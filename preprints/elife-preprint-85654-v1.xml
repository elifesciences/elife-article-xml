<abstract>
<p>Apicomplexan parasites use Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis to secrete essential virulence factors from specialized organelles called micronemes. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are required for microneme exocytosis; however, the molecular events that regulate trafficking and fusion of micronemes with the plasma membrane remain unresolved. Here, we combine sub-minute resolution phosphoproteomics and bio-orthogonal labeling of kinase substrates in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> to identify 163 proteins phosphorylated in a CDPK1-dependent manner. In addition to known regulators of secretion, we identify uncharacterized targets with predicted functions across signaling, gene expression, trafficking, metabolism, and ion homeostasis. One of the CDPK1 targets is a putative HOOK activating adaptor. In other eukaryotes, HOOK homologs form the FHF complex with FTS and FHIP to activate dynein-mediated trafficking of endosomes along microtubules. We show the FHF complex is partially conserved in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, consisting of HOOK, an FTS homolog, and two parasite-specific proteins (TGGT1_306920 and TGGT1_316650). CDPK1 kinase activity and HOOK are required for the rapid apical trafficking of micronemes as parasites initiate motility. Moreover, parasites lacking HOOK or FTS display impaired microneme protein secretion, leading to a block in the invasion of host cells. Taken together, our work provides a comprehensive catalog of CDPK1 targets and reveals how vesicular trafficking has been tuned to support a parasitic lifestyle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis is ubiquitous among eukaryotes. This signaling paradigm regulates an array of processes such as neurotransmitter release in neurons, hormone secretion in endocrine cells, and histamine secretion in mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Pang and Südhof, 2010</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis is also critical for apicomplexan parasites that are the causative agents of rampant, lifethreatening diseases including malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Havelaar et al., 2015</xref>). Central to their pathogenesis is their ability to transition from intracellular replicative stages to extracellular motile stages, which involves a unique form of cellular movement called gliding, egress from the primary host cell, and invasion into a new host. These processes are driven by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis of apicomplexan-specific membrane-bound organelles called micronemes and rhoptries.</p>
<p>The sequential exocytosis of micronemes and rhoptries is required to promote extracellular motile stages of the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Blader et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Carruthers and Sibley, 1997</xref>). Micronemes are localized to the parasite apex and their positioning is dependent on cortical microtubules, ultrastable filaments that polymerize down the length of the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Leung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Exocytosis of microneme cargo enables host cell rupture by releasing perforin-like proteins during egress and translocation of exposed adhesins required for gliding and attachment to new host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Carruthers and Sibley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Carruthers and Tomley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Kafsack et al., 2009</xref>). Multiple microneme proteins, including the associated cysteine repeat modular proteins (CRMP) complex, are also required to trigger the exocytosis of rhoptries upon host cell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Kessler et al., 2008</xref>; Sidik et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Singer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Sparvoli et al., 2022</xref>). Rhoptry proteins include effectors that modulate host responses and transmembrane proteins that are embedded into the host plasma membrane to enable active invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Bradley and Sibley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Lamarque et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Ong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Tyler and Boothroyd, 2011</xref>). Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is necessary and sufficient to trigger the rapid trafficking and exocytosis of micronemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Carruthers et al., 1999a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Endo et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). While Ca<sup>2+</sup> is also necessary for rhoptry discharge, exocytosis relies on additional cellular processes such as microneme exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Coleman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Segev-Zarko et al., 2022</xref>). While the exocytosis of micronemes and rhoptries is known to be critical for parasite motility, the mechanisms linking Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to their trafficking and fusion to the plasma membrane are still unclear. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in apicomplexans are primarily transduced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Billker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Farrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Garrison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Lourido et al., 2012</xref>, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Lourido and Moreno, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Luo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Márquez-Nogueras et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">McCoy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Sebastian et al., 2012</xref>). CDPKs are serine/threonine protein kinases that are unique to apicomplexans and plants. CDPKs are activated by directly binding to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in contrast to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) found in animals, which are indirectly regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound calmodulin (CaM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Ojo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Wernimont et al., 2010</xref>). CDPKs are crucial for apicomplexan infection—yet are absent from mammals—making them attractive drug targets; however, their mechanisms of action are still not well understood at a cellular and molecular level. In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) is required for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis of micronemes, impacting all steps of parasite motility including egress, gliding, and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>)). Small-molecule competitive inhibitors against CDPK1 have been identified and have shown some activity against <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Doggett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Lourido et al., 2013</xref>, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">Winzer et al., 2015</xref>). Identifying the signaling pathways regulated by CDPK1 could reveal the pathways controlling microneme and rhoptry exocytosis.</p>
<p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> that activates CDPK1 and other cellular processes is released from intracellular stores following cyclic nucleotide–mediated activation of protein kinase G (PKG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bisio and Soldati-Favre, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). This process can be artificially induced by treating parasites with cGMP specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors zaprinast or BIPPO that indirectly activate PKG (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref></bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Lourido et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Nofal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Yuasa et al., 2005</xref>). PDE inhibition activates PKG within seconds and triggers the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and lipid signaling nodes controlling parasite motility, including the exocytosis of micronemes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref></bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Lourido et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Yuasa et al., 2005</xref>). The identity of the CDPK1 substrates that contribute to the regulation of microneme exocytosis remains unknown. Determining CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation is challenging because the signaling pathways controlling parasite motility are rapid and integrate signals from multiple kinases.</p>

<p>Global phosphoproteomic studies found that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphorylation included proteins involved in signal transduction, motility, exocytosis, cytoskeleton, in addition to many proteins with unknown functions; however, the functional relevance and organization of these proteins—especially CDPK1—in regulating exocytosis remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Herneisen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Invergo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">McCoy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Nofal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Treeck et al., 2014</xref>, 2011). Here, we utilized time-resolved phosphoproteomics and chemical genetics to identify 163 proteins phosphorylated by CDPK1. Our comprehensive analysis of CDPK1 not only identified phosphoregulation of known factors involved in parasite motility, but also revealed new regulators of exocytosis. We identified a conserved HOOK complex that is phosphorylated by CDPK1 and is required for microneme exocytosis by mediating the rapid trafficking of micronemes during parasite motility.</p>

<title>Identifying CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation with sub-minute resolution</title>
<p>We examined the effect of CDPK1 on the phosphoproteome. To control the expression of CDPK1, we endogenously tagged the kinase with a C-terminal auxininducible degron (AID) for rapid conditional knockdown upon treating parasites with auxin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref></bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Shortt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). CDPK1 was robustly depleted from extracellular parasites following auxin treatment for 3.5 hrs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). We compared vehicle- and auxin-treated parasites at four timepoints in the 5 min following zaprinast stimulation (0, 9, 30, and 300 sec) to capture the earliest changes following Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). We used TMTpro labeling to multiplex 16 samples enabling analysis of a complete time course comparing vehicle- and auxin-treated parasites in biological duplicate in a single LC-MS/MS experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Samples treated with DMSO instead of zaprinast served as a control. We enriched for phosphopeptides using sequential metal-oxide affinity chromatography (SMOAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). In total, we generated four datasets: an enriched zaprinast phosphoproteome [1], a zaprinast proteome (unenriched) [2], an enriched DMSO phos-phoproteome [3], and a DMSO proteome (unenriched) [4]. Of the 4,255 parasite proteins quantified in the zaprinast proteome by LC-MS/MS, CDPK1 was the only protein with a greater than two-fold depletion in parasites treated with auxin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). The remainder of the proteome was largely stable (median log2-fold change = −0.002 ± 0.089 M.A.D).</p>
<p>We first quantified peptide abundances across time relative to the 0 sec vehicle-treated time point to identify CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation, which yielded kinetic profiles of individual phosphopeptides in vehicle and auxin conditions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). The zaprinast phosphoproteome included 2,570 phosphorylated proteins, represented by 10,594 unique phosphopeptides quantified across both biological replicates (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of individual phosphopeptide profiles for vehicle (AUC<sub>vehicle</sub>) and auxin (AU<sub>Cauxin</sub>) conditions. To identify the subset of phosphopeptides exhibiting CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation, we calculated the difference between AUC values (AUC<sub>difference</sub>) by comparing the distribution of AUC<sub>difference</sub> values in the zaprinast phos-phoproteome to a null distribution derived from the DMSO phosphoproteome (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1—figure supplement S1</xref></bold>). This approach allowed us to account for the variability among AUCs under conditions that did not exhibit dynamic changes. We identified 74 unique CDPK1-dependent phosphopeptides across both biological replicates (Group A), belonging to 69 proteins (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-F</xref></bold>). Additionally, we identified peptides that were zaprinast responsive—despite being CDPK1 in-dependent—by comparing the distribution of AUC<sub>vehicle</sub> values in the zaprinast phosphoproteome to a null distribution derived from the DMSO phosphoproteome, resulting in 809 unique phosphopeptides representing 501 proteins. We utilized projection-based clustering to sort kinetic profiles of CDPK1-independent peptides into three groups, in which Group B and Group C contained phosphopeptides that increased in abundance and Group D contained phosphopeptides that decreased in abundance (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1—figure supplement S1</xref>)</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Thrun and Ultsch, 2021</xref>). Significant changes at the peptide level are attributed to altering levels of phosphorylation as opposed to protein levels. Of the 543 proteins exhibiting zaprinast-dependent phosphorylation, 484 were quantified at the proteome level. When comparing the 300 to 0 sec time points, zaprinast-dependent proteins displayed no significant changes (median log<sub>2</sub>-fold change = 0 ± 0.074 M.A.D). This was consistent with the rapid time scale of these experiments and the overall stability of the 4,255 proteins quantified in the proteome (median log2-fold change = 0.01 ± 0.089 M.A.D).</p>
<p>Gene ontology analysis identified several classes of genes that may be relevant to the regulation of za-prinast responses within the different groups (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref></bold>). CDPK1-independent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation was prevalent amongst proteins regulating cyclic nucleotide signaling (ACβ, GC, UGO, PDE1, PDE2, PDE7, PDE9, PDE10, and PKG), lipid signaling (PI4K, PI4P5K, PI-PLC, DGK1, and PAP1), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (CDPK2A and CDPK3). CDPK1-independent phosphorylation was also observed on downstream proteins regulating microneme exocytosis (APH and DOC2.1), rhoptry exocytosis (ARO, AIP, PL3, and NdP2), gliding motility (AKMT and MyoA), and home-ostasis/biogenesis (NHE3, VHA1, NST2, and ERK7). MyoA phosphorylation was observed at S20 and S21, which was previously shown to be phosphorylated by CDPK3 and required for gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gaji et al., 2015</xref>). SCE1 phosphorylation was observed at S225, which was previously shown to be phosphorylated by CDPK3 and required to relieve inhibition during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">McCoy et al., 2017</xref>). Our analysis highlights temporally-resolved changes in the phospho-proteome in response to zaprinast stimulation. We identify a subset of proteins phosphorylated by CDPK1 that likely represent factors involved in motility-related exocytosis, which we discuss in further detail below.</p>

<title>Myristoylation modulates CDPK1 activity and alters its interacting partners</title>
<p>CDPK1 was found to be myristoylated on Gly2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Broncel et al., 2020</xref>). Myristoylation results in lipid modifications on proteins that can impact membrane targeting and protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">Wright et al., 2014</xref>).

We assessed whether myristoylation of CDPK1 affects the kinase’s function. We validated myristoylation of CDPK1 using myristoylation-dependent pull downs followed by immunoblot detection and MS analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2—figure supplement S2</xref>)</bold>. To investigate the role of myristoylation on CDPK1 function, an inducible knock-down strain (iKD) was generated by introducing a mAID-Myc tag at its C terminus (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2—figure supplement S2</xref>)</bold>. Auxin-dependent depletion was confirmed using immunoblot (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2—figure supplement S2</xref>)</bold>.

<p>Given that myristoylation is frequently reported to facilitate membrane association, we examined the localization of cWT and cMut CDPK1 by immunofluorescence (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). No clear differences were detected between the punctate cytosolic patterns of cWT and cMut. We explored possible effects of myristoylation on the subcellular fractionation of CDPK1 resolved using differential centrifugation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref></bold>). First, we evaluated the fractionation pattern of the endogenous, myristoylated CDPK1. YFP-expressing parasites were metabolically labeled with Myr or YnMyr and lysed in a hypotonic buffer to preserve intact membrane structures. Next, lysates were fractionated to generate a low-speed pellet and supernatant at 16,000 x <italic>g</italic>. The low-speed supernatant was fractionated further into a high-speed pellet and supernatant at 100,000 x <italic>g</italic>. Click reaction based pull down and immunoblotting were used to resolve myristoylation-dependent partitioning. In contrast to the doubly acylated GAP45, which was present exclusively in the low-speed pellet, myristoylated CDPK1 was observed in the low-speed pellet and supernatant, and the high-speed pellet (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref></bold>), suggesting a potential association with membranous structures or higher molecular weight complexes. We next used both the cWT and cMut lines to elucidate any myristoylationdependent changes to CDPK1 localization. While cWT could be found predominantly in the high-speed pellet, loss of myristoylation released cMut into the highspeed supernatant confirming an association with membranous structures or large protein complexes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the role of CDPK1 myristoylation in parasite fitness, we performed plaque assays comparing the various strains (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref></bold>). In the presence of the endogenous copy of CDPK1, both complemented lines developed normally. However, upon auxin-mediated depletion of endogenous CDPK1, cMut plaque size substantially decreased. This finding demonstrates that one or more steps of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> lytic cycle are negatively affected by the loss of CDPK1 myristoylation. In light of CDPK1’s known function, we next explored whether CDPK1 myristoylation might impact the parasite’s ability to egress from host cells. In the absence of auxin, cWT, cMut, and the parental line (iKD) egressed within two min of ionophore stimulation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2—figure supplement S2</xref>)</bold>. While cWT parasites maintained similar egress kinetics following auxin treatment, cMut parasites showed a significant delay after two min of treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref></bold>). This egress delay was overcome by six min, suggesting that CDPK1 myristoylation is important for ionophore-induced egress, but not essential.</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to examine whether myristoylation of CDPK1 affects its interactions with other proteins, which may occur by direct binding to the kinase or by indirect association with a shared membrane structure. We performed immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) on HA-tagged CDPK1 from cWT, cMut, and untagged TIR1 parasites after hypotonic lysis. CDPK1 was the most significantly enriched protein across both cWT and cMut pulldowns when compared to untagged controls (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref></bold>). Two additional proteins were significantly enriched along with CDPK1: NUP134 (TGGT1_-240510) and SRS36D (TGGT1_292280). Comparing the cWT and cMut pulldowns, we found two proteins preferentially associated with cWT: NUDIX hydroxylase (TGGT1_227450) and a 14-3-3 protein (TGGT1_-269960) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref></bold>). Loss of myristoylation appears to enhance interactions with three different proteins: ROM4 (TGGT1_268590), a putative T complex protein 1 alpha subunit (TGGT1_229990), and IMP dehydrogenase (TGGT1_233110). Genome-wide knockout screen data suggest that NUP134 and the putative T complex protein 1 are the only putative interacting partners required for parasite fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). NUP134 binds and co-localizes with the nuclear pore complex, whereas the putative T complex protein 1 may function as an ATP-dependent chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Courjol et al., 2017</xref>). CDPK1 is localized primarily to the cytoplasm of the parasite and partially in the nucleus, which could explain its interactions with NUP134 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Ojo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>). ROM4 is an integral membrane protease required to shed secreted microneme proteins through proteolysis, and its knockdown impaired gliding motility and invasion of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Buguliskis et al., 2010</xref>). ROM4 localizes to the plasma membrane of parasites but was enriched with cytosolic CDPK1 and was not observed in our sub-minute resolution phosphoproteomics. Our pulldowns did not reveal a membrane compartment association for myristoylated CDPK1 but did identify interacting proteins enriched in cytosolic and myristoylated CDPK1. Given the annotated functions of these interacting proteins, the factors are unlikely to participate in the motility-related functions of CDPK1. Additional studies will be required to understand how myristoylation influences CDPK1 activity.</p>

<title>Identification of direct CDPK1 targets through thiophosphorylation</title>
<p>Our phosphoproteomic time course experiment identified proteins exhibiting CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation in live parasites, which includes direct and indirect substrates of the kinase. CDPK1 is unusual among apicomplexan and metazoan kinases in that it contains a glycine at its gatekeeper residue, resulting in an expanded ATP-binding pocket that can ac-commodate bulky ATP analogues. CDPK1 can use bulky analogues like N6-furfuryladenosine (kinetin)-5-O-[3-thiotriphosphate] (KTPγS) to thiophosphorylate its substrates in parasite lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Lourido et al., 2013</xref>). Thiophosphorylated substrates can subsequently be enriched with an iodoacetyl resin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Blethrow et al., 2008</xref>). Specificity can be assessed by comparison to mutant parasites harboring a G128M gatekeeper mutation in CDPK1 (CDPK1<sup>M</sup>) that retains kinase activity but prevents it from using KTPγS. Previous studies using lysates identified a small set of six putative CDPK1-dependent substrates; however, these studies lost the target specificity conferred by the subcellular context and lacked the accuracy and sensitivity of quantitative proteomic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Lourido et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We implemented several modifications to the thiophosphorylation procedure that improved identification of CDPK1 targets (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref></bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Rothenberg et al., 2016</xref>). First, we used stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to directly compare thiophosphorylation in WT (CDPK1<sup>G</sup>) and mutant (CDPK1<sup>M</sup>) parasites. Second, we used parasites semi-permeabilized with the bacterial toxin aerolysin—as opposed to the preparations of detergent-lysed parasites used in prior methods. Aerolysin forms 3-nm pores in the plasma membrane which permit the diffusion of small molecules but not proteins, enabling us to perform labeling reactions without drastically disrupting the concentration or localization of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Iacovache et al., 2006</xref>). Lastly, we prevented non-specific extracellular substrate labeling due to premature lysis by treating semi-permeabilized parasites with 1B7, a nanobody that allosterically inhibits CDPK1 but does not enter the cytosol of semi-permeabilized parasites (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref></bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ingram et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

WT (CDPK1<sup>G</sup>) and mutant (G128M; CDPK1<sup>M</sup>) parasites were grown in SILAC media for multiplexed quantitation.

CDPK1 substrate labeling was initiated by treating semi-permeabilized parasites with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, KTPγS, ATP, and 1B7. While CDPK1 in both WT and mutant parasites can utilize ATP to phosphorylate substrates, only WT parasites can use KTPγS to thiophosphorylate substrates.

<p>Thiophosphorylation experiments were performed in biological triplicate comparing CDPK1<sup>G</sup> and CDPK1<sup>M</sup> parasites. We assessed thiophosphorylation labeling by immunoblot, identifying an array of proteins specifically labeled in CDPK1<sup>G</sup>, but not CDPK1<sup>M</sup> parasites (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). MS analyses quantified the abundance of peptides in CDPK1<sup>G</sup> relative to CDPK1<sup>M</sup> parasites, identifying 734 unique peptides across three biological replicates (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). Samples from CDPK1<sup>G</sup> parasites were significantly enriched in phosphorylated peptides, consistent with CDPK1-mediated thiophosphorylation of targets (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). 123 peptides across 104 proteins were likely direct substrates of CDPK1. GO enrichment analysis did not reveal any pathways relevant to the function of CDPK1 in exocytosis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref></bold>). While our approach largely maintains kinases in their subcellular context, aerolysin treatment disrupts native ion concentrations and detaches the plasma membrane from the inner membrane complex (IMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Wichroski et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore proceeded to consider the thiophosphorylated substrates in the context of the time-resolved phosphoproteomics.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>CDPK1 targets participate in pathways controlling parasite motility</title>
<p>Considering the thiophosphorylation and time-resolved phosphoproteomics, we arrived at a prioritization scheme to identify 163 proteins phosphorylated in a CDPK1-dependent manner (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref></bold>). Proteins were divided into five classes based on the overlap of phosphorylated sites between both approaches. Class 1 contains five proteins for which the same phosphorylated site was identified in both the time course and thiophosphorylation experiments. Class 2 contains four proteins for which phosphorylated sites identified across both approaches were within 50 amino acid residues of one another. Class 3 contains two proteins that were enriched by thiophosphorylation and were also CDPK1-dependent in the time course, but the identified sites were more than 50 residues apart. Class 4 contains 93 proteins that were exclusively enriched by thiophosphorylation. Lastly, Class 5 contains 59 proteins that were CDPK1-dependent exclusively in the time course and are likely indirect targets of the kinase. Proteins within each class were further stratified by fitness scores reported from genome-wide knockout screens, with lower scores representing genes more essential for parasite fitness in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). Of the 163 targets of CDPK1, 72 proteins across all classes also displayed changes in zaprinast-dependent phosphorylation at distinct sites that were independent of CDPK1. This overlap suggests that some proteins modified by CDPK1 are also regulated by additional kinases and phosphatases.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that regulators of exocytosis would be found among the targets of CDPK1. Of the 163 protein targets, 38 have been previously localized and/or functionally characterized (indicated with asterisks; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref></bold>). Of these 38 proteins, 13 have been implicated in regulating motile stages of the parasite (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 3—figure supplement S3</xref>)</bold>. Among the candidates associated with microneme exocytosis, centrin 2 (CEN2) and RNG2 have previously been localized to tubulin-based structures in the apical complex of the parasite, and their knockdown is sufficient to inhibit secretion of microneme proteins and block host cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Katris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Lentini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Leung et al., 2019</xref>). Candidates associated with rhoptry exocytosis include the armadillo repeats only protein (ARO), ARO-interacting protein (AIP), palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC7, and patatin-like phospholipase (PL3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Wilson et al., 2020</xref>). ARO and DHHC7 both localize to the cytosolic face of rhoptries, where they influence the recruitment of AIP and AC. Knockdown of either DHHC7 or ARO disrupts the localization of mature rhoptries, in-hibiting the secretion of rhoptry proteins required for invasion. Another potential CDPK1 target, the apical complex lysine methyltransferase (AKMT), rapidly relocalizes from the apical complex to the parasite body during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated motility, and its knockdown impairs the gliding motility of parasites required for invasion and egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Heaslip et al., 2011</xref>). Other putative CDPK1 targets participate in homeostasis and biogenesis of secretory organelles, such as the vacuolar type Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3), dynamin-related protein B (DrpB), V-ATPase a1 (VHA1), and GDP-fucose transporter (NST2). NHE3-knockout parasites exhibit sensitivity to osmotic shock and dysregulated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, resulting in reduced secretion of microneme proteins and an inhibition of invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Francia et al., 2011</xref>). DrpB was previously identified as a CDPK1 target, and its depletion results in severe defects in the biogenesis of micronemes and rhoptries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Breinich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Lourido et al., 2013</xref>). VHA1 and NST2 participate in the maturation of microneme and rhoptry proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bandini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Stasic et al., 2019</xref>). Lastly, signaling proteins regulating intracellular cGMP levels, such as the guanylate cyclase (GC) and the unique GC organizer (UGO), were also phosphorylated in a CDPK1-dependent manner(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bisio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Brown and Sibley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). CDPK1 acts downstream of GC-mediated production of cGMP, which may suggest regulatory feedback on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, as has been suggested for CDPK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Nofal et al., 2022</xref>). These data demonstrate that identification of CDPK1 targets can uncover proteins involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis.</p>
<p>To identify new factors involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated secretion, we prioritized Class 1 and Class 2 candidates. Seven candidates in this category lack functional annotation or have been associated with apical structures: TGGT1_227610, TGGT1_221470, TGGT1_-235160, TGGT1_254870, KinesinB (TGGT1_273560), a small nuclease (TGGT1_310060), and TGGT1_-289100 (MIC18). TGGT1_221470 was previously identified as a CDPK1 substrate after a pull down from parasite lysates but remained functionally uncharacterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Lourido et al., 2013</xref>). KinesinB localizes to cortical microtubules, TGGT1_254870 localizes to the apical complex, and TGGT1_289100 co-localizes with micronemes, each of which are parasite structures relevant to exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Butler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Leung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Long et al., 2017</xref>). Of these candidates, only TGGT1_227610 and TGGT1_289100 appear to be required for parasite fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Long et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). Despite prior annotation as a microneme protein, TGGT1_289100 lacks a signal peptide and is localized to the cytosol by spatial proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Butler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barylyuk et al., 2020</xref>). Instead, TGGT1_-289100 is predicted to have an N-terminal Hook domain and extensive coiled-coil domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Simm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Söding et al., 2005</xref>) with homology to activating adaptors that bind to endosomes and activate super-processive dynein-mediated trafficking towards the minus end of microtubules (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref></bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bielska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).

We observed extensive CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation between the Hook and coiled-coil domains of TGGT1_289100 (S167, S177, and S189—191), consistent with potential regulation of the putative adaptor. These data motivated functional characterization of this factor—henceforth referred to as HOOK.</p>

<title>A Hook domain protein phosphorylated by CDPK1 regulates parasite invasion</title>
<p>To study the role of HOOK during the acute stages of the parasite, we generated a conditional knockdown by fusing an HA-mAID tag to its N terminus (AID-HOOK; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 4—Figure supplement S4</xref>)</bold>. HOOK was depleted from parasites following 24—40 hrs of auxin treatment, as determined by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence microscopy (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-C</xref></bold>). In contrast to previous observations that localized HOOK to micronemes, we observed only partial co-localization with micronemes with a majority of HOOK localized to the cytosol (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). Plaque formation was impaired when AID-HOOK parasites were grown in the presence of auxin, consistent with the strong effect on parasite fitness reported from genome-wide knockout screens (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref></bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). These results indicate that HOOK is required during the acute stages of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Parasite replication was not affected following 24 hrs of auxin treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). Microneme and rhoptry biogenesis were also unaffected following 24 hrs of auxin treatment immunofluorescence analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 4—figure supplement S4</xref>)</bold>. These data suggest HOOK functions during stages associated with parasite motility, such as parasite invasion and egress. Parasites depleted of HOOK displayed reduced invasion efficiency, consistent with that of CDPK1-depleted parasites (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref></bold>). We noted that even in the absence of auxin treatment AID-HOOK parasites required longer incubations to reach comparable levels of invasion to wildtype, suggesting that manipulation of the N terminus partially affects HOOK function.</p>
<p>HOOK depletion only partially recapitulates the effects of CDPK1 loss. Parasites depleted of CDPK1 were unable to egress—as documented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">2012</xref>)—whereas depletion of HOOK had no effect on parasite egress (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref></bold>). Finally, we also examined whether the stability of CDPK1 affected HOOK expression by tagging the C terminus of HOOK with a 3xHA tag in CDPK1 cKD parasites (HOOK-3xHA). HOOK localization and abundance was unaffected by depleting parasites of CDPK1 for 24 hrs as determined by immunofluorescence (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref></bold>). Taken together, our results indicate that HOOK is required for invasion of host cells, but dispensable for egress.</p>

<title>HOOK forms a complex that regulates parasite invasion</title>
<p>Opisthokont HOOK proteins function in complexes to activate dynein-mediated trafficking of vesicular cargo along microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bielska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Christensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Gillingham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and mammals, HOOK proteins have been shown to form dimers and bind FTS and FHIP via a C-terminal region that interacts with vesicular cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Krämer and Phistry, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Christensen et al., 2021</xref>). To identify analogous binding partners of HOOK in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, we performed IP-MS on lysates from HOOK-3xHA parasites and an untagged control (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). Three proteins showed comparable enrichment to HOOK-3xHA: TGGT1_264050, TGGT1_316650, and TGGT1_306920. Like FTS, TGGT1_264050 bears homology to E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, but lacks the catalytic cysteine required for enzymatic activity at position 162. Because of these shared features and their homology, we designated TGGT1_264050 as FTS. To confirm that FTS forms a complex with HOOK, we investigated its localization and performed reciprocal IPs. We fused a 3xHA tag to the C terminus of FTS and observed a similar localization to HOOK by immunofluorescence: primarily cytosolic with partial overlap with micronemes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). To identify binding partners of FTS, we performed IP-MS on FTS-3xHA parasite lysates and compared protein enrichment to the HOOK-3xHA IP (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). Four proteins were significantly enriched in the reciprocal IP experiments—HOOK, FTS, TGGT1_316650, and TGGT1_306920—confirming the four-member complex.</p>

<p>To determine whether FTS functions in the same pathway as HOOK, we generated a conditional knockdown by fusing an AID-HA tag to the C terminus of FTS (FTS-AID; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5—Figure supplement S5</xref>)</bold>. FTS was readily depleted from parasites following 40 hrs of auxin treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). FTS depletion completely blocked plaque formation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref></bold>). Similar to HOOK, depletion of FTS had no observable effect on parasite replication or microneme biogenesis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5—figure supplement S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref></bold>). During the motile stages of the parasite, FTS depletion resulted in a block in invasion efficiency but had no effect on egress, phenocopying the effects of HOOK depletion (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref></bold>). FTS appeared to tolerate tagging better than HOOK, since the FTS-AID parasites behaved normally in the absence of auxin. These data suggest that HOOK and FTS form a functional complex required for parasite invasion.</p>
<p>We pursued enzyme-catalyzed proximity labeling to complement IP-MS studies and capture transient protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). In this approach, cells express a protein of interest tagged with the promiscuous biotin ligase TurboID. Addition of a biotin substrate to live cells results in biotinylation within a few nanometers of the TurboID-tagged protein, in a matter of minutes. Biotinylated proteins can be enriched from cellular lysates using streptavidin-affinity purification and identified using MS. Proximity labeling was recently used to characterize the cargo diversity of distinct human FHF complexes in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Christensen et al., 2021</xref>). To identify additional proteins that interact with the <italic>T. gondii</italic> HOOK complex, we performed proximity labeling after fusing TurboID to the C terminus of FTS, which was more amenable to tagging compared to HOOK (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5—figure supplement S5</xref>)</bold>. As a control, we used parasites expressing a cytosolic mNeonGreen-TurboID that would broadly label cytosolic proteins and identify non-specific interactions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5—figure supplement S5</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>Of the 14 proteins significantly enriched in FTS-TurboID parasites, members of the HOOK complex (HOOK, FTS, TGGT1_306920, and TGGT1_316650) were the top four most enriched proteins. In humans, proximity labeling studies suggest FTS and FHIP bind at the C terminus of the HOOK dimer to mediate FHIP binding to RAB5 endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Christensen et al., 2021</xref>). Our FTS proximity labeling results suggest that TGGT1_-306920 and TGGT1_316650 may also bind in this manner. Among the other significantly-enriched proteins, PC and ACC1 encode carboxylases known to be covalently modified by biotin and likely represent nonspecific enrichment. DHFR enrichment is likely due to its use as a selectable marker when generating the FTS-TurboID strain. TGGT1_294610 and TGGT1_-280770 are a putative histone lysine methyltransferase and regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1)-repeat containing protein, respectively, and have no characterized functions. Of the remaining enriched proteins that lack annotations, TGGT1_221180 was previously localized to micronemes by spatial proteomics and contains a transmembrane domain, suggesting a molecular link between the HOOK complex and micronemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barylyuk et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>The HOOK complex promotes invasion by regulating microneme exocytosis</title>
<p>To determine whether the HOOK complex is required for microneme exocytosis, we directly measured secretion of the microneme protein MIC2. Microneme exocytosis exposes integral membrane proteins like MIC2 that function as adhesins during gliding motility. These adhesins subsequently undergo proteolytic cleavage and are released into the supernatant, which can be analyzed by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Carruthers et al., 2000</xref>). Quantification of the proportion of secreted MIC2 was per-formed by generating a standard curve from unstimulated lysates. Strikingly, parasites depleted of either member of the HOOK complex were severely impaired in their ability to secrete microneme proteins (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5—figure supplement S5</xref>)</bold>. Inhibition of the complex led to a similar degree of secretion impairment as CDPK1 depletion. Together, these data suggest that HOOK and FTS form a functional complex that is required for microneme exocytosis.</p>

<title>Microneme trafficking depends on CDPK1 activity and HOOK</title>
<p>We hypothesized that if the HOOK complex is required for sustained microneme exocytosis, then depletion of HOOK would inhibit trafficking of micronemes during parasite motility. Dynamic relocalization of micronemes can be visualized using live microscopy of parasites expressing the integral microneme protein CLAMP fused to mNeonGreen (CLAMP-mNG) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref></bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). To trigger microneme exocytosis, parasites are treated with zaprinast to stimulate a rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and activate CDPK1. Dynamic relocalization of micronemes is defined as the CLAMP-mNG signal that concentrates at the apical end of the parasite over time. To quantify microneme relocalization, mNG signal is measured, over time, along the apical-basal axis of individual parasites within a vacuole. We scored microneme relocalization by calculating the difference in maximum apical intensity comparing the instant of zaprinast addition to the time point just prior to parasite egress of the uninhibited zaprinast-stimulated controls (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We first assessed whether CDPK1 kinase activity is required for microneme relocalization using the specific inhibitor 3-MB-PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>). We incubated parasites with 3-MB-PP1 for 30 min, imaged for 1 min to establish a baseline, and then stimulated with zaprinast. Parasites pre-treated with DMSO relocalized micronemes as expected; however, microneme relocalization was blocked when CDPK1 was inhibited by 3-MB-PP1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B—D</xref></bold>). These results indicate microneme relocalization depends on CDPK1 kinase activity.</p>
<p>We next assessed whether HOOK is also required for microneme relocalization. We fused an mNG reporter to the C terminus of CLAMP in AID-HOOK parasites and TIR1 parasites as a control (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 6—Figure supplement S6</xref>)</bold>. We treated parasites with auxin for 24 hrs prior to stimulation with zaprinast. Microneme relocalization was unaffected in TIR1/CLAMP-mNG parasites treated with auxin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref></bold>). By contrast, microneme relocalization did not occur in intracellular AID-HOOK parasites regardless of auxin treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–H</xref></bold>). We attributed the lack of relocalization in vehicle-treated parasites to the hypomorphism resulting from N-terminal tagging, which is consistent with the delayed invasion and reduced plaque size documented for this strain. To determine whether vehicle-treated AID-HOOK parasites relocalized micronemes over longer periods, we examined CLAMP-mNG localization in extracellular parasites after egress. While vehicle-treated AID-HOOK parasites were able to relocalize micronemes, parasites depleted of HOOK exhibited a striking microneme localization dispersed throughout the cytosol (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–J</xref></bold>). As expected, TIR1/CLAMP-mNG parasites maintained the apical relocalization of micronemes regardless of auxin treatment in extracellular parasites. We used an alternative metric for microneme relocalization to account for the disorganized localization of micronemes in parasites depleted of HOOK. We quantified the percent of the total CLAMP-mNG signal localized to the apical end versus the remaining body of the parasite (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref></bold>). The apical region cutoffs were experimentally derived from vehicle-treated TIR1/CLAMP-mNG parasites and defined as the apical 12.5% of the parasite. While a majority of CLAMP-mNG signal was localized to the apical region of TIR1/CLAMP-mNG parasites, most of the CLAMP-mNG signal observed in parasites depleted of HOOK was found in the parasite body. Micronemes rapidly adopt an aberrant localization in the absence of HOOK during parasite motility. These results indicate that CDPK1 kinase activity and HOOK are required for microneme trafficking during parasite motility.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we sought to identify new regulators of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated exocytosis in <italic>T. gondii</italic> by studying the targets of a key regulator, the kinase CDPK1. We identified 163 proteins phosphorylated in a CDPK1-dependent manner using sub-minute resolution phosphoproteomics and thiophosphorylation for direct substrate capture. We determined that myristoylation of CDPK1 contributes to the kinase’s function during the lytic cycle. 13 of the identified CDPK1 targets have previously described functions in parasite motility, revealing possible points of regulation within relevant signaling pathways. Furthermore, we characterized a new regulator of microneme exocytosis called HOOK, which forms a stable complex with FTS and two other proteins. Homologs of HOOK and FTS participate in dynein-mediated vesicular trafficking in other organisms. In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, knockdown of HOOK or FTS blocked invasion of host cells and altered rapid microneme trafficking during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated motility. Overall, we show how studying parasite signaling pathways can illuminate the cellular adaptations that support parasitism.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, several efforts have sought to characterize phosphorylation within apicomplexans. Improvements in phosphopeptide enrichment and mass spectrometry have enabled global characterization of the phosphoproteomes from <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> schizonts, trophozoites, and ring-stages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Treeck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Solyakov et al., 2011</xref>; La-sonder et al., 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Pease et al., 2013</xref>). Coupling such approaches with genetic and pharmacological tools has enabled the deconvolution of kinase-specific effects from the vast global phosphorylation program(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Blomqvist et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Fang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Invergo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Nofal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Pease et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Treeck et al., 2014</xref>), revealing the activation of MyoA-mediated gliding by TgCDPK3, the roles of PbCDPK4 and PbSRPK1 during male gametogenesis, and the erythrocytic-stage effects of PfCDPK1, <italic>Pf</italic>PK7, and PfCDPK5(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Blomqvist et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Fang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gaji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Invergo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Pease et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Tang et al., 2014</xref>). Attributing individual phosphorylation events to specific kinases can be complicated by cumulative changes or adaptation of the signaling networks in knockouts. Chemicalgenetic approaches can more precisely inhibit the activity of a given kinase at the time of the assay, while controlling for off-target effects, and have been used to characterize <italic>Pf</italic>PKG-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Brochet et al., 2014</xref>). Kinetically-resolved phosphoproteomics has enabled a more nuanced understanding of signaling cascades during parasite motility(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Invergo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Herneisen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Nofal et al., 2022</xref>). While such technical advances have led to more in-depth phosphoproteome mapping, identifying the direct targets of a given kinase remains a key challenge to structuring the observed changes into signaling pathways.</p>
<p>To resolve direct and indirect effects on the phospho-proteome for <italic>T. gondii</italic> CDPK1, we combined two com-plementary approaches: temporally-resolved phosphoproteomics and bio-orthogonal labeling of direct substrates. We implemented several methodological advances. Rapid conditional knockdown using the auxininducible degron system resulted in rapid and specific depletion of the kinase of interest for the phos-phoproteomic studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Brown et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, quantification and coverage by mass spectrometry were improved through TMTpro multiplexing and ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS)(Van Vranken et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2020</xref>). We also improved on the low coverage observed in previous thiophosphorylation experiments with parasite lysates(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Lourido et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Fang et al., 2017</xref>) by maintaining a more native signaling environment using aerolysin semi-permeabilization, SILAC-based peptide quantification, and shortened labeling times(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Rothenberg et al., 2016</xref>). These approaches characterize proteome-wide phosphorylation kinetics in live parasites and reveal direct kinase-substrate relationships for CDPK1.</p>
<p>Myristoylation of CDPK1 contributes to its function. Contrary to previous reports describing the kinase as cytosolic or nuclear(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Ojo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Pomel et al., 2008</xref>), we demonstrate that myristoylated CDPK1 is at least partially associated with structures that can be fractionated from the cytoplasm by differential centrifugation. Loss of myristoylation led to CDPK1 release from the insoluble fraction. The ortholog of CDPK1 in <italic>P. berghei</italic>, PbCDPK4, also displays myristoylation-specific functions during male gametogenesis: myris-toylated PbCDPK4 is critical for the first genome replication, whereas the non-myristoylated <italic>Pb</italic>CDPK4 is important for the completion of gametogenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Fang et al., 2017</xref>). Myristoylation could impact CDPK1’s ability to access certain targets efficiently. However, such interactions appear to be too weak or transient to be captured by immunoprecipitation. Mutating the myristoylation site of CDPK1 only modestly affected ionophore-induced egress. However, minor effects in these key transitions may be magnified over repeated lytic cycles, which may explain the more substantial impact of losing CDPK1 myristoylation on plaque formation. Alternatively, other kinases may compensate for decreased CDPK1 activity, particularly under hyperactivated conditions like stimulated egress. A plausible candidate for compensation is CDPK2A, which also appears to be myristoylated, despite lacking an N-terminal MG motif, and was recently shown to display epistatic interactions with CDPK1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Broncel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Shortt et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>CDPK1 plays a critical role in the transition from the replicative intracellular stages to motile extracellular stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Shortt et al., 2022</xref>). During this transition parasites must execute rapid cellular changes that involve the exocytosis of micronemes and rhoptries, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, gliding motility, and maintenance of ion homeostasis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Blader et al., 2015</xref>). CDPK1 has also been suggested to control the actomyosin system and extrusion of the conoid(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>). Our detailed target analysis suggests CDPK1 regulates—and possibly helps coordinate—multiple pathways. We revealed over a hundred CDPK1 targets with diverse predicted functions, including many relevant to phenotypes dependent on CDPK1. In addition to the effects on microneme trafficking examined in this study, our results point to a direct link between CDPK1 and rhoptry exocytosis. Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been implicated in rhoptry discharge, as the rhoptry-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding FER2 is required for rhoptry exocytosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Coleman et al., 2018</xref>). We observed a preponderance of CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation on proteins regulating rhoptry exocytosis, including DHHC7, ARO, and AIP. Phosphorylation on ARO was observed near the N-terminal acylation sites required for rhoptry targeting and may regulate the bundling and positioning of mature rhoptries during motile stages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Mueller et al., 2016</xref>). However, formally demonstrating the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CDPK1 and rhoptry discharge is complicated by the dependency of the latter on the secretion of certain microneme proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Carruthers and Sibley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ben Chaabene et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites have several rhoptries, yet only two are docked for exocytosis at a given time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aquilini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Mageswaran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Segev-Zarko et al., 2022</xref>). Regulating the activity of ARO during motile stages may influence the ability to mobilize and re-dock rhoptries in preparation for invasion. Considering how different CDPK1 substrates function, we expect the various phenotypes associated with CDPK1 will depend on distinct sets of substrates.</p>
<p>Although CDPK1 is known to mediate microneme exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>), the precise molecular events controlling this process have remained elusive. In this study, we determined that CDPK1 activity is required for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated trafficking of micronemes to the apical end. This phenotype depends on HOOK, one of the CDPK1 targets uncovered by both global phosphoproteomics and thiophosphorylation studies. Despite prior annotation as a microneme protein(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Butler et al., 2014</xref>), HOOK likely functions as an activating adaptor in <italic>T. gondii</italic> based on homology to other Hook proteins and the functional characterization we have performed. In particular, immunoprecipitation of HOOK identified three interacting proteins: FTS, TGGT1_316650, and TGGT1_306920. In <italic>H. sapiens, A. nidulans</italic>, and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, Hook proteins complex with FTS and FHIP (the FHF complex), to link cargo to the dynein machinery for trafficking along microtubules(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bielska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Gillingham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). FHF complexes have been shown to recognize early endosomes via FHIP binding to RAB5(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bielska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Homology to FHIP was lacking in TGGT1_316650 and TGGT1_-306920. However, genome-wide knockout screens indicate TGGT1_306920 is critical for parasite fitness, leading us to speculate that it may mediate cargo binding in a manner structurally distinct from known adaptors. Additional work will be needed to elucidate the function of the HOOK complex and to understand how it mediates trafficking of apicomplexan-specific organelles.</p>
<p>Our results place the HOOK complex downstream of CDPK1, regulating the stimulated relocalization of micronemes to the apical end of parasites. However, the HOOK complex only partially explains CDPK1’s role during egress. Whereas CDPK1 depletion blocks egress entirely, parasites depleted of HOOK or FTS exit host cells, despite subsequent defects in microneme secretion and invasion. Microneme discharge is required for egress, supplying adhesins for gliding motility and the perforin PLP1 to rupture the parasitophorous vacuole membrane(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Kafsack et al., 2009</xref>). It therefore appears that the initial round of microneme discharge during egress depends on CDPK1, and only subsequent rounds require the HOOK complex. Indeed, a fraction of micronemes are already found docked at the apical complex prior to the transition from the replicative to the motile stages, and may constitute the first round of microneme exocytosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Mageswaran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). Dynein-mediated trafficking might become important immediately following egress when continuous microneme discharge is necessary, as is the case during gliding motility and invasion. Consistent with this hypothesis, depletion of the dynein light chain 8a (DLC8a) yielded similar phenotypes to HOOK and FTS knockdown: intact egress but dysfunctional microneme protein secretion, gliding motility, and invasion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Lentini et al., 2019</xref>). Loss of DLC8a also led to defects in rhoptry positioning, which were not observed in HOOK knockdowns(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Lentini et al., 2019</xref>), so other activating adaptors may be involved in rhoptry trafficking. Our results suggest that the HOOK complex has been specifically adapted for microneme trafficking in <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p>
<p>Several aspects of microneme trafficking remain to be determined. The precise nature of the dynein complex is poorly understood. Eukaryotes typically express a single cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain. In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, TGGT1_294550 is the top candidate for the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (DHC) as it contains the necessary domains, is conserved among apicomplexans, and is required for parasite fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Lentini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). Other putative DHCs in the <italic>T. gondii</italic> genome are likely axonemal dyneins required for flagellar function in sexual-stage parasites. It also remains unknown how the HOOK complex binds to micronemes. In <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, RAB5 on vesicles interacts with FHIP in the HOOK complex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bielska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Gillingham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that TGGT1_-306920 may serve the role of FHIP within the HOOK complex but its binding partner on micronemes remains unknown. RAB5A and RAB5C have been implicated in the biogenesis of micronemes, but their roles during exocytosis have not been explored(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Kremer et al., 2013</xref>). Understanding how micronemes are recognized may elucidate how cargo specificity is achieved and regulated.</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been tuned to support apicomplexan-specific cellular processes but identifying and integrating effectors within the pathway has remained a major bottleneck. Signaling effectors conserved amongst eukaryotes are often integrated into apicomplexan cellular pathways in novel or unusual ways. Here, we identified candidate downstream effectors of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated kinase CDPK1 by monitoring proteome-wide protein phosphorylation. In addition to creating a catalog of candidates for future characterization, we identified, characterized, and integrated the HOOK complex downstream of CDPK1 within the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling network controlling microneme exocytosis. Lastly, our results are the first to implicate activating adaptors as critical factors for the pathogenesis of an apicomplexan organism by promoting exocytic trafficking.</p>

Abundances were normalized on the total protein amount. Protein level and peptide level ratios were generated for each time point relative to 0 sec vehicle-treated parasites stimulated with DMSO.</p>
<p>Exported peptide and protein abundance files from Proteome Discoverer 2.4 were loaded into R (version 4.1.1). To determine CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation, log2 ratios for peptide abundances in DMSO and zaprinast-treated samples derived from Proteome Discoverer were used. Only phosphorylated peptides quantified across all time points were used for analysis. Area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated for individual peptides undergoing vehicle (AUC<sub>vehicle</sub>) and auxin (AUC<sub>auxin</sub>) treatment using trapezoidal integration. AUC differences (AUC<sub>difference</sub>) were calculated by taking the difference between AUC<sub>vehicle</sub> and AUC<sub>auxin</sub> values. The distribution of zaprinast AUC<sub>difference</sub> values were tested against a null distribution derived from the DMSO AUC<sub>difference</sub> values to calculate z-scores and p-values using a two-tailed t-test. Replicates 1 and 2 were analyzed independently and phosphopeptides with p-values &lt; 0.05 across both replicates were determined to be CDPK1-dependent (Group A). Peptides exhibiting phosphorylation independent of CDPK1 (Group B, C, and D) were determined similarly, but compared the distribution of zaprinast AUC<sub>vehicle</sub> values to a null distribution of DMSO AUC<sub>vehicle</sub> values and excluded phosphopeptides already determined to be CDPK1-dependent. CDPK1-independent phosphopeptides were clustered into Groups B, C, and D using projection-based clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Thrun and Ultsch, 2021</xref>).</p>

Peptides were loaded onto a analytical column (column: PF360-75-15-N-5, New Objective, 360 μm OD, 75 μm ID, 15 μm Tip PicoFrit Emitter; resin: 04A-4506, Phenomenex Aeris Peptide, C18 1.7 μm) via trapping column (column: 360 um OD, 100 um ID; resin: AA12S11, YMC Gel ODS-A, C18 10 μm). Peptides were separated at 300 nL/min on a gradient of 2% B for 5 min, 2—25% B for 100 min, 25—40% B for 20 min, 40—100% B for 1 min, and 100% B for 12 min. The orbitrap was operated in positive ion mode with a positive ion voltage of 2700V with an ion transfer tube temperature of 300°C. Full scan spectra were acquired in profile mode at a resolution of 60,000, with a scan range of 375 to 1600 m/z, 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> AGC target, maximum injection time of 50 msec, intensity threshold of 4 x 10<sup>5</sup>, dynamic exclusion of 13 sec, and 20 data dependent scans (DDA Top 20). MS2 spectra were generated with a HCD collision energy of 27 at a resolution of 15,000, first mass at 100 m/z, isolation window of 1.5 m/z, an AGC target of 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> with a maximum injection time of 20 msec, and scan range of 200 to 2000 m/z.</p>

<p>Raw files were analyzed in Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate peak lists and protein and peptides identifications using Sequest HT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the ToxoDB release 34 GT1 protein database. The maximum missed cleavage sites for trypsin was limited to 2. The following modifications were included in the search: dynamic oxidation (+15.995 Da; M), dynamic phosphorylation (+79.966 Da; S,T,Y), dynamic 13C615N4 (+10.008 Da; R), dynamic 13C615N2 (+8.014 Da; K), and dynamic acetylation (+42.011 Da; N-terminus). Site localization scores were generated using ptmRS, with phosphoRS and use of diagnostic ions set to true. SILAC 2plex (Arg10, Lys8) method was used for relative quantification of protein and unique peptide abundances. For peptide level analysis, ratios of unique peptides comparing CDPK1<sup>G</sup> and CDPK1<sup>M</sup> were generated and low abundance resampling (5%) was used to impute missing values. For protein level analysis, ratios of proteins were determined from the summed abundance of unique peptides comparing CDPK1G and CDPK1M strains.</p>
<p>Peptide and protein level data were exported from Proteome Discoverer for analysis in R. For enriched peptides, abundance ratios were calculated within each replicate for high confidence peptides (CDPK1<sup>G</sup>/CDPK1<sup>M</sup>) and normalized to the median abundance ratio of the whole proteome peptides derived from the flow through samples. Normalized abundance ratios in the flow through proteome samples were calculated by dividing abundance ratios by the median abundance ratios within each replicate. For enriched peptides, an average log<sub>2</sub> normalized abundance ratio was calculated from three replicates. Significantly enriched peptides were calculated using a one-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test using the normalized abundance ratios for three replicates. A non-linear significance threshold was calculated using the function (<italic>y</italic> = |4/<italic>x</italic>|), where significantly enriched peptides had product value of -log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>p</italic>)*(mean log<sub>2</sub> abundance ratio) greater than 4.</p>

Media was exchanged for 3% IFS in Ringer’s buffer just prior to live microscopy. At approximately 30 sec after beginning live microscopy, parasites were stimulated with zaprinast (500 μM final concentration) or a vehicle solution of DMSO in corresponding Ringer’s buffer. Images were recorded every 5–7 sec until egress or approximately 5 min using a Nikon Ti Eclipse with an enclosure maintained at 37°C.</p>
<p>Microneme relocalization was quantified using built-in commands from ImageJ (v. 1.53e). To determine the distribution of fluorescent micronemes at a specific time frame, a line was drawn from the parasite’s apical end to its basal end. The “plot profile” command was applied to this line to calculate fluorescence intensity at regularly spaced intervals (0.13 microns) across the parasite on unadjusted images. This process was repeated for each time frame of interest and for each parasite in the analyzed vacuole. Regression analysis was performed on relocalization data from each time frame, resulting in logarithmic regression plots that display how fluorescence intensity correlates with distance from the parasite’s apical end. Microneme relocalization is shown as SuperPlots to simultaneously visualize the median relocalization of an entire vacuole and the relocalization of individual parasites within each vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Lord et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Microneme localization in extracellular parasites</title>
<p>Microneme localization in extracellular parasites was quantified using a custom-built, image analysis pipeline. ImageJ’s built-in commands were used to measure the length of the parasite’s major axis. Based on the patterns of vehicle-treated TIR1/CLAMP-mNG data, 1/8th of the parasite closest to the apical end was deemed the apical region. The remaining region was deemed the body. Using the Interactive Learning and Segmentation Toolkit (ilastik v. 1.3.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berg et al., 2019</xref>), the apical region and body of parasites were isolated from each other and from the surrounding media. Ilastik’s pixel and object quantification tools were then used to determine the total intensity of fluorescence in each of these regions. Comparing these values to each other yielded the percentage of fluorescent micronemes present in each of these sections in relation to the total fluorescence present in the parasite. This process was repeated for several extracellular parasites in each of the conditions tested.</p>

<p>This carefully done research paper presents a fundamental model of techniques that are useful for the elucidation of kinase substrates. The paper utilizes state-of-the-art approaches to define a kinetic phosphoproteome and how to integrate that data with complementary approaches using a chemical probe (in this case KTPyS, a triphosphate) to find these substrates. Using these approaches TgCDPK1 was demonstrated to affect microneme secretion via a direct interaction with a HOOK complex (defined as a HOOK protein TGG1_289100, an FTS TGGT1_264050 and 2 other proteins TGGT1_316650 and 306920).</p>
<p>This work is carefully controlled and the analysis pathways are logical and provide paradigms for how to approach the question of identifying substrates of kinases using proteomic approaches employing genetic and chemical strategies.</p>
<p>The authors succeeded in the identification of candidate substrates for TgCDPK1. Validation of the results was provided by previous studies in the literature that characterized some of these substrates as well as the experiments in this manuscript on the characterization of the HOOK complex that is phosphorylated by CDPK1.</p>
<p>The HOOK complex (defined as a HOOK protein TGG1_289100, an FTS TGGT1_264050, and 2 other proteins TGGT1_316650 and 306920) was clearly demonstrated to be involved in invasion via its role in microneme trafficking.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors take a multipronged approach to identify the substrate repertoire of calcium-dependent protein kinase, CDPK1 in Toxoplasma that includes quantitative phosphoproteomics, myristoylation, thiophosphorylation, immunoprecipitation as well as proximity-based labeling. Their finding also reveals that CDPK1 functions in parasite invasion and egress by phosphorylating different protein candidates. More importantly, the authors successfully determine one branch of the CDPK1 signaling pathway that regulates invasion through the phosphorylation of the HOOK protein involved in the translocation and secretion of micronemal proteins.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Chan and collaborators investigate the role of CDPK1 in regulating microneme trafficking and exocytosis in Toxoplasma gondii. Micronemes are apicomplexan-specific organelles localized at the apical end of the parasite and depending on cortical microtubules. Micronemes contain proteins that are exocytosed in a Ca²+-dependent manner and are required for T. gondii egress, motility, and host-cell invasion. In Apicomplexa, Ca²+ signaling is dependent on Ca²+-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs). CDPK1 has been demonstrated to be essential for Ca²+-stimulated micronemes exocytosis allowing parasite egress, gliding motility, and invasion. It is also known that intracellular calcium storages are mobilized following a cyclic nucleotide-mediated activation of protein kinase G. This step, occurs upstream of CDPK1 functions. However, the exact signaling pathway regulated by CDPK1 remains unknown. In this paper, the authors used phosphoproteomic analysis to identify new proteins phosphorylated by CDPK1. They demonstrated that CDPK1 activity is required for calcium-stimulated trafficking of micronemes to the apical end, depending on a complex of proteins that include HOOK and FTS, which are known to link cargo to the dynein machinery for trafficking along microtubules. Overall, the authors identified evidence for a new protein complex involved in microneme trafficking through the exocytosis process for which circumstantial evidence of its functionality is demonstrated here.</p>
