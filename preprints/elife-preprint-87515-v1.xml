<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Infection with Influenza A virus (IAV) causes the well-known symptoms of the flu, including fever, loss of appetite and excessive sleepiness. These responses, mediated by the brain, will normally disappear once the virus is cleared from the system, but a severe respiratory virus infection may cause long-lasting neurological disturbances. These include encephalitis lethargica and narcolepsy. The mechanisms behind such long lasting changes are unknown. The hypothalamus is a central regulator of the homeostatic response during a viral challenge. To gain insight into the neuronal and non-neuronal molecular changes during an IAV infection, we intranasally infected mice with an H1N1 virus and extracted the brain at different time points. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of the hypothalamus, we identify transcriptional effects in all identified cell populations. The snRNA-seq data showed the most pronounced transcriptional response at 3 days past infection, with a strong downregulation of genes across all cell types. General immune processes were mainly impacted in microglia, the brain resident immune cells, where we found increased numbers of cells expressing pro-inflammatory gene networks. In addition, we found that most neuronal cell populations downregulated genes contributing to the energy homeostasis in mitochondria and protein translation in the cytosol, indicating potential reduced cellular and neuronal activity. This might be a preventive mechanism in neuronal cells to avoid intracellular viral replication and attack by phagocytosing cells. This is complemented by increased activity of microglia monitoring their surroundings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In humans as well as other species, Influenza A virus (IAV) infection causes respiratory tract disease, evoking seasonal epidemics associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Macias et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Paget et al., 2019</xref>). Beyond seasonal epidemics, H1N1 IAV strains have been identified as the causal agent for the pandemics in 1918 and 2009, leading up to 50 million and 18.000 deaths worldwide, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Simonsen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Taubenberger &amp; Morens, 2008</xref>). Beyond respiratory tract disease, IAV infections have also been associated with neurological consequences such as encephalitis lethargica and narcolepsy. Evidence from the spanish flu pandemic in 1918 linked H1N1 influenza infections to epidemic encephalitis lethargica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hoffman &amp; Vilensky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Maurizi, 2010</xref>). Similarly, increased numbers of encephalitis cases were reported during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goenka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Surana et al., 2011</xref>). A peak in new narcolepsy cases was also seen following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, and while this was linked with the Pandemrix vaccine in Europe, in China it was unrelated to vaccinations and thus might instead be linked to infection with the virus itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahmed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Han et al., 2011</xref>). A better understanding of the direct and indirect effects of IAV infection on the brain is needed to shed light on these observations.</p>
<p>Some IAV strains are considered neurotropic, meaning that they hold the machinery to infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS) and replicate, but evidence suggest that even non-neurotropic influenza strains can infiltrate the brain and cause neurological disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ekstrand, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hodgson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Macias et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Majde et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zielinski et al., 2013</xref>). When non-neurotropic viruses are found in the CNS, they are either not able to replicate at all or not efficiently in the brain resident cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hosseini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zielinski et al., 2013</xref>). The H1N1 strain from the 2009 pandemic (H1N1 pdm09) is non-neurotropic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sadasivan et al., 2015</xref>), so the mechanism behind the neurological consequences seen after that H1N1 infection must be caused by indirect effects rather than direct viral infection of brain cells. It is well known that cytokines produced during a peripheral infection can reach the brain and cause functional disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dantzer &amp; Kelley, 2007</xref>). It has also been shown that microglia become activated during peripheral IAV infections with non-neurotropic strains. Whether this microglia activation is a neuroprotective mechanism or contributes to neuroinflammation and -degeneration remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dusedau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sadasivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wiley et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The hypothalamus is a functional integrator of peripheral signals and regulates several physiological and behavioural functions via several specialised nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berthoud &amp; Munzberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonnavion et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Stuber &amp; Wise, 2016</xref>). The different hypothalamic neuron populations control among other things feeding, body temperature, sleep-wake states, and circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonnavion et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Timper &amp; Bruning, 2017</xref>; Yousefvand, 2021). The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) contains well described neuron populations like hypocretin (HCRT) or melanin-concentrating hormone releasing (MCH) neurons. These neurons are coupled to several biological functions including metabolism and the regulation of sleep and wake states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Oesch &amp; Adamantidis, 2021</xref>). Recent studies showed that the LHA is also involved during inflammatory processes and regulates pain perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonnavion et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brown et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fakhoury et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Stuber &amp; Wise, 2016</xref>). The dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) receives circadian input from the suprachiasmatic nucleus to regulate downstream behavioural and physiological changes including food intake, locomotion, and core body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gooley et al., 2006</xref>). Recent findings have linked neuronal subpopulations in the DMH to changes in thermoregulation and metabolism during immune activation with the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Osterhout et al., 2022</xref>). Several single-cell/nuclei-RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq) datasets have been published during the past years, shedding more light on the cell heterogeneity of the different hypothalamic regions, but little is known about how the transcriptome of these cell types change during environmental perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mickelsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mickelsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Romanov et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>In the current study, we used intranasal infections with H1N1 pdm09 in female mice and snRNA-seq to follow changes in the transcriptional landscape of cell populations in the medial hypothalamus. We find changes in all populations during the peak of disease. A change in cell state is seen in microglia at early infection and later strong effects are detected in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, after the mice have recovered from the acute infection, all non-neuronal cell types return to their resting state, while in neurons we detect long lasting changes of the transcriptome even after full recovery.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Mice were infected intranasally with influenza virus A/California/07/2009 (H1N1 pdm09) and monitored for a period of 23 days post infection for weight changes. Groups of mice were euthanized at 3, 7 and 23 days post infection (dpi) to collect lung, olfactory bulb (OB) and brain tissue for detection of viral abundance and snRNA-seq. The rationale for choosing these time points of sampling were as follows: (i) 3 dpi as a time point of initial disease onset before the start of weight loss – at this time point innate immunity is peaking; (ii) 7 dpi marks the point of strong weight loss and is where the adaptive immune response takes over, and before potential lethal outcome for some of the animals and (iii)23 dpi as a recovery group where animals had completely regained their initial body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Uddback et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>IAV respiratory tract disease progression and viral infiltration into lung and olfactory bulbs</title>
<p>Infected mice started losing weight around 4 dpi and had the highest weight loss at 10 dpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Animals in the recovery group had regained their body weight at 23 dpi. Lungs and OB were tested for the abundance of the M1 gene of the virus, to test for viral infection of those tissues. Viral mRNA was detected at 3 and 7 dpi in the lungs but was not detected at 23 dpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In the OB, viral mRNA was detected in one animal at 3 dpi, in all animals at 7 dpi, and in four out of five animals at 23 dpi. Three of the animals did not lose weight due to the infection (7 dpi: 7.3; 23 dpi: 23.3 and 23.4) instead the presence of viral mRNA in lungs and/or OB confirmed a successful infection (Supplementary Figure 2).</p>

<title>Molecular and cellular composition of the medial hypothalamus snRNA-seq dataset</title>
<p>For snRNA-seq we dissected a hypothalamic region containing both the DMH and the LHA from brains obtained from infected mice and the control group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, n=5 per group). Each sample was hashed individually, samples from one time point were pooled together and sequenced. After sequencing, samples were demultiplexed for the pooled samples at the different time points. We detected a total of 44,201 nuclei (henceforth referred to as cells). Subsequently, we filtered for viable cells and removed duplicates as well as cells with high contamination of ambient mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA), which leaved us with a total 30,452 cells for downstream analyses. We separated the cells into neuronal and non-neuronal (NonN) cells by using known marker genes expressed in neurons (Snap25, Syp, Syt1, Elavl2; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F,H</xref>). As expected, NonN cells expressed in general only half the number of genes (median unique gene count: 2,103) compared to neuronal cells (median unique gene count: 4,360). Similarly, the median transcript count per cell in the NonN population was lower (3,735 transcripts/cell) compared to the median number transcripts in neuron (10,497 transcripts/cell, 4360 features/cell; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The ratio between NonN and neuronal cells was similar at all time points except 3 dpi, where we detected a greater number of neuronal cells than NonN cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Identified NonN cell types</title>
<p>Among the non-neuronal cell types, we were able to identify 9 distinct populations, discriminated by their sets of cell type-specific markers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). We used published datasets of different regions of the hypothalamus to confirm the identity of the distinct cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mickelsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mickelsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Romanov et al., 2017</xref>). Two of the clusters belonged to the oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage, including oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs, NonN_3) and mature oligodendrocytes (MOLs, NonN_1). The main marker genes in these two clusters were Lhfpl3 and Slc24a2 but they also expressed other typical marker genes as Pdgfra, C1ql1, Fyn (OPCs) or Olig1, Anln, Plp1 in MOLs. Further, we resolved a cluster of astrocytes (NonN_2), which was defined by the differential expression of Slc4a4 and which was also positive for Sox9, Gja1 and Agt. The nearby cluster NonN_7 expressed similar characteristics as the astrocytes and exhibited a high expression of Slit2, Col23a1, and Slc16a2 which have been described to be enriched in tanycytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, D</xref>, and Supplementary Table 2). The identity of this cluster was confirmed by label transfer of other snRNA/scRNA-seq datasets from the hypothalamus, which showed a high prediction score of this cluster as tanycytes (Supplementary Table 2 and 3, Supp. Figure 5). The distinct clusters NonN_5 (Ranbp3l+, Cped1+, Slc6a20a+) and NonN_9 (Bnc2+, Slc47a1+, Slc26a7+) were identified as vascular and leptomeningeal cells, respectively. The NonN_8 cluster expressing Slco1a4 is expressing additionally Ebf1, Flt1, Rgs5, which are described as pericyte marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pagani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>). The cluster NonN_6 is a microglia cluster, with expression of Hexb, C1qa and C1qc - known microglia marker genes. Lastly, even though the cluster NonN_4 (Syt1+) is expressing general neuron markers, we could not identify any discriminatory markers for inhibitory or excitatory neuron populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Discriminatory marker genes such as Slc17a7, Crym, Ptk2b, Itcam5, Slit3, Crym indicate a progenitor/neuroblast identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kostin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>). Aligning this dataset with a dataset from the developing dentate gyrus including cells from the neuroblast lineage, indicates the presence of an immature granule subcluster strengthening the idea of NonN_4 as a neuroblast cluster (Supplementary Figure 5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hochgerner et al., 2018</xref>). However, because of the general low confidence and weak alignment we have kept this cluster unassigned.</p>

<title>Heterogeneous populations of inhibitory and excitatory neurons</title>
<p>To subcluster the neurons, we first examined the expression signature of neuronal markers: Vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2; encoded by Slc17a6); Vesicular GABA Transporter (VGAT, encoded by Slc32a1), glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67; encoded by Gad1); and histidine decarboxylase (encoded by Hdc) and separated the neuronal cells in GABAergic and glutamatergic cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We identified a total of 26 GABAergic and 30 glutamatergic clusters. The glutamatergic clusters also included a population of histaminergic neurons (Glut_24; Hdc+) and dopaminergic neurons (Glut_27; Th+, Ddc+) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Among the glutamatergic cells, we were able to detect two small clusters of HCRT expressing neurons (Glut_29; Hcrt+) and MCH-expressing neurons, (Glut_25; Pmch+).

<title>General transcriptional disease responses within the medial hypothalamus across all cells</title>
<p>To understand the nature of the molecular changes between the control group and the infected groups at different time points of disease progression, we first used a pseudo-bulk approach to compare their transcriptional signatures of all cells per time point against each other. A principal component analysis based on the pseudo-bulk dataset showed a clear clustering of the biological replicates per time point (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We found a clear separation of the samples taken at 3 dpi from the other time points. 7 dpi is clustering separately between 3 dpi and the control samples, whereas the samples from the recovery group at 23 dpi are spread between the 7 dpi and the control group cluster. This indicates a clear transcriptional change during the first 7 days of infection. The recovery group is mostly overlapping with the control group, but one sample clusters together with the 7 dpi group, suggesting a slower disease or recovery process in this animal (animal 23.4, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The overall gene expression counts show a pattern of lower counts per cell at 3 dpi in both GABAergic and glutamatergic cell populations. In glutamatergic cells this is a lasting but less pronounced effect until 23 dpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we performed a differential gene expression (DGE) analysis comparing the control samples to samples from different time points during disease progression, disregarding any differentiation between cell subpopulations. We tested, based on previous studies, gene sets know to be involved in neuroinflammatory and immune regulatory process within the central nervous system (CNS) for possible changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dusedau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hosseini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sadasivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zielinski et al., 2013</xref>). We primarily detected a down-regulation of these gene categories, which was strongest at 3 dpi with only very few significant changes lasting until 23 dpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The only up-regulated genes were detected at 3 and 7 dpi belonging to the category of neuron-related factors. Genes in the other categories were consistently down-regulated or not significantly regulated at all. This also included the virus-related cytokines and IFN-response genes (i.e. <italic>Il1a, Ifih1</italic>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) at 3 dpi. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are central in initiating the innate immune response by orchestrating signalling pathways leading to the release of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kawai &amp; Akira, 2011</xref>). In our dataset we see a general downregulation of TLRs (<italic>Tlr2, Tlr3</italic> and <italic>Tlr4</italic>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). These results show that a peripheral H1N1 pdm09 infection cause decreased gene expression in non-neuronal, GABAergic, and glutamatergic cell populations in the hypothalamus affecting several immune related processes.</p>

<title>Specific molecular regulation in non-neuronal, glutamatergic, and GABAergic cell populations</title>
<p>Next, we resolved the molecular disease responses in better detail, by performing a differential gene expression (DGE) analysis on the three overall cell populations (GABAergic, glutamatergic, and NonN). Similarly, to the previous pseud-bulk approach, we detected the strong down-regulation of genes at 3 dpi in all the three distinct cell populations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The overall number of down-regulated genes decreased at 7 and 23 dpi, but more differential expressed genes were detected in the GABAergic cells at 23 dpi, than at 7 dpi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>). Of all highly regulated genes at 3 dpi (False discovery rate (FDR) &lt;= 0.05, log fold change (logFC) &gt; 1 or logFC &lt;-1), approximately a quarter (27%) of the genes were shared between the 3 cell populations, and 30% were shared between the two neuronal clusters. Around 10% of the genes expressed in the GABAergic and glutamatergic cell clusters at 3 dpi were found expressed only in these cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, 20% of the DEGs in the NonN cells at 3 dpi were unique to these cells only. At 7 dpi, only 4 genes were shared between all 3 clusters, and 59 genes between the two neuronal clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). At 23 dpi no more DEGs were detected in the NonN cells. Most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at this time point belonged to the GABAergic cluster. To study what functional effects these detected changes in gene expression might have, we performed a gene ontology enrichment analysis. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> shows all the significantly regulated pathways. Of special interest, we detect an enrichment of genes involved in immune responses at 3 dpi in all three clusters, while this is restricted to the neuronal clusters at 7 dpi and only the Glut cluster at 23 dpi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Further, enrichment of neuropeptide signalling, and hormone activity pathways are also present in all three clusters at 3 dpi, while lasting until 23 dpi only in the neuronal cells. These data suggest that long term effects in the hypothalamus after a peripheral IAV infection affects primarily neurons.</p>

<title>Dissecting immune system processes in microglia</title>
<p>We tested all identified NonN and neuronal cell populations for differential gene expression. A cell cluster was excluded from analysis if their cells were originating from less than 3 of the biological replicates and if they were composed of less than two cells per cluster per biological replicate. Similarly, we used for further downstream analysis only strongly expressed genes with high up- or down-regulation (FDR &lt;= 0.05, logFC&gt;1 or logFC&lt;-1). As shown before, the strongest regulatory effect on the different clusters’ transcriptomes were detected at 3 dpi, which lasted partially until 23 dpi (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

<p>As described in the previous paragraph, we identified immune response pathways as one of the most enriched gene ontologies (GO) terms in the dataset. Therefore, we selected only the genes annotated in these immune-related GO terms, leaving us with 22 genes. Interestingly, all these 22 immune related genes are regulated in microglia (NonN_6) at 3 and 7 dpi (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). In other non-neuronal clusters less than half of this genes are differentially regulated at 3 dpi and none at 7 or 23 dpi. Similarly, neuronal cell populations showed fewer genes regulated at 3 dpi than microglia, however especially some GABAergic cell types show a transcriptional response of immune genes until 7 and even 23 dpi (i.e., GABA_7, 16 and 17). The here reported highest regulation of immune genes indicate that microglia are also in the medial hypothalamus the main immune orchestrating cell population.</p>
<p>We next aimed to describe the transcriptional changes in the microglia during disease progression. Raw DEG numbers emphasize the microglia cluster as the only cell cluster with a strong upregulation of genes at 3 dpi (75 genes), and a long-lasting down-regulation of genes until 23 dpi (52 and 12 genes at 7 and 23 dpi respectively; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, cluster NonN_6), indicating the importance of microglia for immune homeostasis in the medial hypothalamus. A closer look at the highest up-regulated genes reveals a strong induction of genes involved in cell adhesion, signalling and differentiation, synapse organization as well as apoptosis signalling. Down-regulated genes participate in the complement system, immune and antigen processing, microglia state genes and ribosomal genes contributing to protein synthesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>Typical markers like cell surface proteins or intracellular markers are often used to identify pro- (M1 state; i.e., Il1b, Ifng, Tfna, Fcgr3) or anti-inflammatory (M2 state; i.e., Tgfb, Mrc1, or Arg1) states of microglia [35, 37]. These markers were not regulated during disease progression in our dataset. Discrimination of the activation state of microglia using snRNA-seq has been reported to be challenging, due to a depletion of certain marker genes in the nucleus especially in human tissue [36]. Because of this lack of typical M1 and M2 markers, we identified alternative DEGs in microglia at different the time points related to activation states. Two long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes: Maternally Expressed 3 (<italic>Meg3</italic>), Imprinted in Prader-Willi Syndrome (<italic>Ipw</italic>) and the gene Fibroblast Growth Factor 14 (<italic>Fgf14</italic>) which have been recently connected to immune activation and pro-inflammatory microglia states [38-40], were found in our dataset enriched in the microglia at 3 and partly at 7 dpi (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). In contrast, genes connected to an anti-inflammatory state (<italic>F13a1, Mrc1, Arhgap14</italic>), were expressed in less microglia cells during acute infection than in control and 23 dpi. The results show that microglia are also in the medial hypothalamus a main immune orchestrating cell population, shifting from their homeostatic state towards a pro-inflammatory microglia population during 3 and 7 dpi. This shift is completely resolved after recovery at 23 dpi.</p>

<title>Identification of Oligodendrocyte and Astrocytes subclusters at 7 dpi</title>
<p>In oligodendrocytes (NonN_1) and astrocytes (NonN_2) between 144 – 244 genes were up- or down-regulated (logFC&gt;0 or logFC&lt;0) at 3 and/or 7 dpi (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). This was accompanied by a shift of the cells in the dimensional reduction plot of the not integrated data, especially at 7 dpi (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). In the oligodendrocytes this was accompanied by an up-regulation of genes involved in stress-related and glucocorticoid pathways (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">C</xref>). The same was not seen in the astrocyte sub-cluster. We identified significantly regulated GO terms associated with transport pathways in oligodendrocytes, with a strong up-regulation of genes in these terms at 3 and 7 dpi (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Only mitochondrial transport processes and transmembrane transport included down-regulated genes. Genes associated with GABAergic transport was up-regulated in oligodendrocytes uniquely at 7 dpi. Marker genes for the astrocytic 7-dpi cluster were identified as <italic>Aldh1a1, Lrrc8a</italic> (annotated here as ENSMUSG00000099041) and <italic>Zfhx3. Zfhx3</italic> showed a very distinct expression in this cluster (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). For astrocytes, the GO term oxidoreductase activity was highly and uniquely enriched at 7 dpi (Supplementary Table 5). Accordingly, we found the oxidoreductase genes to be highly up-regulated in the 7 dpi cluster, with only a few being also regulated a 3 dpi and non at 23 dpi (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Together these results suggest that an IAV infection induces slowly evolving transcriptional changes in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, leading to the appearance of distinct sub-populations of these cell types at 7 dpi. This altered cell stated disappear again after recovery at 23 dpi.</p>

<title>Long-term transcriptional response in neurons following as IAV infection</title>
<p>Even though the most prominent feature of the hypothalamic transcriptional response to H1N1 pdm09 was the downregulation of genes at 3 dpi across all cell clusters, some neuronal cell populations showed long-term differential expression of genes. As described in previous paragraphs, we detected overall changes in both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons at 23 dpi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). When looking at neuronal subclusters, we found that 6 out of 26 GABAergic cell clusters and 17 out of 30 glutamatergic cell clusters contained significantly regulated genes at 23 dpi when compared to the control group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Our initial GO term enrichment analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) hinted at several different possible pathways being affected, so we aimed at dissecting this further by analysing individual neuronal cell clusters. In this analysis we included glutamatergic and GABAergic cell clusters, which a high DGE profile at 23 dpi with at least 10 genes exhibiting a logFC greater than 1 or less than -1. The 15 neuronal clusters fulfilling this criterion were: Gaba_2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and Glut_1, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15, 17, 18 and 20. In general, we found the same regulatory processes to be regulated across many of the neuronal cell types. When looking at the pathways that remain altered at 23 dpi these include translational processes in the cytosol, metabolic processes in the mitochondria, as well as apoptotic processes (i.e., mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, Supplementary Table 6). Taken together, neuronal populations were the only cell populations that were affected by the H1N1 pdm09 infection until recovery, with changes including inhibition of genes contributing to metabolic and translational processes in the neurons.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The compiled snRNA-seq dataset presented above, to our knowledge, represents the first comprehensive transcriptome profiling on single-nuclei level of the hypothalamus during a peripheral IAV infection. We detected 26 GABAergic, 30 glutamatergic and 9 non-neuronal cell types, aligning closely with previously published datasets of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mickelsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mickelsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Romanov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, we deconvoluted the molecular changes of distinct cell populations in the hypothalamus during a peripheral IAV infection and detected a whole range of transcriptional changes across both NonN and neuronal cell types. In addition, we believe our dataset is a valuable resource for the scientific community to explore unsolved questions of hypothalamic responses during peripheral infections.</p>
<p>We were able to report viral infection of the olfactory bulb using H1N1 pdm09. This is comparable to what has been seen in previous studies using the non-neurotropic H1N1 strain PR8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Majde et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zielinski et al., 2013</xref>). The same studies found replication intermediates of the viral nucleoprotein (NP1), suggesting the potential ability of the virus to replicate further within the OB. However, another mechanism has been suggested, in which the virus continuously replicate in the nasal epithelium and then gets transported into the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zielinski et al., 2013</xref>). Other areas deeper in the CNS, like the hippocampal region, did not show any viral infiltration by PR8. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hosseini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jurgens et al., 2012</xref>). Similar results were reported for infections with H1N1 pmd2009, where the virus could not be detected in the hippocampus, striatum or cortex, supporting the hypothesis that this virus is not replicating in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sadasivan et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to our results, studies using the PR8 disease model reported elevated mRNA expression levels of cytokines related to viral infections 24 hours and 6 days post infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zielinski et al., 2013</xref>). We found in general a strong down-regulation of genes at 3 dpi, including also virus-related cytokines and IFN-response genes (i.e., <italic>Tlr3, Il1a, Ifih1</italic>) at 3 dpi with no differential regulation of these transcripts at 7 dpi. This indicate that we do not have neuroinflammatory processes in the hypothalamus in our model, or that the here chosen time point of 3 dpi might be too late to capture innate immune activation in the CNS.</p>
<p>Even though we used different published datasets to annotate the here-in identified cell types or compare gene expression changes in a disease context, the comparability of these datasets is challenging due to differences in the experimental setups. We identified a lack of RNA sequencing studies focusing solely on molecular changes in the hypothalamus during non-neurotropic IAV challenges. Different molecular changes based on viral strain or between brain regions are expected and further studies are needed to resolve this.</p>
<p>A prominent feature of our dataset is a long-lasting down-regulation of gene transcripts until 23 dpi in many neuronal cell populations. Gene set enrichment analysis showed these to be mainly related to processes in mitochondria (i.e. citric acid cycle (TCA), ATP synthesis) or to protein translation in the cytosol. This could be interpreted as a defensive mechanism, for the neurons to escape viral entry or replication in the cell and hence protect the cells from apoptosis. Different intermediates of the citric acid (TCA) cycle can be important for viral replication within the cell. In the context of IAV, acetyl-CoA and ATP are known to be beneficial for viral replication. Acetyl-CoA is also used for viral acetylation and ATP is needed for budding of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hatakeyama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hui &amp; Nayak, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2021</xref>). The downregulation of genes contributing to the translational machinery could be another attempt to inhibit translation of viral proteins in case of a potential entry of the virus into the cell. Another explanation for our findings could be that the downregulation of metabolic and translational processes in the cell might be caused by the excessive weight loss over the disease course and the lack of energy resources. However, we did see these changes also after full weight regain at 23 dpi. In addition, our results indicate that the virus is present in the OB until complete recovery at 23 dpi, suggesting this as one potential trigger for the here reported long-lasting transcriptional changes on hypothalamic neuron populations. Further studies are needed to determine for how long the virus remains in the system and when/if the neurons return fully to the healthy control condition.</p>
<p>Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, can have based on their activation state different immunological functions and properties. Interestingly, our results demonstrate the activation of pro-inflammatory genes in the microglia population, whereas anti-inflammatory transcripts are depleted. Further, general microglia signature genes (i.e, <italic>Hexb, Cx3cr1</italic> and <italic>Selplg</italic>) were found down-regulated at 3 and partly at 7 dpi, indicating a clear shift in microglia homeostasis at 3 dpi. This assumption is supported by the activation of genes contributing to cell adhesion, signalling and differentiation as well as synapse signalling. A pro-inflammatory microglia state (M1) is induced during an acute immune response and provide acute defence and repair mechanisms. For this, a tight control via constant cell-to-cell communication is necessary to avoid excessive long-term activation and eventual neurodegenerative consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rodriguez-Gomez et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, anti-inflammatory microglia (M2) are regulating the phagocytosis of pathogen and cell debris, inhibit inflammation and restore tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Franco &amp; Fernandez-Suarez, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jurga et al., 2020</xref>). While our data does not support the presence of an acute inflammatory process in the hypothalamus, what we instead find is an increased alert state of the resident immune cells.</p>
<p>The most striking shift in gene expression in our dataset was detected in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes at 3 and 7 dpi, which caused the separation of the cell populations into distinct sub-populations at 7 dpi for both cell types. In oligodendrocytes, we detect a distinct expression of S<italic>erum/glucocorticoid Regulated Kinase 1</italic> (<italic>Sgk1</italic>) in the 7-dpi population. This protein belongs to the family of glucocorticoid receptors (GCR) and has been associated with several environmental pertubations, including its up-regulation in the CNS during stress or during fasting in obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Avey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hinds et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Miyata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nonogaki et al., 2006</xref>). Further, the activation of SGK1 in oligodendrocytes is believed to lead to morphological changes, potentially caused by abnormal swelling of cytoplasm in oligodendrocytes or arborization of their processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Miyata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Miyata et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Fkbp5</italic>, encoding for FK506-binding protein 5, was another strongly induced transcript in oligodendrocytes at 7 dpi. It has previously been shown to be induced by glucocorticoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hahle et al., 2019</xref>) and involved in myelination in the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Choi et al., 2021</xref>). One of the main functions of oligodendrocytes is myelin formation around neuronal axons and the metabolic support of these to ensure neuronal signalling and information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Moore et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Saab et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, oligodendrocytes are involved in orchestrating stress responses mediated by GCRs. This is relevant for our model, as glucocorticoids are released following immune activation. This release usually occurs in a bi-phasic pattern, with an initial peak at 2 – 3 dpi caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines and a second peak at 7 – 8 dpi driven by T-cell specific cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hermann et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Silverman et al., 2005</xref>). Since the disease specific subpopulation of oligodendrocytes, we detect at 7-dpi shows markers related to GC signalling, this sub-cluster is likely driven by T–cell specific cytokines. For the astrocytes, one of the most pronounced discriminatory factors for the 7-dpi specific population was the expression of the <italic>Leucine-Rich Repeat-Containing Protein 8A</italic> (<italic>Lrrc8a</italic>, also <italic>Swell1</italic>, annotated as ENSMUSG00000099041) transcript. Lrrc8a has putative regulatory transmembrane transporter functions and is one essential subunit of volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC). Hence, it plays an important role in cell volume changes and regulate synaptic transmission via glutamate release from astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Osei-Owusu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). The upregulation of Lrrc8a suggests changes in astrocytic morphology in the hypothalamus in our model, comparable to what has been reported in the hippocampus during peripheral IAV infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hosseini et al., 2018</xref>). However, the functional importance of this change in our study stays elusive and needs further investigation. In addition, we showed that the <italic>zinc finger homeobox 3</italic> (<italic>Zfhx3</italic>) transcript is specifically up-regulated in astrocytes at 7 dpi. Its genomic locus has been associated with body mass index and it is further known to influence circadian rhythm and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Balzani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Parsons et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Turcot et al., 2018</xref>). The latter two are believed to be also regulated via astrocytic released glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brancaccio et al., 2017</xref>). Further, we identified a distinctive expressed gene in a part of the astrocyte population - <italic>aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 A1 (Aldh1a1</italic>), which is contributing to retinol metabolism. The inhibition of Aldh1a1 leads to reduced weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Haenisch et al., 2018</xref>). Aldh1a1 is known to mediate the synthesis of GABA in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kwak et al., 2020</xref>), which is then secreted by <italic>Best1</italic>-channels and GABA transporters (GAT, <italic>Slc6a1</italic> and <italic>Slc6a11</italic>) transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mederos &amp; Perea, 2019</xref>). These two transporters were found robustly expressed in the here analysed astrocyte population but not differentially expressed at any time point. The release of glutamate by astrocytes is regulated via the excitatory amino acid transporters (glutamate transporter 1; GLT-1, also known as <italic>Slc1a2</italic> and Glutamate Aspartate Transporter 1; GLAST, also known as <italic>Slc1a3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Delgado, 2013</xref>), which we found highly expressed in the here analysed astrocytes (Supplementary Figure 6). Additionally, we identified an up-regulation of genes of the oxidoreductase system. Such modulations of the antioxidant gene expression system has been shown to regulate microglia activation states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shih et al., 2006</xref>), so what we see might be a regulatory feature enabling astrocytes to fine tune the transitions between microglia homeostatic and inflammatory states. Taken together, the data suggest activation of two different transport processes in astrocytes. The expression of VRAC might facilitate glutamine release by astrocytes which can be taken up by neurons and converted to glutamate or GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">McKenna &amp; Ferreira, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Waagepetersen et al., 2003</xref>). This could be a supportive mechanism to maintain base level of neuronal signalling, which might be affected by the down-regulation of genes in the citric acid cycle in neurons and the accompanied loss of downstream products as neuropeptides. At the same time, the expression of transmembrane transporters might contribute to the swelling of astrocytes by the uptake of glutamate. Morphological changes in astrocytes are connected to appetite regulation by redirecting glutamate away from neurons and hence reducing glutamatergic signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Delgado, 2013</xref>). This might be a fundamental factor for sickness related weight loss and gain, categorizing the here identified 7-dpi astrocyte population as regulating neuroendocrine processes. Further studies are needed to understand and confirm the functional identity of the 7 dpi subclusters.</p>
<p>In summary, the data presented here shows how the cellular state of non-neuronal and neuronal cell populations in the hypothalamus change during peripheral IAV. Our data suggests the existence of tight co-regulation where one cell type affects the state of another. This connectivity on the one hand potentially ensures protection of the tissue by surveillant microglia but also counterbalances the microglia activity by astrocytic regulation of their antioxidant machinery. In addition, we found evidence that non-neuronal cell types like astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are potentially supporting neurons with their metabolic and signalling integrity, by enabling more nutrient transport as well as neuropeptide supply. Altogether, our study provides the first evidence of complex hypothalamic gene expression changes at the single cell level during a peripheral viral infection.</p>

<title>Animals and viruses</title>
<p>The experiments conducted in the study were approved by the Danish Animal Experimental Inspectorate (license number: 2020-15-0201-00585) in accordance with the Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and Council on the protection of animal used for scientific purposes. Female C57BL/6NTac mice were obtained from Taconic at 8-10 weeks old. Animals were kept in groups of 5, fed ad libitum and kept at a 12h day/night cycle. Virus stocks (H1N1 A/California/07/2009) were maintained at Prof. Jan P. Christensen Lab, University of Copenhagen. Virus stocks were propagated in Madin-Barby Canine Kidney cells (MDCK). Cell cultures were infected at 0,01 MOI and harvested at 90-100 % CPE after 2-3 days. Supernatant was centrifuged to clear it of cell debris and supernatant was stored at -80°C for titration and infection of animals. Titration was done as previously described by Uddbäck and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Uddback et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Viral infections and tissue collection</title>
<p>10-week-old female C57BL/6N were inoculated intranasally with H1N1 A/California/07/2009 with a dose of 5×10<sup>5</sup> pfu in 30 µl per animal. 3 days, 7 days and 23 days post inoculation (dpi) the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation between 1:00-3:00 pm to minimize confounding effects from circadian rhythm or sleep/wake phases. The lungs, brains and olfactory bulbs were removed, frozen on dry ice and stored in at -80°C. The lungs and olfactory bulb were used to determine infection and the hypothalamus of the brain was used for snRNAseq.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Viral RNA Measurement by PCR</title>
<p>The olfactory bulbs and the right lung were homogenized using an ULTRA-Turrax T8.01 homogenizer in the RLT lysis buffer from the RNeasy mini and midi kit (Qiagen). The rest of the RNA extraction was performed according to the manufactured protocol from the RNeasy mini and midi kit to extract RNA from brain and lung tissue. The concentration and purity of RNA in the samples was measured by a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Delaware, USA). All the samples used in this experiment had a 1.7-2.1 260/280nm ratio. Next, the samples were diluted to 1 µg total RNA in each well and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit.</p>

<title>Tissue preparation, nuclei isolation and hashing of nuclei</title>
<p>Mouse brains tissue were sectioned at 300 μm in a cryostat [Leica CM3050S] to identify the lateral hypothalamus (bregma -0.94 to -1.34) for punching. The sections were punched five times, and the tissue was transferred to a cooled Dounce-homogenizer containing Nuclei EZ lysis buffer to homogenize the tissue. The samples were filtered through a 40μm mini cell strainer followed by a 25%/29% iodixanol gradient to separate debris from the nuclei. To be able to distinguish samples later in post-sequencing analysis, the pellet was resuspended in FACS buffer containing sample-specific hash-tagged antibody recognizing a nucleus specific protein. A hashtag is an antibody with an oligonucleotide tail with PCR handle, a unique barcode and a poly A tail.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>FACS Sorting and snRNA-sequencing</title>
<p>The sample were stained with DAPI (0.5µg/ml) and purified using the Sony SH800S cell sorter. Whole nuclei were gated using the DAPI fluorescence at 450±25 nm, to avoid debris, and sorted directly into RT Reagent B (10X genomics) and further processed according to the company’s guide and sequenced using a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina).</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing raw data processing and quality control</title>
<p>Raw sequencing reads were processed using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger version 3.0 pipeline and aligned to the Mus musculus (mm10) genome with default parameters. All libraries were converted to FASTQs using bcl2fastq. The FASTQ files were aligned to the mouse genome (assembly - GRCm38.p6) and subsequent read quantification was performed using the Salmon pipeline. Each library underwent separate quality control steps as described in the Alevin pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Srivastava, 2020</xref>). Hash-tagged antibody tag oligos (HTO) filtering removes nuclei with low tags or noisy cells. Furthermore, nuclei containing two or more cell barcodes (doublets) were removed.</p>
<p>Following normalization (SCTransform), integration and dimensionality reduction were performed using Seurat version 4.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hao et al., 2021</xref>). Cells were tested for their mitochondrial RNA content and outliers with high mitochondrial RNA were removed using the quality control (QC) functions (perCellQCMetrics, PercentageFeatureSet, quickPerCellQC, isOutlier) from the R package <italic>scuttle (McCarthy et al</italic>., <italic>2017)</italic>. Counts were normalized using a log transformation of a genes counts divided by the total counts of a cell multiplied by 1e6. To remove variance attributed to batch and treatment for downstream visualization and clustering, samples were normalized using ‘SCTransform’ and integrated using the ‘FindIntegrationAnchors’ and ‘IntegrateData’ Seurat functions. The integrated dataset was centred and scaled, PCA was carried out and for visualization we used UMAP dimensionality reduction.</p>

<sec id="s4g">
<title>Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing cell population identification</title>
<p>Cells were classified into neuronal and non-neuronal cells using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based on the expression of pan-neuronal markers (<italic>Syp, Galntl6, Rbfox3, Syn1, Dnm1, Slc17a6, Slc32a1, Gad1, Gad2</italic>). Cells with high expression were classified as neurons and low expression as non-neuronal cells. The dataset was separated based on this classification and subsequently analysed independently.</p>
<p>For identifying GABAergic and glutamatergic cells we used a GMM based on known GABAergic and glutamate markers (<italic>Slc17a6, Slc32a1, Gad1, Gad2</italic>), and divided the dataset further based on their classification. We identified a neuronal cluster expressing neither of the GABAergic nor glutamatergic markers. It also did not express any other neuron markers (histaminergic, dopaminergic, ect.), and the cluster was therefore moved to the non-neuronal dataset.</p>
<p>Cluster identification was performed on the integrated dataset using the Seurat functions ‘FindNeighbors’ and ‘FindClusters using the Leiden algorithm (is a reference neede here?). Non-neuronal cell populations and well known (i.e Hcrt, Hdc, Pmch, ect) neuronal populations were identified and classified based of known marker genes. Additionally, we used published datasets from the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mickelsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mickelsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Romanov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>) to confirm cell type annotations by using the Seurat functions ‘FindTransferAnchors’ and ‘TransferData’. We accepted a prediction score &gt;= 0.5 in at least 50 % of the cells of a cell cluster. Marker genes for the different cell populations were identified using the ‘FindMarkers” function from the Seurat package and using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method.</p>

<sec id="s4h">
<title>Differential gene expression analysis</title>
<p>To calculate gene expression fold changes in samples from infected mice compared to the control group, we used a pseudo-bulk approach. We calculated in total three different differential gene expression datasets; (I) Aggregating counts per gene across all cells without discriminating between cell types or clusters, (II) aggregating counts per gene for all GABAergic, glutamatergic, and non-neuronal cells and (III) aggregating counts per gene for each identified cluster. Differential gene expression analysis was performed used the <italic>DESeq2</italic> and <italic>scran</italic> R packages. Calculations were performed per time point and a cell cluster was only included if it contained more than 2 nuclei in at least 3 individual animals (equals at least 9 single nuclei per time point per cluster). Further we selected only robustly expressed genes in a cell cluster for DGE analysis, meaning a gene must be expressed in at least 95% of the cells of one of the tested time points versus the control to be included in the analysis. The counts were aggregated using the Seurat function ‘AggregateExpression’ and transformed to a DESeq2 data set with the function ‘DESeqDataSetFromMatrix’. We calculated normalization factors using the scran function ‘computeSumFactors’. The differential expression analysis was performed using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) and a Gamma-Poisson Generalized linear model (glmGamPoi) for fitting the dispersion to the mean intensities. P values were adjusted (for time points tested x number of cell populations x the number of genes) using the false discovery rate by Benjamini &amp; Hochberg.</p>

<sec id="s4i">
<title>Gene set enrichment analysis</title>
<p>For gene ontology enrichment analysis (GOEA), we used the <italic>topGO</italic> package in R (is a reference needed?). All significant differentially expressed genes (FDR &lt;= 0.05) were defined as the gene universe. Only highly regulated genes (FDR &lt;= 0.05, logFC &gt; 1 or logFC &lt; -1) were included in the GOEA and tested twice, first implementing a classical algorithm, and second using an algorithm eliminating (<italic>elim</italic> method) local dependencies between GO terms. For the t-test statistic we used in both cases a Fisher exact test. P-values returned by the <italic>elim</italic>ination method are considered as not affected by multiple testing and hence can be interpreted as corrected (Alexa &amp; J., 2022). Enrichment analysis for the Reactome database was performed with the ‘ReactomePA’ R package and its ‘enrichPathway’ function. We mapped the mice gene identifiers to human Entrez gene IDs for analysis. Genes were selected based on their expression in the same way as for GOEA. P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini &amp; Hochberg correction method.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work provides a comprehensive study of how different cell types of the lateral and dorsomedial hypothalamus are affected by an Influenza H1N1 infection. The evidence presented here is <bold>solid</bold>; the methodological approach is state-of-the-art, however, the theoretical analysis can be strengthened by further reanalysis of the datasets. This work is of interest to virologists and neurobiologists as the results are promising and open a new door to understanding the effect of respiratory viruses on the physiology of the central nervous system.</p>

<p>This study uses single-cell genomics and gene pathway analysis to characterize the transcriptional effects of influenza H1N1 infection on cell types of the lateral hypothalamus and dorsomedial hypothalamus. The authors use droplet-based single-nuclei RNA-seq to profile single-cell gene expression at 3, 7, and 23 days post intranasal infection with H1N1 influenza virus. Through state-of-the-art and rigorous computational methods, the authors find that many hypothalamic cell types, including glia and neurons, are transcriptionally altered by respiratory infection with a non-neurotropic influenza virus, and that these alterations can persist for weeks and potentially affect cell type interactions that disrupt function. Their thorough discussion of the findings raises interesting questions and hypotheses about the functional implications of the molecular changes they observed, including the physiological changes that can persist long after acute viral infection. Given the role of the hypothalamus in homeostasis, this work sheds light on potential mechanisms by which the H1N1 virus can disrupt cell function and organismal homeostasis beyond the cells that it directly infects.</p>
<p>Despite its strengths, there are several points in the manuscript lacking sufficient evidence or clarity, which need to be addressed through revision. For instance, the conclusion that neurons but not non-neurons show persistent changes in gene expression may be alternatively explained by differences in the number of neuron and non-neuronal cells and transcripts. Also, the authors highlight the connection between influenza infection and loss of appetite and sleepiness but do not explore whether the influenza infection affected the cell types in their dataset previously associated with appetite and sleepiness, or whether differences in weight loss among the influenza-infected subjects correspond to any differences in gene expression.</p>

<p>The new work from Lemcke et al suggests that the infection with Influenza A virus causes such flu symptoms as sleepiness and loss of appetite through the direct action on the responsible brain region, the hypothalamus. To test this idea, the authors performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the mouse hypothalamus in controlled experimental conditions (0, 3, 7, and 23 days after intranasal infection) and analyzed changes in the gene expression in the specific cell populations. The key results are promising.</p>
<p>However, the analysis (cell type annotation, integration, group comparison) is not optimal and incomplete and, therefore should be significantly improved.</p>
<p>More specifically:</p>
<p>1. The current annotation of cell types (especially neuronal but also applicable to the group of heterogeneous &quot;Unassigned cells&quot;) did not make a good link to existing cell heterogeneity in the hypothalamus identified with scRNA seq in about 20 recently published works. All information about different peptidergic groups can not be extracted from the current version (except for a few). There are also some mistakes or wrong interpretations (eg, authors assigned hypothalamic dopamine cells to the glutamatergic group, which is not true). This state is feasible to improve (and should be improved) with already existing data.</p>
<p>2. I am confused with the results shown in the label transfer (suppl fig 3 and 4; note, they do not have the references in the text) applied to some published datasets (authors used the Seurat functions 'FindTransferAnchors' and 'TransferData'). The final results don't make sense: while the dataset for the arcuate nucleus (Campbel et al) well covered the GABAergic neurons it is not the case for the whole hypothalamus datasets (Chen et al; Zeisel et al). Similarly, for glutamatergic neurons. Additionally, I could not see that the label transfer works well for PMCH cells which should be present in the dataset for the lateral hypothalamus (Mickelsen et al,2019).</p>
<p>3. There are newly developed approaches to check the shifts in the cell compositions and specific differential gene expression in the cell groups (e.g. Cacoa from Kharchenko lab, scCoda from Büttner et al; etc). Therefore, I did not fully understand why here the authors used the pseudo-bulk approaches for the data analysis (having such a valuable dataset with multiple hashed samples for each timepoint). Therefore it would be great to use at least one of those approaches, which were developed specifically for the scRNAseq data analysis. Or, if there are some reasons - the authors should argue why their approach is optimal</p>
<p>4. When the authors describe the DGE changes upon experimental conditions (Figures 5 and 6), my first comment is again relevant: it is difficult to use the current annotation and cell type description as the reference for testing virus effects and shifts in the DGE in distinct neuronal subtypes.</p>
<p>I have to note that the experimental design is well done and logical. Therefore I believe that to strengthen the conclusions, the already obtained datasets can be used for improved analysis.</p>
