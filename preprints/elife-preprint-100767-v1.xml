<abstract>
<p>Mutations in Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway genes, e.g. <italic>Suppressor of Fused</italic> (SUFU), drive granule neuron precursors (GNP) to form medulloblastomas (MB<sup>SHH</sup>). However, how different molecular lesions in the Shh pathway drive transformation is frequently unclear, and SUFU mutations in the cerebellum seem distinct. In this study, we show that fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) signaling is integral for many infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> cases and that FGF5 expression is uniquely upregulated in infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> tumors. Similarly, mice lacking SUFU (Sufu-cKO), ectopically express FGF5 specifically along the secondary fissure where GNPs harbor preneoplastic lesions and show that FGFR signaling is also ectopically activated in this region. Treatment with an FGFR antagonist rescues the severe GNP hyperplasia and restores cerebellar architecture. Thus, direct inhibition of FGF signaling may be a promising and novel therapeutic candidate for infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, with half of cases diagnosed before the age of 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ward et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ostrom et al., 2016</xref>). Mutations in <italic>Suppressor of Fused</italic> (<italic>SUFU)</italic> comprise approximately 30% of tumors in infants with Sonic Hedgehog driven MB (MB<sup>SHH</sup>). Infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup>, including those with SUFU mutations (MB<sup>SHH-SUFU</sup>) have worse prognosis and higher rates of local recurrence than other MB<sup>SHH</sup> subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kool et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Schwalbe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Guerrini-Rousseau et al., 2018</xref>). Unfortunately, available SHH-targeted treatments for MB<sup>SHH</sup> act specifically on proteins upstream of SUFU and are therefore ineffective for MB<sup>SHH-SUFU</sup> patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kool et al., 2014</xref>). The poor prognosis, early occurrence, and lack of targeted therapy for MB<sup>SHH-SUFU</sup> patients make detailed understanding of the drivers of oncogenesis in this group of great importance.</p>
<p>Sufu acts as an intracellular modulator of SHH signaling (Matise and Wang, 2011). Briefly, the SHH signaling pathway is initiated after binding of extracellular SHH ligands to the transmembrane receptor Patched 1 (Ptch1). This relieves Ptch1 inhibition of the transmembrane protein, Smoothened (Smo), and enables the initiation of a cascade of intracellular events promoting the activator function of the transcription factors, Gli1, Gli2, or Gli3. Sufu modulates SHH signaling by ensuring the stability of Gli transcription factors or by promoting the formation of the repressor forms of Gli2 (Gli2R) or Gli3 (Gli3R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; Wang et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2014). Thus, depending on the developmental context, loss of Sufu can lead to activation or repression of SHH signaling. In the developing cerebellum, Sufu dysfunction is associated with abnormal development of granule neuron precursors (GNP), which account for MB<sup>SHH</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kim et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Vanner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Vladoiu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jiwani et al., 2020</xref>). GNPs populate the external granule layer (EGL) along the cerebellar perimeter where local SHH signals trigger GNP proliferation and differentiation at neonatal stages. However, other mitogenic pathways can also influence GNP behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Leto et al., 2016</xref>), yet little is known on how Sufu interacts with these pathways. Understanding how SUFU loss-of-function (LOF) affects the activity of concurrent local signaling pathways in granule neuron development may be key towards developing potent targets for anti-tumor therapy.</p>
<p>In this study, we examined regulation of FGF signaling in MB<sup>SHH</sup> and identified upregulation of FGF5 expression in tumors of infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> patients. Similarly, we show ectopic expression of FGF5 in the neonatal cerebellum of mice in lacking SUFU and correlates with the activation of FGF signaling in surrounding EGL-localized cells where GNPs accumulate. Strikingly, acute pharmacological inhibition of FGF signaling results in near-complete rescue of these defects, including a restoration of cerebellar histo-organization. Thus, our findings identify FGF5 as a potential biomarker for a subset of patients with infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> who may be responsive to FGFR-targeting therapies.</p>

<title>FGF5 is specifically upregulated in SHH-driven infantile MB</title>
<p>We previously reported that SUFU LOF in neocortical progenitors result in FGF signaling activation to influence specification and differentiation of neocortical excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yabut et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we sought to determine if key FGF signaling pathway genes are differentially expressed in MB patient tumors. We performed comparative analysis of the expression dataset from 763 MB patient samples comprised of tumors resected from molecularly distinct MB subgroups: Wingless (Wnt subgroup; MB<sup>WNT</sup>), MB<sup>SHH</sup>, Group 3 (MB<sup>Group3</sup>), and Group 4 (MB<sup>Group4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cavalli et al., 2017</xref>). Strikingly, our analyses show that FGF5 expression is higher in tumors specifically from MB<sup>SHH</sup> patients compared to other MB subgroups, with approximately 25% of MB<sup>SHH</sup> tumors exhibiting a two-fold increase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-1B</xref>). We also find that FGF5 is uniquely upregulated in MB<sup>SHH</sup> tumors from patients within the 0-3 years old age group, but not patients within the same age group in other MB subtypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Further examination across all MB<sup>SHH</sup> tumors stratified which subgroups express the highest levels of FGF5 expression. Infantile tumors, largely belonging within the SHHb and SHHg subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cavalli et al., 2017</xref>), exhibit higher FGF5 levels compared to tumors from children (SHHa) or adults (SHHd) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). By all measures, the proportion of SHHb and SHHg tumors with relatively high levels of FGF5 is significantly increased (â¼30%) compared to other MB<sup>SHH</sup> subgroups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that FGF signaling is specifically disrupted in infantile-onset MB<sup>SHH</sup>.</p>

<title>Region-specific expansion of GNPs in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum coincides with increased FGF5 expression</title>
<p>FGF signaling has been implicated in cerebellar development, particularly in granule neuron development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yaguchi et al., 2009</xref>; Yu et al., 2011) leading us to wonder if and how aberrant FGF signaling may be contributing to oncogenicity of GNPs. Since mutations in SUFU drive infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup>, we generated the mutant mice (<italic>hGFAP-Cre;Sufu</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>, hereto referred as Sufu-cKO), in which Sufu is conditionally deleted in GNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhuo et al., 2001</xref>) to examine FGF expression and activity. Sufu-cKO mice exhibit profound defects in cerebellar development. At P0, a timepoint at which GNP proliferation and differentiation is ongoing, there is a visible increase in measured cerebellar size and expansion of Pax6-positive (Pax6+) GNPs in the EGL of Sufu-cKO cerebellum compared to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). Notably, the expansion of Pax6+ GNPs specifically localize along the secondary fissure (EGL Region B, arrow in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) compared to other EGL areas (EGL Regions A and C) in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). We then proceeded to examine whether these defects correlated with abnormal FGF5 expression. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) using FGF5-specific riboprobes show high expression of FGF5 (FGF5<sup>high</sup>) immediately adjacent to the secondary fissure in the P0 control cerebellum (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Strikingly, in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum, there is anterior expansion of FGF5<sup>high</sup> expression regions (outlines, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), coinciding with areas near the secondary fissure where GNP expansion is most severe (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, 2D</xref>). Further, while FGF5-expressing (FGF5+) cells are largely excluded from the EGL of the control cerebellum, a substantial number of FGF5+ cells are ectopically localized in the EGL Region B of the Sufu-cKO cerebellum (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). FGF5 mRNA molecules are visibly higher in FGF5-expressing cells in the Sufu-cKO EGL compared to controls (arrows, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). These findings implicate FGF5 as a potential instigator of region-specific defects in GNP differentiation present in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum.</p>

<title>FGF signaling drives GNP proliferation in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum</title>
<p>FGF5 is a ligand for fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 (FGFR1) and 2 (FGFR2), both of which are expressed in the developing cerebellum, particularly in IGL regions where FGF5-expressing cells localize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Clements et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ornitz et al., 1996</xref>). Binding of FGF5 to these receptors triggers the activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways including the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway to control cellular activities driving NSC progression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>). Immunostaining with antibodies to detect MAPK pathway activation reveals increased MAPK activity in the EGL of the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum. Regional distribution of cells labeled with phospho-Erk1/2 (pErk1/2+), a marker for activated MAPK signaling, shows that the abnormally expanded EGL of the secondary fissure in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum increase in these cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Quantification of the number of pERK1/2+ cells in this area reveals that this is significant compared to controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Many pERK1/2+ cells are also proliferative as indicated by Ki67 labeling (boxed areas, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) and the numbers of these dual labeled cells are significantly higher in the Sufu-cKO cerebellum compared to controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). These findings indicate that the increase in FGF5 correlates with the activation of FGF signaling in GNPs and demonstrates a likely role in regulating the abnormal proliferation and pre-neoplastic lesion in mutant mice.</p>

<p>Given the role of SUFU in regulating Gli transcription factors to modulate SHH signaling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yin et al., 2019</xref>), we examined whether the activation of FGF signaling occurred concurrently with SHH signaling activation. Surprisingly, Gli protein levels in the P0 control and Sufu-cKO cerebellum show marked reduction of Gli1, Gli2, Gli3, and Ptch1 levels (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>); this is inconsistent with elevated SHH signaling we anticipated in the absence of SUFU. To directly examine this in specific EGL regions, we compared the cerebellum of P0 control and Sufu-cKO mice carrying the SHH reporter transgene Gli1-LacZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahn and Joyner, 2005</xref>). In these mice, SHH signaling activity is absent or very low throughout the entire P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum but is highly active in a region-specific manner in controls (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). Furthermore, while some LacZ+ cells are detectable in EGL regions A and C and adjacent ML and IGL, LacZ+ cells are completely absent in EGL region B and adjacent areas of the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1B-1C</xref>). These findings indicate that the accumulation of GNPs does not rely on active SHH signaling, particularly in Region B where there is a severe expansion of GNPs in the absence of SUFU.</p>

<title>Blockade of FGF signaling dramatically rescues the Sufu-cKO phenotype</title>
<p>To determine if activated FGF signaling drives GNP defects in the Sufu-cKO cerebellum, we pharmacologically inhibited FGF signaling using the competitive FGFR1-3 antagonist AZD4547 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gudernova et al., 2016</xref>). For this experiment, 1 Âµl of AZD4547 (5mg/ml) was - delivered via intraventricular (IV) injection for 5 consecutive days beginning at P0 and the cerebellum analyzed 3 days after treatment at P7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Strikingly, AZD4547 treatment results in near complete rescue of the GNP phenotype by P7 in the Sufu-cKO cerebellum, displaying a cerebellar morphology indistinguishable from controls with normal foliation and cellular organization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Indeed, in the cerebellum of AZD4547 -treated P7 Sufu-cKO mice, proliferating Ki67+ cells largely exclusively localize in the EGL while NeuN+ cells densely pack the IGL and not the EGL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Notably, NeuN expression appears in cells localized at the border of the EGL and ML, where Ki67+ cells are absent, indicating that post-mitotic cells successfully began differentiation as observed in controls (boxed regions, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Thus, our findings confirm that inhibition of FGF signaling in proliferating GNPs of the Sufu-cKO cerebellum ensure normal progression of GNP differentiation.</p>

<title>FGF5 expression is increased in the developing cerebellum of Sufu;p53-dKO mice</title>
<p>Our findings indicate a critical role for FGF signaling in driving GNP hyperplasia, making GNPs vulnerable to neoplastic lesions resulting in tumorigenesis, when SUFU is absent in the developing cerebellum. Indeed, we find that Pax6+ GNPs within the neonatal Sufu-cKO EGL display an increase in double-strand breaks, especially in Region B (DSBs; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-4B</xref>), as detected by immunostaining for phosphorylated H2AX (gH2AX), an early marker for DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mah et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, as previously reported, tumors do not readily form in the Sufu-cKO cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yin et al., 2019</xref>), indicating either timely repair of DSBs or the induction of apoptosis in GNPs with significant genomic instability. Indeed, double-labeling with cleaved Caspase 3 (CC3) and gH2AX show a significantly higher number of double-labeled cells in EGL Regions A and B (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2A-2B</xref>). Among the downstream targets of DSB repair pathways is p53, which when activated mediates cell death to suppress tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gao et al., 2000</xref>). In the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum, p53 protein is present, albeit significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The reduction in p53 may be driving an increase in DSBs yet still sufficient to induce apoptotic pathways. Supporting this, conditional ablation of both p53 and SUFU in GNPs (<italic>hGFAP-Cre;Sufu</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;p53</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> or Sufu;p53-dKO) results in the formation of massive tumors in the cerebellum within 2 months after birth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>), indicating the failure to activate critical apoptotic pathways. However, tumors do not form in mice lacking p53 (Marino et al., 2000) or SUFU alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). These findings suggest that in the absence of SUFU, the failure of GNPs to transition into fully differentiated granule neurons compromises genomic stability and renders GNPs extremely vulnerable to tumor formation with a second molecular hit.</p>

<p>We sought to confirm that upregulated FGF signaling also occur in the tumor-prone Sufu;p53-dKO. As expected, the neonatal cerebellum of Sufu-cKO, display EGL expansion due to excess proliferative (Ki67+) and Pax6+ cells in the P0 Sufu;p53-dKO cerebellum but not in p53-cKO and control cerebelli (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Further expansion of Pax6+ GNPs in the P0 Sufu;p53-dKO is also most severe along the secondary fissure (EGL Region B) compared to other EGL areas (EGL Regions A and C) of the P0 Sufu;p53-dkO cerebellum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-4H</xref>). As with our observations in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum, ISH for FGF5 in the P0 Sufu;p53-dKO cerebellum show ectopic FGF5 expression. Particularly, FGF5+ cells are expanded anteriorly and detected specifically around the secondary fissure of the P0 Sufu;p53-dKO cerebellum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). There is also ectopic MAPK signaling activity in the P0 Sufu;p53-dKO cerebellum, with significantly higher numbers of pErk1/2+ cells within the EGL, many of which are proliferative as marked by co-labeling with Ki-67, within the expanded EGL of the secondary fissure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). These findings indicate that as in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum, ectopic FGF5 expression triggers FGF signaling in GNPs in the P0 Sufu;p53-dKO cerebellum and may facilitate oncogenic transformation and tumor growth of GNPs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our studies identify a mechanism by which the combinatorial effects of oncogenic <italic>SUFU</italic> mutations and other concurrent developmental signaling pathways, make GNPs vulnerable to oncogenic transformation leading to infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup>. Using mice lacking SUFU in GNPs, we find that ectopic FGF5 expression correlates with an increase in FGF signaling, particularly in areas where proliferating GNPs reside, resulting in GNP hyperplasia, preneoplastic lesions, and patterning defects. Inhibition of FGF signaling through pharmacological blockade of FGFR1-3 prevents hyperplasia and associated cerebellar architectural abnormalities. Strongly supporting a role for FGF5, we also find elevated levels of FGF5 gene expression specifically in infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> patients, but not in other MB subgroups. These findings indicate that FGF-targeting compounds may be a promising therapeutic option for infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> patients, with elevated levels of FGF5 in tumor tissues acting as a potential biomarker.</p>
<p>Expansion of Pax6+ GNPs in the newborn Sufu-cKO cerebellum (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) occur in similar anatomic subregions where infantile MB tumors typically arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tan et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, these subregions have low levels of Gli1 reporter activity, Ptch1 expression, and SHH ligand expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Corrales et al., 2004</xref>). Spatially distinct regulation of granule neuron development by Sufu may therefore rely on non-canonical SHH signaling beyond Smo, or through yet undefined downstream interactions resulting in control of FGF signaling activity. Supporting this, we find ectopic expression of FGF5 and deregulation of FGF signaling as marked by the excessive intracellular activation of MAPK signaling in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum. Similarly in previous studies, ectopic expression of FGF ligands, FGF8 and FGF15, are associated with degradation of Gli3R because of SUFU deletion, resulting in regional patterning and precursor specification and differentiation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kim et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jiwani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yabut et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that SUFU acts at the intersection of SHH and FGF signaling to modulate GNP behavior (as summarized in our working model in <bold>Fig. 8</bold>). We postulate that SUFU exerts this role via stabilization of Gli transcription factors, since we observed a decrease in Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 protein level in the newborn Sufu-cKO cerebellum. Supporting this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yin et al., (2019)</xref> found that reducing Gli2 levels rescued GNP hyperplasia and patterning defects in the Sufu-cKO neonatal cerebellum. Further studies are required to elucidate the involvement of Gli-dependent mechanisms in controlling FGF5 gene expression in the neonatal cerebellum.</p>
<p>In the wildtype cerebellum, FGF5-expressing cells localize within the IGL surrounding the secondary fissure at P0 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ozawa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hattori et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yaguchi et al., 2009</xref>) where Gli1 reporter activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), and SHH and Ptch1 expression are lowest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Corrales et al., 2004</xref>). By P4, FGF5 expression is detected in cells within the IGL throughout the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yaguchi et al., 2009</xref>). However, by P14, a timepoint at which most granule neurons have differentiated, FGF5 is no longer detected in the IGL or other cerebellar regions per Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brain-map.org">www.brain-map.org</ext-link>). The strict spatiotemporal expression of FGF5 strongly supports a stage-specific role for regulating GNP development, particularly along the secondary fissure, to ensure timely differentiation and maturation of granule neurons. Indeed, deregulation of FGF5 expression, as we observed in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum, results in the inability of adjacent GNPs to normally differentiate and instead continued massive proliferation.</p>
<p>Our findings are contrary to previous reports of the proliferation-suppressive roles of FGFs, particularly FGF2, in GNPs specifically carrying <italic>Ptch1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fogarty et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Emmenegger et al., 2013</xref>). However, in contrast to the Ptch1-cKO cerebellum, the newborn Sufu-cKO cerebellum still express Ptch1 and exhibit reduced Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 protein levels (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). These key molecular differences may activate unique signaling networks in Sufu-cKO GNPs. Additionally, there are 18 FGF ligands which differ significantly in molecular features and binding specificities to distinct combinations of FGFR splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>). For example, unlike FGF2 which act in an autocrine manner, FGF5 can exert both autocrine and paracrine functions, bind different combinations of FGFRs, and is dynamically expressed in distinct regions of the developing cerebellum. Thus, in-depth studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms triggered by abnormally high levels of FGF5 in the developing cerebellum, particularly since FGF5 overexpression is known to drive cancer development and progression, including brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allerstorfer et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The high occurrence of <italic>SUFU</italic> mutations in infantile MB indicate the selective vulnerability of the developing cerebellum to neoplastic effects of SUFU dysfunction. Notably, the timing of SUFU LOF is critical; conditional deletion of SUFU in neural stem cells prior to granule neuron specification (using the hGFAP-Cre line) results in GNP hyperplasia, whereas conditional deletion of SUFU after granule neuron specification (using the Math1-Cre line) does not lead to these defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jiwani et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, SUFU-associated infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> is a likely consequence of defects stemming from early stages of granule neuron lineage specification at embryonic stages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, tumors initiated at embryonic stages are typically undetectable until several months after birth when tumorigenesis has significantly progressed. Thus, therapeutics for infantile MB must successfully curtail tumorigenic mechanisms at postnatal stages and minimally affect normal GNPs elsewhere in the cerebellum. Towards this goal, inhibiting localized FGF5 and FGF signaling activity may provide new paths toward the design of targeted treatments. Since we confirmed the occurrence of high FGF5 levels in a subset of infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> patients, FGF5 levels may be useful as a diagnostic biomarker for this patient population. This may predict the lack of efficacy of SHH-targeting compounds in curtailing tumor growth but could instead significantly impede cerebellar development. Importantly, detection of elevated FGF5 levels may identify patients who will be responsive to FGF-targeting treatments. Ultimately, we hope these studies facilitate the design of much needed precision medicines to address the distinct oncogenic mechanisms specifically and effectively in infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> patients while enabling normal progression of cerebellar development.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Mice carrying the floxed Sufu allele (Sufu<sub>fl</sub>) were kindly provided by Dr. Chi-Chung Hui (University of Toronto) and were genotyped as described elsewhere(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pospisilik et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>hGFAP-cre</italic> (Stock #004600) and Gli1-LacZ (Stock #008211) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Mice designated as controls did not carry the <italic>Cre</italic> transgene and may have either one of the following genotypes: <italic>Sufu</italic><sub><italic>fl/+</italic></sub> or <italic>Sufu</italic><sub><italic>fl/fl</italic></sub>. All mouse lines were maintained in mixed strains, and analysis included male and female pups from each age group, although sex differences were not included in data reporting. All animal protocols were in accordance to the National Institute of Health regulations and approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> treatment with FGFR inhibitor</title>
<p>The FGFR1-3 inhibitor, AZD4547 (Selleck Chemicals, #S2801) was dissolved sequentially in 4% Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO), 30% Polyethylene glycol (PEG), 5% Tween-80, and water to make a 1mM solution. 1 ul of 1mM AZD4547, or vehicle only as control, was injected into the lateral ventricle (â¼1 mm from the cerebellar midline) of pups for 5 days from P0/P1 using a 2.5 ml syringe (Model 62 RN; Hamilton Scientific). Pups remained with the mother until perfusion at P7 for analysis.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry and LacZ Staining</title>
<p>Perfusion, dissection, and immunofluorescence and LacZ staining were conducted according to standard protocols as previously described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yabut et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, P0/P1 brain tissues were fixed after dissection by direct immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and P7 and older postnatal brains fixed by intracardial perfusion followed by 2 h post-fixation. All fixed brains were cryoprotected a 15-30% sucrose gradient prior to cryosectioning. Cryostat sections were air dried and rinsed 3Ã in PBS plus 0.2%Triton before blocking for 1 h in 10% normal lamb serum diluted in PBS with 0.2% Triton to prevent nonspecific binding. A heat-induced antigen retrieval protocol was performed on selective immunohistochemistry using 10 lzM Citric Acid at pH 6.0. Primary antibodies were diluted in 10% serum diluted in PBS with 0.2% Triton containing 4â6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI); sections were incubated in primary antibody overnight at room temperature. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Pax6 (1:250 dilution; Cat. #: 901301, Biolegend); rabbit anti-NeuN (1:250 dilution; Cat. #: PA5-784-99, Invitrogen); mouse anti-Calretinin (1:250, Cat. #: AB5054, Millipore); rabbit anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (1:250 dilution; Cat. #: 4370, Cell Signaling); Î³H2AX (1:100 dilution; Cat. #: 05-636, Millipore); mouse anti-Ki67 (1:100 dilution; Cat. #: 550809 BD Biosciences) and cleaved-Caspase 3 (1:250 dilution; Cat. #: 9661S, Cell Signaling). To detect primary antibodies, we used species-specific Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500; Invitrogen) in 1X PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature, washed with 1X PBS, and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech).</p>
<sec id="s5c1">
<title>In Situ Hybridization</title>
<p>RNAScope ISH was conducted for FGF15 and Ptch1. RNAscope probes for Mm-FGF5 were designed commercially by the manufacturer (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Inc.). RNAScope Assay was performed using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit V2 according to manufacturerâs instructions. Detection of the probe was done with Opal 570 or Opal 520 reagent (Akoya Biosciences).</p>

<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>Western blot analyses were conducted according to standard protocols. Soluble extracts were loaded onto Criterion, 4-15% Tris-HCI 4 SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad), separated at 120V, and transferred to PVDF membrane at 30V for 2 hours or overnight at 4Â°C. Membranes were blocked with 3% milk/1X TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) or 5% BSA/1X TBS-T for 1hr at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4Â°C, and secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution; IR-Dye antibodies, LI-COR) for 1 hour at RT. Membranes were washed in 1X TBS-T and scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR). Primary antibodies were used as follows: rabbit anti-Gli1 (1:1000; Abcam); goat anti-Gli2 (1:1000; R&amp;D Systems), rabbit anti-Gli3 (1:100; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Pax6 (1:1000 dilution; Cat. #: 901301, Biolegend); rabbit anti-NeuN (1:1000 dilution; Cat. #: PA5-784-99, Invitrogen); rabbit anti-GABA A Receptor Î±6 (1:1000 dilution; Cat. #. PA5-77403, GABRA6; Invitrogen), and a-Tubulin (1:5000 dilution; Cat. #: ab4074, Abcam). Quantification and analysis were conducted using the Odyssey Image Studio Software (LI-COR). Protein levels were normalized to GAPDH protein levels. Levels of NeuN and GABRA6 were quantified in correlation with Pax6 levels (NeuN/Pax6 or GABRA6/Pax6) to determine the proportion of Pax6+ cells expressing mature granule neuron markers.</p>

<title>Image Analysis and Acquisition</title>
<p>Images were acquired using a Nikon E600 microscope equipped with a QCapture Pro camera (QImaging), Zeiss Axioscan Z.1 (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA) using the Zen 2 blue edition software (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA), or the Nikon Ti inverted microscope with CSU-W1 large field of view confocal and Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera. All images were imported in tiff or jpeg format. Brightness, contrast, and background were adjusted equally for the entire image between controls and mutant using the âBrightness/Contrastâ and âLevelsâ function from âImage/Adjustmentâ options in Adobe Photoshop or NIH ImageJ without any further modification. NIH Image J was used to threshold background levels between controls and mutant tissues to quantify fluorescence labeling. To quantify cell density, positively labeled cells within defined EGL regions, as defined in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, were counted. Measurements were obtained and averaged from 2-3 20 lzm thick and histologically matched sections encompassing the cerebellar midline (vermis).</p>

<p>This study provides potentially highly <bold>valuable</bold> new insight into the role of Fgf signalling in SUFU mutation-linked cerebellar tumors and indicates novel therapeutic interventions via inhibition of Fgf signalling.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>SUFU modulates Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling and is frequently mutated in the B-subtype of SHH-driven medulloblastoma. The B-subtype occurs mostly in infants, is often metastatic, and lacks specific treatment. Yabut et al. found that Fgf5 was highly expressed in the B-subtype of SHH-driven medulloblastoma by examining a published microarray expression dataset. They then investigated how Fgf5 functions in the cerebellum of mice that have embryonic Sufu loss of function. This loss was induced using the hGFAP-cre transgene, which is expressed in multiple cell types in the developing cerebellum, including granule neuron precursors (GNPs) derived from the rhombic lip. By measuring the area of Pax6+ cells in the external granule cell layer (EGL) of Sufu-cKO mice at postnatal day 0, they find Pax6+ cells occupy a larger area in the posterior lobe adjacent to the secondary fissure, which is poorly defined. They show that Fgf5 RNA and phosphoErk1/2 immunostaining are also higher in the same disrupted region. Some of the phosphoErk1/2+ cells are proliferative in the Sufu-cKO. Western blot analysis of Gli proteins that modulate SHH signaling found reduced expression and absence of Gli1 activity in the region of cerebellar dysgenesis in Sufu-cKO mice. This suggests the GNP expansion in this region is independent of SHH signaling. Amazingly, intraventricular injection of the FGFR1-2 antagonist AZD4547 from P0-4 and examined histologically at P7 found the treatment restored cytoarchitecture in the cerebella of Sufu-cKO mice. This is further supported by NeuN immunostaining in the internal granule cell layer, which labels mature, non-diving neurons, and KI67 immunostaining, indicating dividing cells, and primarily found in the EGL. The mice were treated beginning at a timepoint when cerebellar cytoarchitecture was shown to be disrupted and it is indistinguishable from control following treatment. Figure 3 presents the most convincing and exciting data in this manuscript.</p>
<p>Sufu-cKO do not readily develop cerebellar tumors. The authors detected phosphorylated H2AX immunostaining, which labels double-strand breaks, in some cells in the EGL in regions of cerebellar dysgenesis in the Sufu-cKO, as was cleaved Caspase 3, a marker of apoptosis. P53, downstream of the double-strand break pathway, the protein was reduced in Sufu-cKO cerebellum. Genetically removing p53 from the Sufu-cKO cerebellum resulted in cerebellar tumors in 2-month old mice. The Sufu;p53-dKO cerebella at P0 lacked clear foliation, and the secondary fissure, even more so than the Sufu-cKO. Fgf5 RNA and signaling (pERK1/2) were also expressed ectopically.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the paper are largely supported by the data, but some data analysis need to be clarified and extended.</p>
<p>(1) The rationale for examining Fgf5 in medulloblastoma is not sufficiently convincing. The authors previously reported that Fgf15 was upregulated in neocortical progenitors of mice with conditional loss of Sufu (PMID: 32737167). In Figure 1, the authors report FGF5 expression is higher in SHH-type medulloblastoma, especially the beta and gamma subtypes mostly found in infants. These data were derived from a genome-wide dataset and are shown without correction for multiple testing, including other Fgfs. Showing the expression of other Fgfs with FDR correction would better substantiate their choice or moving this figure to later in the manuscript as support for their mouse investigations would be more convincing.</p>
<p>(2) The Sufu-cKO cerebellum lacks a clear anchor point at the secondary fissure and foliation is disrupted in the central and posterior lobes. It would be helpful for the authors to review Sudarov &amp; Joyner (PMID: 18053187) for nomenclature specific to the developing cerebellum.</p>
<p>(3) The metrics used to quantify cerebellar perimeter and immunostaining are not sufficiently described. It is unclear whether the individual points in the bar graph represent a single section from independent mice, or multiple sections from the same mice. For example, in Figures 2B-D. This also applies to Figure 3C-D.</p>
<p>(4) The data on Fgf5 RNA expression presented in Figure 2E are not sufficiently convincing. The perimeter and cytoarchitecture of the cerebellum are difficult to see and the higher magnification shown in 2F should be indicated in 2E.</p>
<p>(5) The data presented in Figure 3 are not sufficiently convincing. The number of cells double positive for pErk and KI67 (Figure 3B) are difficult to see and appear to be few, suggesting the quantification may be unreliable.</p>
<p>(6) The data presented in Figure 4F-J would be more convincing with quantification. The Sufu;p53-dKO appears to have a thickened EGL across the entire vermis perimeter, and very little foliation, relative to control and single cKO cerebella. This is a more widespread effect than the more localized foliation disruption in the Sufu-cKO.</p>
<p>(7) Figure 5 does not convincingly summarize the results. Blue and purple cells in sagittal cartoon are not defined. Which cells express Fgf5 (or other Fgfs) has not been determined. The yellow cells are not defined in relation to the initial cartoon on the left.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mutations in SUFU are implicated in SHH medulloblastoma (MB). SUFU modulates Shh signaling in a context-dependent manner, making its role in MB pathology complex and not fully understood. This study reports that elevated FGF5 levels are associated with a specific subtype of SHH MB, particularly in pediatric cases. The authors demonstrate that Sufu deletion in a mouse model leads to abnormal proliferation of granule cell precursors (GCPs) at the secondary fissure (region B), correlating with increased Fgf5 expression. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of FGFR restores normal cerebellar development in Sufu mutant mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The identification of increased FGF5 in subsets of MB is novel and a key strength of the paper.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study appears incomplete despite the potential significance of these findings. The current paper does not fully establish the causal relationship between Fgf5 and abnormal cerebellar development, nor does it clarify its connection to SUFU-related MB. Some conclusions seem overstated, and the central question of whether FGFR inhibition can prevent tumor formation remains untested.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The interaction between FGF signaling and SHH-mediated GNP expansion in MB, particularly in the context of Sufu LoF, has just begun to be understood. The manuscript by Yabut et al. establishes a connection between ectopic FGF5 expression and GNP over-expansion in a late-stage embryonic Sufu LoF model. The data provided links region-specific interaction between aberrant FGF5 signaling with the SHH subtype of medulloblastoma. New data from Yabut et al. suggest that ectopic FGF5 expression correlates with GNP expansion near the secondary fissure in Sufu LoF cerebella. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of FGF signaling inhibits GNP proliferation. Interestingly, the data indicate that the timing of conditional Sufu deletion (E13.5 using the hGFAP-Cre line) results in different outcomes compared to later deletion (using Math1-cre line, Jiwani et al., 2020). This study provides significant insights into the molecular mechanisms driving GNP expansion in SHH subgroup MB, particularly in the context of Sufu LoF. It highlights the potential of targeting FGF5 signaling as a therapeutic strategy. Additionally, the research offers a model for better understanding MB subtypes and developing targeted treatments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>One notable strength of this study is the extraction and analysis of ectopic FGF5 expression from a subset of MB patient tumor samples. This translational aspect of the study enhances its relevance to human disease. By correlating findings from mouse models with patient data, the authors strengthen the validity of their conclusions and highlight the potential clinical implications of targeting FGF5 in MB therapy.</p>
<p>The data convincingly show that FGFR signaling activation drives GNP proliferation in Sufu, conditional knockout models. This finding is supported by robust experimental evidence, including pharmacological blockade of FGF signaling, which effectively inhibits GNP proliferation. The clear demonstration of a functional link between FGFR signaling and GNP expansion underscores the potential of FGFR as a therapeutic target in SHH subgroup medulloblastoma.</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated the inhibitory effect of FGF2 on tumor cell proliferation in certain MB types, such as the ptc mutant (Fogarty et al., 2006)(Yaguchi et al., 2009). Findings in this manuscript provide additional support suggesting multiple roles for FGF signaling in cerebellar patterning and development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the GEO dataset analysis, where FGF5 expression is extracted, the reporting of the P-value lacks detail on the statistical methods used, such as whether an ANOVA or t-test was employed. Providing comprehensive statistical methodologies is crucial for assessing the rigor and reproducibility of the results. The absence of this information raises concerns about the robustness of the statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Another concern is related to the controls used in the study. Cre recombinase induces double-strand DNA breaks within the loxP sites, and the control mice did not carry the Cre transgene (as stated in the Method section), while Sufu-cKO mice did. This discrepancy necessitates an additional control group to evaluate the effects of Cre-induced double-strand breaks on phosphorylated H2AX-DSB signaling. Including this control would strengthen the validity of the findings by ensuring that observed effects are not artifacts of Cre recombinase activity.</p>
<p>Although the use of the hGFAP-Cre line allows genetic access to the late embryonic stage, this also targets multiple celltypes, including both GNPs and cerebellar glial cells. However, the authors focus primarily on GNPs without fully addressing the potential contributions of neuron-glial interaction. This oversight could limit the understanding of the broader cellular context in which FGF signaling influences tumor development.</p>

<p>To assess FGF5 (ENSG00000138675) expression in MB tissues, we used Geo2R (Barrett et al., 2013) to analyze published human MB subtype expression arrays from accession no. GSE85217 (Cavalli et al., 2017). GEO2R is an interactive web tool that compares expression levels of genes of interest (GOI) between sample groups in the GEO series using original submitter-supplied processed data tables. We entered the GOI Ensembl ID and organized data sets according to age and MB subgroup or MBSHH subtype classifications. GEO2R results presented gene expression levels as a table ordered by FDR-adjusted (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg) p-values, with significance level cut-off at 0.05, processed by GEO2Râs built-in limma statistical test. Resulting data were subsequently exported into Prism (GraphPad). We generated scatter plots presenting FGF5 expression levels across all MB subgroups (Figure 1A) and MBSHH subtypes (Figure 1D). We performed additional statistical analyses to compare FGF5 expression levels between MB subgroups and MBSHH subtypes and graphed these data as violin plots (Figure 1B, 1C, and 1E). For these analyses, we used one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidakâs multiple comparisons test, single pooled variance. <italic>P</italic> value â¤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Graphs display the mean Â± standard error of the mean (SEM).</p>

<p>Expression of the 21 known FGF ligands were also analyzed. Many FGFs did not exhibit differential expression levels in MBSHH compared to other MB subgroups, such as with FGF12 in Figure 1. FGF5, FGF10, and FGF19 (the human orthologue of mouse FGF15) all showed specific upregulation in MBSHH compared to other MB subgroups (Author response image 1), supporting our previous observations that FGF15 is a downstream target of SHH signaling (Yabut et al., 2020), as the reviewer pointed out. However, further stratification of MBSHH patient data revealed that only FGF5 specifically showed upregulation in infants with MBSHH (MBSHHb and MBSHHg Author response image 2) indicating a more prominent role for FGF5 in the developing cerebellum and driver of MBSHH tumorigenesis in this dynamic environment.</p>

<p>The revised manuscript will include the following detailed explanation of the statistical analyses of the GEO dataset:</p>
<p>For the analysis of expression values of FGF5 (ENSG00000138675), we obtained these values using Geo2R (Barrett et al., 2013), which directly analyze published human MB subtype expression arrays from accession no. GSE85217 (Cavalli et al., 2017). GEO2R is an interactive web tool that compares expression levels of genes of interest (GOI) between sample groups in the GEO series using original submitter-supplied processed data tables.

For these analyses, we used one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidakâs multiple comparisons test, single pooled variance. <italic>P</italic> value â¤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Graphs display the mean Â± standard error of the mean (SEM). Sample sizes were:</p>

<p>Another concern is related to the controls used in the study. Cre recombinase induces double-strand DNA breaks within the loxP sites, and the control mice did not carry the Cre transgene (as stated in the Method section), while Sufu-cKO mice did. This discrepancy necessitates an additional control group to evaluate the effects of Cre-induced double-strand breaks on phosphorylated H2AX-DSB signaling. Including this control would strengthen the validity of the findings by ensuring that observed effects are not artifacts of Cre recombinase activity.</p>

<p>The breeding scheme we used to generate homozygous SUFU conditional mutants will not generate pups carrying only hGFAP-Cre. Thus, we are unable to compare expression of gH2AX expression in littermates that do not carry loxP sites. The reviewer is correct in pointing out the possibility of Cre recombinase activity inducing double-strand breaks on its own. However, it is likely that any hGFAP-Cre induced double-strand breaks does not sufficiently cause the phenotypes we observed in homozygous mutants (Sufu-cKO) mice because the cerebellum of mice carry heterozygous SUFU mutations (hGFAP-Cre;Sufu-fl/+) do not display the profound cerebellar phenotypes observed in Sufu-cKO mice. We cannot rule out, however, any undetectable abnormalities that could be present which may require further analyses.</p>

<p>Although the use of the hGFAP-Cre line allows genetic access to the late embryonic stage, this also targets multiple celltypes, including both GNPs and cerebellar glial cells. However, the authors focus primarily on GNPs without fully addressing the potential contributions of neuron-glial interaction. This oversight could limit the understanding of the broader cellular context in which FGF signaling influences tumor development.</p>

<p>The reviewer is correct in that hGFAP-Cre also targets other cell types, such as cerebellar glial cells, which are generated when Cre-expression has begun. It is possible that cerebellar glial cell development is also compromised in Sufu-cKO mice and may disrupt neuron-glial interaction, due to or independently of FGF signaling. In-depth studies are required to interrogate how loss of SUFU specifically affect development of cerebellar glial cells and influence their cellular interactions in the developing cerebellum.</p>
