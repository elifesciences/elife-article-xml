<title>Abstract</title><p>The assembly and operation of neural circuits in the brain rely on the coordination and balance of excitatory and inhibitory activities. Inhibitory synapses are key regulators of the functional balance of neural circuits. However, due to the diversity of inhibitory presynaptic neurons, the complex composition of postsynaptic receptor subunits and the lack of typical postsynaptic dense structure, there are relatively few studies on the regulatory mechanisms for inhibitory synaptic structure and function, and insufficient understanding of the cellular and molecular abnormalities of inhibitory synapses in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we report a crucial role for endophilin A1 in inhibitory synapses. We show that endophilin A1 directly interacts with the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin in excitatory neurons, and promotes organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic density and synaptic recruitment/stabilization of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors via its plasma membrane association and actin polymerization promoting activities. Loss of endophilin A1 by gene knockout in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells weakens inhibitory synaptic transmission and causes imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory function of neural circuits, leading to increased susceptibility to epilepsy. Our findings identify endophilin A1 as an iPSD component and provide new insights into the organization and stabilization of inhibitory postsynapses to maintain E/I balance as well as the pathogenesis of epilepsy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activities of neural circuits are tightly orchestrated in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sakimoto et al., 2021</xref>). The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity is implicated in many neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Canitano and Pallagrosi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Canitano and Palumbi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Foss-Feig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fritschy, 2008</xref>). In the brain, in contrast to asymmetric excitatory synapses formed between axonal boutons and dendritic postsynaptic structures with thick disc-shaped PSD, inhibitory synapses are symmetric and are constituted of the presynaptic terminal from diverse interneurons and the postsynaptic plasma membrane with thin sheet-like PSD where receptor complexes are anchored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Favuzzi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mody and Pearce, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tao et al., 2018</xref>). Although the formation, maturation and plasticity of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses are vitally important for neural circuit functioning, much more research efforts have been focused on the regulatory mechanisms governing excitatory synaptic structure and function. The mechanisms by which inhibitory synapses are constructed in the brain and fine-tuned in response to neural activity remain largely unexplored.</p>
<p>The γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs), major targets of antiseizure drugs, are heteropentameric chloride channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission at inhibitory synapses in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Scott and Aricescu, 2019</xref>). Several neuropathologies are characterized by alterations in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking, synaptic E/I ratio and neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sakimoto et al., 2021</xref>). At the inhibitory postsynaptic site, synaptic localization and functioning of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs requires trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules, submembranous scaffold proteins and intracellular signaling proteins. Gephyrin is a master organizer of iPSD, which self-assembles into planar lattices beneath the plasma membrane and anchors GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs or glycine receptors (GlyRs) to the postsynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">George et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kasaragod and Schindelin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kirsch et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014</xref>). Collybistin, a membrane lipid-binding protein, functions in recruitment of gephyrin and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to the plasma membrane by interacting with gephyrin, the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin-2 (NL2) and the α2 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kalscheuer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saiepour et al., 2010</xref>). The transmembrane protein Shisa7 binds GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and regulates their trafficking, synaptic abundance and functional properties via binding to protein(s) other than gephyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, mechanisms governing the assembly, recruitment and maintenance of various inhibitory synaptic components remain largely enigmatic.</p>
<p>The majority of inhibitory synapses are formed on the dendritic shaft, or around the cell body of excitatory principal neurons where both actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are present underneath the plasma membrane. Through direct interaction with polymerized tubulin, gephyrin organizes the iPSD by anchoring the GlyRs and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to the microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Parato and Bartolini, 2021</xref>). Notably, although small F-actin patches are observed within the dendritic shaft where the majority of inhibitory synapses are assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">van Bommel et al., 2019</xref>), role(s) of the actin cytoskeleton in the organization and maintenance of inhibitory synapses is still unclear.</p>
<p>Endophilin A1 (EndoA1) is a member of the endophilin A protein family characterized by an amino (N)-terminal membrane-binding N-BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain and a carboxyl (C)-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. The gene encoding endophilin A1 (<italic>EndoA1</italic>, gene name <italic>sh3gl2</italic>) is almost exclusively expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ringstad et al., 1997</xref>), and has been implicated in epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Corponi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Germer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yu et al., 2018b</xref>). In excitatory synapses, endophilin A1 functions in synaptic vesicle recycling and autophagosome formation at the axon terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bademosi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Murdoch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ringstad et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schuske et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Soukup et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Verstreken et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>), and regulates the morphogenesis, maturation, and acute structural plasticity of dendritic spines by promoting actin polymerization via its effector protein p140Cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies reported that the double knockout (KO) mice of <italic>EndoA1</italic> and <italic>EndoA2</italic> exhibit spontaneous epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>). However, <italic>EndoA1</italic> depletion only causes a slight decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). As E/I imbalance is caused by changes in either excitatory or inhibitory activity, or both, we were prompted to investigate the biological function of endophilin A1 in the inhibitory synapses. In this study, we show that endophilin A1 interacts with gephyrin and localizes to GABAergic postsynapses. Via its membrane-binding and actin polymerization-promoting activities, endophilin A1 facilitates organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic machinery. Loss of endophilin A1 causes impairment of inhibitory synaptic transmission, E/I imbalance and aggravation of epileptic susceptibility.</p>

<title>Ablation of endophilin A1 causes E/I imbalance and increases epilepsy susceptibility</title>
<p>Previous studies found that <italic>EndoA1</italic> and <italic>EndoA2</italic> double knockout (KO) mice exhibit spontaneous epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that endophilin A1 and A2 are involved in maintaining the E/I balance. However, another study reported that the protein levels of endophilin A1 were higher in temporal neocortex neurons of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yu et al., 2018b</xref>). Moreover, in a chemical kindling mouse model of epilepsy, in which mice are chronically induced with the GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dhir, 2012</xref>), endophilin A1 was also upregulated in the hippocampus and adjacent temporal cortex, and silencing its expression in the hippocampal CA3 region reduced PTZ-induced seizure susceptibility and severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yu et al., 2018b</xref>). To investigate the role of endophilin A1 in epilepsy, we determined the impact of <italic>EndoA1</italic> gene ablation on chemical kindling of pan-neural <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>) with PTZ at a sub-convulsive dose of 25 mg/kg. Compared with the wild-type, PTZ-induced epileptic behaviors were significantly exacerbated in <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref> and Video S1).</p>

<p>We previously found that <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO caused a slight decrease in the amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSC) and a significant attenuation of long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). As imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in neuronal circuits is implicated in epilepsy, we then determined whether loss of endophilin A1 in excitatory neurons affects the E/I ratio by electrophysiological analysis. To this end, we eliminated the <italic>EndoA1</italic> gene in pyramidal neurons by stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing CaMKIIα promoter-driven Cre recombinase into the hippocampal CA1 region of <italic>EndoA1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Whole-cell patch clamp recording of CA1 pyramidal cells indicated that, while the eEPSC and its paired-pulse ratio were not significantly changed, the evoked inhibitory postsynaptic current (eIPSC), not its PPR, was decreased in the <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO neurons, resulting in a significant increase in the E/I ratio (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-I</xref>). Of note, neither the frequency nor the amplitude of miniature EPSCs (mEPSC) or miniature IPSCs (mIPSC) was altered in <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J-O</xref>). Moreover, neither fast mIPSCs (perisomatic events: &lt; 2.8 ms) nor slow mIPSCs (distal dendritic events: &gt; 2.8 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Miles et al., 1996</xref>) were affected by <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO (Figure S1), indicating that presynaptic quantal release of soma- or dendrite-targeting inhibitory synapses is normal. Taken together, these data indicate that endophilin A1 in hippocampal pyramidal neurons functions in inhibitory synaptic transmission to maintain E/I balance.</p>

<title>Endophilin A1 is required for the formation and stabilization of inhibitory synapses</title>
<p>Diminished eIPSC in <italic>EndoA1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> pyramidal neurons prompted us to determine the role of endophilin A1 in inhibitory synapses by immunofluorescence staining of brain sections from <italic>EndoA1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.

In line with the data from immunofluorescent labeling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and S2), decreased endogenous PSD95 or gephyrin clusters at synapses were also visualized by the recombinant probes, PSD95.FingR-eGFP or mRuby2-gephyrin.FingR, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bensussen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gross et al., 2013</xref>), in <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO neurons in the CA1 region at P21 (Figure S3A-D).

<title>Endophilin A1 localizes to the iPSD and augments the organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic machinery</title>
<p>To substantiate the role of postsynaptic endophilin A1 in the assembly of inhibitory synapses and exclude the impacts of presynaptic endophilin A1 and its depletion on early embryonic development, we determined the effects of endophilin A1 KO on inhibitory and excitatory synapses in cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons during late developmental stages. As the expression levels of GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 are highly heterogeneous in individual cultured neurons (Figure S4A), we determined the effect of Cre-mediated <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO on surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 in <italic>EndoA1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>hippocampal neurons by immunofluorescence staining. Whilst no changes in surface GluA1 was detected, the fluorescence signal intensity and number of surface GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 clusters were largely lower in dendrites of <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO neurons, which was rescued by re-expression of endophilin A1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>). We further examined the total and surface levels of synaptic proteins by immunoblotting. Biotinylation assay of surface proteins revealed that, compared with wild-type, although there was no change in total levels of synaptic proteins in <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO pyramidal neurons, the surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs but not NL2 or the NR1 subunit of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor was significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E,F</xref>).

<p>Next we sought to determine the molecular function of endophilin A1 in inhibitory synapses at the cellular level. By immunofluorescence staining and super-resolution microscopy of hippocampal neurons in dissociated culture, we observed partial colocalization of endophilin A1 with gephyrin as well as surface GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 in dendrites of hippocampal neurons, and juxtaposition or partial colocalization of endophilin A1 and VGAT puncta (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-I</xref> and Video S2-4). We further detected the localization of endophilin A1 to inhibitory synapses by co-immunostaining with both pre- and post-synaptic markers (Figure. S4B and Video 5). Quantitative analysis of super-resolution localization maps revealed that ∼ 47 % puncta of gephyrin or Bassoon were proximal to endophilin A1 (Figure. S4G, <italic>n</italic> = 14), with a mean distance between endophilin A1- and gephyrin-positive pixels of ∼ 120 nm, or between endophilin A1- and Bassoon-positive pixels of ∼ 130 nm (Figure. S4C-F). These results indicate that endophilin A1 localizes to not only ePSD but also iPSD. Therefore, we speculated that endophilin A1 acted as a component of iPSD. Previous studies reported that synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs contain the γ2 subunit along with α and β subunits (e.g., α1β2γ2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Scott and Aricescu, 2019</xref>). The γ2 subunit is essential for receptor clustering at the synapse, mediated by interactions with scaffold proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Essrich et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) of endogenous proteins in membrane fractions from mouse brain lysates with antibodies against GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 detected not only the known iPSD components γ2, NL2 and gephyrin, but also endophilin A1, and vice versa (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). Of note, loss of endophilin A1 caused decreases in levels of GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 and gephyrin but not NL2 in anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 immunoprecipitates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Further, immunoblotting of synaptosome fractions revealed that the levels of GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 and gephyrin were reduced at synapses in adult <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>). Together, these data support that endophilin A1 functions at the iPSD to promote the assembly and/or stabilization of the GABAergic postsynaptic machinery.</p>

<p>We subsequently sought to investigate the mechanistic role of endophilin A1 in the clustering of inhibitory postsynaptic proteins.

<p>Gephyrin is the major scaffold protein which interacts with the intracellular domains of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and anchors them at the inhibitory postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Essrich et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kneussel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tretter et al., 2008</xref>). The cell adhesion molecule NL2 drives postsynaptic assembly at perisomatic inhibitory synapses via interaction with gephyrin and the membrane lipid-binding protein collybistin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>). We speculated that endophilin A1 functions in the assembly of iPSD via interaction with the scaffold and/or intercellular adhesion proteins. To determine which inhibitory synaptic protein(s) interacts with endophilin A1, we performed coIP from HEK293T cells transiently expressing endophilin A1 and NL2, or gephyrin, and detected interaction of endophilin A1with gephyrin but not NL2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Moreover, coIP from mouse brain lysates corroborated interaction between endophilin A1 and gephyrin but not GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 or γ2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Further, neither endophilin A2 nor A3 interacted with gephyrin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, although the expression levels of gephyrin were not affected by ablation of <italic>EndoA1</italic>, its distribution in the PSD fraction was decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>). In dendrites of mature cultured hippocampal neurons following <italic>EndoA1</italic> depletion, the signal intensity and number of gephyrin.FingR-eGFP clusters were also significantly attenuated, with no obvious changes in PSD95.FingR-eGFP clusters (Figure S5A-D), which was consistent with the reduced gephyrin but unaltered PSD95 labeled by antibodies in brain slice of mature <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and S2), Moreover, immunofluorescence staining revealed a decrease in the clustering of gephyrin across the soma, the axon initial segment (AIS), and dendrites (Figure S5E-H). The gephyrin clustering phenotype was rescued by expression of endophilin A1 but not endophilin A2 or A3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G,H</xref>), suggesting that their functions at the inhibitory postsynapses are not redundant. Conversely, overexpression of endophilin A1 caused an increase in the mean signal intensity and number of gephyrin puncta in the soma and dendrites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I,J</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that endophilin A1 interacts with the scaffold protein gephyrin and facilitates its clustering at inhibitory postsynapses.</p>
<p>At the submembraneous postsynaptic density, gephyrin self assembles via the N-terminal G and C-terminal E domains to provide scaffold for inhibitory postsynapses and anchors GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to the postsynaptic sites.

Moreover, overexpression of endophilin A1 also enhanced clustering of GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 in the soma and dendrites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D,E</xref>).

<p>To further understand the mechanism by which endophilin A1 regulates the assembly and function of inhibitory postsynapses, next we attempted domain mapping of the endophilin A1-gephyrin interaction. To this end, we generated a series of truncation and internal deletion mutants for endophilin A1 or gephyrin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). For those which did not express in mammalian cells, we determined their interaction with gephyrin by in vitro binding assays with recombinant proteins. None of the truncation or internal deletion mutants lost the ability to bind to gephyrin, and deletion of neither the BAR nor the SH3 domain weakened the binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G,H</xref>), suggesting that they are involved in the interaction with gephyrin.

Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">van Bommel et al., 2019</xref>), we observed large patches of F-actin labeled by LifeAct-mCherry in spines and small puncta in dendritic shafts that exhibited partial colocalization with or adjoined gephyrin in cultured hippocampal neurons by super-resolution microscopy (Figure S6A and Video S6). We then determined the impact of F-actin depolymerization on gephyrin-labeled iPSD and γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in cultured hippocampal neurons. Treatment of mature neurons with nocodazole, a microtubule depolymerizing reagent, for one hour (short-term) or two hours (long-term), caused decreases in the number of both PSD95 and gephyrin puncta (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-D</xref>), which was in good agreement with previous findings that microtubule dynamics regulates the spatial organization of both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jaworski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kirsch and Betz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kirsch et al., 1991</xref>). Short-term or long-term incubation with latrunculin A, which disrupts actin polymerization, also caused decreases in the number of both ePSD and iPSD puncta (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-D</xref>), indicating that actin polymerization also contributes to the stabilization of the iPSD. We then tested the effect of actin depolymerization on GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering and found that, long-term but not short-term latrunculin A application caused a reduction in the number of GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 puncta in dendrites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E-H</xref>), this finding supported the observation that the decrease in gephyrin cluster preceded the reduction in GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 receptor cluster following latrunculin A treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>). In addition, colocalization analysis revealed less recruitment of γ2 to gephyrin puncta even after short-term drug application, without changes in γ2 clustering (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J,K</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that actin polymerization is essential for the stabilization of iPSD and anchoring of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to the postsynaptic sites.</p>

<title>Both the membrane-binding and p140Cap-binding capacities of endophilin A1 are indispensable for its function at the inhibitory postsynapses</title>
<p>At the excitatory synapse, the plasma membrane-associated endophilin A1 regulates the morphogenesis, maturation and structural plasticity of dendritic spines by promoting branched actin polymerization underneath the postsynaptic membrane via its interaction with the cytoskeleton regulator p140Cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Having established the requirement for both endophilin A1 and the actin cytoskeleton in the assembly and stabilization of the inhibitory postsynaptic structure, we speculated that regulation of inhibitory postsynapse assembly by endophilin A1 necessitated its plasma membrane-binding and actin polymerization-promoting activities. Silencing p140Cap expression in postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells by shRNA-mediated knockdown caused decreases in the clustering of gephyrin puncta in dendrites, which was restored by overexpression of p140Cap (Figure S6B, C), suggesting that p140Cap-mediated actin polymerization is required for the assembly of iPSD in postsynaptic neurons. However, compared with mere depletion of endophilin A1, p140Cap knockdown did not further attenuate the clustering of gephyrin in <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO neurons (Figure S6D, E). Moreover, overexpression of p140Cap did not rescue the iPSD phenotype in <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A,B</xref>), suggesting that p140Cap-enhanced actin polymerization promotes the organization of iPSD through endophilin A1-mediated pathway. Indeed, overexpression of neither the membrane-binding deficient (KKK-EEE) nor the p140Cap-binding deficient (Y343A) mutant of endophilin A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang et al., 2021</xref>) could rescue the iPSD defect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Consistently, neither p140Cap nor the endophilin A1 loss-of-function mutants could rescue the GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 clustering phenotype in <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that both plasma membrane association and actin polymerization-promoting activities are required for endophilin A1 to promote the assembly of the inhibitory postsynaptic machinery.</p>

<p>Next, we determined the mechanistic role of endophilin A1 in vivo by rescuing the epilepsy susceptibility caused by <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO.

All together, these data indicate that endophilin A1 contributes to the structure and function of inhibitory synapses by promoting the submembrane assembly of iPSD and synaptic localization of the GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, thereby maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory activities in neural circuits (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although collybistin is implicated in plasma membrane recruitment and clustering of gephyrin and GABA<sub>A</sub>R α2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saiepour et al., 2010</xref>), studies of collybistin KO mice showed that the GABA<sub>A</sub>R α3 subunit promotes gephyrin-mediated formation of inhibitory synapses in the absence of collybistin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wagner et al., 2021</xref>), raising the possibility that formation of a subset of GABAergic synapses requires gephyrin-interacting membrane-associated proteins other than collybistin. In the present study, we identify endophilin A1 as a novel binding partner for gephyrin and demonstrate that it promotes the assembly of inhibitory synapses and clustering of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at the iPSD. Loss of endophilin A1 activity causes impairment of inhibitory synaptic transmission in neuronal circuits and increases susceptibility to seizures. In the central nervous system, inhibitory interneurons are highly diverse in morphologies, molecular profiles and physiological functions. Presynaptic terminals from different types of interneurons target distinct subcellular compartments in postsynaptic pyramidal neurons where GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors of specific subunit compositions are located. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons usually contact the soma and proximal dendrites, whereas somatostatin-expressing (SST+) interneurons mainly innervate the dendrites of pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>). Although different inhibitory synapses localized in different subcellular compartments of postsynaptic neurons have distinct properties and express a diversity of synaptic proteins, gephyrin remains a core postsynaptic component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Favuzzi et al., 2019</xref>). Our study revealed that endophilin A1 promotes the clustering of gephyrin in all subcellular compartments of pyramidal neurons, indicating that endophilin A1 functions in the organization of inhibitory postsynapses innervated by various presynaptic interneurons.</p>
<p>Among the endophilin A proteins, endophilin A1 is the most abundant in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>). Although they have redundant roles in physiological or pathological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>), endophilin A1, but not A2 or A3, promotes spine morphogenesis and excitatory postsynaptic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we uncover a previously unanticipated role for endophilin A1 at GABAergic synapses. By deleting endophilin As in specific neuron subtypes, we found that endophilin A1 regulates GABAergic postsynaptic compartments. Endophilin A1, rather than A2 or A3, interacts with gephyrin and modulates the inhibitory postsynaptic machinery. Although endophilin A1 might function redundantly with other endophilin As in synaptic vesicle recycling at the presynaptic site, it participates in the organization or reorganization of postsynaptic structures through specific binding to postsynaptic proteins, a function that cannot be fully replaced by other endophilin As at both excitatory and inhibitory postsynapses.</p>
<p>The membrane lipid-binding protein collybistin interacts with the trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecule NL-2 to recruit gephyrin and GABA<sub>A</sub>R α2 to the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kalscheuer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saiepour et al., 2010</xref>). Adamtsl3 secreted from presynapses binds to the transmembrane protein DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) and controls its synaptic localization, which is required for the maintenance of GABAergic synapses in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cramer et al., 2023</xref>). Anchoring of the α5 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>R to the actin cytoskeleton through radixin, an actin-binding protein, facilitates its clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Loebrich et al., 2006</xref>). These findings underscore the necessity for investigation of mechanism(s) regulating the plasma membrane-iPSD-actin cytoskeleton interaction. As membrane-binding and actin polymerization-promoting activities of endophilin A1 are both required for its function in enhancing iPSD formation and γ2–containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering to iPSD, we propose that membrane-bound endophilin A1 promotes postsynaptic assembly by coordinating the plasma membrane tethering of the postsynaptic protein complex and its stabilization with the actin cytomatrix (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, clustering of β2/3 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is independent of the actin or microtubule cytoskeleton in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allison et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kasaragod et al., 2022</xref>). Given that synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are composed of distinct subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kasaragod et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Koh et al., 2023</xref>), these findings indicate that the actin cytoskeleton plays distinct roles in the clustering and possibly dynamic changes in the subunit composition and subcompartmental localization of different types of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Of note, the subcellular distribution of gephyrin, which has a tubulin-binding motif, is not affected by depolymerization of F-actin or microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allison et al., 2000</xref>). Overall, the discrepancy in data about the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in inhibitory synapses may be due to differences in drug concentration, treatment time, receptor subtypes and neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mody and Pearce, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sexton et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, the impaired clustering of gephyrin and GABA<sub>A</sub> γ2 by F-actin depolymerization underscores the essential role of F-actin in the assembly and stabilization of the inhibitory postsynaptic machinery. Membrane-bound endophilin A1 promotes F-actin polymerization beneath the plasma membrane through its interaction with p140Cap, an F-actin regulatory protein, thereby facilitating and/or stabilizing the clustering of gephyrin and γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at postsynapses.</p>
<p>The number of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is subject to alterations not only during development and neuronal plasticity but also during pathological processes such as epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nusser et al., 1998</xref>). Synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are recruited directly from extrasynaptic pools following exocytosis, and their endocytosis occurs exclusively at extrasynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bogdanov et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, lateral diffusion of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs between synaptic and extrasynaptic sites and their iPSD anchoring are very important for their synaptic distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>). In good agreement with the finding that GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs stabilization at synapses depends on gephyrin clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jacob et al., 2005</xref>), we found that decreases in gephyrin clustering precedes the reduction in surface GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs following F-actin depolymerization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). As the core scaffold protein in iPSD, gephyrin is highly enriched at the inhibitory postsynaptic sites and drives the formation of iPSD sheets via phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2021</xref>). As binding of gephyrin by its partner proteins inhibits the iPSD condensate formation via autoinhibition of the multivalent interactions between its E domain and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hoffmann and Milovanovic, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), it is conceivable that endophilin A1 binding not only tethers the scaffold protein to the plasma membrane, but also releases it from the autoinhibitory conformation to facilitate the phase separation of the gephyrin-receptor complexes. Whether the activity of endophilin A1 is regulated by neuronal activity to participate in the structural and functional remodeling of iPSD awaits further investigation.</p>
<p>At the presynaptic site of excitatory synapses, endophilin A1 functions in synaptic vesicle recycling by recruiting the clathrin-uncoating factor synaptojanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schuske et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Verstreken et al., 2003</xref>). At the excitatory postsynapses, plasma membrane-associated endophilin A1 facilitates the morphogenesis, stabilization, maturation and plasticity of dendritic spines by promoting actin polymerization via its interaction with p140Cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that endophilin A1 functions upstream of p140Cap in not only excitatory but also inhibitory postsynapses of excitatory neurons. Intriguingly, recent studies reported that p140Cap is present in the inhibitory presynaptic compartment and regulates GABAergic synaptogenesis and neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Russo et al., 2019</xref>), raising the possibility that endophilin A1 and p140Cap also coordinate to regulate the organization and activity of GABAergic synapses at the inhibitory presynaptic site. Remodeling of inhibitory synapses and dendritic spines are spatially clustered by sensory inputs in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, the turnover of inhibitory synapses outpace that of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that deficits in inhibitory synapses are much more severe in <italic>EndoA1</italic> KO mice, leading to perturbation of the E/I balance and increased epileptic vulnerability.</p>

<title>Confocal and three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) image acquisition and analysis</title>
<p>Confocal images were collected using the Spectral Imaging Confocal Microscope Digital Eclipse A1Si (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a 100× Plan Apochromat VC (NA 1.40) oil objective (4× optical zoom). Images were z projections of images taken at 0.25-μm step intervals. The number of planes, typically 5-7, was chosen to cover the entire dendrite from top to bottom. Images were captured using a 1024×1024 pixels screen for neuronal cells. Laser power, digital gain, and offset settings were identical in each experiment. Images were processed with the NIH ImageJ software and exported into Adobe Photoshop. Only brightness and contrast were adjusted for the whole frame, and no part of a frame was enhanced or modified in any way. Control and experimental group neurons which were to be directly compared were imaged with the same acquisition parameters.</p>
<p>For 3D-SIM, secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 were used and images were captured as described by Niu et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Niu et al., 2017</xref>) on the DeltaVision OMX V4 imaging system (Applied Precision Inc, USA) with a 100× 1.4 oil objective (Olympus UPlanSApo), solid state multimode lasers (488, 593 and 642 nm) and electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras (Evolve 512× 512, Photometrics, USA). Serial Z-stack sectioning was done at 125 nm intervals. The microscope is routinely calibrated with 100 nm fluorescent spheres to calculate both the lateral and axial limits of image resolution. SIM image stacks were reconstructed using softWoRx 5.0 (Applied Precision) with the following settings: pixel size 39.5 nm; channel-specific optical transfer functions; Wiener filter 0.001000; discard Negative Intensities background; drift correction with respect to first angle; custom K0 guess angles for camera positions. Pixel registration was corrected to be less than 1 pixel for all channels using 100 nm Tetraspeck beads. Three dimensional images were reconstructed from z stacks. For clarity of display, small linear changes of brightness and contrast were performed on three-dimensional reconstructions.</p>
<p>Quantification of immunostaining were carried out blindly. For quantitative analysis of immunofluorescent signals in neurons, maximal projection images were created with the ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net">https://imagej.net</ext-link>.) from 6-7 serial optical sections. Background was subtracted by using the “subtract background” function and the background level was held identical for all cells within each experiment. To examine the number and fluorescence intensity of signal puncta in soma or dendrites, the EGFP- or DsRed-labeled soma or dendrites were outlined automatically by using the “Wand Tool” function. The region of interest (ROI) in cultured neurons was defined along a segment of the dendrite according to the fluorescence signal distinguished from the background. Average values of fluorescence intensities in ROI (the total fluorescent intensity divided by the total area of a dendritic segment) were calculated by Analyze &gt; measure. Gephyrin clusters were thresholded and confirmed visually to select appropriate clusters following a minimal size cut-off by using the “Analyze Particles” plugin of the ImageJ software. For colocalization quantifications, NIS-Elements Software was used as follows: region of interest (ROI) of dendritic segments was manually chosen, and thresholded using the “Threshold” function to remove background signals. Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Manders overlap coefficient were analyzed by using the “Analyze Control &gt; colocalization” function.</p>
<p>For spatial correlation/colocalization analysis in super-resolution images, we using the method described in the reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">McCall, 2024</xref>). Briefly, channels in 3D images were split and followed by Gaussian blur performed on both GPN and Bassoon channels. Next masks of all possible localizations for the signal in GPN and Bassoon image channel were obtained. Then, the input images of the three channels were deconvolved using 10 iterations of the Richardson-Lucy algorithm in Deconvolution Lab 2 (version 2.1.2), with theoretical point spread functions (PSFs) generated by the PSF Generator plugin. PSFs were generated using the Born &amp; Wolf model, with parameters matching the acquisition parameters: 1.518 immersion refractive index, 1.4 NA, 40 nm pixel size and 125 nm z-step, 512 × 512 × 14 output diameters, and 520 nm, 592 nm and 670 nm wavelengths.

Data sets were tested for normality and direct comparisons between two groups were made using two-tailed Student’s t test (t test, for normally distributed data) as indicated. To evaluate statistical significance of three or more groups of samples, one-way ANOVA analysis with a Tukey test was used or repeated measures ANOVA analysis with a Tukey test was used in behavior assays. Statistical parameters are reported in the figures and the corresponding legends. The statistical significance was defined as * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001, respectively. All data are presented as scatterplots with mean ± S.E.M.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> finding on the molecular mechanisms that govern GABAergic inhibitory synapse function. The authors propose that Endophilin A1 serves as a novel regulator of GABAergic synapses by acting as a component of the inhibitory postsynaptic density. The findings are <bold>convincing</bold> and likely to interest a broad audience of scientists focusing on inhibitory synaptic transmission, the excitation-inhibition balance, and its disruption in disorders such as epilepsy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present study, Chen et al. investigate the role of Endophilin A1 in regulating GABAergic synapse formation and function. To this end, the authors use constitutive or conditional knockout of Endophilin A1 (EEN1) to assess the consequences on GABAergic synapse composition and function, as well as the outcome for PTZ-induced seizure susceptibility. The authors show that EEN1 KO mice show a higher susceptibility to PTZ-induced seizures, accompanied by a reduction in the GABAergic synaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin as well as specific GABAAR subunits and eIPSCs. The authors then investigate the underlying mechanisms, demonstrating that Endophilin A1 binds directly to gephyrin and GABAAR subunits, and identifying the subdomains of Endophilin A1 that contribute to this effect. Overall, the authors state that their study places Endophilin A1 as a new regulator of GABAergic synapse function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the topic of this manuscript is very timely, since there has been substantial recent interest in describing the mechanisms governing inhibitory synaptic transmission at GABAergic synapses. The study will therefore be of interest to a wide audience of neuroscientists studying synaptic transmission and its role in disease. The manuscript is well written and contains a substantial quantity of data. In the revised version of the manuscript, the authors have increased the number of samples analyzed and have significantly improved the statistical analysis, thereby substantially strengthening the conclusions of their study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The function of neural circuits relies heavily on the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Particularly, inhibitory inputs are understudied when compared to their excitatory counterparts due to the diversity of inhibitory neurons, their synaptic molecular heterogeneity, and their elusive signature. Thus, insights into these aspects of inhibitory inputs can inform us largely on the functions of neural circuits and the brain.</p>
<p>Endophilin A1, an endocytic protein heavily expressed in neurons, has been implicated in numerous pre- and postsynaptic functions, however largely at excitatory synapses. Thus, whether this crucial protein plays any role in inhibitory synapse, and whether this regulates functions at the synaptic, circuit, or brain level remains to be determined.</p>
<p>The three remaining concerns are:</p>
<p>(1) The use of one-way ANOVA is not well justified.</p>
<p>(2) The use of superplots to show culture to culture variability would make it more transparent.</p>
<p>(3) Change EEN1 in Figure 8B to EndoA1.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors addressed the concerns adequately.</p>

<p>Chen et al. identify endophilin A1 as a novel component of the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold. Their data show impaired evoked inhibitory synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons of mice lacking endophilin A1, and an increased susceptibility to seizures. Endophilin can interact with the postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin and promotes assembly of the inhibitory postsynaptic element. Endophilin A1 is known to play a role in presynaptic terminals and in dendritic spines, but a role for endophilin A1 at inhibitory postsynaptic densities has not yet been described, providing a valuable addition to the field.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of endophilin A1 at inhibitory postsynapses, the authors used a broad array of experimental approaches, including tests of seizure susceptibility, electrophysiology, biochemistry, neuronal culture and image analysis. The authors have addressed the remaining concerns in their revision. Taken together, their results expand the synaptic role of endophilin-A1 to include the inhibitory post synaptic element.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors addressed the concerns adequately. The three remaining concerns are:</p>
<p>(1) The use of one-way ANOVA is not well justified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The statement about statistical test in “Statistical analysis” section is as follows in the revised manuscript, “Data sets were tested for normality and direct comparisons between two groups were made using two-tailed Student’s t test (t test, for normally distributed data) as indicated. To evaluate statistical significance of three or more groups of samples, one-way ANOVA analysis with a Tukey test was used or repeated measures ANOVA analysis with a Tukey test was used in behavior assays. Statistical parameters are reported in the figures and the corresponding legends”.</p>
<p>We used a one-way ANOVA for the data about one categorical independent variable and one quantitative dependent variable. The independent variable should have at least three different groups or categories. And we conducted repeated measures ANOVA analysis for the data about behavioral tests according to the suggestion by Reviewer #1 (Point 18) in revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The use of superplots to show culture to culture variability would make it more transparent.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the nice suggestion. While superplots could more transparently show culture to culture variability, it is difficult to add more colors or even shades to the scatterplots in the current form, which have already been color coded for multiple groups of samples. The scatterplots we used effectively illustrate the variability across all collected data and do not affect the conclusions of our study. Therefore, we prefer not to change the way of data presentation in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Change EEN1 in Figure 8B to EndoA1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks a lot for the sharp eye. Corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>The authors have made a substantial effort to improve their manuscript. A number of issues, related to numbers of observations mentioned by the reviewers, are clarified in the revised manuscript. The authors have also clarified some of the other questions from the reviewers. The long list of issues brought up by the reviewers and the many corrections needed still raise questions about data quality in this manuscript.</p>
<p>In response to my comments (Point 2), the added experiment with PSD95.FingR and GPN.FingR in cultured neurons (Fig. S5A-D) is a good addition; the in vivo data using FingRs in Figure S3 look less convincing however. In response to my Point 5, the authors have added a cell-free binding assay (Figure 5I). This is a useful addition, but to convincingly make the point of interaction between Gephyrin and EndoA1, more rigorous biophysical quantitation of binding is needed. The legend in Figure 5I states that 4 independent experiments were performed, but the graph only shows 3 dots. This needs to be corrected.</p>

<p>We sincerely appreciate your comments and apologize for any concerns raised. As suggested (Point 2), we made many efforts to visualize endogenous postsynaptic proteins using recombinant probes. However, due to much lower expression of GPN.FingR compared with PSD95.FingR in P21 brain slices following viral infection (Figure S3), we were unable to obtain better imaging results. To strengthen our data and conclusions, we additionally performed experiments with PSD95.FingR and GPN.FingR in cultured neurons (Fig. S5A-D) in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Regarding the biophysical quantification of gephyrin–endophilin A1 binding, we do not have the equipment for this type of experiment (surface plasmon resonance or isothermal titration calorimetry). Instead, we performed a pull-down assay as an alternative to confirm their interaction (Figure 5I). We also apologize for the error in the number of independent experiments stated in the figure legend and have corrected it in the revised manuscript.</p>
