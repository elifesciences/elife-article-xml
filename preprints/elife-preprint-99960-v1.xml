<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Metal-ion-dependent nucleases play crucial roles in cellular defense and biotechnological applications. Time-resolved crystallography has resolved catalytic details of metal-ion-dependent DNA hydrolysis and synthesis, uncovering the essential roles of multiple metal ions during catalysis. The superfamily of His-Me nucleases is renowned for binding one divalent metal ion and requiring a conserved histidine to promote catalysis. Many His-Me family nucleases, including homing endonucleases and Cas9 nuclease, have been adapted for biotechnological and biomedical applications. However, it remains unclear how this single metal ion in His-Me nucleases, together with the histidine, promotes water deprotonation, nucleophilic attack, and phosphodiester bond breakage. By observing DNA hydrolysis <italic>in crystallo</italic> with His-Me I-PpoI nuclease as a model system, we proved that only one divalent metal ion is required during its catalysis. Moreover, we uncovered several possible deprotonation pathways for the nucleophilic water. Interestingly, binding of the single metal ion and water deprotonation are concerted during catalysis. Our results reveal catalytic details of His-Me nucleases, which is distinct from multi-metal-ion-dependent DNA polymerases and nucleases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent nucleases play fundamental roles in DNA replication and repair (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></italic>), RNA processing (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>), as well as immune response and defense (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>). Moreover, they are widely employed for genome editing in biotechnological and biomedical applications (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). These nucleases are proposed to cleave DNA through a SN<sub>2</sub> type reaction, in which a water molecule, or sometimes, a tyrosine side chain (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>), initiates the nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphate with the help of metal ions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>). Metal ions can orient and stabilize the binding of the negatively charged nucleic acid backbone (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>), promoting proton transfer, nucleophilic attack, and stabilization of the transition state. As a highly varied family of enzymes, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent nucleases can be broadly categorized by the number of metal ions captured in their active site. So far, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent nucleases with one and two metal ions have been observed. In the two-Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ion dependent nuclease, a metal ion binds on the leaving group side of the scissile phosphate (Me<sup>2+</sup><sub>B</sub>) while the other binds on the nucleophile side (Me<sup>2+</sup><sub>A</sub>). In one-metal ion dependent nucleases, only the metal ion corresponding to the B site in two-metal ion dependent nucleases is present (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></italic>). Moreover, transiently bound metal ions have been identified in the previously thought two-metal-ion RNaseH (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>) and EndoV nucleases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>) <italic>via</italic> time-resolved X-ray crystallography, proposed to play key roles in various stages of their catalysis. Similarly, catalysis in the one-metal ion dependent APE1 nuclease has been observed <italic>in crystallo</italic>, but mechanistic details regarding its metal-ion dependence have not been thoroughly explored (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>). There also exist three-Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent nucleases, with two Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding in the A-equivalent and B-equivalent positions, while the third Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordinating the sp oxygen on the nucleophile side of the scissile phosphate (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></italic>). However, it remains unclear how the single metal ion in one-metal-ion dependent nucleases is capable of aligning the substrate, promoting deprotonation and nucleophilic attack, and stabilizing the pentacovalent transition state.</p>
<p>A large subfamily of one-metal-ion dependent nucleases consist of His-Me nucleases that perform critical tasks in biological pathways such as apoptosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></italic>), extracellular defense (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>), intracellular immunity (CRISPR-Cas9) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></italic>), and intron homing (homing endonuclease) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></italic>). Despite sharing poor sequence homology, the structural cores and active sites of His-Me nucleases are highly conserved and thus are proposed to catalyze DNA hydrolysis through a similar mechanism (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></italic>). Surrounded by two beta sheets and an alpha helix, the His-Me nucleases active sites all contain a single metal ion, a histidine, and an asparagine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>, and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The asparagine residue helps to stabilize metal ion binding whereas the strictly conserved histidine is suggested to deprotonate a nearby water for nucleophilic attack towards the scissile phosphate (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></italic>). To this day, the dynamic reaction process of DNA hydrolysis by His-Me nucleases has never been visualized, and the mechanism of single metal ion-dependent and histidine-promoted catalysis remains unclear. Emerging genome editing and disease treatment involving CRISPR-Cas9 emphasize the importance of understanding the catalytic mechanism of DNA hydrolysis by His-Me nucleases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>). Recent crystal and cryo-electron microscope structures of Cas9 have captured the His-Me family Cas9 HNH active site engaged with DNA before and after cleavage (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></italic>). However, due to the relative low resolution and the static nature of the structures, key catalytic details, such as metal ion dependence, transition-state stabilization, and alternative deprotonation pathways, remain elusive. Moreover, the large size and multiple conformational checkpoints during Cas9 catalysis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></italic>) hinder <italic>in crystallo</italic> observation of Cas9 catalysis.</p>

<p>I-PpoI is a well-characterized intron-encoded homing endonuclease member of the <italic>physarum polycephalum</italic> slimemold. By 1999, Stoddard and colleagues were able to capture intermediate structures of I-PpoI complexed with DNA before and after product formation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>). We herein employed I-PpoI as a model system and applied time-resolved crystallography to observe the catalytic process of His-Me nuclease. By determining over 40 atomic resolution structures of I-PpoI during its reaction process, we show that one and only one divalent metal ion is involved in DNA hydrolysis. Moreover, we uncover several possible deprotonation pathways for the nucleophilic water. Notably, metal ion binding and water deprotonation are highly concerted during catalysis. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into one-metal-ion dependent nucleases, enhancing future design and engineering of these enzymes for emerging biomedical applications.</p>

<title>Preparation of the I-PpoI system for in crystallo DNA hydrolysis</title>
<p>We sought to implement I-PpoI for <italic>in crystallo</italic> metal ion soaking (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), which has been successful in elucidating the catalytic mechanisms of DNA polymerases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></italic>), nucleases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></italic>), and glycosylase (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></italic>). First, a complex of I-PpoI and a palindromic DNA was crystalized at pH 6 with 0.2 M sodium malonate. Similar to previous studies, a dimer of I-PpoI was found in the asymmetric unit, with both active sites engaged for catalysis and DNA in the middle bent by 55° (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). The two I-PpoI molecules were almost identical and thus served as internal controls for evaluating the reaction process (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Within each I-PpoI active site, a water molecule (nucleophilic water, WatN) existed 3.6 Å from the scissile phosphate, near the imidazole side chain of His98. On the leaving group side of the scissile phosphate, the metal exhibited an octahedral geometry, being coordinated by three water molecules, two oxygen atoms from the scissile phosphate, and the conserved asparagine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we removed malonate in the crystallization buffer, which may chelate metal ions and hinder metal ion diffusion (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></italic>), by equilibrating the crystals in 200 mM NaCl buffer at pH 6, 7, or 8 for 30 min. The diffraction quality of the crystals was not affected during the soaking. The structures of I-PpoI equilibrated at pH 6, 7, or 8 in the presence of 200 mM NaCl showed no signs of product formation and appeared similar to the malonate and previous reported I-PpoI structures (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). To confirm if a monovalent metal ion binds in the pre-reaction state (PRS), we soaked the I-PpoI crystals in buffer containing Tl<sup>+</sup> and detected anomalous electron density at the metal ion binding site without product formation (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Our results support that the monovalent metal ion can bind within the active site without initiating reaction, in corroboration with our biochemical assays (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Witnessing DNA hydrolysis in crystallo by I-PpoI</title>
<p>To initiate the chemical reaction <italic>in crystallo</italic>, we transferred the I-PpoI crystals equilibrated in NaCl buffer to a reaction buffer with 500 µM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). After 600 s soaking, we saw a significant negative F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub> peak on the leaving group side of the scissile phosphate atom as well as a positive F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub> peak on the other side (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>), indicating that DNA hydrolysis was occurring <italic>in crystallo</italic>. After DNA cleavage, the newly generated phosphate group shifted only 1 Å towards the WatN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Furthermore, an additional product state was observed after soaking the crystals in 500 µM Mg<sup>2+</sup> for 600 s and 1800 s, at which the newly formed phosphate shifted 3 Å away from the metal ion to form a hydrogen bond with Arg61 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Our results confirm that the implementation of I-PpoI with <italic>in crystallo</italic> Me<sup>2+</sup> soaking is feasible for observing the I-PpoI catalytic process and dissecting the mechanism of His-Me nucleases.</p>
<p>With an established <italic>in crystallo</italic> reaction system, we next visualized the entire reaction process by soaking I-PpoI crystals in buffer containing 500 µM Mg<sup>2+</sup> pH 7, for 10-1200 s. Density between the reactant phosphate and nucleophilic water increased along with longer soaking time, indicating the generation of phosphate products (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). During the reaction, the coordination distances of the metal ion ligands decreased 0.1-0.2 Å when Mg<sup>2+</sup> exchanged with Na<sup>+</sup>, which is consistent with their preferred geometry (<italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup></italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). At reaction time 160 s, 45% of product had been generated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), which later plateaued to 65% at 300 s. During the reaction process, the sugar ring of the reactant and product DNA that resides around 3 Å away from the scissile phosphate, remained in a C3’-endo conformation. As Mg<sup>2+</sup> soaking time increased from 10-160 s, we observed the WatN approaching the scissile phosphate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). At the same time, the conserved His98 sidechain proposed to deprotonate the WatN was slightly rotated.</p>

<title>A single divalent metal ion was captured during DNA hydrolysis</title>
<p>Throughout the reaction process with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, we found that the electron density for the Mg<sup>2+</sup> metal ion strongly correlated (R<sup>2</sup>=0.97) with product formation (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), which may suggest that saturation of this metal ion site is required and sufficient for catalysis. However, Mg<sup>2+</sup>’s similar size to Na<sup>+</sup> makes it suboptimal for quantifying metal ion binding. To thoroughly investigate metal-ion dependence, we repeated the <italic>in crystallo</italic> soaking experiment with Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which is more electron rich and can be unambiguously assigned based on its electron density and anomalous signal. With 500 µM Mn<sup>2+</sup> in the reaction buffer, we found that the reaction process and the product conformation were similar to that for Mg<sup>2+</sup>. After 160 s Mn<sup>2+</sup> soaking, clear anomalous signal was present at the metal ion binding site, confirming the binding of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>). For crystal structures of I-PpoI with partial product formation, Mn<sup>2+</sup> signal at the metal ion site correlated with product formation with a R<sup>2</sup> of 0.98 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). To further search if additional and transiently-bound divalent ions participate in the reaction, we soaked the I-PpoI crystals in high concentration of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (200 mM) for 600 s, at which 80% product formed within the active site. However, apart from the single metal ion binding site, we do not detect anomalous signal for additional Mn<sup>2+</sup>, despite such high concentration of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The strong correlation between product phosphate formation with Mn<sup>2+</sup> binding and the absence of additional anomalous density peaks in heavy Mn<sup>2+</sup> soaked crystals suggest that one and only one divalent metal ion is involved in I-PpoI DNA hydrolysis.</p>

<p>To examine if additional monovalent metal ions participate during DNA hydrolysis, we titrated Tl<sup>+</sup>, which can replace monovalent Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> and yields anomalous signal (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></italic>), at up to 100 mM concentration in the biochemical assay. Apart from precipitation that occurred at 50 and 100 mM Tl<sup>+</sup>, we found that product conversion remained unaffected with increasing Tl<sup>+</sup> <italic>in solution</italic> (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>). Similarly, increasing Na<sup>+</sup> concentration <italic>in solution</italic> did not increase product conversion (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4f</xref>). In addition, only one Tl<sup>+</sup> was detected by its anomalous signal in the pre-reaction state (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). The biochemical and structural results indicate that additional monovalent metal ion may not be necessary for DNA hydrolysis. However, crystal deterioration limited us from soaking the I-PpoI crystals in high concentration of Tl<sup>+</sup> for <italic>in crystallo</italic> reaction.</p>

<title>pH-dependence of I-PpoI DNA cleavage</title>
<p>During DNA hydrolysis, deprotonation of the WatN is required for the nucleophilic attack and phosphodiester bond breakage. This proton transfer has been proposed to be mediated by the highly conserved His98 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>) that lies within 3 Å from the WatN. We speculated that the ability of His98 to activate the nearby WatN and mediate proton transfer would be affected by pH. The DNA cleavage assay revealed that I-PpoI cleavage activity increased with pH with a pKa of 8.3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), which is much higher than the pKa of histidine, but the histidine pKa and the proton transfer process may be affected by the active site environment. To explore how pH affects the active site configuration and catalysis, we conducted <italic>in crystallo</italic> soaking experiments with Mg<sup>2+</sup> at pH 6 and pH 8 in addition to the pH 7 data series in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. Consistent with <italic>in solution</italic> experiments, higher pH resulted in faster product formation <italic>in crystallo</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), indicating that metal ion binding may also be affected by pH. To test this, we performed Mg<sup>2+</sup> titration at different pH <italic>in solution</italic>. Our results showed that over 100-times higher concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> was needed to yield 50% product in pH 6 versus pH 8 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), confirming that pH affects metal-ion dependent I-PpoI catalysis. Likewise, the reactions <italic>in</italic> crystallo at higher pH reached 50% product formation at shorter soaking times (320 s at pH 6, 160 s at pH 7, and 80 s at pH 8, respectively). Interestingly, the crystal structures that contained 30-35% product at pH 6 and pH 8 were nearly identical (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d, e</xref>). The positions of the His98 residue and the WatN were practically superimposable (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). At all pH, Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding strongly correlated with product formation (R<sup>2</sup> greater than 0.95), suggesting that low pH reduces the overall reaction rate without altering the reaction pathway (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4b, c</xref>).</p>

<title>Nucleophilic water deprotonation pathway during I-PpoI DNA cleavage</title>
<p>We next investigated the deprotonation pathway with mutagenesis. Because His98 has been proposed to primarily activate the nucleophilic water, we first mutated His98 to alanine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). As expected, cleavage activity of H98A I-PpoI drastically dropped. Our assays showed that H98A I-PpoI displayed residual activity but required a reaction time of 1 hr to be comparable to WT I-PpoI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), similar to the H98Q mutant in previous studies (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></italic>). Furthermore, varying the pH resulted in a sigmoidal activity curve of I-PpoI pH dependence, corresponding to a pKa of 7.9 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). The significantly reduced reaction rate and the shift of pH dependence suggest that His98 plays a key role in pH sensing and water deprotonation. On the other hand, the low but existing activity of H98A I-PpoI suggests the presence of alternative general bases for proton transfer. Another histidine (His78) resides on the nucleophile side 3.8 Å from the WatN, with a cluster of water molecules in between (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). We hypothesized that His78 may substitute His98 as the proton acceptor. The DNA cleavage assays revealed that the single mutant, H78A I-PpoI, had an activity similar to WT, whereas the double mutant (H78A/H98A I-PpoI) exhibited much lower activity than that of H98A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Furthermore, varying the pH for H78A/H98A I-PpoI resulted in a sigmoidal activity curve that corresponded to a pKa of 8.7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). In consistent with previous speculations, our results confirm the possibility of His78 as an alternative general base (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></italic>). The residual activity and pH dependence of H78A/H98A I-PpoI indicated that something else was still activating the nucleophilic water in the absence of any nearby histidine. Furthermore, we found that titrating imidazole in H98A and H78A/H98A I-PpoI partially rescued cleavage activity (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6a, b</xref>), similar as observed in Cas9 and EndA nuclease (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></italic>). Collectively, our results indicate that His98 is the primary proton acceptor like previous simulation results (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></italic>) but at the same time, I-PpoI can use alternative pathways to activate the nucleophilic WatN.</p>

<p>We next sought to understand the mechanism of His98-promoted hydrolysis from a structural standpoint. In our <italic>in crystallo</italic> soaking experiments, we equilibrated H98A I-PpoI crystals in 500 µM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The structure looked nearly identical to the Na<sup>+</sup> structure and previous H98A I-PpoI structure with Mn<sup>2+</sup>. As shown earlier, the coordination environment of Na<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> was quite similar. To confirm divalent metal ion binding, the H98A I-PpoI crystals were soaked for 1800 s in 500 µM Mn<sup>2+</sup>, the same concentration used to initiate DNA hydrolysis by WT I-PpoI. However, to our surprise, the metal ion binding site was devoid of any anomalous signal. Increasing the Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 1 mM still did not produce anomalous density at the Me<sup>2+</sup> binding site (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). The results indicate that metal ion binding can be altered by perturbing His98 and possibly water deprotonation, even though the metal ion binding site and His98 exist 7 Å apart without direct interaction. Although we tried soaking the H98A I-PpoI crystals in 1 mM Mg/Mn<sup>2+</sup> and 100 mM imidazole for 15 h, metal ion binding, imidazole binding or product formation were not detected (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6d</xref>), possibly due to the difficulty of imidazole diffusion within the lattice. Our results indicate that perturbing the deprotonation pathway not only affects nucleophilic attack but also metal binding, suggesting that I-PpoI catalyzes DNA catalysis <italic>via</italic> a concerted mechanism.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Time-resolved crystallography can visualize time-dependent structural changes and elucidate mechanisms of enzyme catalysis with unparalleled detail <italic>in crystallo</italic>, especially for light-dependent enzymes, in which the reactions can be synchronously initiated by light pulses (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></italic>). In complementary, recently advanced metal ion diffusion-based time-resolved crystallographic techniques have uncovered rich dynamics at the active site and transient metal ion binding during the catalytic processes of metal-ion-dependent DNA polymerases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></italic>) and nucleases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>) and glycosylase (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></italic>). In addition to metal ions captured in static structures, these transient metal ions have been shown to play critical roles in catalysis, such as water deprotonation for nucleophilic attack in RNaseH (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>), bond breakage and product stabilization in polymerases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></italic>) and substrate alignment or rotation in MutT (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></italic>). Interestingly, one and only one metal ion was captured within the I-PpoI active site during catalysis, even when high concentration (200 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup>) of metal ion was tested (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The observed location of the Me<sup>2+</sup> on the leaving group side of the scissile phosphate corresponds to the Me<sup>2+</sup><sub>B</sub> in two metal-ion dependent nucleases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></italic>) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). However, the metal ion is unique in its environment and role. First, it is coordinated by a water cluster and asparagine side chain (sometimes with an additional aspartate residue) rather than the acidic aspartate and glutamic acid clusters that outline the active sites of RNaseH and APE1 nuclease (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></italic>) as well as DNA polymerases (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Even in the absence of divalent Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>, the active site including the scissile phosphate was already well-aligned in I-PpoI, which is again different from RNaseH. Instead, Leu116 and the beta sheet consisting of Arg61, Gln63, Lys65, Thr67 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></italic>) helped to position the DNA optimally towards the active site (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1a, c</xref>). Second, (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></italic>) single metal ion binding is strictly correlated with product formation in all conditions, at different pH and with different mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4a-c</xref>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></italic>). Thus, we suspect that the metal ion may play a crucial role in the chemistry step to stabilize the transition state and reduce the electronegative buildup of DNA, similar as the third metal ion in DNA polymerases and RNaseH.</p>
<p>Proton transfer by a general base is essential for a SN<sub>2</sub>-type nucleophilic attack. Such deprotonation of the nucleophilic water has been attributed to His98, which is highly conserved in His-Me nucleases. Existing close to the nucleophilic water at 2.6 Å, His98 is perfectly positioned to mediate the proton transfer. Moreover, due to the bulky presence of His98 and beta sheet protein residues, there is no space for an additional metal ion at the nucleophilic side (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The H98A mutation significantly reduced catalytic activity and altered pH-dependence. But since H98A I-PpoI showed residual activity, His78, imidazole, or its surrounding waters may still serve as alternative general bases for accepting the proton, similar to Pol η, in which primer 3’-OH deprotonation can occur through multiple pathways (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></italic>). However, the order of events regarding metal ion binding, water deprotonation, and nucleophilic attack remains unanswered. Based on our <italic>in crystallo</italic> observations, water deprotonation and metal ion binding appeared to be highly correlated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>). Lowering the pH not only reduced reaction rate but also slowed metal ion binding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c</xref>). Moreover, the metal ion was not observed <italic>in crystallo</italic> when His98 was removed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). As there is no direct interaction between His98 and the Me<sup>2+</sup> binding site, the divalent metal ion may be sensitive to the charge potential of the substrate scissile phosphate, which may be indirectly affected by the deprotonated state of the nucleophilic water. Conversely, binding of the divalent metal ion may alter the local electrostatic environment and affect His98 deprotonation. Consistently, previous molecular dynamics simulation of Cas9 has suggested that the histidine pKa is highly sensitive to active site changes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></italic>). Without a proper proton acceptor, the metal ion may be prone for dissociation without the reaction proceeding, and thus stable Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding was not observed <italic>in crystallo</italic> without His98 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b</xref>). In summary, our experimental observations suggest a concerted mechanism for one-metal-ion promoted DNA hydrolysis, offering guidance for future computational analysis of enzyme catalysis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></italic>) and the rational design and engineering of nucleases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></italic>) for biotechnological and biomedical applications.</p>

<p>Chang et al. have investigated the catalytic mechanism of I-PpoI nuclease, a one-metal-ion dependent nuclease, by time-resolved X-ray crystallography using soaking of crystals with metal ions under different pH conditions. This <bold>convincing</bold> study revealed that I-PpoI catalyzes the reaction process through a single divalent cation. The study uncovers <bold>important</bold> details of the roles of the metal ion and the active site histidine in catalysis.</p>

<p>This study is convincing because they performed time-resolved X-ray crystallography under different pH conditions using active/inactive metal ions and PpoI mutants, as with the activity measurements in solution in conventional enzymatic studies. Although the reaction mechanism is simple and may be a little predictable, the strength of this study is that they were able to validate that PpoI catalyzes DNA hydrolysis through &quot;a single divalent cation&quot; because time-resolved X-ray study often observes transient metal ions which are important for catalysis but are not predictable in previous studies with static structures such as enzyme-substrate analog-metal ion complexes. The discussion of this study is well supported by their data. This study visualized the catalytic process and mutational effects on catalysis, providing new insight into the catalytic mechanism of I-PpoI through a single divalent cation. The authors found that His98, a candidate of proton acceptor in the previous experiments, also affects the Mg2+ binding for catalysis without the direct interaction between His98 and the Mg2+ ion, suggesting that &quot;Without a proper proton acceptor, the metal ion may be prone for dissociation without the reaction proceeding, and thus stable Mg2+ binding was not observed in crystallo without His98&quot;. In future, this interesting feature observed in I-PpoI should be investigated by biochemical, structural, and computational analyses using other metal-ion dependent nucleases.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Most polymerases and nucleases use two or three divalent metal ions in their catalytic functions. The family of His-Me nucleases, however, use only one divalent metal ion, along with a conserved histidine, to catalyze DNA hydrolysis. The mechanism has been studied previously but, according to the authors, it remained unclear. By use of a time resolved X-ray crystallography, this work convincingly demonstrated that only one M2+ ion is involved in the catalysis of the His-Me I-PpoI 19 nuclease, and proposed concerted functions of the metal and the histidine.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work performs mechanistic studies, including the number and roles of metal ion, pH dependence, and activation mechanism, all by structural analyses, coupled with some kinetics and mutagenesis. Overall, it is a highly rigorous work. This approach was first developed in Science (2016) for a DNA polymerase, in which Yang Cao was the first author. It has subsequently been applied to just 5 to 10 enzymes by different labs, mainly to clarify two versus three metal ion mechanisms. The present study is the first one to demonstrate a single metal ion mechanism by this approach.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the basis of the quantitative correlation between the fraction of metal ion binding and the formation of product, as well as the pH dependence, and the data from site-specific mutants, the authors concluded that the functions of Mg2+ and His are a concerted process. A detailed mechanism is proposed in Figure 6.</p>
<p>Even though there are no major surprises in the results and conclusions, the time-resolved structural approach and the overall quality of the results represent a significant step forward for the Me-His family of nucleases. In addition, since the mechanism is unique among different classes of nucleases and polymerases, the work should be of interest to readers in DNA enzymology, or even mechanistic enzymology in general.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Two relatively minor issues are raised here for consideration:</p>
<p>
p. 4, last para, lines 1-2: &quot;we next visualized the entire reaction process by soaking I-PpoI crystals in buffer....&quot;. This is a little over-stated. The structures being observed are not reaction intermediates. They are mixtures of substrates and products in the enzyme-bound state. The progress of the reaction is limited by the progress of the soaking of the metal ion. Crystallography has just been used as a tool to monitor the reaction (and provide structural information about the product). It would be more accurate to say that &quot;we next monitored the reaction progress by soaking....&quot;.</p>
<p>p. 5, the beginning of the section. The authors on one hand emphasized the quantitative correlation between Mg ion density and the product density. On the other hand, they raised the uncertainty in the quantitation of Mg2+ density versus Na+ density, thus they repeated the study with Mn2+ which has distinct anomalous signals. This is a very good approach. However, there is still no metal ion density shown in the key Figure 2A. It will be clearer to show the progress of metal ion density in a figure (in addition to just plots), whether it is Mg or Mn.</p>

<p>We appreciate the clarification regarding the description of our experimental approach. We agree that our structures do not represent reaction intermediates but rather mixtures of substrate and product states within the enzyme-bound environment. We will revise the text accordingly to more accurately reflect our methodology.</p>

<p>Thank you for your insightful comments. We recognize the importance of visualizing metal ion density alongside product density data. As you commented, distinguishing between Mg2+ and Na+ is challenging, and in Fig 2A, no distinguishable density was observed at 20s. Mn2+, with its higher electron density, is detectable even at low occupancy. To address this, we will include figure panels in Figure 3 or supplementary figures to present Mn2+ and product densities concurrently.</p>
