<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>SNAP25 is one of three neuronal SNAREs driving synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We studied three mutations in SNAP25 that cause epileptic encephalopathy: V48F, and D166Y in the Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) binding interface, and I67N, which destabilizes the SNARE-complex. All three mutations reduced Syt1-dependent vesicle docking to SNARE-carrying liposomes and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated membrane fusion <italic>in vitro</italic> and in neurons. The V48F and D166Y mutants (with potency D166Y &gt; V48F) led to reduced Readily Releasable Pool (RRP) size, due to increased spontaneous (mEPSC) release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased the release probability, which are gain-of-function features not found in <italic>Syt1</italic> knockout (KO) neurons; normalized mEPSC release rates were higher (potency D166Y&gt;V48F) than in the <italic>Syt1</italic> KO. These mutations (potency D166Y &gt; V48F) increased spontaneous association to partner SNAREs, resulting in unregulated membrane fusion. In contrast, the I67N mutant decreased mEPSC frequency and evoked EPSC amplitudes due to an increase in the apparent height of the energy barrier for fusion, whereas the RRP size was unaffected. This could be partly compensated by positive charges lowering the energy barrier. Overall, pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion.</p>

<p>Fabio Lolicato and Walter Nickel, University of Heidelberg, performed atomistic MD simulations of the V48F and D166Y mutations.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The fusion machinery responsible for chemical synaptic transmission is well known: it consists of the SNARE-complex, a ternary complex formed by the proteins VAMP2, syntaxin-1 and SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). This complex is under tight control by upstream partner protein Munc18-1, which acts as a template for SNARE-complex formation, and Munc13s, which assist in the transitions required along the pathway of assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rizo, 2022</xref>). SNARE-complexes assemble in a zipper-like manner; partially assembled SNAREpins bind synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) and complexin within two separate interaction sites: the primary interface formed between a synaptotagmin 1 molecule and syntaxin-1 and SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), and the tripartite interface formed by syntaxin-1 and VAMP2 with another Syt1 molecule and complexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Upon arrival of an action potential, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to the two C2-domains of Syt1, which results in rapid vesicle-plasma membrane fusion and release of neurotransmitter within a fraction of a millisecond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sudhof, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The strong functional integration and specialization of the neuronal SNARE for speed has rendered the release machinery exquisitely susceptible to insults. <italic>De novo</italic> mutations in SNAREs and associated proteins lead to complex neurological disease, characterized by drug-resistant epilepsy, intellectual disability, movement disorders and often autism; a syndrome which has been denoted “SNAREopathy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Verhage and Sorensen, 2020</xref>). Although rare, these are devastating conditions for the patients and their families. Consequently, there is considerable interest in revealing the molecular/cellular mechanisms for these conditions, which is seen as key to the development of treatment. Disease-causing mutations in the SNARE-machinery fall into distinct categories according to the nature of the defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Verhage and Sorensen, 2020</xref>). These include different forms of haplo-insufficiency, where the mutated protein is either lost altogether or has lost its functionality, and dominant-negative or recessive variants, as well as variants with new or changed protein interactions, referred to as neomorphs.</p>
<p>Most SNAREopathy mutations have been described in <italic>STXBP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abramov et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Verhage and Sorensen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Xian et al., 2022</xref>), the gene encoding Munc18-1. These mutations are generally found to cause Munc18-1 hypo-expression, probably due to protein instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Guiberson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kovacevic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Saitsu et al., 2008</xref>), and thus the mutations belong in the haploinsufficiency category. Synaptic phenotypes of Munc18-1 hypoexpression have been identified in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wu et al., 1998</xref>), in cultured mouse neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Toonen et al., 2006</xref>) and in brain slices of <italic>STXBP1</italic> heterozygous mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">dos Santos et al., 2023</xref>), as well as in human neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Patzke et al., 2015</xref>), whereas expression of human missense mutations in <italic>STXBP1</italic> null mouse neurons led to synaptic phenotypes for some mutations, but not for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kovacevic et al., 2018</xref>). Attempts to rescue the disease phenotypes have focused on mechanisms for increasing expression levels, for instance chemical chaperones that might prevent Munc18-1 misfolding and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Abramov et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Guiberson et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The situation is different for disease mutations in Syt1 and SNAP25. In these cases, mutation generally does not cause protein instability, but instead changes function in different ways. For Syt1, disease mutations were found to cluster in the C2B-domain around the top loops that coordinate Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baker et al., 2018</xref>). Expression of these mutants in neurons demonstrated reduced evoked release, in some cases an increase in spontaneous release, and a dominant-negative phenotype when co-expressed with wildtype protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bradberry et al., 2020</xref>). The molecular mechanism was identified as a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent lipid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bradberry et al., 2020</xref>). In SNAP25, disease causing mutations are found within the SNARE-domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hamdan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Klockner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rohena et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Alten et al. studied a selection of SNAP25 mutants, and found no changes in expression levels, but changes in both spontaneous and evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alten et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, mutations in the primary Syt1:SNARE interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>) caused an increase in spontaneous release rates, and a decrease in evoked release amplitudes. Conversely, C-terminal mutations in the so-called ‘layer residues’, whose side chains point to the center of the SNARE complex and are involved in SNAREpin zippering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>), led to a decrease in both evoked and spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alten et al., 2021</xref>). This is expected because the C-terminal end of the SNARE-complex is required for both types of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Weber et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alten et al. (2021)</xref> described striking phenotypes for most SNAP25 mutations tested, but the molecular reason for these phenotypes remains incompletely understood, and a few findings were surprising. For instance, Alten et al. reported that the V48F and D166Y mutants supported an unchanged Readily Releasable Pool (RRP) of vesicles. The RRP is the pool of vesicles available for immediate release upon invasion of the presynapse by the action potential, and it is often assessed by applying a hyperosmotic solution (often 0.5 M sucrose), which causes primed vesicles to fuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>). Previously, we concluded that the primary Syt1:SNARE-interface is involved in vesicle priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schupp et al., 2016</xref>), which agrees with the suggestion that Syt1 binds to the SNAREs before Ca<sup>2+</sup> arrival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, Alten et al. reported a smaller RRP for the I67N mutant, but the I67 residue is present in the internal of layer +4, which we expected to affect final SNARE complex zippering causing membrane fusion rather than priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Sorensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Weber et al., 2010</xref>). These discrepancies might be explained by the fact that Alten et al. used mixed cultures and mainly studied GABAergic transmission. Glutamatergic transmission is hard to investigate in mixed cultures due to reverberating activity, but it can be studied using autaptic neurons, which was our approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schupp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Weber et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, there is a need to further study these disease mutations in glutamatergic neurons. Another open question is whether the phenotype of the mutants in the primary interface (V48F, D166Y) are explainable solely by the loss of Syt1 binding, or whether other features of these mutations add to, or detract from, the phenotype.</p>
<p>Here, we reexamined three SNAP25 disease mutations using glutamatergic autaptic neurons: I67N, V48F and D166Y. We confirmed the increase in spontaneous release rate and decrease in evoked release by V48F and D166Y reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alten et al., 2021</xref>). Through <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis we find that both mutations lower Syt1 association to SNARE-protein liposomes. Additional experiments both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells demonstrate that V48F and especially D166Y represent partial gain-of-function mutations that increase association to partner SNAREs and lower the energy barrier for fusion, bypassing Syt1-dependent control. Thus, these mutants do not phenocopy the loss of Syt1, but combine loss of Syt1 binding with a gain-of-function phenotype. At the same time, the mutants act as loss-of-function in upstream reactions, through effects on priming. The I67N is a classical dominant-negative mutation, which increases the energy barrier for fusion, but does not change the size of the RRP if probed by a sufficiently high concentration of sucrose, nor does the I67N change the electrostatics of triggering itself. Thus, for V48F and D166Y, loss-of-function and gain-of-function features combine to change the energy landscape for vesicle priming and fusion in a complex way. These findings have consequences for our understanding of the simultaneous role of the primary SNARE:Syt1 interface in vesicle priming and release clamping. It further demonstrates the challenge faced by finding mechanism-based treatments of these disorders in the presence of multiple effects caused by single point mutations.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We first investigated two SNAP25 disease-causing mutations within the primary Syt1:SNARE-interface (V48F, D166Y; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). The mutations occurred <italic>de novo</italic> and were identified in single heterozygous subjects. The V48F mutant was identified in a 15-year-old female with encephalopathy, intellectual disability and generalized epilepsy with seizures started at 5 months of age; MRI was normal except for delayed myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rohena et al., 2013</xref>). The D166Y mutants was found in a 23-year-old male with global developmental delay, nocturnal tonic-clonic seizures, and moderate intellectual disability; the MRI showed mild diffuse cortical atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hamdan et al., 2017</xref>). We aimed to achieve a detailed understanding of the reason for synaptic dysfunction.</p>

<title>The V48F and D166Y mutants disinhibit spontaneous release and desynchronize evoked release</title>
<p>We constructed lentiviral vectors, which expressed wildtype (WT) or mutant SNAP25b fused N-terminally to EGFP as an expression marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Delgado-Martinez et al., 2007</xref>). In the absence of SNAP25, neuronal viability is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Delgado-Martinez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Peng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Santos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Weber et al., 2010</xref>) with low-density autaptic glutamatergic neurons dying within a few days, whereas <italic>Snap25</italic> KO neurons growing at higher densities, or in the intact brain, can survive longer, but also eventually degenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bronk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hoerder-Suabedissen et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore first examined the morphology and survival of autaptic hippocampal neurons from <italic>Snap25</italic> KO after expressing mutated or WT EGFP-SNAP25b (henceforth denoted ‘WT’ in rescue experiments; not to be confused with ‘<italic>Syt1</italic> WT’, which refers to wildtype littermates of <italic>Syt1</italic> KO mice).</p>
<p>As expected, <italic>Snap25</italic> KO autaptic neurons did not survive in the absence of expression of exogeneous SNAP25 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), whereas expression of WT EGFP-SNAP25b restored survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Delgado-Martinez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Weber et al., 2010</xref>). Both mutations (V48F and D166Y) caused rescue of survival; however, the number of neurons per islet was lower than in WT-expressing neurons prepared in parallel. This difference was statistically significant for D166Y, but not for V48F (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Since patients harbor one mutated and one WT allele, we coexpressed WT EGFP-SNAP25b with mutated EGFP-SNAP25b, by combining infection with separate viruses encoding WT and mutant protein in a 1:1 ratio, as done previously by others for Syt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bradberry et al., 2020</xref>). As a prerequisite for this, we demonstrated by Western blot analysis that both mutant viruses expressed similar amounts of protein as WT viruses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). In co-expressing neurons, we added half the volume of WT and mutant virus as compared to the WT condition, thus keeping the total amount of virus constant. We preferred to combine two single-cistronic viruses, rather than to construct bicistronic viruses, since the larger insert would be expected to lower the titer of viruses, which might compromise survival rescue of <italic>Snap25</italic> KO neurons. Using co-expression of WT and mutant SNAP25b, neuronal survival was mildly and significantly reduced in the V48F + WT condition from WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Overall, mutations seemed to mildly reduce survivability of neurons. Staining of neurons against VGlut1 (a marker for glutamatergic synapses) and MAP2 (a dendritic marker) revealed no significant difference in the dendritic length or the number of synapses in neurons expressing V48F, and D166Y alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-F</xref>).</p>

<p>Patch-clamp was performed on days 10-14 on autaptic neurons expressing either the WT EGFP-SNAP25b, the mutants, or both the mutant and WT in a 1:1 ratio. Spontaneous miniature events were recorded at a holding voltage of -70 mV. Both primary interface mutations (V48F, D166Y) strongly increased the frequency of mEPSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B, D-E</xref>); the mEPSC amplitude was significantly increased in the V48F, and insignificantly (p=0.14) increased for the D166Y (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, F</xref>). The mEPSC frequency was at least as high as in <italic>Syt1</italic> KO neurons measured in separate experiments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G-I</xref>).

The V48F and D166Y mutants both supported evoked release, but the evoked EPSC (eEPSC) amplitude was significantly reduced in the mutant condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B, E-F</xref>), whereas when co-expressed with the WT, only the D166Y mutant had a significantly reduced eEPSC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,F</xref>). Integration of individual eEPSCs allowed determination of the total charge and the assessment of synchronous and asynchronous release components (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> – Figure supplement 1). The eEPSC charge was significantly reduced in the D166Y, but not in the V48F (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C,G</xref>), whereas in both cases the kinetics was significantly shifted in the direction of more asynchronous release, and the fast time constant was prolonged (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D,H</xref>; <xref rid="figs4-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 - Figure supplement 2</xref>).

<p>Overall, D166Y and V48F caused a strong disinhibition of spontaneous release and a desynchronization of evoked release, as demonstrated before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alten et al., 2021</xref>), and consistent with previous mutational studies of the primary interface, both in SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schupp et al., 2016</xref>) and Syt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, these phenotypes are similar to <italic>Syt1</italic> KO, but the effect of V48F and D166Y on total evoked charge was milder than in the <italic>Syt1</italic> KO. The preserved overall charge of evoked release in V48F and mild reduction in D166Y might point to a compensatory gain-of-function aspect to these mutations, in addition to the impaired Syt1 interaction.</p>

<title>V48F and D166Y mutations lower the energy barrier for release and reduce the readily releasable pool size</title>
<p>The role of Syt1 and Syt1:SNARE interactions in vesicle priming has been controversially discussed. The RRP is often assessed by applying a pulse of hypertonic solution to the neurons, usually 0.5 M sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schotten et al., 2015</xref>). However, in some experiments this did not lead to a change in RRP size in the absence of Syt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bacaj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Xu et al., 2009</xref>), whereas experiments both from our laboratories and others showed a decrease in RRP in the absence of Syt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bouazza-Arostegui et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Courtney et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>). The reason for this discrepancy is likely partly technical and has to do with how fast sucrose can be applied to the dendritic tree (see also Discussion). Using neurons growing on small autaptic islands makes it possible to apply sucrose to the entire dendritic tree (which is confined to the 30-50 µm island) within tens of milliseconds, which is fast enough to dissect the RRP with a short (few s) sucrose application. We set out to understand whether the V48F and D166Y mutants changed the size of the RRP.</p>
<p>Application of 0.5M sucrose to neurons with the V48F or D166Y mutation resulted in estimates of the RRP (denoted RRP<sub>0.5</sub>) that were significantly reduced compared to the WT condition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A,C,F,H</xref>). Also the co-expressed condition displayed significantly reduced RRP<sub>0.5</sub>. Application of two different sucrose concentrations is used to probe the size of the energy barrier for release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schotten et al., 2015</xref>), because the use of a lower sucrose concentration (typically 0.25 M) will only release a fraction of the RRP, and this fraction depends sensitively on the energy barrier for release; the size of the RRP at 0.5M sucrose (RRP<sub>0.5</sub>) is used for normalization. Application of 0.25 M sucrose to V48F and D166Y expressing neurons strikingly led to unchanged pool release (RRP<sub>0.25</sub>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B,G</xref>). Consequently, the ratio of pools (RRP<sub>0.25</sub>/RRP<sub>0.5</sub>) was significantly increased for both the V48F and the D166Y mutations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D,I</xref>), indicating that these two mutations decrease the apparent energy barrier for fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schotten et al., 2015</xref>). The co-expressed conditions were in-between WT and mutant and did not reach statistical significance. Consistent with these results, both mutations on average increased the release probability, calculated as the ratio between the eEPSC charge and the RRP<sub>0.5</sub> charge measured in the same cell. The increase was statistically significant for the D166Y mutation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>), but not for V48F (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). This is different from the situation in the <italic>Syt1</italic> KO, where the RRP<sub>0.25</sub>/RRP<sub>0.5</sub> and the release probability were both significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K-O</xref>), although in this data set the reduction in RRP<sub>0.5</sub> size by removing Syt1 did not reach statistical significance (P=0.0548, unpaired t-test). Thus, the increased mEPSC release rate from the <italic>Syt1</italic> KO does not correlate with a reduced energy barrier as assayed by sucrose, which was reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huson et al., 2020</xref>), and the V48F and D166Y have specific gain-of-function features that lower the energy barrier for vesicle fusion.</p>

<p>To investigate the reasons for the change in RRP-size by D166Y and V48F, we considered a one-pool model for the RRP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), where the RRP is filled by priming (<italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic>) from an upstream pool and depleted by de-priming (<italic>k<sub>-1</sub></italic>) or spontaneous fusion (<italic>k<sub>f</sub></italic>). Dividing the miniature release rates (<italic>r<sub>mini</sub></italic>) with the size of the RRP yields the spontaneous fusion rate <italic>k<sub>f</sub></italic>. The current plateau during 0.5 M sucrose application (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) essentially reports on the priming rate (<italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic>), providing that the fusion rate is sufficiently increased by sucrose (Materials and Methods). However, high sucrose concentrations can change the baseline current level, which will cause an error in estimation of <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic>. We therefore corrected the plateau level using a plot of the variance versus mean during the sucrose application (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>); this plot is linear for the type of noise generated by synaptic transmission (shot noise). Back-extrapolation of a regression line allows a determination of the baseline current level in the presence of sucrose (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-C</xref>; see Materials and Methods). Combining RRP size with the estimates of <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>f</sub></italic> allows determining the depriming rate, <italic>k<sub>-1</sub></italic>.</p>

<p>These calculations showed that <italic>k<sub>f</sub></italic>, the spontaneous fusion rate was strongly increased in the V48F and D166Y, and this increase was much larger for the mutations than for the <italic>Syt1</italic> KO (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>) fulfilling D166Y&gt;V48F&gt;<italic>Syt1</italic> KO. Further analysis showed that in both mutations, the forward priming rate, <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic>, and the depriming rate, <italic>k<sub>-1</sub></italic>, were both decreased – the latter effect was only significant for D166Y (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Summing up the effects of changes in the three parameters on the RRP-size for the V48F, D166Y and <italic>Syt1</italic> KO (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), we can conclude that for the V48F and even more for the D166Y, spontaneous release contributes to the reduction in RRP size, whereas this effect is minimal in the <italic>Syt1</italic> KO. However, the major reason for the smaller RRP size is a reduction in priming rate, <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic>, which is partly counteracted by the decrease in <italic>k<sub>-1</sub></italic> (which would increase RRP size). Overall, changes in priming, depriming and spontaneous fusion rates combine to change RRP size.</p>

<p>Repetitive stimulation to determine the RRPs often results in lower estimates than sucrose application, because action potentials draw on a sub-pool of the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Moulder and Mennerick, 2005</xref>), whereas sucrose releases the entire RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>). To determine the RRP sub-pool that evoked release draws on (denoted RRP<sub>ev</sub>) we applied repetitive stimulation (50 APs @ 40 Hz) and used back-extrapolation to determine the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Neher, 2015</xref>). Performing this in our standard 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing extracellular solution resulted in overall smaller estimates for RRP<sub>ev</sub> for V48F and D166Y compared to WT (<xref rid="figs7-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 - Figure supplement 1</xref>); however, the differences were not statistically significant. The back-extrapolation method works best with high release probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Neher, 2015</xref>); therefore, we repeated these experiments in the presence of 4 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Under these conditions, the RRP<sub>ev</sub> was significantly reduced for both the V48F and D166Y mutation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C,G</xref>; <xref rid="figs7-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 - Figure supplement 2</xref>). Strikingly, the release probabilities (calculated as the charge of the first eEPSC of the train divided by the RRP<sub>ev</sub>) were decreased for both mutations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D,H</xref>), which correlated with an increased paired-pulse ratio (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A,E</xref>, <italic>inserts)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>). Thus, although the release probability calculated by normalizing evoked charge to the sucrose-determined RRP (RRP<sub>0.5</sub>) was increased (see above), the release probability when normalizing to RRP<sub>ev</sub> was decreased. This points to a difference in the organization of the RRP<sub>ev</sub> and RRP<sub>0.5</sub> (see Discussion). The forward priming rate is determined as the slope of the linear fit used for the back extrapolation; this parameter was reduced in both mutations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B, F</xref>; <xref rid="figs7-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 - Figure supplement 2</xref>).

<p>Overall, these data demonstrate a rather complex phenotype of the D166Y and V48F mutations, which combine a lowering of the energy barrier – a gain-of-function feature – with a loss of vesicle priming – a loss-of-function feature. The D166Y and V48F phenotypes can be summarized as 1) desynchronized eEPSCs with at most mildly reduced total charge, 2) lowered energy barrier for fusion, 3) increased release probability when normalized to the sucrose pools, 4) decreased RRP-size due to unclamped spontaneous release and lowered forward priming rates, 5) short-term facilitation. These phenotypes are distinctive from the Syt1 KO, which does not have a preserved charge of the eEPSC, or lowered energy barrier when probed by sucrose, or an increased release probability. Thus, the D166Y and V48F cannot be understood solely in terms of a lack of Syt1 coupling; instead, gain-of-function features are present in the mutants which are absent upon deletion of Syt1.</p>

Cis-SNARE complex stability was tested in the presence of SDS at the indicated temperatures (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>), and the release of syntaxin-1 as a single protein band was used as a measure of the complex dissociation. The wildtype (WT), V48F and D166Y v-/t-SNARE complexes showed a similar stability with half-maximal dissociation occurring at approximately 71°C.</p>

<p>Next, we asked whether the V48F and D166Y mutants would change interaction with Syt1. To this end, Atto647 labelled Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) filled with isosmotic sucrose and containing preassembled t-SNARE complexes were preincubated with Atto488/Atto550 labeled Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUVs) containing Syt1 as well as VAMP2 for 10 minutes on ice, followed by centrifugation to reisolate GUVs with attached SUVs. Fusion was blocked by performing the assay on ice. Attachment of SUVs was determined by measuring the Atto550 fluorescence of SUVs. In the absence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, vesicle attachment occurs by Syt1:SNARE interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Parisotto et al., 2012</xref>), probably involving the primary interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). In the cell, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding by Syt1 appears to happen first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Honigmann et al., 2013</xref>), whereas subsequent Syt1:SNARE-binding leads to a tightly docked state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Under our conditions, both SNAP25 mutants (V48F and D166Y) showed significantly impaired attachment of Syt1/VAMP2 SUVs to t-SNARE GUVs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). Both V48 and D166 directly interact with Syt1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>)), so that changing these two amino acids to more bulky or hydrophobic amino acids reduced the docking from 42.7 ± 2.6 % wildtype (WT) docking efficiency to 29.6 ± 4.1 % and 20.9 ± 3.7 %, respectively. In the presence of 1% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, the vesicle attachment increased from 42.7 ± 2.6 % to 66.0 ± 0.5 % for WT t-SNARE. Although the Syt1:PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interaction predominated SUV-GUV docking, both mutants still showed significantly reduced vesicle attachment by approximately 6% compared to WT (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>) (V48F: 59.1 ± 1.4 %, and D166Y: 60.0 ± 2.0 %).</p>
<p>To understand how the mutations affect fusion in a well-defined reconstituted membrane fusion system, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> lipid mixing assays using GUVs containing both t-SNAREs (syntaxin-1 and SNAP25) with 1% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5% Atto488/0.5% Atto550 labeled SUVs containing Syt1 and VAMP2 in the presence or absence of complexin-II (6 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kedar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Malsam et al., 2012</xref>). Fusion was measured at 37°C by Atto488 fluorescence dequenching, which occurs upon lipid mixing with GUVs. Calcium (100 µM free Ca<sup>2+</sup> final) was added after 2 minutes to the t-SNARE GUV assay. Measurements were continued for another 5 minutes. SUVs treated with botulinum toxin D, which cleaves VAMP2 and abolishes membrane fusion, served as negative control and the corresponding background fluorescence was subtracted. Measurements were normalized to total fluorescence after detergent lysis.</p>
<p>Complexin-II clamps spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent membrane fusion in the reconstituted assay (i.e. fusion before addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>), via laterally binding the membrane-proximal C-terminal ends of SNAP25 and VAMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Malsam et al., 2020</xref>). Remarkably, V48F and D166Y showed impaired clamping by complexin, as apparent by increased fusion before Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). The decreased clamping is likely caused by the reduced interaction of V48F and D166Y with Syt1. As a note, the clamping function of Syt1 becomes only obvious in the presence of complexin, whereas the clamping function of complexin depends on the presence of Syt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Malsam et al., 2012</xref>); thus, the clamping function of the two proteins cannot be separated. After Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggering, WT SNAP25 supported the largest amount of fusion, followed by V48F, whereas D166Y Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fusion was clearly reduced (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). Notably, this is the same sequence as found for evoked release in synapses, considering either the amplitude or the charge of the eEPSC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-C, F-G</xref>). Thus, the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay reproduces both the increased spontaneous release and the reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release found in neurons, indicating that these features are present within the minimal set of fusion proteins included in this assay (i.e. the SNAREs, Syt1 and complexin).</p>
<p>There is evidence that SNAP25 might enter the SNARE-complex last, after syntaxin-1 and VAMP2 are joined by Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jiao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78a">Sitarska et al., 2017</xref>), although another view is that a syntaxin/SNAP25 dimer bound to Munc18-1 acts as an intermediary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jakhanwal et al., 2017</xref>). In the former case, mutations changing association of SNAP25 to the SNAREs might change exocytosis efficiency. To test this, we used a syntaxin-1 GUV assay, where the incorporation of soluble SNAP25 into the SNARE complex becomes a rate-limiting step. In this assay, fusion kinetics are much slower when compared with fusion reactions containing GUVs with pre-assembled t-SNAREs. Accordingly, we allowed 30 min for pre-stimulation fusion to take place, and after addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (100 µM free Ca<sup>2+</sup>), fusion was followed for another 30 min (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). The assay was performed in the presence and absence of complexin-II. D166Y and to a lesser degree V48F revealed enhanced stimulation of fusion in comparison to WT before calcium was added, regardless of the presence or absence of complexin (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). Comparing data with and without complexin established that complexin barely suppressed spontaneous fusion in reactions containing the V48F mutant. The presence of complexin partially reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent fusion, but D166Y still stimulated pre-Ca<sup>2+</sup> fusion compared to wildtype. Overall, these data demonstrate that D166Y and V48F are gain-of-function mutants under conditions where SNAP25 association to the other SNAREs is rate limiting.</p>
<p>To test directly whether V48F and especially D166Y enhance SNARE interactions, co-flotation assays were performed. SUVs containing either syntaxin-1 (Stx-1), or VAMP2, or Syt1, or the Syt1/VAMP2 combination were incubated with SNAP25 and re-isolated by flotation using a Nycodenz density gradient. An additional reaction, reflecting the fusion assay, contained SNAP25 in combination with both Syt1/VAMP2 SUVs and Syntaxin-1 SUVs (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). SNAP25 recruitment for each condition was determined by SDS PAGE followed by Coomassie blue and silver staining. Silver stained SNAP25 bands were quantified, and the mutants were plotted relatively to the wildtype SNAP25 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref> and <xref rid="figs9-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 – Figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>SNAP25 WT did not show any binding to Syt1 SUVs (<xref rid="figs9-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 – Figure supplement 1</xref>), although direct interactions with Syt1 would be predicted based on the primary interface, indicating that such interactions are not stable under the employed conditions, which is expected because SNAP25 is unstructured until it binds its SNARE partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fasshauer et al., 1997</xref>). D166Y showed profoundly increased interactions with SUVs containing either syntaxin-1, or VAMP2, or Syt1/VAMP2, and the combination used in the fusion assay (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>; <xref rid="figs9-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 – Figure supplement 1</xref>). V48F displayed mildly increased binding to syntaxin-1 and Syt1/VAMP1 SUVs, and a tendency to increased association to VAMP2 SUVs (p=0.0629, one-sample t-test). These data show that loss of Syt1 interaction upon mutation in the primary interface can be accompanied by a gain-of-function phenotype stimulating interactions with the other SNARE-partners. This association of SNAP25 to the other SNAREs might happen as one of the last steps towards fusion; consequently, when D166Y and V48F join the complex prematurely, it will bypass layers of control and result in uncontrolled fusion.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>The I67N mutation supports an intact RRP, but an increased energy barrier for fusion</title>
<p>We next addressed the phenotype of the I67N disease mutation, which was found in an 11-year-old female, who suffered from myasthenia, cortical hyperexcitability, ataxia and intellectual disability, but with normal brain MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). The I67 is found within the interaction layer +4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fasshauer et al., 1998</xref>), which helps in assembly of the C-terminal of the SNARE-complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gao et al., 2012</xref>), and it might therefore have a different synaptic phenotype than V48F and D166Y.</p>
<p>In <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, SNARE-complexes formed with the I67N mutant displayed a lower stability, with the melting temperature reduced from 71°C to approximately 56°C (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>), as expected for a mutation that destabilizes the SNARE-complex. I67N also showed a strong decrease in SUV docking (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B-C</xref>), which is likely caused by the destabilization of the t-SNARE complex, which indirectly perturbs the Syt1 binding interface(s). In lipid mixing assays, I67N strongly reduced both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fusion, whether the t-SNAREs were preassembled (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D-E</xref>) or not (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B-C</xref>). The co-flotation assay did not display any binding of I67N to t-SNAREs or Syt1 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). The binding to Syt1/VAMP2 SUVs was reduced compared to SNAP25 WT, but since binding of the WT protein is already very low, the biological significance of this result is unclear. Overall, these data indicate that I67N is inferior in membrane fusion.</p>
<p>Lentiviruses encoding the I67N mutant N-terminally fused to EGFP expressed similar amounts as WT EGFP-SNAP25 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A-C</xref>). Expression in SNAP25 KO neurons resulted in reduced rescue of survival in neurons expressing I67N alone, whereas neurons co-expressing WT and I67N had intermediate survival, not significantly different from WT (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10D</xref>). Staining against MAP2 (dendritic marker) and VGlut1 (synapse marker) showed that the number of synapses on average was reduced in the I67N (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10E-F</xref>), and the dendritic length was on average reduced (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10G</xref>), but the changes did not reach statistical significance. Patch-clamp measurements demonstrated strongly reduced spontaneous release frequencies (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10H-J</xref>) and evoked release amplitude (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10K-L</xref>) with the I67N mutation, see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alten et al., 2021</xref>). mEPSCs were absent in most I67N expressing neurons, whereas WT and I67N co-expressing neurons had a very low mEPSC rate, much closer to the I67N than the WT phenotype; similar for eEPSC amplitudes and charges (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10I, L</xref>-M). The I67N therefore is dominant-negative for both types of release, in contrast to the incompletely dominant phenotypes of the V48F and D166Y mutants (see above). The fraction of synchronous release was unchanged in WT and I67N coexpressing neuron (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10N</xref>); this number could not be estimated for I67N-expressing neurons due to the low amount of release.</p>

<p>Reduced spontaneous and evoked release could result from a decrease in priming, or fusion, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we turned to sucrose applications. Application of 0.25M sucrose did not lead to any measurable release in I67N expressing cells, and only minimal release in cells co-expressing WT and I67N (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11B</xref>). This indicates that the energy barrier is increased in amplitude, and therefore the RRP might be underestimated when probed by 0.5M sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schotten et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, 0.5M sucrose displayed reduced release in the I67N and WT+I67N condition (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11C</xref>), but this could be due to defects in priming or fusion. To investigate this, we applied a stronger stimulus, 0.75M sucrose, to these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schotten et al., 2015</xref>). Strikingly, the RRP as assessed by 0.75M sucrose (RRP<sub>0.75</sub>) was unchanged between WT, I67N and WT+I67N co-expressed cells (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11E,G</xref>). Application of 0.375M sucrose led to small amounts of release in the I67N, but more in the WT+I67N co-expressed situation (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11F</xref>). Forming the ratio RRP<sub>0.375</sub>/RRP<sub>0.75</sub> revealed a statistically significant reduction in I67N compared to WT (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11H</xref>). Therefore, the RRP <italic>per se</italic> appears intact in the I67N (when probed by sufficiently high concentrations of sucrose), but the vesicles face a higher apparent fusion barrier, which makes the RRP appear smaller if assessed by 0.5M sucrose. The higher apparent fusion barrier explains the lower frequency of mEPSC in the I67N mutation, the lower degree of spontaneous fusion in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, as well as the lower amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release in vitro and in the cell.</p>

<p>The I67N mutation profoundly affected trains in 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11I</xref>) leading to strong facilitation, which is expected due to the strong phenotype of this mutation, which radically lowers release probability. Even when co-expressed with WT protein, the train facilitated over the first several stimulations, attesting to the strong dominant-negative feature of the I67N mutation (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11I-J</xref>). Consequently, the paired-pulse ratio was increased in the I67N and intermediate in the WT+I67N condition (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11K</xref>). Back-extrapolation of these trains was not reliable, because the low release probability in the I67N mutation made it impossible to achieve sufficient depletion of the RRP.</p>
<p>The energy barrier for fusion is exquisitely sensitive to the charges on the surface of the SNARE-complex, with positive charges decreasing and negative charges increasing the fusion barrier amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>). To investigate whether the same electrostatic mechanism applies to the I67N, we combined the I67N mutation with a mutation of four amino acids (“4K”=SNAP25 E183K/S187K/T190K/E194K) in the second SNARE-domain of SNAP25, constructing the quintuple mutation (“I67N/4K”=SNAP25 I67N/E183K/S187K/T190K/E194K). The 4K mutation lowers the energy barrier for fusion by increasing the charge of the SNARE-complex surface by +6 via charge introduction and charge reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>). The 4K-mutation increased the mEPSC release rate compared to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>), whereas in the combined I67N/4K mutation the spontaneous release rate was indistinguishable from WT (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12A-C</xref>), showing that increased positive charges rescued the defect of spontaneous release in the I67N mutant. Evoked release was also increased in the 4K mutation compared to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>), but in the I67N/4K mutation, evoked release was still strongly depressed compared to WT (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12D-E</xref>).

<p>We previously created a simple mathematical model that links the release rate to the number of charges added to the SNARE-complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>). This model includes both spontaneous and evoked release, which are separated by the addition of 35 positive charges in the latter case (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12F</xref>, black points are WT spontaneous and evoked release rates; blue line is the model fitted to WT data). Placing the spontaneous release rates for I67N and I67N/4K on this curve (by dividing the spontaneous release rate with RRP size and finding a corresponding charge-value using the model) resulted in two points (red) separated by 5.6 charges, which is close to the nominal 6 charges added by the 4K mutation (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12F</xref>). Similarly, evoked release in the I67N and the I67N/4K were separated by 5.9 charges (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12F</xref>). The fact that these numbers are close to the nominal 6 charges introduced shows that even for the I67N mutation, the same basal electrostatic model still applies, but the deleterious effect of the I67N on evoked release rates is larger than on spontaneous rates and therefore the rescue of evoked release rate by positive charges is insufficient to reach WT values. Moreover, because of the saturating form of the curve (i.e. the model) adding positive charges is an effective way of rescuing spontaneous, but not evoked release.</p>
<p>Overall, the I67N disease mutation increases the amplitude of the energy barrier for fusion, and it does so more for evoked than for spontaneous release, but the electrostatic mechanism, which we assume is part of release triggering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>), appears to be intact.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have shown that two SNAP25 mutations (V48F, D166Y) that compromise interaction with Syt1 lead to complex phenotypes characterized by a combination of loss-of-function and gain-of-function features. Thereby, the mutations fall into the ‘neomorph’ category, where the mutated protein has novel or changed interactions or functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Verhage and Sorensen, 2020</xref>). In contrast, the I67N substitution within the SNARE-bundle is a dominant-negative mutation.</p>

<title>SNAP25 disease mutations change protein-protein interactions and the energy landscape of fusion</title>
<p>Both the V48F and the D166Y resulted in a decrease in the amplitude of the apparent energy barrier for fusion, whereas the I67N increased the amplitude of the apparent fusion barrier. A vesicle’s release willingness can only be assessed by fusing it; therefore, it is not possible to distinguish between effects on the fusion barrier <italic>per se</italic>, and effects on the fusion machinery. In recognition of this fact, we here refer to the “apparent energy barrier”. Using Arrhenius’ equation to convert fusion, priming and depriming rates to their respective energy barrier heights (see Materials and Methods for the assumptions behind this procedure), we can derive the energy landscape for fusion of the three mutants (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13A-D</xref>). This shows the multiple changes in the V48F and D166Y, which affect at least two different barriers (priming and fusion, <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig 13A-B</xref>), leading to a complex phenotype, whereas for I67N the fusion barrier is primarily (or solely) affected (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13D</xref>).</p>

<p>When combining the I67N with the 4K-mutation, which introduces 6 extra positive fixed charges, we could place our data within the framework of our model for electrostatic triggering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>) and show that the effect of charge <italic>per se</italic> is approximately the same in the I67N mutant as in the WT. Note that there are endogenous positively charged amino acids towards the C-terminal end of SNAP25 that are important for release rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fang et al., 2015</xref>). Rescue of spontaneous release was completed by adding 6 positive charges, which is consistent with the idea that the assembly of the C-terminal end of the SNARE-complex, which is compromised by I67N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rebane et al., 2018</xref>), works against the electrostatic energy barrier, which is affected by the SNARE surface charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, rescue of evoked release by charges were incomplete, due to the larger effect of I67N on evoked release, combined with the shallow effect of charges on evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>). The larger susceptibility of evoked release to C-terminal mutation of the SNAREs might be partly due to the higher number of SNARE-complexes involved in evoked than in sustained/spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mohrmann et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The effect of the I67N mutation in the energy domain at rest can be calculated from the spontaneous release rate, which was reduced by a factor 22.4 (from 1.31 ± 0.36 to 0.0583 ± 0.0274 Hz). This corresponds to an effect in the energy domain of 3.1 k<sub>B</sub>T (where k<sub>B</sub> is Boltzmann’s constant; assuming unchanged RRP size, pool normalization is not required). Work with single-molecular optical tweezers showed that the I67N mutation destabilizes the overall SNARE C-terminal and linker domain, which are supposed to deliver the power stroke for membrane fusion, by 14 k<sub>B</sub>T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rebane et al., 2018</xref>), which is substantially more. The reduction in spontaneous release rate is more comparable to the reduction in the transition rate of folding by the C-terminal and linker domain by a factor of ∼10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rebane et al., 2018</xref>). Since at least three SNARE-complexes, possibly more, contribute to vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Manca et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mohrmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Shi et al., 2012</xref>), folding kinetics correlates better to spontaneous fusion rates than overall SNARE-complex stability.</p>
<p>The D166Y and V48F mutations lead to increases in spontaneous release, and more asynchronous eEPSCs, consistent with their localization in the primary SNARE:Syt1 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schupp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), and the demonstrated impaired Syt1 binding (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B-C</xref>), see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alten et al., 2021</xref>). These phenotypes are at first glance similar to Syt1 knockout/knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bouazza-Arostegui et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>). However, when normalized to the RRP size, mEPSC frequencies were much higher in the V48F and the D166Y than in the <italic>Syt1</italic> KO (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>), and dual sucrose applications indicated a decrease in the amplitude of the sucrose-probed apparent energy barrier and increased release probability, features not found in the <italic>Syt1</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bouazza-Arostegui et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huson et al., 2020</xref>). This indicates a gain-of-function feature of these mutations, which fulfills D166Y&gt;V48F; such a feature was identified as an increased interaction of V48F and D166Y with VAMP2- and syntaxin-1-containing SUVs (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>); the interaction was stronger for D166Y than for V48F. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of the SNAP25 mutants did not reveal major structural changes in the SNAP25 backbone compared to WT (<xref rid="figs9-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 - Figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). Nevertheless, the calculation of electrostatic (Coulomb) and van der Waals (Lennard-Jonson, LJ) interactions for residues 48-52 (<xref rid="figs9-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 - Figure supplement 2D</xref>) and residues 162-166 (<xref rid="figs9-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 - Figure supplement 2E</xref>) shows that for D166Y the interaction energy is substantially more negative. This suggests that the interaction between D166Y and nearby residue H162 is stronger than in WT. Overall, this may result in stabilization of a structure consistent with SNARE-complex formation and explain why D166Y is a stronger gain-of-function mutation than V48F. However, note that the AlphaFold prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>) used as a starting point for these simulations is identical to the structure of SNAP25 in the assembled SNARE-complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), whereas unassembled SNAP25 is likely less structured or unstructured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fasshauer et al., 1997</xref>). Overall, these disease mutants do not only fail in their interaction with Syt1, they bypass fusion control, resulting in premature SNARE-complex assembly. Although the increased spontaneous release rate might cause patient symptoms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alten et al. (2021)</xref> suggested that the resulting postsynaptic depolarization might compensate for the smaller eEPSC amplitude to normalize the overall firing rate.</p>
<p>In a SUV:GUV fusion assay, where folding of SNAP25 onto syntaxin-1/VAMP2 is rate-limiting, D166Y and V48F caused an increase in pre-stimulation fusion rates. This is consistent with recent data showing that folding of SNAP25 onto a template formed by VAMP2 and syntaxin-1 held in place by Munc18-1 might be a late, rate-limiting, step in exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jiao et al., 2018</xref>). This process is regulated and sped up by Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kalyana Sundaram et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). The fact that a similar effect on spontaneous fusion was seen in the assay with preformed t-SNAREs in the presence of complexin indicates that there is an assembly step, even in that assay, which can be sped up by the mutations. This aligns with the demonstration by single molecule FRET of a further assembled (‘tighter’) state of the trans-SNARE-complex induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-unbound Syt1, which becomes committed for fusion once Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Das et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>V48F and D166Y change the size of the RRP via effects on priming, depriming and fusion</title>
<p>We found that V48F and D166Y cause a decrease in RRP size, whether measured by sucrose application or by train stimulation. The reduced RRP appears to be at variance with the publication by Alten et al., who used sucrose application to larger mixed cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alten et al., 2021</xref>). There might be several reasons for this discrepancy. First, Alten et al. used longer duration of sucrose application (∼1 min) and applied sucrose to a large mixed culture, which might result in a variable delay such that all synapses are not stimulated simultaneously. This will result in temporally overlapping release of RRP and upstream vesicle pools, which then cannot be distinguished from each other. When grown on 50-µm micro-islands, sucrose can be applied acutely (within ∼0.05 s) to the entire dendritic tree and all synapses using a local perfusion system, which allows distinguishing the RRP from upstream pools. Second, Alten assessed the RRP for GABAergic synaptic transmission in mixed culture, whereas we measured the RRP for glutamatergic neurons in autaptic culture. The RRP has a different substructure in the two types of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Moulder and Mennerick, 2005</xref>), which might lead to different findings. Third, it was recently shown that sufficient neuronal maturation is necessary to detect the decrease in RRP upon Syt1 elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bouazza-Arostegui et al., 2022</xref>), which is likely modulated by the presence of other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Wierda and Sorensen, 2014</xref>). This adds an additional layer of complexity since neuronal maturation likely varies between laboratories.</p>
<p>Dissection of the three rates that determine RRP size (priming, depriming and fusion rates) showed that all three are changed in the V48F and D166Y mutations. Especially for D166Y, but also for V48F, spontaneous release contributed to RRP depletion by triggering premature fusion. Significant RRP depletion has not been expected for moderate increases in mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rhee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>), based on the argument that RRP refilling should be fast enough to counteract depletion. However, to properly make this argument, priming, depriming and spontaneous release rates must be compared in the steady-state situation. Similarly, we recently showed by cryo-electron tomography that the 4K-mutation, which increased the mEPSC frequency to ∼30 Hz and had a reduced RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>) caused a loss of synaptic vesicles tethered to the membrane with three tethers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Radecke et al., 2023</xref>), which is the structural correlate of the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fernandez-Busnadiego et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The major effect on RRP size is caused by a reduction in forward priming rate by D166Y and V48F. Comparison to the Syt1 KO showed qualitatively similar changes, but of a smaller magnitude, with spontaneous release playing a negligible role for RRP size. Notably, in all three cases a reduction in depriming rate partly counteracted the lowered priming rate (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) – this was only significant for D166Y. Indeed, part of the role of Syt1:SNARE interaction might be catalytic, lowering the energy level of a transition state along the path to priming, which will affect both rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Walter et al., 2013</xref>). This might happen because transient binding to Syt1 might structure SNAP25 and assist in formation of the SNARE-complex, whereas SNAP25 mutants might prestructure the protein, bypassing the need for Syt1. In an energy diagram (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref>) it becomes clear that vesicle priming and regulation of spontaneous release are interdependent. Stabilization of the RRP state will both increase RRP size at rest and reduce spontaneous release, since lowering the energy level of (i.e. stabilizing) RRP vesicles will increase the size of the energy barrier that the RRP vesicles face (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref>). Consistently, downregulation (clamping) of spontaneous release and upregulation of evoked release are often interdependent under conditions where Syt1 expression level, or Syt1 interaction with the SNAREs, are up or down regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Courtney et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Courtney et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Vevea and Chapman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). This does not rule out the existence of mutations that can affect one mode of release more than the other (e.g. the I67N/4K mutation). By inference, assembly of the primary Syt1:SNARE interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>) is most likely involved in both clamping release and setting up a RRP. In further support of this, the minimal <italic>in vitro</italic> assay with preassembled t-SNARE dimers displayed a qualitatively similar reduction in calcium-dependent release, with D166Y being more impaired than V48F (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). Overall, the energetic contribution of Syt1:SNARE interaction to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release is a stabilization of upstream steps, and the increase of the fusion barrier downstream of the RRP (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref>). The electrostatic nature of the fusion barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>) ensures its rapid dissolution by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, possibly by unbinding of Syt1 from the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Voleti et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>For the I67N-mutation, the sucrose-RRP was also reduced in size when using 0.5 M sucrose, which is consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alten et al., 2021</xref>). However, when the energy barrier for release is increased, 0.5 M sucrose is insufficient to deplete the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schotten et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, 0.75 M sucrose released an RRP of similar size in WT, I67N and I67N+WT co-expressing cells, showing that the vesicle priming reaction is intact, but the vesicles face a larger fusion barrier (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>). In this mutant, train stimulations in the I67N or co-expressed WT + I67N case resulted in a phenotype quite distinct from the WT, with strong facilitation throughout the train. Thus, the I67N is a strongly dominant-negative mutant, whether considering mEPSC frequency, eEPSC amplitude or train stimulations, whereas V48F and D166Y are incompletely dominant. This can be explained by the different function of SNAP25 domains during fusion, where V48 and D166 help set up an arrested primed vesicle state by interacting with Syt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schupp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), whereas I67 participates in the final conformational change, the ‘stroke’ that leads to assembly of the C-terminal end of the complex and the linker domain. Due to their defect in priming, V48F and D166Y might not enter the super-complex (the complex of SNARE-complexes driving fusion) as often as WT protein. In contrast, I67N will readily enter the super-complex and compromise its function, which will lead to a dominant-negative phenotype due to the multiple SNARE-complexes involved in fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mohrmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Shi et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Back-extrapolation of 40 Hz trains (@4 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>) also led to the conclusion that V48F and D166Y have a reduced RRP<sub>ev</sub>, the RRP-subpool that action potentials draw on, and a reduced forward priming rate. Interestingly, the release probability when normalized to the sucrose pool (RRP<sub>0.5</sub>) was increased non-significantly for the V48F and significantly for the D166Y mutation, but when considering 40Hz trains, the release probabilities of both mutations were decreased, consistent with a shift towards facilitation. The latter finding is likely caused by the defective interaction with Syt1, which leads to suboptimal priming and/or defective super-priming, which is an additional priming step after entry of the vesicle into the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Taschenberger et al., 2016</xref>). This will lead to reduction of the first eEPSC of a train and thereby a lowered nominal release probability. However, when comparing the eEPSC charge to the RRP<sub>0.5</sub>, the strong reduction in the RRP<sub>0.5</sub> pool (especially in the D166Y mutation) accounts for the increase in the overall release probability. This can be explained if spontaneous release causes a disproportional depletion of vesicles, which are in the RRP<sub>0.5</sub>, but not in the RRP<sub>ev</sub>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>SNAP25 disease missense mutations change the function of the protein without compromising its expression, leading to dominant negative or neomorphic mutations. Missense mutations in the primary SNARE:Syt1 interface (V48F, D166Y) result in a complex phenotype characterized by loss-of-function in the priming step and gain-of-function in the fusion step. Missense mutation in the SNARE-bundle (I67N) leads to an increased amplitude of the energy barrier for fusion. In addition, disease mutations display inefficient rescue of neuronal survival. Overall, SNAP25 encephalopathy caused by single missense point mutations presents with interdependent functional deficits, which must be overcome for successful treatment.</p>

Glial cells were washed with pre-warmed HBSS-HEPES. Trypsin was added and the flasks were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min.

Pups were selected based on the absence of motion after tactile stimulation and bloated neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Washbourne et al., 2002</xref>); the genotype was confirmed by PCR in all cases. The cortices were isolated from the brains in the HBSS-HEPES medium. The meninges were removed and the hippocampi were cut from the cortices before being transferred to 0.25% trypsin dissolved in HBSS-HEPES solution. The hippocampi were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, subsequently washed with HBSS-HEPES, triturated and the cell count was determined with a Bürker chamber before plating on the islands (7000-8000 neurons per well). Cells were incubated in the NB medium (Neurobasal with 2% B-27, 1 M HEPES, 0,26% Glutamax, 14,3 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 20000 IU Penicillin, 20 mg Streptomycin) and used for measurements between DIV10-14.</p>
<p>Hippocampal neurons for high-density cell culture for Western blotting were obtained from P0-P1 CD1 outbred mice. The dissection, tissue digestion and cell counting were performed the same way as the neurons for the autaptic culture, the high-density culture (600,000 neurons per well) was then kept in NB-A medium (Neurobasal-A with 2% B-27, 1 M HEPES, 0,26% Glutamax, 20000 IU Penicillin, 20 mg Streptomycin) and half the volume of the media was replaced every 2-3 days before harvesting the cells at DIV14.</p>

<p>Autaptic cultures were used from DIV10 until DIV14. The intracellular pipette medium contained: KCl 136 mM, HEPES 17.8 mM, Creatine Phosphate 15 mM, Na-ATP 4 mM, Creatine Phosphokinase 50 U, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 4.6 mM, EGTA 1 mM (pH 7.4, osmolarity ∼300 mOsm). The standard extracellular recording medium contained: NaCl 140 mM, KCl 2.4 mM, HEPES 10 mM, Glucose 14 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2 mM.

An Axio Observer A1 inverted microscope (Zeiss) was used to visualize the cells. The recordings were performed at room temperature. An EPC10 amplifier (HEKA) was used with the program Patchmaster v2.73 (HEKA). Traces were filtered with a 3kHz Bessel low-pass filter and data were acquired at 20 kHz. The series resistance was compensated to 70%. Glass pipettes were freshly pulled on a P1000 pipette puller (Sutter Instruments) from borosilicate glass capillaries. Pipets ranging from 2.5 to 5 MΩ were selected for recordings. Cells with starting access resistance above 10 MΩ were rejected. Recordings were performed in voltage clamp, with the holding potential kept at -70 mV. Evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSC) were induced by raising the holding voltage to 0 mV for 2 ms. Sucrose was dissolved into the standard extracellular recording medium. Application of the extracellular media was done using a custom-made barrel system, controlled by SF-77B perfusion fast step (Warner Instruments) controlled via digital output switches from the EPC10. Electrophysiological data was analyzed in IGOR Pro (v6.21 and v6.37, WaveMetrics) using a custom-written script. mEPSCs were analyzed with MiniAnalysis (v6.0.7, Synaptosoft).</p>

<title>Electrophysiological data: Calculations</title>
<p>Deconvolution was calculated and the electrostatic model for triggering was fitted to 4K and I67N/4K data as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>). Since the evoked release for I67N was so small that deconvolution became unreliable, we downscaled the peak release rate of the I67N/4K mutation with a factor of 5.616, corresponding to the reduction in eEPSC amplitude in the I67N compared to I67N/4K.</p>
<p>In order to determine the reasons for the reduced RRP size for V48F and D166Y, we considered a single pool model for the RRP, with priming rate <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic>, depriming rate <italic>k<sub>-1</sub></italic>, and fusion rate <italic>k<sub>f</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). The equation describing the evolution in RRP size is:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="541607v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic> has the unit vesicles/s, whereas <italic>k<sub>-1</sub></italic>, and <italic>k<sub>f</sub></italic> have the unit 1/s. The solution of this differential equation is
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="541607v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The steady-state RPP size is
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="541607v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The miniature release rate at steady state is
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="541607v2_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
When stimulated by sucrose, <italic>k<sub>f</sub></italic> increases, and if <italic>k<sub>f</sub></italic> &gt;&gt; <italic>k<sub>-1</sub></italic> (for justification, see below) the current plateau will report on the forward priming rate alone:
<disp-formula id="eqn5a">
<graphic xlink:href="541607v2_eqn5a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Thus, the current plateau during sucrose application can be used for estimating the forward priming rate. However, application of 0.5 M sucrose causes cell shrinkage and changes in solution viscosity, which in turn can change the leak current. This might cause the plateau current to change, which might be invisible during the experiment due to the synaptic events. To correct for this, we implemented variance-mean analysis to identify the true baseline current (the current corresponding to the lack of synaptic release). Synaptic release is essentially a source of shot noise, for which the variance is proportional to the mean. We therefore calculated the variance (after subtraction of a running average) and mean of the current in 50 ms intervals during the sucrose application, and performed linear regression in a variance-mean plot. The corrected baseline was identified by backextrapolation to the variance level found in the absence of synaptic activity (using a stretch of current before sucrose application), as illustrated in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>.</p>
<p>If sucrose does not sufficiently increase <italic>k<sub>f</sub></italic>, the <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5a">equation 5a</xref> above would be replaced by
<disp-formula id="eqn5b">
<graphic xlink:href="541607v2_eqn5b.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>N<sub>suc</sub></italic> is the fold-increase in <italic>k<sub>f</sub></italic> induced by sucrose application. Plotting the solutions to Eqs 3, 4, and 5b at different values of <italic>N<sub>suc</sub></italic>, the dependency of the estimated <italic>k<sub>-1</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic> upon <italic>N<sub>suc</sub></italic> can be investigated (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> – Figure supplement 1). Notably, in wildtype cells <italic>N<sub>suc</sub></italic> &gt;5,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schotten et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that the estimated values of <italic>k<sub>-1</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic> using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5a">Eq. 5a</xref> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) is quite accurate for the WT case, and the estimation in the case of the D166Y and V48F is even less dependent on <italic>N<sub>suc</sub></italic>, because the value of <italic>k<sub>f</sub></italic> is higher at rest (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> – Figure supplement 1). Importantly, for no realistic value of <italic>N<sub>suc</sub></italic> would the conclusion of decreased <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>-1</sub></italic> in the two mutants be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>For calculating the energy profiles of WT and mutants, we used Arrhenius’ Equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="541607v2_eqn6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>E<sub>A</sub></italic> is the activation energy, R and T are the gas constants and the absolute temperature, respectively, and A is an empirical constant that depends on collision rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schotten et al., 2015</xref>). Solving for the activation energy, we get:
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="541607v2_eqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Since A is unknown, we cannot use this equation to calculate the absolute values of the transition energies; however, when we compare a mutation to the WT condition, and under the assumption that A is unchanged by mutation, we can calculate the difference in energy level of the transition states:
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="541607v2_eqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Using this equation sequentially, for the priming rate, the depriming rate and the fusion rate, we can derive the entire energy diagram, under the additional assumption that the energy in the pre-primed state is identical between WT and mutation, and using that at room temperature, RT=2.479 kJ/mol.</p>
<p>The assumption that the empiric factor, <italic>A</italic>, is unchanged by mutation is likely to hold for the fusion reaction, which depends on conformational changes in a preformed complex. In contrast, collision rates might be involved in priming; in that case, the effect of the V48F and D166Y mutations on priming, which we here attribute to an increase in the energy level of the priming transition state might reflect a lower collision rate between vesicles and plasma membrane fusion machinery, and/or a lower energy level of the pre-primed state.</p>

T-SNARE-GUVs (28 nmol lipid, 30 ± 1,4 pmol t-SNARE) were preincubated with VAMP2/Syt1-SUVs (5 nmol lipid, 9 pmol VAMP2, 4 pmol Syt1) on ice in 100 µL fusion buffer (20 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.4, 135 mM KCl, 1mM DTT) with 0.1 mM EGTA and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. After 10 min incubation, the reactions were underlaid with 20 µL of a sucrose cushion (1 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.4, 60 mM sucrose, 1 mM DTT) and the GUVs with attached SUVs were re-isolated by centrifugation for 10 min. After removing the supernatant, the pellets (in 10 µL remaining volume) were resuspended, transferred into new tubes, treated with 100 µL of 1% SDS/1% DDM and the SUV recovery was determined by measuring the Atto488 fluorescence.</p>
<p>To determine the respective inputs, 28 nmol GUV lipids or 5 nmol SUV lipids were treated with 1% SDS/1% DDM (final) and the corresponding Atto647 and Atto488 fluorescence was measured at λ<sub>ex</sub> = 620/40 nm, λ<sub>em</sub> = 680/30 nm and λ<sub>ex</sub> = 485/20 nm, λ<sub>em</sub> = 528/20 nm, respectively. A sample lacking SUVs was used to determine the GUV recovery (usually 80-95%). GUV recovery of each sample was used to normalize the respective SUV docking. A sample without GUVs was used to determine the absolute background (usually &lt;15%), which was subtracted from all samples.</p>

<title>SNAP25 recruitment assay / SUV flotation assay</title>
<p>Small unilamellar liposomes (SUVs) containing 35 pmol syntaxin-1A or 210 pmol VAMP2 and/or 100 pmol Synaptotagmin-1 (66 nmol lipid for Stx1-, V2/Syt1- or Syt1-SUVs, 40 nmol lipid for V2-SUVs) were mixed with 180 pmol SNAP25 in a final assay volume of 50 µl in fusion buffer (20 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.4, 135 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT). After two hours on ice, allowing the SNARE complex formation, the samples were diluted five times with fusion buffer and mixed with the equivalent volume of 80% nycodenz solution. After overlaying the sample with 100 µl 35% nycodenz, 25 µl 20% nycodenz solution and finally with 5 µl fusion buffer in an ultra-clear tube (5 x 41 mm), the liposomes were isolated by centrifugation for 3 h 40 mins at 55,000 rpm at 4°C in a SW 60 rotor (SW 60 Ti, Beckman). 20 µl were harvested from the top of the gradient and mixed with 8 µl of 4x Laemmli buffer (final 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 50 mM ß-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). 18 µl of this mixture were used to quantify the amount of recruited SNAP25 by SDS PAGE followed by Coomassie Staining and Silver Staining. Using the Fiji software (Image J based) the Coomassie stained band intensity of syntaxin-1A or VAMP2 or Syt1, respectively, were determined and normalized to the respective mean. Subsequently, Silver Staining was used to quantify the band intensities of SNAP25, and these values were normalized to the intensities of the relative protein (e.g. Syntaxin-1A) based on the Coomassie Staining. From this, the ratios between the SNAP25 mutants and wild type were determined.</p>

<title>Temperature-dependent dissociation of v-/t-SNARE complexes in SDS</title>
<p>SNARE complex stability was determined as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schupp et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, preassembled full-length t-SNARE complexes (WT and mutants, 10 µM) were incubated with the cytoplasmic domain of VAMP2 (30 µM) in 25 mM MOPS (3-(Nmorpholino) propanesulfonic acid)-KOH, pH 7.4, 135 mM KCl, 1% Octyl ß-D-glucopyranoside, 1 mM Dithiothreitol, 10 mM TECEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride)-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.4 overnight at 0°C and subsequently for 1 h at 25°C. Subsequently, 37 µl of reaction mixture (36 µg of total protein) was diluted with 213 µl of 1x Laemmli buffer. 7.5 µl aliquots were incubated at the indicated temperatures for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% gels) and proteins were visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue staining. Temperature-dependent dissociation of the SNARE complex was quantified by the appearance of free syntaxin-1A (35 kDa protein band released from the high MW SNARE complex) using the Fiji (Image J based) software. Data were normalized to the maximum value of a measurement set.</p>

<title>Silver Staining</title>
<p>Coomassie prestained gels from SDS PAGE were destained overnight in destain solution (30 % methanol, 10 % acetic acid). Gels were gently washed 30 minutes with 10% ethanol and one minute with 0.02% sodium thiosulfate. After short washing with deionized water, gels were stained (0.03% paraformaldehyde, 0.002% silver nitrate) for 15 minutes and again quickly washed with water. Developing solution (0.06% sodium carbonate, 0.018% paraformaldehyde, 0.0002% sodium thiosulfate) was applied to the gels until protein band intensities were satisfactorily stained. The reactions were stopped by replacing the staining solution with 0.07% acetic acid. Gels were scanned and quantified by using the Fiji (Image J based) software.</p>

<title>Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations</title>
<p>Simulations were carried out at the atomic level using classical molecular dynamics (MD). We used the CHARMM36m force field for protein, CHARMM TIP3P for water, and the standard CHARMM36 for ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). GROMACS 2022 software package was used for performing these simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>). The 3D structure of SNAP25 wild-type protein was generated through AlphaFold2, utilizing the first ranked structure obtained using the default settings of ColabFold v1.5.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>). Both wild-type and the V48F and D166Y mutant variants’ topology files and initial 3D structures, inclusive of water and ions, were produced via the CHARMM-GUI web interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). All systems were hydrated, neutralized with counter ions, and supplemented with 150 mM potassium chloride to replicate experimental conditions. Following the CHARMM-GUI recommended protocol, systems were energy-minimized, equilibrated under NpT conditions, temperature-stabilized at 310 K by the Nose-Hoover thermostat with a 1.0 ps time constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Evans and Holian, 1985</xref>), and maintained a constant 1 atm pressure via the Parrinello– Rahman barostat, setting the time constant at 5.0 ps and an isothermal compressibility at 4.5 × 10<sup>−5</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>). Isotropic pressure coupling was utilized in the simulations. The Verlet scheme determined neighbor searches, updating once every 20 steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Verlet, 1967</xref>). Electrostatics were computed using the Particle Mesh Ewald method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Darden et al., 1993</xref>) with parameters set to a 0.12 nm spacing, a tolerance 10<sup>-5</sup>, and a 1.2 nm cut-off. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all three dimensions. Simulations ran with a 2 fs timestep until 800 ns was achieved. As shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> – Figure Supplement 2 panel A, the structures used for protein alignment represent the predominant structure from the most populated cluster. Clustering was based on the RMSD value using the GROMACS “gmx cluster” tool and the Gromos algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Daura et al., 1999</xref>), setting an RMSD cut-off for neighbor structures at 0.6 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Legrand et al., 2020</xref>). The RMSD analysis was conducted using the average structure of the wild-type as a reference. Interaction energies, including both short-range Coulomb and Lennard-Jones forces, were computed throughout the 800 ns trajectory. The autocorrelation function of the data indicated that correlations diminished substantially after approximately 6 ns. Given this reduced correlation, we adopted a block size of 200 ns to ensure statistical independence between blocks. All structures generated using AlphaFold2, as well as the initial structures and topology files for atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, were deposited to ZENODO (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10051665)</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Graphs (bar and line) display mean ± SEM with all points displayed, except when otherwise noted; for electrophysiological experiments <italic>n</italic> denotes the number of cells recorded and is given in the legends. For <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments the number of biological replicates was 3 unless stated otherwise in the legends. Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Unless otherwise noted, statistical differences between several groups were determined by one-way ANOVA; post-test was Dunnett’s test comparing to the WT condition as a reference, unless otherwise noted. Equal variance of groups was tested by the Brown-Forsythe test; in case of a significant test, the Brown-Forsythe ANOVA test, which does not assume equal variances, was used instead. Kruskal-Wallis test was used in cases, where the data structure contained many identical values (zeros). Pairwise testing was carried out using unpaired t-test, or Welch’s t-test in case of significantly different variances as determined by an F-test. The test is mentioned in the Figure legend; if no test is mentioned, the difference was not significantly different. Significance was assumed when p&lt;0.05 and the level of significance is indicated by asterisk: * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001, **** p &lt; 0.0001.</p>

<p>This study documents <bold>important</bold> findings on three variants in SNAP25 that are associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The thorough characterization of synaptic release and in vitro vesicle fusion phenotypes provides interesting information about the nature of the SNAP25 variants. The evidence supporting the claims is <bold>compelling</bold>, and this work will be of interest to neuroscientists working on SNAP25, SNAP25-associated encephalopathy, and synaptic vesicle exocytosis.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Kadkova et al. describes an electrophysiological analysis of 3 neurodevelopmental disease-causing SNAP-25 mutations in hippocampal neuron autaptic cultures. The work expands on a prior study of these 3 mutations, along with several others in SNAP-25, that was performed in acutely dissociated hippocampal cultures by another group (Alten et al, 2021). Most of the physiology defects found are pretty similar for the 3 mutations the two research groups characterized, with differences largely found in the effects on the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of SVs. These differences could be due to technical differences in the approach but are also likely to reflect in part differences in autapses as a model that have been previously described. In addition to the physiological analysis in cultured neurons, the current work extends the analysis beyond the prior study by analyzing the effects of these SNAP-25 mutations in in vitro liposome fusion assays with purified proteins, and some modeling of the effects on energy landscapes during priming and fusion.</p>
<p>The authors use lentiviral expression of wildtype or one of the 3 mutants in SNAP-25 autaptic neurons and assay neuronal survival and synaptic output. The authors also combine wildtype with each of the 3 mutants as well, given these diseases manifest as spontaneous mutations in only 1 of the SNAP-25 alleles, suggesting a dominant effect. The authors observe that the V48F and D166Y alleles (that are suggested to disrupt the Syt1-SNAP-25/SNARE interface) result in a very large increase in spontaneous release that exceeds the Syt1 null mutant alone, suggesting an effect on spontaneous SV release beyond a lack of Syt1 regulation of SNARE-mediated fusion. In contrast, Syt1 nulls have a much more severe loss of evoked release, through both V48F and D166Y also have modest decreases in release. They find both mutants also cause a decrease in the RRP. Applying some modeling for these results, the authors suggest V48F and D166Y lowers the energy barrier for fusion, creating the enhanced spontaneous release rates and causing a decrease of the RRP. They also find evidence for reduced SV priming. In contrast, a SNAP-25 I167N disease mutation in the SNARE assembly interaction layer causes dramatic decreases in both evoked and spontaneous release, consistent with a disruption to SNARE assembly/stability. In vitro fusion assays with these mutant SNAP-25 alleles was also done and provided supportive evidence for these interpretations for all 3 alleles. The ability to control calcium, Syt1, PIP2 and Complexin levels in the in vitro assays provided additional information on defining the precise steps of the fusion process these mutations disrupt. Together, the study indicates the I167N mutation acts as a dominant-negative allele to block fusion, while the other two alleles have both loss- and gain-of function properties that cause more complex disruptions that decrease evoked release while dramatically enhancing spontaneous fusion.</p>
<p>Overall, these results build on prior work and shed light on how disruptions to the SNAP-25 t-SNARE alter the process of SV priming and fusion.</p>

<p>Kádková, Murach, Pedersen, and colleagues studied how three disease-causing missense mutations in SNAP25 affect synaptic vesicle exocytosis. These mutations have previously been studied by Alten et al., 2021. The authors observed similar impairments in spontaneous and evoked release as Alten et al., 2021, but the measurement of readily releasable pool (RRP) size differed between the two studies. The authors found that the V48F and D166Y mutations affect the interaction with the Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), but do not entirely phenocopy Syt1 loss-of-function because they also exhibit a gain-of-function. Thus, these mutations affect multiple aspects of the energy landscape for vesicle priming and fusion. The I67N mutation specifically increases the fusion energy barrier without affecting upstream vesicle priming.</p>
<p>The strength of the study includes careful and technically excellent dissection of the synaptic release process and a combination of electrophysiology, biophysics, and modeling approaches. This study gained a deeper mechanistic understanding of these mutations in vesicle exocytosis than the previous study but did not result in a paradigm shift in our understanding of SNAP25-associated encephalopathy because the same spontaneous and evoked release phenotypes were previously identified.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors fully addressed the two previous technical concerns and improved the introduction of the paper.</p>

<p>1. The authors discussed possible reasons for the different results of the RRP sizes between this study and Alten et al., 2021. One of them is how the hypertonic solution is applied. The authors thought that the long application of hypertonic solution in Alten et al., 2021 caused an overlapping release of RRP and upstream vesicle pools because Alten et al., 2021 measured 10-fold larger RRP size than what was measured in this study. However, Alten et al., 2021 measured RRP from IPSCs and a single inhibitory vesicle fusion causes larger charge transfer than an excitatory vesicle. The authors need to take this into consideration and 10-fold is likely an overestimate.</p>

<p>Answer: Thank you for pointing out this important difference. We have modified the text in the Discussion accordingly and we no longer refer to the 10-fold difference.</p>

<p>1. Statistical tests should be performed for protein expression levels (Fig 2A and Fig 10A) and in vitro fusion assays (Fig 8D,E and Fig 9 B,C).</p>

<p>Answer: We inserted new panels B and C in Fig. 2 and Fig. 10 showing all the Western Blot data and performed statistical tests (none were significant). For the in vitro fusion assays, we have inserted statistical tests in panels 8E and 9C. The quantities in those panels (subdivided into “Pre Ca2+”, “post Ca2+” and “end fusion”) are based on the data in Figure 8D and 9B. We have therefore not inserted separate statistical tests in Figures 8D and 9B.</p>

<p>It would be quite interesting for future studies to address how these three mutations in SNAP-25 behave in the Syt1 null background in their electrophysiological experiments. Does the I167N allele block the enhanced spontaneous release in the Syt1 null? Do the V48F and D1667 alleles synergize with Syt1 to enhance spontaneous release to even higher levels? By examining how different components interact to shape the energy landscape for priming and fusion, these types of approaches should be quite revealing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We agree with the reviewer that these future studies would be interesting. Unfortunately, they are beyond our current capacities.</p>

<p>1. In the introduction, when discussing haploinsufficiency of Munc18-1 causes a decrease in release, additional references should be included, for example, the studies in flies (Wu et al., 1998, EMBO), human neurons (Patzke et al., 2015 JCI), and mouse neurons (Toonen et al., 2006 PNAS; Chen et al., 2020 eLife).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Thank you for the suggestion. We have rewritten the text and added additional references.</p>

<p>1. The authors may consider introducing additional motivations and significance of this study. For example, the evoked EPSCs cannot be properly measured in the cultures of Alten et al., 2021, but was properly studied here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We agree and have added additional motivations in the Introduction.</p>
