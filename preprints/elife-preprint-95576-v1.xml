<title>Summary</title><p>Neuronal aging and neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by proteostasis collapse, while cellular factors that trigger it are not identified. Impaired mitochondrial transport in the axon is another feature of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Using <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we found that genetic depletion of axonal mitochondria causes dysregulation of translation and protein degradation. Axons with mitochondrial depletion showed abnormal protein accumulation, and autophagic defects. Lowering neuronal ATP levels by blocking glycolysis did not reduce autophagy, suggesting that autophagic defects are associated with mitochondrial distribution. We found eIF2β was upregulated by depletion of axonal mitochondria via proteome analysis. Phosphorylation of eIF2α, another subunit of eIF2, was lowered, and global translation was suppressed. Neuronal overexpression of <italic>eIF2β</italic> phenocopied the autophagic defects and neuronal dysfunctions, and lowering <italic>eIF2β</italic> expression rescued those perturbations caused by depletion of axonal mitochondria. These results indicate the mitochondria-eIF2β axis maintains proteostasis in the axon, of which disruption may underly the onset and progression of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurons have a morphologically complex architecture composed of microcompartments and require tight regulation of the abundance of proteins and organelles spatially and temporally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Such control of protein amounts, or proteostasis, is essential for neuronal functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and is achieved through the orchestration of protein expression, folding, trafficking, and degradation controlled by intrinsic and environmental signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Translation is initiated by the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. eIF2, a heterotrimer of α, β, and γ subunits, transports Met-tRNA to the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Under stressed conditions, phosphorylation of eIF2α attenuates global translation and initiates translation of mRNAs related to the integrated stress response (ISR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. As for protein degradation, the autophagosome and proteasome are major systems that maintain proteostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The proteasome degrade unnecessary proteins followed by regulated ubiquitination processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and autophagy removes damaged or harmful components, including large protein aggregates and organelles, through catabolism (selective autophagy)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In addition to autophagy induced by acute stressors, a basal level of selective autophagy mediates the global turnover of damaged proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Such constitutive autophagy decreases during aging, which may underlie declines in the structural and functional integrity of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Decreased protein degradation and accumulation of abnormal proteins also contribute to increased risks of neurodegenerative diseases. Age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease are often associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as amyloid-β, tau, and α-synuclein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Enhancement of autophagy mitigates age-related dysfunctions and neurodegeneration caused by proteotoxic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, it is not fully understood how aging disrupts the regulation of this constitutive autophagy.</p>
<p>Neurons are also highly energy-demanding. At nerve terminals, action potentials trigger the release of neurotransmitters via exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, which requires a constant supply of ATP and calcium buffering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Such neuronal activity relies on mitochondrial functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and mitochondria are actively transported from their major sites of biogenesis in soma to axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, the axonal transport of mitochondria declines during aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Reduced axonal transport of mitochondria is thought to contribute to age-related declines in neuronal functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The number of functional mitochondria in synapses is reduced in the brains of patients suffering from age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and mutations in genes involved in mitochondrial dynamics are linked to neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Mislocalization of mitochondria is sufficient to cause age-dependent neurodegeneration in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, indicating that the proper distribution of mitochondria is essential to maintain neuronal functions. Thus, depletion of functional mitochondria from axons and proteostasis collapse are common features of aging and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial transport is regulated by a series of molecular adaptors that mediate the attachment of mitochondria to molecular motors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mitochondrial transport is mediated by milton and Miro, which attaches mitochondria to microtubules via kinesin heavy chain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In the absence of milton or Miro, synaptic terminals and axons lack mitochondria, although mitochondria are numerous in the neuronal cell body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We previously reported that RNAi-mediated knock-down of <italic>milton</italic> or <italic>Miro</italic> in neurons causes reduction in axonal mitochondria, age-dependent locomotor defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and age-dependent neurodegeneration in neuropile area starting around 30 days after eclosion (day-old)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, and enhances axon degeneration caused by human tau proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. These results suggest that flies with neuronal knockdown of <italic>milton</italic> can be used as a model to analyze the effect of depletion of axonal mitochondria during aging. In this study, we investigated a causal relationship between mitochondrial distribution and neuronal proteostasis by using neuronal knockdown of <italic>milton</italic>. We found that depletion of axonal mitochondria reduced autophagy and increased accumulation of aggregated proteins in the axon prior to neurodegeneration. Proteome analysis and follow-up biochemical analyses revealed that neuronal knockdown of <italic>milton</italic> increased eIF2β levels. In addition, phosphorylation of eIF2α was lowered in the axon, and global translation was suppressed. Overexpression of <italic>eIF2β</italic> was sufficient to decrease autophagy and induce neuronal dysfunction, and genetic suppression of <italic>eIF2β</italic> restored autophagy and improved neuronal function in the <italic>milton</italic> knockdown background. These findings suggest that loss of axonal mitochondria and elevated levels of eIF2β mediate proteostasis collapse and neuronal dysfunction during aging.</p>

<p>To test how loss of axonal mitochondria affects proteostasis in neurons, we first examined the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. At 14 day-old, more ubiquitinated proteins were deposited in the brains of <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies than in those of age-matched control flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005 between control RNAi and <italic>milton</italic> RNAi). Knockdown of <italic>Miro</italic>, a partner of <italic>milton</italic>, also resulted in more ubiquitin-positive puncta, but the difference was not significant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.452 between control RNAi and <italic>Miro</italic> RNAi). These data suggest that the depletion of axonal mitochondria leads to accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins before neurodegeneration occurs.</p>
<p>It has been reported that ubiquitinated proteins accumulate with aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>; thus, we analyzed the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in aged brains (30 day-old) with <italic>milton</italic> knockdown. The number of puncta of ubiquitinated proteins did not significantly differ between control and <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies or between control and <italic>Miro</italic> knockdown flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Together with the effect of <italic>milton</italic> knockdown in 14-day old flies, this result suggests that depletion of axonal mitochondria accelerates the onset of age-related accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins.”</p>
<p>We examined the ultrastructure of synaptic terminals and cell bodies in photoreceptor neurons with <italic>milton</italic> knockdown by transmission electron microscopy in 27 day-old flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). As previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, axonal swelling was observed in these neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, asterisks). Some swollen axons in <italic>milton</italic> knockdown neurons contained dense materials, indicating abnormal protein accumulation in the axon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, arrowheads). In contrast, dense materials were not observed in cell bodies in the <italic>milton</italic> knockdown retina (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). These results indicate that the depletion of axonal mitochondria induces protein accumulation in the axon.</p>

<title>Depletion of axonal mitochondria impairs protein degradation pathways</title>
<p>Since abnormal proteins were accumulated in <italic>milton</italic> knockdown brains, we next examined if protein degradation pathways were suppressed. We analyzed autophagy via western blotting of the autophagy markers LC3 and p62<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. During autophagy progression, LC3 is conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II, which localizes to isolation membranes and autophagosomes. The LC3-II/LC3-I ratio was lower in the head lysate of <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies than in that of control flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We also analyzed an autophagy substrate p62. Brain lysates were sequentially extracted using detergents with different stringencies (1% Triton X-100 and 2% SDS), and p62 was detected by western blotting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The p62 level was increased in brains of 14 day-old <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that autophagy is decreased in these brains. The increase in the p62 level was more prominent in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction than in the SDS-soluble fraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that depletion of axonal mitochondria impairs the degradation of less-aggregated proteins. We also analyzed proteasome activity. At 14 day-old, 20S proteasome activity was significantly decreased in brains with neuronal knockdown of <italic>milton</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005). Autophagy was also reduced in the brains of <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies at 30 day-old (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). At this age, milton knockdown increased p62 in both fractions significantly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Proteasome activities were also decreased in <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies at 30 day-old (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). These results indicate that depletion of axonal mitochondria impairs protein degradation pathways.</p>

<title>ATP deprivation does not impair autophagy</title>
<p><italic>milton</italic> knockdown downregulates ATP in the axon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. To examine whether the disruption of protein degradation pathways by <italic>milton</italic> knockdown is due to ATP deprivation, we investigated the effects of knocking down phosphofructokinase (<italic>Pfk</italic>), a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, on protein degradation pathways.

However, in contrast with <italic>milton</italic> knockdown, <italic>Pfk</italic> knockdown did not affect the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) and decreased p62 level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that autophagy is promoted.

<title>Proteome analysis suggests that depletion of axonal mitochondria causes disruption of autophagy and premature aging</title>
<p>To identify the pathways that mediate the decrease in autophagy in <italic>milton</italic> knockdown brains, we performed proteome analysis to systematically detect differentially expressed proteins upon neuronal knockdown of <italic>milton</italic>. We analyzed flies at 7 and 21 day-old, the age before autophagic defects are detected and the age just before the onset of neurodegeneration, respectively. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). 1039 proteins were detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

<title>Depletion of axonal mitochondria upregulates eIF2β and decreases phosphorylation of eIF2α and translation</title>
<p>Differentially expressed proteins in 7 day-old flies may reflect alterations that are causal for autophagic defects. We noticed that the expression level of eIF2β was 2.465-fold higher in the brains of <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies than in those of control flies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Upregulation of eIF2β in the brains of <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies was confirmed by western blotting. <italic>milton</italic> knockdown upregulated eIF2β protein levels more than twice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), but did not change the level of <italic>eIF2β</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). eIF2β is a subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) complex, which is critical for translation initiation and the integrated stress response (ISR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. eIF2 is a heterotrimer of α, β, and γ subunits, and during the ISR, eIF2α is phosphorylated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. To characterize the effect of <italic>milton</italic> knockdown on the eIF2α, we analyzed the levels of eIF2α and p-eIF2α in the brain. Western blotting of brain lysates showed that <italic>milton</italic> knockdown reduced eIF2α levels, but p-eIF2α levels were not significantly affected (Figure S1). To analyze local changes of eIF2α and p-eIF2α, we carried out immunostaining. We focused on the mushroom body, where axons, dendrites, and cell bodies can be easily identified (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Both eIF2α and p-eIF2α were downregulated in the cell body (Kenyon cells) and dendritic (Calyxes) regions of the brains of <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). In axons (lobe tips), <italic>milton</italic> knockdown did not downregulate eIF2α (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.271) but significantly downregulated p-eIF2α (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). The ratio of p-eIF2α to eIF2α was lower in the axon but not in the soma or dendritic region.</p>
<p>Downregulation of p-eIF2α alters global translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. We performed polysome gradient centrifugation to examine the level of ribosome binding to mRNA. In the brains of <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies, the level of mRNAs associated with polysomes was reduced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>), as expected upon downregulation of p-eIF2α. We also compared the level of translation between the brains of control and <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies by assessing the incorporation of puromycin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). Puromycin incorporation was lower in the brains of <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies than in those of control flies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>, indicated by a bracket).

<p>We were motivated to ask if eIF2β upregulation mediates autophagic defects caused by milton knockdown.

<title>Lowering eIF2β rescues autophagic impairment and locomotor dysfunction induced by milton knockdown</title>
<p>Finally, we investigated whether suppression of eIF2β rescues autophagy impairment and locomotor dysfunction caused by neuronal knockdown of <italic>milton</italic>. Null mutants and flies with RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>eIF2β</italic> in neurons did not survive.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Proteostasis perturbations trigger the formation of pathological aggregates and increase the risks of neurodegenerative diseases during aging. By using neuronal knockdown as a tool to deplete mitochondria from the axon, we provide evidence that loss of axonal mitochondria drives age-related proteostasis collapse via eIF2β (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). We observed declines in autophagy-mediated degradation of less-aggregated proteins and proteasome activity in <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and changes in age-related pathways started prematurely in <italic>milton</italic> knockdown flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). <italic>milton</italic> knockdown upregulated eIF2β and downregulated eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>eIF2β</italic> phenocopied the effects of <italic>milton</italic> knockdown, including reduced autophagy and accelerated age-related locomotor defects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, lowering <italic>eIF2β</italic> levels suppressed the impairment of autophagy and locomotor dysfunction induced by <italic>milton</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Our results suggest that mitochondrial distribution and eIF2β are part of the mechanisms constituting proteostasis. <italic>milton</italic> knockdown causes loss of mitochondria in the axon and accumulation of mitochondria in the soma. Thus, accumulation of mitochondria may also have detrimental effects. However, degeneration induced by milton knockdown is prominent in the axon and not detected in the cell body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Furthermore, abnormal protein accumulation was observed in the axon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) and p-eIF2α/eIF2α was decreased in the neurites but not in the soma (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F and G</xref>). These results suggest that proteostasis defects observed in these flies are caused by depletion of mitochondria in the axon rather than accumulation of mitochondria in the soma.</p>

</fig>
<p>Our results revealed that eIF2β regulates proteostasis via autophagy and neuronal function during aging. eIF2β is a component of eIF2, which meditates translational regulation and ISR initiation. When ISR is activated, eIF2α phosphorylation suppresses global translation and induces translation of ATF4, which mediates transcription of autophagy-related genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In milton knockdown neurons, however, both eIF2α and global translation were reduced. Increased levels of eIF2β may disrupt eIF2 complex and its functions. We found that eIF2β upregulation reduced the levels of p-eIF2α (Figure S2), indicating that eIF2β negatively regulates eIF2α. Thus, impairment of autophagy caused by depletion of axonal mitochondria may be due to impairment of ISR. It is also possible that eIF2β mediates autophagy defects via mechanisms independent of ISR, since eIF2β has functions independent of eIF2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. For example, suppression of <italic>eIF2β</italic> has been reported to slow down cancer cell growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In developing neurons, eIF2β can directly interact with the translational repressor Kra to regulate midline axon guidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. However, to our knowledge, the roles of eIF2β in aging have not been reported. Our results revealed a novel function of eIF2β to maintain proteostasis during aging.</p>
<p>How depletion of axonal mitochondria upregulates eIF2β is currently under investigation. A major mitochondrial function is ATP production, and depletion of axonal mitochondria downregulates ATP in axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. However, we found that ATP deprivation does not always suppress autophagy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting it is unlikely to be involved in the mechanisms that induce eIF2β upregulation. Mitochondria also serve as signaling hubs for translation and protein degradation. Mitochondrial proteins are regulated by co-translational protein quality control, and mitochondrial damage induces translational stalling of mitochondrial outer membrane-associated <italic>complex-I 30 kD subunit</italic> (<italic>C-I30</italic>) mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Additionally, the mitochondrial outer membrane ubiquitin ligase MITOL (also known as MARCHF5) ubiquitinates and regulates not only mitochondrial proteins such as Mfn2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> but also microtubule-associated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> and endoplasmic reticulum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> proteins. These findings indicate that mitochondria serve as local signaling centers for proteostasis maintenance and eIF2β levels may also be regulated by mechanisms related to mitochondria.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results suggest that axonal mitochondria and eIF2β form an axis to maintain constitutive autophagy. Suppression of <italic>eIF2β</italic> rescued autophagic defects and neuronal dysfunction upon loss of axonal mitochondria. Since eIF2β is conserved across many species, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans, our results suggest that eIF2β may be a possible therapeutic target for aging and diseases associated with mitochondrial mislocalization.</p>

<title>LC-MS/MS analysis and database search</title>
<p>LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a nano electron spray ionization (ESI) source. The LC system was equipped with a trap column (C18 PepMap 100, 0.3 × 5 mm, 5 µm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an analytical column (NTCC-360/75-3-125, Nikkyo Technos, Tokyo, Japan). Peptide separation was performed using a 90-min gradient of water/0.1% FA (mobile phase A) and MeCN/0.1% FA (mobile phase B) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Elution was performed as follows: 0–3 min, 2% B; 3–93 min, 2%–40% B; 93–95 min, 40%–95% B; 95–105 min, 95% B; 105–107 min, 95%–2% B; and 107–120 min, 2% B. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. The MS parameters were as follows: spray voltage, 2.0 kV; capillary temperature, 275°C; S-lens RF level, 50; scan type, full MS; scan range, <italic>m/z</italic> 350–1500; resolution, 70,000; polarity, positive; automatic gain control target, 3 × 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>; and maximum injection time, 100 msec.

Measurements were made in duplicate for each sample.</p>
<p>The identification of proteins and label-free quantification (LFQ) of the detected peptides were performed using Proteome Discoverer software ver. 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The analytical parameters used for the database search were as follows: parent mass error tolerance, 10.0 ppm; fragment mass error tolerance, 0.02 Da; search engine, sequest HT; protein database, Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly: SwissProt Tax ID=7227); enzyme name, trypsin (full); maximum number of missed cleavages, 2; dynamic modification, oxidation (methionine), phosphorylation (serine, threonine, tyrosine), acetyl (lysine), GG (lysine); N-terminal modification, Met-loss (methionine), and Met-loss+acetyl (methionine); static modification, carbamidomethylation (cysteine) and FDR confidence, High &lt; 0.01, 0.01 ≤ Medium &lt; 0.05, 0.05 ≤ Low. The parameters for LFQ were as follows: precursor abundance, based on area; and normalization mode, total peptide amount. The abundance ratio of <italic>milton</italic> RNAi to control RNAi at 7 or 21 day-old was calculated. We considered proteins with the abundance ratio of ≥2.0 or ≤ 0.5 and an ANOVA <italic>P</italic>-value of &lt; 0.05 based on volcano plots to be differentially expressed of <italic>milton</italic> RNAi.

<p>In flies defective for axonal transport of mitochondria, the authors report the upregulation of one subunit, the beta subunit, of the heterotrimeric eIF2 complex via mass spectroscopy proteome analysis. Neuronal overexpression of eIF2β phenocopied aspects of neuronal dysfunction observed when axonal transport of mitochondria was compromised. Conversely, lowering eIF2β expression suppressed aspects of neuronal dysfunction. While these are intriguing observations that are potentially <bold>useful</bold>, several technical weaknesses limit the interpretation and mean the evidence supporting the current claims is <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>The authors observed a decline in autophagy and proteasome activity in the context of Milton knockdown. Through proteomic analysis, they identified an increase in the protein levels of eIF2β, subsequently pinpointing a novel interaction within eIF subunits where eIF2β contributes to the reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation levels. Furthermore, they demonstrated that overexpression of eIF2β suppresses autophagy and leads to diminished motor function. It was also shown that in a heterozygous mutant background of eIF2β, Milton knockdown could be rescued. This work represents a novel and significant contribution to the field, revealing for the first time that the loss of mitochondria from axons can lead to impaired autophagy function via eIF2β, potentially influencing the acceleration of aging. To further support the authors' claims, several improvements are necessary, particularly in the methods of quantification and the points that should be demonstrated quantitatively. It is crucial to investigate the correlation between aging and the proteins eIF2β and eIF2α.</p>

<p>In the manuscript, the authors aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism that explains neurodegeneration caused by the depletion of axonal mitochondria. In Drosophila, starting with siRNA depletion of Milton and Miro, the authors attempted to demonstrate that the depletion of axonal mitochondria induces the defect in autophagy. From proteome analyses, the authors hypothesized that autophagy is impacted by the abundance of eIF2β and the phosphorylation of eIF2α. The authors followed up the proteome analyses by testing the effects of eIF2β overexpression and depletion on autophagy. With the results from those experiments, the authors proposed a novel role of eIF2β in proteostasis that underlies neurodegeneration derived from the depletion of axonal mitochondria.</p>
<p>The manuscript has several weaknesses. The reader should take extra care while reading this manuscript and when acknowledging the findings and the model in this manuscript.</p>
<p>The defect in autophagy by the depletion of axonal mitochondria is one of the main claims in the paper. The authors should work more on describing their results of LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, as there are multiple ways to interpret the LC3 blotting for the autophagy assessment. Lysosomal defects result in the accumulation of LC3-II thus the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio gets higher. On the other hand, the defect in the early steps of autophagosome formation could result in a lower LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. From the results of the actual blotting, the LC3-I abundance is the source of the major difference for all conditions (Milton RNAi and eIF2β overexpression and depletion). In the text, the authors simply state the observation of their LC3 blotting. The manuscript lacks an explanation of how to evaluate the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. Also, the manuscript lacks an elaboration on what the results of the LC3 blotting indicate about the state of autophagy by the depletion of axonal mitochondria.</p>
<p>Another main point of the paper is the up-regulation of eIF2β by depleting the axonal mitochondria leads to the proteostasis crisis. This claim is formed by the findings from the proteome analyses. The authors should have presented their proteomic data with much thorough presentation and explanation. As in the experiment scheme shown in Figure 4A, the author did two proteome analyses: one from the 7-day-old sample and the other from the 21-day-old sample. The manuscript only shows a plot of the result from the 7-day-old sample, but that of the result from the 21-day-old sample. For the 21-day-old sample, the authors only provided data in the supplemental table, in which the abundance ratio of eIF2β from the 21-day-old sample is 0.753, meaning eIF2β is depleted in the 21-day-old sample. The authors should have explained the impact of the eIF2β depletion in the 21-day-old sample, so the reader could fully understand the authors' interpretation of the role of eIF2β on proteostasis.</p>
<p>The manuscript consists of several weaknesses in its data and explanation regarding translation.</p>
<p>(1) The authors are likely misunderstanding the effect of phosphorylation of eIF2α on translation. The P-eIF2α is inhibitory for translation initiation. However, the authors seem to be mistaken that the down-regulation of P-eIF2α inhibits translation.</p>
<p>(2) The result of polysome profiling in Figure 4H is implausible. By 10%-25% sucrose density gradient, polysomes are not expected to be observed. The authors should have used a gradient with much denser sucrose, such as 10-50%.</p>
<p>(3) Also on the polysome profiling, as in the method section, the authors seemed to fractionate ultra-centrifuged samples from top to bottom and then measured A260 by a plate reader. In that case, the authors should have provided a line plot with individual data points, not the smoothly connected ones in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(4) For both the results from polysome profiling and puromycin incorporation (Figure 4H and I), the difference between control siRNA and Milton siRNA are subtle, if not nonexistent. This might arise from the lack of spatial resolution in their experiment as the authors used head lysate for these data but the ratio of Phospho-eIF2α/eIF2α only changes in the axons, based on their results in Figure 4E-G. The authors could have attempted to capture the spatial resolution for the axonal translation to see the difference between control siRNA and Milton siRNA.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that multiple ways exist to interpret the LC3 blotting for the autophagy assessment. Thus, we analyzed the levels of p62, an autophagy substrate, and found that milton knockdown caused elevated levels of p62 (Figure 2B). Together, these results suggest that autophagic degradation is lowered.</p>

<p>Thank you for your comments. We will include more analyses of the proteomic data in the next version of our manuscript.
In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which depletion of axonal mitochondria induces proteostasis disruption prematurely. Thus, we did not investigate the roles of differentially expressed proteins in proteostasis at 21-day-old in milton knockdown. Aging disrupts proteostasis via multiple pathways: eIF2β levels may be lowered by feedback of earlier changes or via interaction with other age-related changes at 21-day-old. We will include more discussion in the next version of our manuscript.</p>

<p>The manuscript consists of several weaknesses in its data and explanation regarding translation.</p>
<p>(1) The authors are likely misunderstanding the effect of phosphorylation of eIF2α on translation. The P-eIF2α is inhibitory for translation initiation. However, the authors seem to be mistaken that the down-regulation of P-eIF2α inhibits translation.
Thank you for your comment. We understand that the phosphorylation of eIF2α is inhibitory for translation initiation, as we described in page 9, Line 312-314. We propose a model in which autophagic defects caused by milton knockdown is mediate by upregulation of eIF2β, however, we are not arguing that the translational suppression in milton knockdown is caused by a reduction in p-eIF2α.
We found that milton knockdown causes an increase in eIF2β, and overexpression of eIF2β copied phenotypes of milton knockdown such as autophagic defects (Figure 5 and 6). We also found that the increase in eIF2β reduces the level of p-eIF2α (Supplemental Figure 2), thus, eIF2α phosphorylation in milton knockdown may be caused by an increase in eIF2β. However, the effects of upregulation of eIF2β on the function of eIF2 complex is not fully understood. The translational suppression in milton knockdown may be caused by disruption of eIF2 complex, while it is also possible that it is mediated by a function of eIF2β that is yet-to-be-determined, or mediated by the pathways other than eIF2. We will include more details in the revised version.</p>
<p>(2) The result of polysome profiling in Figure 4H is implausible. By 10%-25% sucrose density gradient, polysomes are not expected to be observed. The authors should have used a gradient with much denser sucrose, such as 10-50%.
Thank you for pointing it out. We are sorry, it was a mistake. The gradient was actually 10-50%, and we described it wrong. We will correct it in the revised version.</p>
<p>(3) Also on the polysome profiling, as in the method section, the authors seemed to fractionate ultra-centrifuged samples from top to bottom and then measured A260 by a plate reader. In that case, the authors should have provided a line plot with individual data points, not the smoothly connected ones in the manuscript.
Thank you for pointing it out. We will replace the graph.</p>
<p>(4) For both the results from polysome profiling and puromycin incorporation (Figure 4H and I), the difference between control siRNA and Milton siRNA are subtle, if not nonexistent. This might arise from the lack of spatial resolution in their experiment as the authors used head lysate for these data but the ratio of Phospho-eIF2α/eIF2α only changes in the axons, based on their results in Figure 4E-G. The authors could have attempted to capture the spatial resolution for the axonal translation to see the difference between control siRNA and Milton siRNA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. A new set of experiments with technical challenges will be required to capture the spatial resolution for the axonal translation. We will work on it and hope to achieve it in the future.</p>
