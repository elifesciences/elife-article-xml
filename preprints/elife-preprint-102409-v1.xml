<title>Abstract</title><p>Meiotic crossover recombination is essential for both accurate chromosome segregation and the generation of new haplotypes for natural selection to act upon. While the conserved role of the ATPase, PCH-2, during meiotic prophase has been enigmatic, a universal phenotype that is observed when <italic>pch-2</italic> or its orthologs are mutated is a change in the number and distribution of meiotic crossovers. Here, we show that PCH-2 controls the number and distribution of crossovers by antagonizing crossover formation. This antagonism produces different effects at different stages of meiotic prophase: early in meiotic prophase, PCH-2 prevents double strand breaks from becoming crossovers, limiting crossovers at sites of initial DSB formation and homolog interactions. Later in meiotic prophase, PCH-2 winnows the number of crossover-eligible intermediates, contributing to the reinforcement of crossover-eligible intermediates, designation of crossovers and ultimately, crossover assurance. We also demonstrate that PCH-2 accomplishes this regulation through the meiotic HORMAD, HIM-3. Our data strongly support a model in which PCH-2’s conserved role is to remodel meiotic HORMADs throughout meiotic prophase to destabilize crossover-eligible precursors, coordinate meiotic recombination with synapsis, and contribute to the progressive implementation of meiotic recombination, guaranteeing crossover control.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that reduces chromosome number by half, resulting in the production of four genetically diverse haploid gametes, so that fertilization during sexual reproduction restores diploidy. This process occurs in two stages: meiosis I, in which homologous chromosomes are partitioned, and meiosis II, in which sister chromatid are segregated. The regulation of meiosis is crucial for ensuring that both genetic recombination and chromosome segregation occur accurately.</p>
<p>During prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair and this pairing is stabilized through a process called synapsis, in which a protein structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC) holds homologs together. This close association between homologs during synapsis facilitates crossover formation, the process in which double strand breaks (DSBs) are deliberately introduced into the genome, repaired by meiosis-specific mechanisms that exchange DNA between homologous chromosomes and generate the chiasmata, or linkage, that promotes accurate meiotic chromosome segregation.</p>
<p>Therefore, disruptions in pairing, synapsis, or recombination prevent the formation of chiasmata and can lead to meiotic errors such as nondisjunction, resulting in aneuploid gametes. Errors in human meiosis are associated with birth defects, such as Down and Turner syndromes, infertility and miscarriages, underscoring the importance of understanding meiosis to human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hassold &amp; Hunt, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the fundamental role that recombination plays in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation, crossover recombination accomplishes another important function: it generates new haplotypes for natural selection to act upon to drive evolution. Thus, to assure a random assortment of alleles on a population level, the distribution of crossovers may be as tightly regulated as their number. The significance of controlling both crossover number and distribution is clearly illustrated by the existence of mechanisms such as crossover assurance, in which every pair of homologous chromosomes gets at least one crossover; crossover homeostasis, in which the number of crossovers remains relatively invariant even if the number of recombination precursors change; and crossover interference, in which the presence of a crossover inhibits the formation of a crossover nearby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gray &amp; Cohen, 2016</xref>). DSBs typically vastly outnumber crossovers in most organisms and are introduced gradually throughout early prophase. Therefore, to accomplish this precise level of control, meiotic crossover recombination and the decision about which DSBs become crossover-eligible intermediates, and eventually crossovers, is implemented progressively throughout meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Morgan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>PCH-2, also known as TRIP13 in mammals, is an evolutionarily ancient AAA-ATPase that plays a significant role in regulating meiosis across different organisms, including <italic>M. musculus</italic> (mice), <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (budding yeast), <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (fruit flies), and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (worms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhalla, 2023</xref>). PCH- 2 and its orthologs structurally remodel a family of proteins with HORMA domains (HORMADs) to control their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gu et al., 2022</xref>). HORMADs participate in a variety of signaling events and can exist in at least three structurally distinct conformations: a “closed” conformation, which they adopt when they bind a short peptide sequence in their own protein sequence or another protein (also called a closure motif) and their C-terminus wraps around this motif to stabilize the interaction; an “open” conformation when unbound, in which their C-terminus is discretely tucked against the HORMA domain; and an “extended” conformation, which is an intermediate between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gu et al., 2022</xref>). PCH-2 and its orthologs convert the closed version of HORMADs to the open or extended versions, playing an important role in recycling HORMADs during signaling. During meiosis, closed versions of meiotic HORMADs assemble on chromosomes to form meiotic chromosome axes, which are essential for pairing, synapsis and recombination between homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). The remodeling of meiotic HORMADs by PCH-2 to an “open” or “extended” conformation is thought to reduce the levels of HORMADs on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Börner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuacos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lambing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wojtasz et al., 2009</xref>) and/or increase their dynamic association and dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Russo et al., 2023</xref>), modulating and coordinating homolog pairing, synapsis and recombination during prophase.</p>
<p>The conserved role of the PCH-2/HORMAD module in meiosis has been difficult to characterize, in part, we have argued, because of the evolutionary innovation that is an inherent aspect of sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhalla, 2023</xref>). Moreover, in some systems, such as budding yeast and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Herruzo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), PCH-2 orthologs not only remodel meiotic HORMADs on meiotic chromosomes but also perform this function in the cytoplasm to make meiotic HORMADs available for their role(s) in meiotic nuclei. This dual role can complicate functional analyses, particularly in <italic>pch-2</italic> null mutants. However, all meiotic systems exhibit defects in the number and distribution of crossovers when PCH-2 function is abrogated by mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Joyce &amp; McKim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lambing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Roig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zanders &amp; Alani, 2009</xref>). Unfortunately, the lack of a clear pattern when analyzing these defects in recombination in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants has contributed to an inability to develop a unified, integrated model of PCH-2 function in the field.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, meiotic HORMADs localize to meiotic chromosomes independently of PCH-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we exploit this system to show that PCH-2 is required to control the number and distribution of crossovers by antagonizing the formation of crossovers. This antagonism produces different consequences depending on the stage of meiotic prophase. In early meiotic prophase, PCH- 2 inhibits DSBs from becoming crossovers, ensuring that they are more widely distributed than sites of initial DSB formation and/or homolog interactions. Later in meiotic prophase, PCH-2 is responsible for winnowing the numbers of crossover-eligible intermediates on synapsed chromosomes, contributing to the reinforcement of crossover-eligible intermediates, designation of crossovers and ultimately, crossover assurance. Genetic analysis demonstrates that PCH-2’s regulation of crossover-eligible intermediates is through one of three essential meiotic HORMADs, HIM-3. Finally, we link PCH-2’s effect on early DSBs in early meiotic prophase to cell cycle stage, demonstrating that both limit early DSBs from becoming crossovers. We propose that PCH-2’s remodeling of HIM-3 on meiotic chromosomes destabilizes crossover-eligible intermediates throughout meiotic prophase, contributing to the progressive implementation of meiotic recombination to control the number and distribution of crossovers and accomplish crossover control.</p>

<title>PCH-2 controls the number and distribution of crossovers in similar patterns on multiple chromosomes</title>
<p>We had previously shown that loss of PCH-2 reduced the frequency of double crossovers and genetic length of both an autosome (chromosome III) and the X chromosome, albeit not uniformly among genetic intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>). To determine whether a more obvious pattern could be observed, we expanded our analysis by monitoring recombination genetically in both wildtype and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutant animals using five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that spanned 95% of Chromosomes, I, III, IV and the X chromosome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We excluded Chromosome II from our analysis because of the potential difficulty combining Hawaiian SNPs with the <italic>pch-2</italic> mutation, which is linked to Chromosome II, and Chromosome V because of our use of the <italic>bcIs39</italic> transgene to identify cross progeny, which may disrupt recombination on that chromosome.</p>

<p>In wildtype animals, we observed multiple double crossovers, ranging from 1-13 depending on the chromosome. In a majority of these double crossovers (69%), one crossover was at the end of the chromosome where pairing and synapsis initiate, also called the Pairing Center (PC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">MacQueen et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting some relationship between where chromosomes might make initial contacts and the likelihood of double crossovers. On all chromosomes analyzed, we observed no double crossovers in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants and this difference was statistically significant for Chromosomes I, III and X. Moreover, there was a striking shift of crossovers to the PC end of all four chromosomes tested.</p>
<p>This shift in the distribution of crossovers to the PC ends of chromosomes was generally accompanied by a reduction in crossovers in the center of chromosomes. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the center of chromosomes are where double strand breaks are less numerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nadarajan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yu et al., 2016</xref>) and where genes are more abundant. In the case of the X chromosome and chromosome III, recombination at the non-PC end was also reduced and appeared to more closely resemble the physical map at this end of these chromosomes. Thus, PCH-2 ensures a wider distribution of crossovers across chromosomes, away from regions that are more likely to undergo early homolog interactions (PC ends) and with more double strand breaks (both the PC and non-PC ends of chromosomes), and towards the center of chromosomes, where double strand breaks are less abundant.</p>

<title>PCH-2 prevents exogenous DSBs early in meiotic prophase from becoming crossovers</title>
<p>We previously showed that PCH-2 promotes crossover formation and crossover assurance through its regulation of the meiotic HORMAD, HIM-3, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Russo et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, this promoting role seems linked to its localization to the synaptonemal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Patel et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the observed shift in the distribution of crossovers in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants suggests that PCH-2 may also play a role in inhibiting crossovers and that this role may be occurring in early meiotic prophase, when chromosomes are undergoing initial homolog interactions. Previous data from our lab had suggested this possibility, but experimental caveats limited our ability to properly interpret these experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>To explicitly test this possibility, we took advantage of both the spatiotemporal organization of meiotic nuclei in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, and the observation that nuclei travel in an assembly line process at a stereotypical pace to late pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007</xref>), where we can cytologically assess crossover formation by staining for the essential crossover factor, COSA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>). We performed irradiation experiments to introduce exogenous DSBs at different timepoints during meiotic prophase and analyzed PCH-2’s role in crossover formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In this experiment, we tested the effects of ionizing radiation at two distinct time points: 8 hours after irradiation, when we can monitor crossover formation in meiotic nuclei that received exogenous DSBs in mid-pachytene, and 24 hours after irradiation, when we monitor crossover formation in meiotic nuclei that received exogenous DSBs in leptotene/zygotene, also known as the transition zone in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In order to detect crossovers, control and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants germlines were stained for GFP::COSA-1, which allowed us to visualize crossovers, and DAPI, which allowed us to visualize DNA. At 8 hours after irradiation, we observed a significant increase in nuclei containing less than 6 COSA-1 nuclei in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants (26%), when compared to control (9%) germlines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, 2C). We did not observe a significant number of nuclei with greater than 6 COSA-1 foci in either backgrounds. This observation is consistent with our and others’ previous findings: exogenous DSBs in mid-pachytene do not affect the number of crossovers in wildtype animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>) and loss of PCH-2 leads to a decrease in crossover formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we examined crossover formation 24 hours post-irradiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, 2E). For this time point, we also saw a significant increase in nuclei containing less than 6 COSA-1 foci (control: 13%, <italic>pch-2</italic>: 26%), similar to the 8 hour time point. However, in contrast to the 8 hour time point, we also observed a significant increase in nuclei with more than 6 COSA-1 foci in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants (wildtype: 2%, <italic>pch-2</italic>: 13%), indicating that loss of PCH-2 leads to increased crossover formation when nuclei in the transition zone get more DSBs. In other words, PCH-2 inhibits exogenous DSBs in early meiotic prophase from becoming crossovers, consistent with our analysis of recombination on multiple chromosomes.</p>

<title>PCH-2 prevents SPO-11-induced DSBs from becoming crossovers in early meiotic prophase</title>
<p>Our previous experiment indicated that PCH-2 is preventing exogenous DSBs in early meiotic prophase from becoming crossovers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). To test whether this was also the case for programmed meiotic DSB formation, we used the auxin-inducible degradation (AID) system to remove the enzyme that is responsible for programmed meiotic DSBs, SPO-11 (<italic>spo-11::AID::3XFLAG</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>). Since meiotic nuclei travel through the germline at about one cell per row per hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007</xref>), we took advantage of this precise spatiotemporal resolution to test five different timepoints to determine if acute depletion of SPO-11 leads to any changes in crossover formation between control animals and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We assayed crossover formation by analyzing both the number of GFP::COSA-1 foci in late pachytene and the presence of bivalents in diakinesis, which indicates the successful formation of chiasmata between homologous chromosomes. Meiotic nuclei travel from late pachytene to diakinesis in approximately 12 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<p>When we treated both control and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutant worms for 36 hours with auxin, we observed a complete loss of GFP::COSA-1 foci (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). When these animals were treated with auxin for 48 hours, to allow nuclei without SPO-11 an additional 12 hours to reach diakinesis, we observed 12 DAPI stained bodies, or univalents, which are the 6 homolog pairs that have not formed chiasmata (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, we can reliably remove SPO-11 from meiotic nuclei throughout the germline and prevent crossover formation.</p>
<p>Having established that we can reliably remove SPO-11 with the AID system, we performed the same experiment at additional timepoints that remove SPO-11 at different stages of early meiotic prophase, monitoring crossover formation both at late pachytene and 12 hours later in diakinesis: 24 hours to monitor GFP::COSA-1 foci and 36 hours to monitor bivalent formation; 22 (GFP::COSA-1 foci) and 34 (bivalent formation) hours; 20 (GFP::COSA-1 foci) and 32 hours (bivalent formation); and 18 (GFP::COSA-1 foci) and 30 hours (bivalent formation). We also performed a control experiment, treating worms with ethanol for the 24 and 36 hour timepoints to ensure that this tagged version of SPO-11 was fully functional for crossover formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, 3D).</p>
<p>At the 24 hour time point, when meiotic nuclei in the transition zone do not receive SPO-11-induced DSBs, we observe a range of GFP::COSA-1 foci in late pachytene in both control animals and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants with a majority of nuclei having 0 or 1 focus (control and <italic>pch-2</italic> averages: 1.8 GFP::COSA-1 foci), indicating a loss of crossover formation, albeit with some heterogeneity. This was confirmed when we monitored bivalent formation at the 36 hour timepoint in both strains. This heterogeneity likely reflects that it takes 1-4 hours to significantly affect DSB formation through acute degradation of SPO-11 at this stage of meiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hicks et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, there was no statistically significant difference in the number of GFP::COSA-1 foci between control animals and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants. However, we did observe a slight, statistically significant difference in the number of DAPI stained bodies between control animals (average number of DAPI stained bodies: 10.6) and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants (average number of DAPI stained bodies: 9.6), suggesting that even at this very early time point, we can detect a role for PCH-2 in preventing early SPO-11-induced DSBs from becoming crossovers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, 3E).</p>
<p>We continued to monitor GFP::COSA-1 and bivalent formation at successive timepoints. At the 22 hours and 34 hour timepoints, where SPO-11 depletion begins later in the transition zone, we saw an increase in the number of GFP::COSA-1 foci and a reduction in the number of DAPI stained bodies, suggesting that more DSBs are becoming crossovers. This trend continued at the 20 hour and 32 hour timepoints, eventually reaching wildtype numbers for GFP::COSA-1 and DAPI stained bodies by the 18 hour and 30 hour timepoints, respectively.</p>
<p>At the 22 hour and 36 hour timepoints, we did not detect any statistically significant difference in the number of GFP::COSA-1 foci or DAPI stained bodies between control animals and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants, even when we analyzed the number of nuclei that had greater than 6 GFP::COSA-1 foci. In contrast, while the number of GFP::COSA-1 foci was not statistically significantly different between control animals and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants at the 20 hour time point, the number of nuclei with greater than 6 GFP::COSA-1 foci was significantly higher in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants (control: 3%, <italic>pch-2</italic>: 10%, p value = 0.009, Fischer’s Exact Test), similar to our analysis of GFP::COSA-1 24 hours after irradiation. Even more strikingly, the number of DAPI stained bodies was significantly lower in <italic>pch-2</italic> animals than control animals at the corresponding 32 hour timepoint, indicating that more homolog pairs had successfully formed chiasmata in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants. The inconsistency between the average number of GFP::COSA-1 foci and DAPI stained bodies at this time point can be explained by our ability to more reliably detect <italic>pch-2</italic>’s loss of crossover assurance when quantifying GFP::COSA-1 foci than when analyzing bivalent formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Russo et al., 2023</xref>). No difference in GFP::COSA- 1 foci or bivalent formation was observed at the 18 hour and 30 hours timepoints, respectively. These data indicate that during a narrow time frame of early meiotic prophase, likely during leptotene/zygotene given the delay in limiting DSB formation with auxin-induced degradation of SPO- 11, PCH-2 prevents SPO-11-induced DSBs from becoming crossovers and chiasmata.</p>

<title>PCH-2 is required for timely loading and removal of MSH-5 on meiotic chromosomes through its regulation of HIM-3</title>
<p>After DSB formation, a subset of DSBs are repaired through a pro-crossover pathway and eventually winnowed to a stereotypical number of crossovers. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, this can be visualized by the loading of the pro-crossover factor MSH-5, a component of the meiosis-specific MutSγ complex that stabilizes crossover-specific DNA repair intermediates called joint molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Janisiw et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kelly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Snowden et al., 2004</xref>). GFP::MSH-5 begins to form a few foci in the transition zone, becoming more numerous in early pachytene before decreasing in number in mid pachytene to ultimately colocalize with COSA-1 marked sites in late pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Janisiw et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Woglar &amp; Villeneuve, 2018</xref>; see control in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, 4B). The mechanism through which MSH-5 functions with the SC and other meiosis factors to ultimately form crossovers has not been established but may involve phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haversat et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<p>Given that we have shown that PCH-2 prevents early DSBs from becoming crossovers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), we tested whether we could cytologically detect this inhibition at the level of MSH-5 behavior in control animals and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants. We generated wildtype and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants with GFP::MSH-5 and quantified the average number of GFP::MSH-5 foci per row of nuclei from the transition zone to late pachytene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, 4B). We observed a statistically significant increase in the average number of GFP::MSH-5 foci per row in the transition zone in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, 4B, p value &lt; 0.0001, Student’s t-test), indicating that PCH-2 typically limits MSH-5 loading at this early stage of meiotic prophase. The average number of GFP::MSH-5 foci per row were similar in number in early pachytene in both backgrounds. However, we also observed a substantial increase in the average number of GFP::MSH-5 foci per row in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants in the mid and late pachytene regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, 4B), indicating that PCH-2 also promotes the turnover or maturation of GFP::MSH-5 foci at these later stages of meiotic prophase. Thus, PCH-2 prevents the loading of the crossover-promoting factor, MSH-5, during early meiotic prophase, consistent with both our genetic analysis of recombination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and its role in preventing early DSBs from becoming crossovers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p>
<p>However, PCH-2 also appears to limit the number of crossover-eligible intermediates in mid and late pachytene, an unexpected observation given that the most severe recombination defect in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants is the loss of crossover assurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>We previously showed that PCH-2 genetically interacts with meiotic HORMADs to effectively control different aspects of meiosis: PCH-2 regulates pairing and synapsis through its regulation of HTP-3 and crossover recombination through its regulation of HIM-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Russo et al., 2023</xref>). To determine which meiotic HORMAD PCH-2 might be regulating to affect GFP::MSH-5’s loading and removal on meiotic chromosomes, we constructed <italic>gfp::msh-5;htp-3<sup>H96Y</sup>, gfp::msh-5;pch-2;htp-3<sup>H96Y</sup>, gfp::msh-5;him-3<sup>R93Y</sup></italic> and <italic>gfp::msh-5;pch-2</italic>;<italic>him-3<sup>R93Y</sup></italic> mutants and quantified GFP::MSH-5 foci throughout the germline.</p>
<p>Both <italic>htp-3<sup>H96Y</sup></italic> and <italic>him-3<sup>R93Y</sup></italic> mutants showed a drastic increase in the average number of GFP::MSH- 5 per row of nuclei throughout the germline (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). For example, compared to control germlines that peaked at approximately an average of 20 MSH-5 foci per row in early pachytene and then decreased in mid-pachytene, <italic>him-3<sup>R93Y</sup></italic> germlines had closer to an average of 30 GFP::MSH-5 foci per row in early pachytene. Moreover, the average number of GFP::MSH-5 foci per row increased further in mid and late pachytene, achieving peaks closer to an average of 35 foci (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). These very high numbers of GFP::MSH-5 were striking but do not produce an increased number of crossovers in <italic>htp-3<sup>H96Y</sup></italic> or <italic>him-3<sup>R93Y</sup></italic>single mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Russo et al., 2023</xref>), raising the possibility that not all of them reflect functional, crossover-specific intermediates, similar to what has been observed in the absence of synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Woglar &amp; Villeneuve, 2018</xref>). These data also suggest that these mutations, which disrupt the ability of meiotic HORMADs to adopt the “closed” conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Russo et al., 2023</xref>), affect the behavior of GFP::MSH-5 on meiotic chromosomes.</p>
<p>Quantification of GFP::MSH-5 foci in <italic>pch-2;htp-3<sup>H93Y</sup></italic>double mutants was similar to <italic>htp-3<sup>H93Y</sup></italic> single mutants, suggesting that PCH-2’s effect on the behavior of GFP::MSH-5 foci was not through its regulation of HTP-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). In stark contrast to <italic>pch-2;htp-3<sup>H93Y</sup></italic>double mutants, the <italic>pch-2</italic>;<italic>him-3<sup>R93Y</sup></italic> double mutant showed a dramatic decrease in the overall average of MSH-5 foci per row throughout the germline (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, 4D). These averages fell between the averages in control and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutant animals, particularly in the transition zone and late pachytene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), consistent with our previous report that this double mutant has fewer defects in crossover formation than either single mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Russo et al., 2023</xref>). These data indicate that PCH-2’s effect on promoting the removal of GFP::MSH-5 in both the transition zone and mid to late pachytene is through its regulation of HIM- 3.</p>
<p><italic>pch-2</italic> single mutants exhibit a loss of crossover assurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>). However, our quantification of GFP::MSH-5 in <italic>pch-2</italic> single mutants in mid to late pachytene showed an increased number of crossover-eligible intermediates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, 4B), suggesting a complex relationship between having too many crossover-eligible intermediates and crossover assurance in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. To address this inconsistency, we generated strains with both OLLAS::COSA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Janisiw et al., 2018</xref>) and GFP::MSH-5 in wildtype animals and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants. Consistent with our and others’ previous findings, we observe a gradual reduction in the average number of GFP::MSH-5 foci per row of nuclei in control animals as these nuclei approach the end of pachytene, ultimately converging with the average number of OLLAS::COSA-1 foci per row (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, 4F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Janisiw et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Woglar &amp; Villeneuve, 2018</xref>). In addition, we consistently observed co-localization of GFP::MSH-5 and OLLAS::COSA-1 foci in control animals, with a few MSH-5 foci persisting without COSA-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, 4F).</p>
<p>By contrast, we detected higher average numbers of GFP::MSH-5 foci per row across all late pachytene nuclei in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants and this average never converged upon the average number of OLLAS-1::COSA-1 foci per row (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, 4F). To test whether there was a correlation between the number of GFP::MSH-5 foci and the loss of crossover assurance in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants, we determined the average number of GFP::MSH-5 foci in meiotic nuclei with 6 OLLAS::COSA-1 foci and those with less than 6 OLLAS::COSA-1 foci in both control and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutant animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, 4G, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). Indeed, we observed that <italic>pch-2</italic> mutant nuclei with less than 6 OLLAS::COSA-1 foci had significantly higher numbers of GFP::MSH-5 foci, compared to both control and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutant nuclei with 6 OLLAS::COSA-1 foci (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, 4G), suggesting that the inability to reduce the number of crossover-eligible intermediates in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants, counterintuitively, contributes to the observed loss of crossover assurance.</p>

<title>PCH-2 is removed from the synaptonemal complex when crossovers are designated</title>
<p>We have previously shown that PCH-2 localization to the SC is extended when there are partial defects in synapsis or changes in karyotype, producing an increase in crossovers and a loss of crossover interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Patel et al., 2023</xref>). These data led us to hypothesize that PCH-2’s presence on chromosomes promotes crossover formation. However, our quantification of GFP::MSH-5 indicates that PCH-2 is required to limit the number of crossover-eligible intermediates, in direct contrast to our proposed hypothesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, we decided to revisit what role PCH-2 localization to the SC might play in regulating crossover formation. To this end, we localized PCH-2 in <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutants, in which DSB formation is substantially reduced and fewer crossovers are formed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rosu et al., 2013</xref>). We performed this experiment because, in budding yeast, similar mutants that reduce DSB formation rely on Pch2 to successfully complete meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zanders &amp; Alani, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the recombination defect in <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutants worsens with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rosu et al., 2013</xref>), we looked at PCH-2 localization in both young (24 hours post L4 larval stage) and older animals (48 hours post L4). We observed a unique and striking localization pattern in <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutants that we had not observed before. When stained for PCH-2 and GFP::COSA-1, nuclei retain PCH-2 onto chromosomes far into late pachytene, past the normal region when PCH-2 typically is removed from chromosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, 5B). However, unlike what we have observed in other mutants that have defects in synapsis or changes in karyotype, this retention of PCH-2 is not uniform among all late pachytene nuclei in <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutants. Instead, most nuclei lose PCH-2 localization in late pachytene while some retain it. We tested whether there was a relationship between the retention of PCH-2 and the number of GFP::COSA-1 foci and found that 96% of nuclei that lose PCH-2 have at least 1 GFP::COSA-1 focus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, 5B). In older animals (see 48 hours post-L4), this pattern was even more clear: 77% of nuclei without PCH-2 had 1 or more GFP::COSA-1 focus and 93% of meiotic nuclei without a GFP::COSA-1 focus retained PCH-2.</p>

<p>These data indicate that PCH-2’s removal from the SC is in response to, coincident with or facilitates crossover designation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed GFP::COSA-1 foci in <italic>dsb-2::AID</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>dsb-2::AID;pch-2</italic> worms, reasoning that if PCH-2’s removal is in response to or coincident with designation, we should not detect any differences in the number of GFP::COSA-1 foci in <italic>dsb-2::AID</italic> and <italic>dsb-2::AID;pch-2</italic> worms. We performed these experiments with the auxin-inducible degradation system because of variability in the <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutant background that affected reproducibility of our experiments.</p>
<p>Upon auxin treatment of <italic>dsb-2::AID</italic> worms, we observed a statistically significant (p value &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test) decrease in the number of GFP::COSA-1 foci, in comparison with ethanol- treated worms, verifying that we can reliably knock down DSB-2 with the AID system (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>When we performed the same experiment in <italic>dsb-2::AID;pch-2</italic> worms, the average number of GFP::COSA-1 foci further decreased, indicating that fewer crossovers are designated when DSBs are reduced and PCH-2 is absent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, 5D). These data suggest that PCH-2’s presence on the SC prevents crossover designation. Given the correlation between elevated GFP::MSH-5 foci and the loss of crossover assurance we observe in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants, we propose that PCH-2 is retained on meiotic chromosomes to ensure that extra crossover-eligible intermediates are removed and crossover designation is delayed until crossover assurance can be guaranteed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

<title>PCH-2 and high CHK-2 activity control the fate of early double strand breaks</title>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, meiotic cell cycle entry and progression depends on the activity of CHK-2, the meiosis- specific ortholog of the DNA-damage kinase Chk2/CHEK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baudrimont et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Castellano-Pozo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">MacQueen &amp; Villeneuve, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Meiotic nuclei in leptotene/zygotene are characterized by high CHK-2 activity, which drops to intermediate activity in mid-pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). In late pachytene, CHK-2 activity is inactivated by the recruitment of polo-like kinase, PLK-2, to the SC, which enables crossover designation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, CHK-2 activity also has consequences for the progression of meiotic recombination and DNA repair.</p>
<p>Given that early DSBs are prevented from becoming crossovers by PCH-2 in early meiotic prophase, we wanted to test if high CHK-2 activity in leptotene/zygotene also contributed to the fate of these early DSBs. To evaluate this possibility, we used <italic>syp-1<sup>T452A</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sato-Carlton et al., 2018</xref>). The SC component, SYP-1, is phosphorylated by CDK-1 on T452, producing a Polo box binding motif that recruits PLK-2 to the SC, contributing to the inactivation of CHK-2 when chromosomes are synapsed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brandt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have shown that PCH-2 antagonizes crossover formation throughout meiotic prophase and that this regulation occurs through one of the three essential meiotic HORMADs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, HIM-3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). We propose that PCH-2 remodels HIM-3 on meiotic chromosomes to destabilize crossover-eligible intermediates, thus limiting which DSBs will become crossovers (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). However, this antagonism has different consequences depending on when during meiotic prophase it occurs, underscoring the importance of temporal regulation of these events. During leptotene/zygotene, when CHK-2 activity is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) and PCH-2 is present as foci on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>), PCH-2 prevents crossover formation at some sites of initial DSB formation and early homolog interactions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). In this way, PCH-2 promotes a wider distribution of crossovers across the genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In pachytene, when CHK-2 activity has decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) and PCH-2 is localized to the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>), PCH-2 winnows crossover-eligible intermediates, ensuring their reinforcement, designation and crossover assurance (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). When there are defects in recombination, such as partial synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>), changes in karyotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Patel et al., 2023</xref>) or too few DSBs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), PCH-2 persists on the SC to prevent designation, guarantee crossover assurance and some degree of homeostasis, independent of an additional feedback mechanism that increases DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Patel et al., 2023</xref>). That persistence of PCH-2 also disrupts crossover interference in two of these situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Patel et al., 2023</xref>) strongly suggests that crossover interference is mechanistically linked to assurance and homeostasis.</p>

<p><italic>him-3<sup>R93Y</sup>;pch-2</italic> double mutants have stronger crossover assurance than either single mutant but less than wildtype animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Russo et al., 2023</xref>), a phenotype which can now be explained by the behavior of GFP::MSH-5 foci in these double mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, 4D). We have shown that HIM-3<sup>R93Y</sup> mutant protein can adopt the closed conformation and loads on meiotic chromosomes similar to wildtype HIM- 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Russo et al. 2023</xref>). In vitro analysis shows that HIM-3<sup>R93Y</sup> binds its closure motif with reduced affinity, likely affecting its ability to adopt the closed conformation in vivo (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Russo et al. 2023</xref>). The proposed role of PCH-2 in meiosis is to remodel meiotic HORMADs from the closed conformation to the extended one (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), regulating their association with chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhalla, 2023</xref>). However, since meiotic HORMADs are not visibly depleted from chromosomes during meiotic progression in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Couteau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Couteau &amp; Zetka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Goodyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Martinez-Perez &amp; Villeneuve, 2005</xref>), this genetic interaction supports a role for PCH-2 in temporarily reducing the occupancy of meiotic HORMADs on meiotic chromosomes, destabilizing interactions with partner proteins that modulate the progression and fidelity of meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Russo et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, PCH-2’s remodeling of HIM-3 would disrupt protein-protein interactions that underlie crossover-eligible intermediates, destabilizing them and reducing their number on chromosomes, contributing to crossover control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Since meiotic HORMADs are essential for meiotic chromosome axis structure and function, our data therefore support a role for the meiotic axis in crossover control, as suggested by previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Girard et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lambing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nabeshima et al., 2004</xref>). However, the disassembly of crossover-eligible intermediates would also release pro-crossover factors present at these sites to concentrate at other, more stable sites on the SC, contributing to reinforcement and designation during synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Girard et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, these results raise the possibility that this behavior of PCH-2 and/or meiotic HORMADs might be regulated by post-translational modifications associated with crossover control, such as ubiquitination, SUMOylation and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gray &amp; Cohen, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that mutation of PCH-2 produces changes in the number and distribution of crossovers across multiple model systems, we argue that controlling crossover distribution and number is the conserved role of PCH-2 in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhalla, 2023</xref>). We have previously proposed that the conserved role of PCH- 2 is to coordinate meiotic recombination with synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhalla, 2023</xref>). With these results, we further refine this model. Early in meiotic prophase, PCH-2 remodels meiotic HORMADs to prevent some DSBs from becoming crossover-eligible intermediates, widening the recombination landscape beyond early homolog interactions and/or sites that tend to be more favorable for DSB formation, also known as ‘hot spots.” For example, this may explain the localization of TRIP13, the PCH-2 ortholog in mice, to telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chotiner et al., 2024</xref>), sites that experience early homolog interactions due to the organization of meiotic chromosomes in the bouquet formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Scherthan et al., 1996</xref>). This antagonism may also expand the regions of the genome that initiate synapsis in organisms that use DSBs to accomplish this event. This possibility is supported by the observation that loss of TRIP13 in mammals produce meiotic chromosomes that exhibit partial asynapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Roig et al., 2010</xref>), particularly near regions that may act as barriers to SC polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Roig et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Limiting which DSBs becomes crossover-eligible intermediates in early meiotic prophase also ensures that meiotic recombination overlaps with synapsis, either completely, as in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>) or partially, as in budding yeast, plants and mice (Capilla-Perez et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Morgan et al., 2021</xref>). Once synapsis is complete, PCH-2 continues to remodel meiotic HORMADs on chromosomes to control the gradual implementation of crossover number and distribution, reinforcing the important role that synapsis plays in mediating crossover control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Durand et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Libuda et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the inability to reduce the number of crossover-eligible intermediates in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants, as visualized by GFP::MSH-5 foci, does not produce extra crossovers but a loss of crossover- assurance in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), a somewhat counterintuitive result. One interpretation of these data is that crossover-eligible intermediates may be more numerous but absent from some chromosomes in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants, explaining the loss of crossover assurance. Since the absence of crossover intermediates in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is accompanied by premature desynapsis of individual chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Machovina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pattabiraman et al., 2017</xref>) and chromosomes in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants delay desynapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>), we do not favor this interpretation. Instead, we propose that having too many crossover-eligible intermediates can be as deleterious to crossover assurance as having too few (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). This possibility is further supported by the loss of crossover assurance we detect in irradiated wildtype worms, which is exacerbated in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>This phenomenon, where crossover-eligible intermediates need to be winnowed to some threshold number to ensure crossover assurance, may also explain the loss of crossover assurance also observed in <italic>Trip13</italic> deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Roig et al., 2010</xref>) and on small chromosomes in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chakraborty et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, the counterintuitive relationship between the number of crossover-eligible precursors and crossover assurance in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants we observe might reflect an additional layer of regulation during crossover formation specific to <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Since <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes are holocentric, crossovers play an additional role organizing chromosomes for the ordered release of sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Martinez-Perez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nabeshima et al., 2005</xref>) and extra crossovers can be deleterious to accurate chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hollis et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a system that appears to be able to tolerate an extraordinarily high number of crossovers with little to no effect on chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Durand et al., 2022</xref>), PCH2’s inability to localize to the SC produces an increase in crossover formation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), as visualized by both MLH1 foci and the formation of chiasmata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Once again, an overarching theme that becomes apparent in our model is that PCH-2 may play a common role in different systems, with dramatic variations in phenotypic consequences given species-specific requirements and constraints.</p>
<p>We were not surprised to see high numbers of double crossovers on almost every chromosome in our genetic analysis of recombination in wildtype worms, given our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>). However, we were surprised to see that the majority of them were found near Pairing Centers and sites of synapsis initiation, suggesting a relationship between early homolog interactions and the formation of double crossovers. When we revisited our previous data, we observed similar patterns. In addition, we do not detect these double crossovers cytologically in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, even when using the OLLAS::COSA-1 reporter, which has been reported to identify double crossovers in spermatogenesis not visualized by GFP::COSA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cahoon et al., 2023</xref>). Crossovers that are cytologically marked by COSA-1 are known as Class I crossovers, which depend on pro-crossover factors such as MSH-5 and ZHP-3, and exhibit crossover control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gray &amp; Cohen, 2016</xref>). These data raise the intriguing possibility that these double crossovers are the product of the alternate, Class II, pathway of crossover formation, which relies on a different suite of proteins, does not respond to crossover control and contributes to varying degrees in different model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gray &amp; Cohen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Youds et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, important corollaries of our model may be that PCH-2 specifically coordinates recombination with synapsis to promote Class I crossovers, limit Class II crossovers and that Class II crossovers are more likely to form early in meiosis, prior to synapsis. Therefore, variations in the contribution of the Class II crossover pathways to crossover recombination and the degree of cross-talk between Class I and Class II pathways among model systems might reflect the degree to which crossover formation overlaps with synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhalla, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gray &amp; Cohen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, these corollaries are entirely consistent with PCH-2’s absence from the genome of fission yeast (Wu &amp; Burgess, 2007), a system in which chromosomes do not undergo synapsis, crossovers do not exhibit interference and all crossovers are dependent on the Class II pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hollingsworth &amp; Brill, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results also have some additional important implications about the regulation of DSB formation across the genome in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We explain the shift in the recombination landscape away from the central regions of chromosomes and toward PC ends in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) as a result of early DSBs becoming crossovers at the expense of later DSBs, suggesting that when DSBs happen in meiotic prophase affects where they happen in the genome. Specifically, we propose that chromosome arms, which are gene poor, receive DSBs early during (or even throughout) DSB formation and the center of chromosomes, which are gene rich, receive DSBs later. A similar regulation of the timing of DSB formation has been demonstrated in budding yeast, where the DSB landscape across the whole genome expands when time in prophase is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">López Ruiz et al., 2024</xref>) and small, highly recombinogenic, chromosomes, get more DSBs later in meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Murakami et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Subramanian et al., 2019</xref>). However, this temporal regulation has not been reported previously in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and suggests that this phenomenon is more widely conserved. This expansion of the DSB landscape in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to include the center regions of chromosomes later in meiosis may be a deliberate attempt for recombination to create new haplotypes for evolution to act on, despite the relative paucity of DSBs and the observation that they can result in chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Altendorfer et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, our work raises some important questions about the functional role(s) of DSBs in meiosis, aside from their contributions to crossover formation. Hicks and colleagues were the first to report that early DSBs do not contribute to crossover formation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hicks et al., 2022</xref>). Here we show that these early DSBs are prevented from becoming crossovers by both PCH-2 activity and cell cycle stage, specifically in leptotene/zygotene, when homologs are initiating pairing and synapsis. In budding yeast, similar, early-occurring DSBs have been characterized as “scout DSBs” because of their preference for repair from sister chromatids, versus homologous chromosomes, and their proposed role in contributing to homolog pairing (Borde &amp; de Massy, 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>). The homolog bias that these “scout DSBs” do display seems dependent on budding yeast <italic>PCH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>) but interpreting this experiment is complicated by the fact that Pch2 is also required to make the budding yeast meiotic HORMAD, Hop1, available for its loading onto meiotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Herruzo et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to budding yeast, <italic>C. elegans</italic> does not rely on DSBs to promote homolog pairing and initiate synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>); in worms, <italic>cis</italic>-acting sites called Pairing Centers are essential for homolog pairing and synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">MacQueen et al., 2005</xref>). There is certainly some support in the literature for DSBs playing a role in supporting pairing and synapsis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mlynarczyk-Evans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Roelens et al., 2015</xref>). However, if these early DSBs were contributing to pairing and synapsis, we would expect to see a genetic interaction between <italic>htp-3<sup>H96Y</sup></italic> and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutations in the installation of GFP::MSH-5 in the transition zone; we previously reported that <italic>htp- 3<sup>H96Y</sup></italic> suppresses the acceleration of pairing and synapsis of <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants, particularly when Pairing Center function is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Russo et al., 2023</xref>). Instead, we favor the possibility that these early DSBs are generated to amplify the signaling of DNA damage kinases to prime them for their role in recombination, a role that has also been proposed for “scout” DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>). That ATM-1, a conserved DNA damage kinase that is downstream of CHK-2 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, relies on DSBs for full activity, supports this proposed, conserved role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yu et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Our work provides an important framework to finally understand the role of PCH-2 in controlling the number and distribution of crossovers, a role that we argue is its conserved role. While specific details may vary across systems, we propose that PCH-2 remodels meiotic HORMADs throughout meiotic prophase to destabilize crossover-eligible precursors, coordinating meiotic recombination with synapsis, contributing to the progressive implementation of meiotic recombination and guaranteeing crossover assurance, interference and homeostasis.</p>

<p>The conserved AAA-ATPase PCH-2 has been shown in several organisms including C. elegans to remodel classes of HORMAD proteins that act in meiotic pairing and recombination. In some organisms the impact of PCH-2 mutations is subtle but becomes more apparent when other aspects of recombination are perturbed. Patel et al. performed a set of elegant experiments in C. elegans aimed at identifying conserved functions of PCH-2. Their work provides such an opportunity because in C. elegans meiotically expressed HORMADs localize to meiotic chromosomes independently of PCH-2. Work in C. elegans also allows the authors to focus on nuclear PCH-2 functions as opposed to cytoplasmic functions also seen for PCH-2 in other organisms.</p>
<p>The authors performed the following experiments:</p>
<p>(1) They constructed C. elegans animals with SNPs that enabled them to measure crossing over in intervals that cover most of four of the six chromosomes. They then showed that double-crossovers, which were common on most of the four chromosomes in wild-type, were absent in pch-2. They also noted shifts in crossover distribution in the four chromosomes.</p>
<p>(2) Based on the crossover analysis and previous studies they hypothesized that PCH-2 plays a role at an early stage in meiotic prophase to regulate how SPO-11 induced double-strand breaks are utilized to form crossovers. They tested their hypothesis by performing ionizing irradiation and depleting SPO-11 at different stages in meiotic prophase in wild-type and pch-2 mutant animals. The authors observed that irradiation of meiotic nuclei in zygotene resulted in pch-2 nuclei having a larger number of nuclei with 6 or greater crossovers (as measured by COSA-1 foci) compared to wildtype. Consistent with this observation, SPO11 depletion, starting roughly in zygotene, also resulted in pch-2 nuclei having an increase in 6 or more COSA-1 foci compared to wild type. The increased number at this time point appeared beneficial because a significant decrease in univalents was observed.</p>
<p>(3) They then asked if the above phenotypes correlated with the localization of MSH-5, a factor that stabilizes crossover-specific DNA recombination intermediates. They observed that pch-2 mutants displayed an increase in MSH-5 foci at early times in meiotic prophase and an unexpectedly higher number at later times. They conclude based on the differences in early MSH-5 localization and the SPO-11 and irradiation studies that PCH-2 prevents early DSBs from becoming crossovers and early loading of MSH-5. By analyzing different HORMAD proteins that are defective in forming the closed conformation acted upon by PCH-2, they present evidence that MSH-5 loading was regulated by the HIM-3 HORMAD.</p>
<p>(4) They performed a crossover homeostasis experiment in which DSB levels were reduced. The goal of this experiment was to test if PCH-2 acts in crossover assurance. Interestingly, in this background PCH-2 negative nuclei displayed higher levels of COSA-1 foci compared to PCH-2 positive nuclei. This observation and a further test of the model suggested that &quot;PCH-2's presence on the SC prevents crossover designation.&quot;</p>
<p>(5) Based on their observations indicating that early DSBS are prevented from becoming crossovers by PCH-2, the authors hypothesized that the DNA damage kinase CHK-2 and PCH-2 act to control how DSBs enter the crossover pathway. This hypothesis was developed based on their finding that PCH-2 prevents early DSBs from becoming crossovers and previous work showing that CHK-2 activity is modulated during meiotic recombination progression. They tested their hypothesis using a mutant synaptonemal complex component that maintains high CHK-2 activity that cannot be turned off to enable crossover designation. Their finding that the pch-2 mutation suppressed the crossover defect (as measured by COSA-1 foci) supports their hypothesis.</p>
<p>Based on these studies the authors provide convincing evidence that PCH-2 prevents early DSBs from becoming crossovers and controls the number and distribution of crossovers to promote a regulated mechanism that ensures the formation of obligate crossovers and crossover homeostasis. As the authors note, such a mechanism is consistent with earlier studies suggesting that early DSBs could serve as &quot;scouts&quot; to facilitate homolog pairing or to coordinate the DNA damage response with repair events that lead to crossing over. The detailed mechanistic insights provided in this work will certainly be used to better understand functions for PCH-2 in meiosis in other organisms. My comments below are aimed at improving the clarity of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Comments</p>
<p>(1) It appears from reading the Materials and Methods that the SNPs used to measure crossing over were obtained by mating Hawaiian and Bristol strains. It is not clear to this reviewer how the SNPs were introduced into the animals. Was crossing over measured in a single animal line? Were the wild-type and pch-2 mutations made in backgrounds that were isogenic with respect to each other? This is a concern because it is not clear, at least to this reviewer, how much of an impact crossing different ecotypes will have on the frequency and distribution of recombination events (and possibly the recombination intermediates that were studied).</p>
<p>(2) The authors state that in pch-2 mutants there was a striking shift of crossovers (line 135) to the PC end for all of the four chromosomes that were tested. I looked at Figure 1 for some time and felt that the results were more ambiguous. Map distances seemed similar at the PC end for wildtype and pch-2 on Chrom. I. While the decrease in crossing over in pch-2 appeared significant for Chrom. I and III, the results for Chrom. IV, and Chrom. X. seemed less clear. Were map distances compared statistically? At least for this reviewer the effects on specific intervals appear less clear and without a bit more detail on how the animals were constructed it's hard for me to follow these conclusions.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 2. I'm curious why non-irradiated controls were not tested side-by-side for COSA-1 staining. It just seems like a nice control that would strengthen the authors' arguments.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 3. It took me a while to follow the connection between the COSA-1 staining and DAPI staining panels (12 hrs later). Perhaps an arrow that connects each set of time points between the panels or just a single title on the X-axis that links the two would make things clearer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper has some intriguing data regarding the different potential roles of Pch-2 in ensuring crossing over. In particular, the alterations in crossover distribution and Msh-5 foci are compelling. My main issue is that some of the models are confusingly presented and would benefit from some reframing. The role of Pch-2 across organisms has been difficult to determine, the ability to separate pairing and synapsis roles in worms provides a great advantage for this paper.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Beautiful genetic data, clearly made figures. Great system for studying the role of Pch-2 in crossing over.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) For a general audience, definitions of crossover assurance, crossover eligible intermediates, and crossover designation would be helpful. This applies to both the proposed molecular model and the cytological manifestation that is being scored specifically in C. Elegans.</p>
<p>(2) Line 62: Is there evidence that DSBs are introduced gradually throughout the early prophase? Please provide references.</p>
<p>(3) Do double crossovers show strong interference in worms? Given that the PC is at the ends of chromosomes don't you expect double crossovers to be near the chromosome ends and thus the PC?</p>
<p>(4) Line 155 - if the previous data in Deshong et al is helpful it would be useful to briefly describe it and how the experimental caveats led to misinterpretation (or state that further investigation suggests a different model etc.). Many readers are unlikely to look up the paper to find out what this means.</p>
<p>(5) Line 248: I am confused by the meaning of crossover assurance here - you see no difference in the average number of COSA-1 foci in Pch-2 vs. wt at any time point. Is it the increase in cells with &gt;6 COSA-1 foci that shows a loss of crossover assurance? That is the only thing that shows a significant difference (at the one time point) in COSA-1 foci. The number of dapi bodies shows the loss of Pch-2 increases crossover assurance (fewer cells with unattached homologs). So this part is confusing to me. How does reliably detecting foci vs. DAPI bodies explain this?</p>
<p>(6) Line 384: I am confused. I understand that in the dsb-2/pch2 mutant there are fewer COSA-1 foci. So fewer crossovers are designated when DSBs are reduced in the absence of PCH-2. How then does this suggest that PCH-2's presence on the SC prevents crossover designation? Its absence is preventing crossover designation at least in the dsb-2 mutant.</p>
<p>(7) Discussion Line 535: How do you know that the crossovers that form near the PCs are Class II and not the other way around? Perhaps early forming Class I crossovers give time for a second Class II crossover to form. In budding yeast, it is thought that synapsis initiation sites are likely sites of crossover designation and class I crossing over. Also, the precursors that form class I and II crossovers may be the same or highly similar to each other, such that Pch-2's actions could equally affect both pathways.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes an in-depth analysis of the effect of the AAA+ ATPase PCH-2 on meiotic crossover formation in C. elegant. The authors reach several conclusions, and attempt to synthesize a 'universal' framework for the role of this factor in eukaryotic meiosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript makes use of the advantages of the 'conveyor' belt system within the c.elegans reproductive tract, to enable a series of elegant genetic experiments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness of this manuscript is that it heavily relies on certain genetic/cell biological assays that can report on distinct crossover outcomes, without clear and directed control over other aspects and variables that might also impact the final repair outcome. Such assays are currently out of reach in this model system.</p>
<p>In general, this manuscript could be more generally accessible to non-C.elegans readers. Currently, the manuscript is hard to digest for non-experts (even if meiosis researchers). In addition, the authors should be careful to consider alternative explanations for certain results. At several steps in the manuscript, results could ostensibly be caused by underlying defects that are currently unknown (for example, can we know for sure that pch-2 mutants do not suffer from altered DSB patterning, and how can we know what the exact functional and genetic interactions between pch-2 and HORMAD mutants tell us?). Alternative explanations are possible and it would serve the reader well to explicitly name and explain these options throughout the manuscript.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their concise summary of our manuscript and their assessment of our work as “convincing” and providing “detailed mechanistic insight.”</p>

<p>We will clarify these issues in the Materials and Methods of an updated preprint. The control and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants were isogenic in either the Bristol or Hawaiian backgrounds. Control lines were the original Bristol and Hawaiian lines and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants were originally made in the Bristol line and backcrossed at least 3 times before analysis. Hawaiian <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants were made by backcrossing <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants at least 7 times to the Hawaiian background and verifying the presence of Hawaiian SNPs on all chromosomes tested in the recombination assay. To perform the recombination assays, these isogenic lines were crossed to generate the relevant F1s.</p>

<p>We hope that the added details above makes the results of these assays more clear. Map distances were compared and did not satisfy statistical significance, except where indicated. While we agree that the comparisons between control animals and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants may seem less clear with individual chromosomes, we argue that more general patterns become clear when analyzing multiple chromosomes. Indeed, this is why we expanded our recombination analysis beyond Chromosome III and the X Chromosomes, as reported in Deshong, 2014.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper has some intriguing data regarding the different potential roles of Pch-2 in ensuring crossing over. In particular, the alterations in crossover distribution and Msh-5 foci are compelling. My main issue is that some of the models are confusingly presented and would benefit from some reframing. The role of Pch-2 across organisms has been difficult to determine, the ability to separate pairing and synapsis roles in worms provides a great advantage for this paper.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Beautiful genetic data, clearly made figures. Great system for studying the role of Pch-2 in crossing over.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their constructive and useful summary of our manuscript and the analysis of its strengths.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) For a general audience, definitions of crossover assurance, crossover eligible intermediates, and crossover designation would be helpful. This applies to both the proposed molecular model and the cytological manifestation that is being scored specifically in C. elegans.</p>

<p>We will make these changes in an updated preprint.</p>

<p>We will reference Woglar and Villeneuve 2018 and Joshi et. al. 2015 to support this statement in the updated preprint.</p>

<p>(3) Do double crossovers show strong interference in worms? Given that the PC is at the ends of chromosomes don't you expect double crossovers to be near the chromosome ends and thus the PC?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Despite their rarity, double crossovers do show interference in worms. However, the PC is limited to one end of the chromosome. Therefore, even if interference ensures the spacing of these double crossovers, the preponderance of one of these crossovers toward one end (and not both ends) suggest something functionally unique about the PC end.</p>

<p>(4) Line 155 - if the previous data in Deshong et al is helpful it would be useful to briefly describe it and how the experimental caveats led to misinterpretation (or state that further investigation suggests a different model etc.). Many readers are unlikely to look up the paper to find out what this means.</p>

<p>We will add this to the updated preprint.</p>

<p>(5) Line 248: I am confused by the meaning of crossover assurance here - you see no difference in the average number of COSA-1 foci in Pch-2 vs. wt at any time point. Is it the increase in cells with &gt;6 COSA-1 foci that shows a loss of crossover assurance? That is the only thing that shows a significant difference (at the one time point) in COSA-1 foci. The number of dapi bodies shows the loss of Pch-2 increases crossover assurance (fewer cells with unattached homologs). So this part is confusing to me. How does reliably detecting foci vs. DAPI bodies explain this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion and will make this more clear in an updated perprint. The reviewer is correct that we do not see a difference in the average number of GFP::COSA1 foci at all time points in this experiment, even though we do see a difference in the number of DAPI stained bodies (an increase in crossover assurance in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants). What we meant to convey is that because of PCH-2’s dual role in regulating crossover formation (inhibiting it in early prophase, guaranteeing assurance later), the average number of GFP::COSA-1 foci at all time points also reflects this later role, resulting in this average being lower than if PCH-2 only inhibited crossovers early in meiotic prophase. We have shown that this later role does not significantly affect the average number of DAPI stained bodies, allowing us to see the role of PCH-2 in early meiotic prophase on crossover formation more clearly.</p>

<p>(6) Line 384: I am confused. I understand that in the dsb-2/pch2 mutant there are fewer COSA-1 foci. So fewer crossovers are designated when DSBs are reduced in the absence of PCH-2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>How then does this suggest that PCH-2's presence on the SC prevents crossover designation? Its absence is preventing crossover designation at least in the dsb-2 mutant.</p>
<p>We will also make this more clear in an updated preprint, as well as provide additional evidence to support this claim. In this experiment, we had identified three possible explanations for why PCH-2 persists on some nuclei that do not have GFP::COSA-1 foci: 1) PCH-2 removal is coincident with crossover designation; 2) PCH-2 removal depends on crossover designation; and 3) PCH-2 removal facilitates crossover designation. The decrease in the number of GFP::COSA-1 foci in <italic>dsb-2::AID;pch-2</italic> mutants argues against the first two possibilities, suggesting that the third might be correct. We have additional evidence that we will include in an updated preprint that should provide stronger support and make this more clear.</p>

<p>(7) Discussion Line 535: How do you know that the crossovers that form near the PCs are Class II and not the other way around? Perhaps early forming Class I crossovers give time for a second Class II crossover to form. In budding yeast, it is thought that synapsis initiation sites are likely sites of crossover designation and class I crossing over. Also, the precursors that form class I and II crossovers may be the same or highly similar to each other, such that Pch-2's actions could equally affect both pathways.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not know that the crossovers that form near the PC are Class II but hypothesize that they are based on the close, functional relationship that exists between Class I crossovers and synapsis and the apparent antagonistic relationship that exists between Class II crossovers and synapsis. We agree that Class I and Class II crossover precursors are likely to be the same or highly similar, exhibit extensive crosstalk that may complicate straightforward analysis and PCH-2 is likely to affect both, as strongly suggested by our GFP::MSH-5 analysis. We present this hypothesis based on the apparent relationship between PCH-2 and synapsis in several systems but agree that it needs to be formally tested. We will make this argument more clear in an updated preprint.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes an in-depth analysis of the effect of the AAA+ ATPase PCH-2 on meiotic crossover formation in C. elegant. The authors reach several conclusions, and attempt to synthesize a 'universal' framework for the role of this factor in eukaryotic meiosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript makes use of the advantages of the 'conveyor' belt system within the c.elegans reproductive tract, to enable a series of elegant genetic experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this reviewer for the useful assessment of our manuscript and the articulation of its strengths.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness of this manuscript is that it heavily relies on certain genetic/cell biological assays that can report on distinct crossover outcomes, without clear and directed control over other aspects and variables that might also impact the final repair outcome. Such assays are currently out of reach in this model system.</p>
<p>In general, this manuscript could be more generally accessible to non-C.elegans readers. Currently, the manuscript is hard to digest for non-experts (even if meiosis researchers). In addition, the authors should be careful to consider alternative explanations for certain results. At several steps in the manuscript, results could ostensibly be caused by underlying defects that are currently unknown (for example, can we know for sure that pch-2 mutants do not suffer from altered DSB patterning, and how can we know what the exact functional and genetic interactions between pch-2 and HORMAD mutants tell us?). Alternative explanations are possible and it would serve the reader well to explicitly name and explain these options throughout the manuscript.</p>

<p>We will make the manuscript more accessible to non-<italic>C. elegans</italic> readers and discuss alternate explanations for specific results in an updated preprint.</p>
