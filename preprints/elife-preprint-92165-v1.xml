<title>Abstract</title>
<p>DNA methylation is extensively reprogrammed during early stage of mammalian development and is essential for normal embryogenesis. It is well established that mouse embryos acquire genome-wide DNA methylation during implantation, referred to as <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, from globally hypomethylated blastocysts. However, the fact that the main <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) is initially expressed as early as the 8-cell stage during preimplantation development, contradicts the current knowledge about timing of initiation of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. Here, we reported that a previously overlooked minor wave of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation initially occurs during the transition from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage, before the well-known large-scale <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation during implantation. Bioinformatic and functional analyses indicated that minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation preferentially occurs on the X chromosome and co-regulates imprinted X-chromosome inactivation via the interaction between DNMT3B and polycomb repressive complexes 2 core components during blastocyst formation. Furthermore, minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation also finetunes proliferation, lineage differentiation and metabolic homeostasis of preimplantation embryos, and is critical for embryonic developmental potential and pregnancy outcomes. Thus, our study updates the current knowledge of embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, thereby providing a novel insight of early embryonic epigenetic reprogramming.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammalian early embryos are co-regulated by a series of spatiotemporally restricted epigenomic events that are critical for acquiring developmental potential. In mouse, it has been widely accepted that a wave of genome-wide <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation occurs around the time of implantation, thus re-establishing DNA methylation patterns from a globally hypomethylated blastocysts to relatively static DNA methylation patterns in post-implantation embryos (Borgel et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2012). DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) is the main enzyme that catalyzes embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. Genetic depletion of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> results in hypomethylation and dysregulation of pluripotency genes, gastrulation genes, germline-specific genes, <italic>etc</italic> (Auclair et al., 2014; Borgel et al., 2010), thus causing severe developmental defects and lethality after implantation (Li et al., 1992; Okano et al., 1999). However, despite its developmental importance, the exact timing of initiation of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation remains largely elusive.</p>
<p>Although earlier results using high-throughput sequencing methods suggested that <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation occurs during the transition from blastocysts to early post-implantation embryos (Auclair et al., 2014; Borgel et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2012), our detection assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,B</xref>) and other previous studies (Guenatri et al., 2013; Li et al., 2016) indicated that <italic>Dnmt3b,</italic> the main <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferase, is initially expressed as early as the 8-cell stage during preimplantation development. This fact creates a contradiction that challenges current knowledge about timing of initiation of embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, and therefore raising the possibility that embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation may precede, but not follows, the blastocyst stage.</p>

<p>To test this possibility, we reanalyzed well-established genome-scale bisulfite sequencing data that profiles DNA methylation maps from the mouse preimplantation to post-implantation embryos (Smith et al., 2012), and found approximately one-third of genes gained promoter DNA methylation during the transition from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage. It means that despite global DNA demethylation throughout the preimplantation development, a small proportion of regions have initiated <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation prior to the blastocyst stage, which we designated as minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. We next ask its developmental functions for embryogenesis. Of interest, minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation is more prone to occur on the X chromosome. We next confirmed that minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation plays an important role in establishing imprinted X chromosome inactivation (iXCI) via the interaction between DNMT3B and the polycomb repressive complexes 2 (PRC2) core components, which are critical for X-linked heterochromatin. Further analyses indicated that minor <italic>de novo</italic> methylation also finetunes proliferation, lineage differentiation and metabolism of preimplantation embryos, and thus affecting the developmental potential and final pregnancy outcomes. Thus, our study provides a novel understanding of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation during early development, which updates the current knowledge of embryonic epigenomic hallmark events and their interactions.</p>

<title>A small proportion of promoters initiate <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation by the 8-cell stage</title>
<p>To investigate the earliest initiation of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, we first examined the expression patterns of <italic>Dnmt3s</italic> in mouse preimplantation embryos. Results from previously published transcriptome (Fan et al., 2015) and our quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) detection showed that expression of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>, the main enzyme for embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation (Borgel et al., 2010; Okano et al., 1999), as well as its non-catalytic partner <italic>Dnmt3l</italic> (Gowher et al., 2005), initiated by the 8-cell stage, and were further increased upon preimplantation development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). By contrast, the expression of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, which is mainly required for gametic methylation (Kaneda et al., 2004a), was maintained at low levels concurrently (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The initial expression of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> was also confirmed at the protein level. Nuclear location of DNMT3B can be clearly detected from the 8-cell stage onward (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Given the essential role of DNMT3B in catalyzing <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, we postulated that embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation may initiate as early as the 8-cell stage, which challenges current knowledge that <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation initiates during implantation.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis, we next reanalyzed a well-established genome-scale bisulfite sequencing data that profiles DNA methylation maps from the mouse preimplantation to post-implantation stage (Smith et al., 2012). We first focused our analysis on DNA methylation dynamics of promoter, the preferential target of DNMT3B (Auclair et al., 2014; Borgel et al., 2010), from the 8-cell stage onward. Despite the global loss of promoter DNA methylation (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), more detailed characterization showed that a considerable proportion of promoters (approximately 30%) gained DNA methylation during the transition from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage, even though most promoters underwent demethylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In line with this, a small proportion of gene bodies also gained DNA methylation during the transition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This observation was also supported by reanalysis results (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) of another published bisulfite sequencing data (Smith et al., 2017). By tracking DNA methylation dynamics of two subsets of promoters that gained or lost DNA methylation from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage respectively, we found promoters that underwent demethylation were relatively hypermethylated following fertilization, and then were gradually demethylated until reaching their lowest value in ICM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, promoters that gained DNA methylation by the 8-cell to blastocyst stage, were more hypomethylated following fertilization, and reached their lowest DNA methylation levels at the 8-cell stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Given the hypomethylated regions are more accessible to <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferases (Lorincz et al., 2002), this subset of promoters may be targeted by DNMT3B at the 8-cell stage and thus initiate their <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation before the blastocyst stage, and then continued during implantation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). As exemplified by the <italic>Yy2</italic> promoter, the results of PCR-based bisulfite sequencing further confirmed the occurrence of <italic>de novo</italic> methylation before the blastocyst stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). To distinguish two waves of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation before and after the blastocyst stage, we designated them as minor and major <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, respectively. We noticed that, besides of many important basic processes common to two waves of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation may be linked to chromosome organization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Compared with conventionally accepted major <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation showed a smaller increase in promoter DNA methylation that tended to occur in low CpG-containing promoters (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation preferentially occurs on the X chromosome and plays an important role in iXCI</title>
<p>To obtain a global view of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, we next detected the chromosome-wide distribution of <italic>de novo</italic> methylated promoters from the 8-cell to ICM, and found that they were globally distributed across autosomes, with the percentage ranging from 23% to 33% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>). Of note, approximately half of X-linked promoters (48%) underwent minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation throughout the X chromosome (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), much higher than those of autosomal promoters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). This result was similar with that of major <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation during implantation (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B,C</xref>). The X chromosome-biased prevalence of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation is reminiscent of XCI, a female-specific epigenetic event that occurs during early development for balancing the X-linked gene dosage between males and females. In mice, early embryos undergo two waves of XCI: iXCI initiates in early preimplantation embryos and persists in extraembryonic tissues, and rXCI occurs in the embryonic cells by implantation stage (Augui et al., 2011; Chow and Heard, 2009; Lee and Bartolomei, 2013). Spatiotemporal co-occurrence of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation and iXCI on the X chromosome, led us to ask if these two epigenetic events are functional linked during preimplantation development. Indeed, it has been well-accepted DNA methylation is essential for maintaining X chromosome-wide transcriptional silence of rXCI during implantation (Blewitt et al., 2008; Sado et al., 2000), its role in iXCI has been documented as a long-standing open question of epigenetic programming during preimplantation development (Csankovszki et al., 2001; Kaneda et al., 2004b; Sado et al., 2000; Sado et al., 2004). Given identification of biological function of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation requires that only minor, but not major <italic>de novo</italic> methylation, is functionally inactivated before blastocyst formation, we next transiently inhibited <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> via siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD). As expected, <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in morulae, but not in blastocysts compared to those of the negative control (NC) group (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A-C</xref>). The transient inhibition of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> resulted in a significant decrease in the global level of 5mC staining before blastocyst formation (<xref rid="figs2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D,E</xref>). We next detected the H3K27me3, a classic marker for establishment of XCI achieving X chromosome-wide heterochromatinization of transcriptional depression (Chow and Heard, 2009; Huynh and Lee, 2005; Wutz, 2011). In line with the decreased DNA methylation levels (<xref rid="figs2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D,E</xref>), we found all detected <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-KD female blastocysts contained trophoblast cells lacking the H3K27me3 domain, with a variable frequency ranging from 10.7% to 42.4%; whereas nearly all NC female blastocysts showed a single H3K27me3 domain in each trophoblast (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>), indicating <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> deficiency leads to an impaired iXCI in preimplantation female embryos. Next, we further confirmed this result via <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-knockout (KO) and chemical-induced inhibition of DNMT3B (<xref rid="figs2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2F,G</xref>). In addition, the involvement of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in iXCI establishment was further supported by the fact that many representative X-linked non-escaping genes tended to <italic>de novo</italic> methylated during the transition from the 8-cell to ICM (<xref rid="figs2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2H</xref>). Although previous studies have described that loss of maintenance methyltransferase <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, or <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferases <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> in the female germ line, had no effect on iXCI in the trophoblast (Kaneda et al., 2004b; Sado et al., 2000), authors also emphasized that the role of <italic>de novo</italic> methylation in iXCI, remains an open question, possibly due to heterozygous deletion of <italic>Dnmt3a/3b</italic> in the maternal germ line, but not in preimplantation embryos (Kaneda et al., 2004b). This is partially in line with another previous report showing a significantly higher expression of <italic>Pgk1</italic>, a representative X-linked non-escaping gene, in <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>/<italic>3b</italic>-deficient female embryos (Sado et al., 2004). Taken together, our data from multiple methodologies, provided direct evidence that a wave of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation preceding the blastocyst stage, is critical for establishing iXCI.</p>

<title>Minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation co-regulates iXCI via the interaction between DNMT3B and PRC2 core components</title>
<p>Having confirmed the functional role of minor <italic>de novo</italic> methylation in iXCI, we next attempt to explore the underlying mechanism. Because iXCI is initiated by <italic>Xist</italic> RNA upregulation and coating during the 8-cell and morular stage (Penny et al., 1996), we first detected <italic>Xist</italic> mRNA expression. No significant difference in the degrees of absence of the <italic>Xist</italic> domain in each blastomere nucleus between NC and <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-KD female morulae (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A,B</xref>), which were also confirmed by detecting <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-KO female morulae (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In line with this, single female embryo qRT-PCR analysis of <italic>Xist</italic> and its essential upstream activator <italic>Rnf12</italic> during initial stage of iXCI, showed that the expression levels of <italic>Xist</italic> and <italic>Rnf12</italic> were not affected by <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> deficiency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Our results demonstrate that minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation participates in establishment, but not in initiation of iXCI.</p>

<p>In attempt to further understand the mechanism underlying the role of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in establishing iXCI, we next asked whether the <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> deficiency-induced loss of H3K27me3 domains was related to abnormal expression of histone-modifying enzymes. We detected the expression of H3K27 histone methyltransferases or the partner (<italic>Ezh2</italic>, <italic>Suz12, Eed</italic>) and demethylase (<italic>Kdm6a</italic>, <italic>Kdm6b</italic>). The results showed <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> deficiency has no impact on the expression of these enzymes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Given DNA methylation has a synergistic relationship with H3K27me3 in the process of heterochromatin formation (Hagarman et al., 2013; King et al., 2016), we reanalyzed H3K27me3 dynamics of promoters that underwent minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation during the transition from the 8-cell to ICM using a well-established H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data (Liu et al., 2016). As expected, concurrent increase in H3K27me3 enrichment can be clearly observed throughout the X chromosome and many <italic>de novo</italic> methylated X-linked promoters (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Next, we used <italic>in situ</italic> proximity ligation assays (PLA), a method that is suitable for visualizing protein interactions (Soderberg et al., 2006) to detect direct interactions between DNMT3B and PRC2 core components, <italic>i.e.,</italic> EZH2, SUZ12, EED, which are essential for X-linked heterochromatin. It is clearly visible that DNMT3B-EZH2, DNMT3B-SUZ12 and DNMT3B-EED interactions can be detected in the nuclei by the blastocyst stage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). In line with this, the function of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in XCI, as well as direct interaction between DNMT3B and PRC2 core components (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F,G</xref>; <xref rid="figs3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A-G</xref>), were also confirmed in differentiated female ES cells. Collectively, our results support the idea that minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation plays an important role in iXCI via synergistic interaction with heterochromatic histone modifications, rather than transcriptional regulation of iXCI-regulating genes.</p>

<title>Minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation participates in embryonic proliferation, differentiation and affects developmental potential</title>
<p>It has been known that <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation during implantation stage plays an essential role in transcriptional regulation of developmental genes that are critical for embryonic differentiation and survival (Auclair et al., 2014; Borgel et al., 2010), thus we next attempted to test the additional short-and long-term developmental consequences of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. Thus, we performed an integrated analysis using the published bisulfite sequencing data (Smith et al., 2012) and transcriptome data (Wu et al., 2016) that profiles DNA methylation and gene expression maps from the 8-cell to ICM, respectively. Putative genes transcriptionally regulated by minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation (<xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) were functionally related to many basic processes that were critical for normal embryonic survival, development and postnatal growth (<xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B,C</xref>), while genes subject to DNA demethylation also participate in similar processes (<xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting the developmental significance of DNA methylation homeostasis.</p>

<p>Given identification of long-term developmental consequence of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation requires that only minor, but not major <italic>de novo</italic> methylation, is functionally inactivated before blastocyst formation, we next used transient <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-KD (<xref rid="figs2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A-E</xref>) to examine whether minor <italic>de novo</italic> methylation is functionally associated with these basic biological processes before blastocyst formation and in turn affects developmental potential and pregnancy outcomes. <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> deficiency not only inhibited proliferation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), but also changed lineage differentiation of blastocysts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we examined the energy metabolism of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-KD embryos. Despite the unchanged total ATP production, <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> deficiency led to a significantly disruption in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-dependent-ATP production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). These observations were further confirmed via chemical-induced inactivation of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation (<xref rid="figs4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A-C</xref>). Finally, we transferred <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-KD embryos into pseudopregnant recipient females. Compared with that in NC group, <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-KD embryos resulted in a significantly reduced implantation rate and live birth rate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref>), suggesting the important role of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in influencing embryonic developmental potential. Since knockdown-mediated <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> deficiency has been restored to normal levels at the blastocyst stage, the possibility can be excluded that the reduced implantation rate and live birth rate may be due to defective major <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. Similarly, previous studies using <italic>Tet1</italic>-deficient or <italic>Tet1</italic>/<italic>3-</italic>deficient embryos, indicated the critical role of TET-mediated DNA demethylation in these processes, as well as embryonic and postnatal development (Dawlaty et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2015). Thus, it can be presumed that minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, and TET-mediated demethylation, may synergistically co-regulate DNA methylation homeostasis before blastocyst formation, thus fine-tuning embryonic developmental potential and long-term outcomes.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation is definitely distinct from previously reported DNA re-methylation in monkey and human preimplantation embryos, which occurs during the 2-to 8-cell and 4-to 8-cell transition respectively (Gao et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2018). The so-called DNA re-methylation does not occur in naturally conceived mouse embryos. However, an aberrant wave of DNA re-methylation has been identified in cloned mouse preimplantation embryos as an epigenetic barrier that impairs full-term developmental potential (Gao et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Collectively, our study presents an update on the current knowledge of embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. We identified that a wave of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation has initially occurred during the transition from the mouse 8-cell to blastocyst stage, but not during the implantation stage. Of interest, we provide the first evidence that DNA methylation is important for establishing iXCI in preimplantation female embryos. Our data, together with previous results, also support a model where minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation and demethylation co-orchestrate DNA methylation homeostasis before blastocyst formation, and serve as epigenetic mechanisms affecting embryonic developmental potential by fine-tuning the processes of lineage commitment, proliferation and metabolic homeostasis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, our work provides a novel insight for understanding epigenetic programming and reprogramming during early embryonic development.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Yue et al. re-processed publicly available DNA methylation data (published in 2012 and 2017 from the Meissner lab) from pre- and post-implantation mouse embryos. Against the global wave of genome-wide reduction of DNA methylation occurring during pre-implantation development, they detected a slight increase (~1% on average) of DNA methylation at gene promoter regions during the transition from 8-cell to blastocyst stage. They claim that many such promoters are located in the X chromosome. Subsequently, they knocked down Dnmt3b (presumably because of its upregulation during the transition from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage) and detected the aberrant patterning of H3K27me3 in the mutant female embryos. Based on this observation, they claim that imprinted X-chromosome inactivation is impaired in the Dnmt3b-Kd pre-implantation embryos. Finally, they propose a model where such an increase of DNA methylation together with H3K27me3 regulates imprinted X-chromosome inactivation in the pre-implantation embryos. While their observation is of potential interest, the current version of the work fails to provide enough evidence to support their conclusions. Below are suggestions and comments on the manuscript.</p>
<p>Major issues:</p>
<p>1. Sex of the embryos of the genome-wide bisulfite-sequencing data</p>
<p>
The authors re-analyzed publicly available genome-wide DNA methylation data from the Meissner lab published in 2012 and 2017. The former used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and the latter used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Based mainly on the RRBS data, Yue et al. detected de novo DNA methylated promoters during the transition from 8-cell to blastocyst against the global wave of genome-wide DNA demethylation. They claim that such promoter regions are enriched at the &quot;inactive&quot; X chromosome. However, it would be difficult to discuss DNA methylation at inactive X-chromosomes as the RRBS data were derived from a mixture of male and female embryos. It would also be notable that the increase of DNA methylation at these promoter regions is ~1% on average. Such a slight increase in DNA methylation during pre-implantation development could also be due to the developmental variations between the embryos or between the sexes of embryos.</p>
<p>2. Imprinted X-chromosome inactivation and evaluation of H3K27me3 (related to Figures 2C, D; 3F; Figure2-supplement 2 F, G; Figure3-supplement 3G)</p>
<p>
Based on the slight change in the H3K27me3 signals in the Dnmt3b-Kd blastocysts, the authors claim that imprinted X-chromosome inactivation is impaired in the mutant embryo. It would be not easy to reach this conclusion from such a rough analysis of H3K27me3 presented in Figure 2C, D. Rigorous quantification/evaluation of the H3K27me3 signals in the Dnmt3b-Kd embryos should be considered. Additional evidence for the impairment of H3K27me3 in the mutant embryos should also be provided (expression of a subset of X-linked genes by RNA-FISH or RT-PCR etc.). Though technically challenging, high-resolution genome-wide approach such as ChIP-seq of H3K27me3 in the Dnmt3b-kd female embryos (with traceable SNPs between maternal and paternal X chromosome to distinguish inactive and active X-chromosome) could more precisely evaluate regions that lose H3K27me3 in the X-chromosome (de novo DNA methylated promoters from 8-cell to blastocyst, for example).</p>
<p>3. Analysis of the developmental potential of Dnmt3b-kd embryos</p>
<p>
While the authors claim that Dnmt3b-mediated de novo DNA methylation plays an important role in imprinted X-chromosome inactivation, it remains unclear whether the analysis presented in Figure 4 is derived from &quot;female&quot; embryos. This analysis seemed confusing as the authors claim that de novo DNA methylation in the promoter regions during the transition from 8-cell to blastocyst regulates imprinted X-chromosome inactivation, but this should not happen in the male embryos. Was the impairment of embryonic proliferation and differentiation observed in both male and female embryos? Or is this specific to the female embryos? We think that the sex of the embryos would be critical for the analysis presented in Figure 4.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here, Yue et al. set out to determine if the low DNMT3B expression that is observed prior to de novo DNA methylation (before the blastocyst stage) has a function. Re-analyzing existing DNA methylation data from Smith et al. (2012) they find a small DNA methylation gain over a subset of promoters and gene bodies, occurring between the 8-cell and blastocyst stages, and refer to this as &quot;minor de novo DNA methylation&quot;. They attempt to assess the relevance/functionality of this minor DNA methylation gain, and report reduced H3K27me3 in Dnmt3b knockdown (KD) trophoblast cells that normally undergo imprinted X-chromosome inactivation (iXCI) before the blastocyst stage. In addition, they assess the proliferation, differentiation, metabolic function, implantation rate, and live birth rate of Dnmt3b KD blastocysts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Working with early embryos is technically demanding, making the well-designed experiments from this manuscript useful to the epigenetics community. Particularly, the DNMT3B expression and 5-mC staining at different embryonic stages.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Throughout the manuscript, please represent DNA methylation changes as delta DNA methylation instead of fold change.</p>
<p>- Detailed methods on the re-analysis of the DNA methylation data from Smith et al. 2012 are missing from the materials and methods section. Was a minimum coverage threshold used?</p>
<p>- Detailed methods on the establishment and validation of Dnmt3b KO blastocysts and 5-aza-dC treated blastocysts are missing (related to Figure 2).</p>
<p>- Detailed methods on the re-analysis of the ChIPseq data from Liu et al. 2016 are missing from the materials and methods section.</p>
<p>- Some of the data represented in bar graphs does not look convincing/significant. Maybe this data can be better represented differently, such as in box plots or violin plots, which would better represent the data.</p>
<p>- The relevance and rationale for experiments using 5-aza-dC treatment is unclear.</p>
