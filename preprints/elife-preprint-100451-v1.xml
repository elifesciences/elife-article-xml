<title>Summary</title><p>Sensitization of spinal nociceptive circuits plays a crucial role in neuropathic pain. This sensitization depends on new gene expression that is primarily regulated via transcriptional and translational control mechanisms. The relative roles of these mechanisms in regulating gene expression in the clinically relevant chronic phase of neuropathic pain are not well understood. Here, we show that changes in gene expression in the spinal cord during the chronic phase of neuropathic pain are substantially regulated at the translational level. Downregulating spinal translation at the chronic phase alleviated pain hypersensitivity. Cell-type-specific profiling revealed that spinal inhibitory neurons exhibited greater changes in translation after peripheral nerve injury compared to excitatory neurons. Notably, increasing translation selectively in all inhibitory neurons or parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneurons, but not excitatory neurons, promoted mechanical pain hypersensitivity. Furthermore, increasing translation in PV<sup>+</sup> neurons decreased their intrinsic excitability and spiking activity, whereas reducing translation in spinal PV<sup>+</sup> neurons prevented the nerve injury-induced decrease in excitability. Thus, translational control mechanisms in the spinal cord, particularly in inhibitory neurons, play a role in mediating neuropathic pain hypersensitivity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Peripheral nerve injury can cause neuropathic pain, a chronic pain condition that is debilitating and challenging to treat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The development (early) and maintenance (late) phases of neuropathic pain are mediated by structural and functional changes in peripheral and central pain-processing compartments via complex interactions between neuronal and non-neuronal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The persistence of these changes relies on <italic>de novo</italic> gene expression, which is tightly regulated, primarily via transcriptional and translational control mechanisms. Whereas previous studies have characterized transcriptional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> and translational<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> changes in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord following peripheral nerve injury and have demonstrated their important roles during the early stage of neuropathic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, the investigations of these mechanisms in the late maintenance phase are lacking.</p>
<p>Studies in neuronal and non-neuronal cells have revealed a poor correlation between the expression levels of distinct mRNAs and the abundance of their corresponding proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The regulation of mRNA translation significantly affects the cellular proteome, representing an important mechanism to account for the discordance between mRNA and protein expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Thus, it is essential to investigate the role of translational control in regulating gene expression and pain hypersensitivity during the clinically relevant late phase of neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>Recent methodological advances enable the investigation of genome-wide transcriptional and translational changes (using ribosome profiling [Ribo-seq]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>), as well as the identification of actively translating mRNAs in specific cell types (using translating ribosome affinity purification [TRAP]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>). Here, we employed Ribo-seq and TRAP techniques to study alterations in gene expression in DRG and spinal cord in the early and late phases of neuropathic pain. We found that both transcriptional and translational mechanisms regulate changes in gene expression in DRG in the early phase (4 days after nerve injury) and the late phase (63 days after nerve injury), as well as in the spinal cord in the early phase. Surprisingly, changes in gene expression in the spinal cord in the late phase of neuropathic pain were predominantly regulated at the translational level. Targeting a key translation initiation factor, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), in the spinal cord provided a long-lasting alleviation of evoked and spontaneous pain during the maintenance phase. Cell-type-specific translational profiling, using metabolic labeling and TRAP, revealed greater nerve injury-induced translational changes in spinal inhibitory neurons than in excitatory neurons. Activating translation in all inhibitory or parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneurons, but not excitatory neurons, was sufficient to induce hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>Taken together, this study provides a characterization of translational changes in the early and chronic phases of neuropathic pain and reveals the central role of spinal translational control, predominantly in inhibitory neurons, in the maintenance of pain hypersensitivity.</p>

<title>Translational regulation of gene expression in the spinal cord in the chronic phase of neuropathic pain</title>
<p>To study changes in gene expression at both transcriptional (transcriptome) and translational (translatome) levels, we employed Ribo-seq on DRG and lumbar spinal cord tissue obtained from mice subjected to an experimental assay of peripheral nerve damage-induced (i.e., neuropathic) pain, spared nerve injury (SNI, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, or sham surgery. SNI prominently features mechanical hypersensitivity, which develops within 2-4 days of the nerve injury and persists for many months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. L3-L5 DRGs and the ipsilateral dorsal half of the corresponding segment of the lumbar spinal cord (illustrated in a schematic diagram in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) were collected on day 4 (early phase) and day 63 (late phase) post-SNI and processed for Ribo-seq. Ribo-seq allows the identification of mRNA fragments (ribosome footprints [rFPs]) where translating ribosomes are bound. These mRNA fragments thus remain protected from nuclease-mediated RNase degradation, and thereby reveal the number and location of ribosomes on specific transcripts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Normalization to the corresponding transcript abundance from the parallel mRNA-seq analysis provides a measure of mRNA translation efficiency (TE) on a genome-wide scale. Using this approach, we identified transcriptionally- and translationally-regulated genes in each tissue and time-point (n = 3 biological replicates/condition, 15 mice pooled per replicate). In the DRG, a significant number of transcripts were altered at both transcriptional and translational levels at day 4 post-SNI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>; datasets are provided in Supplementary Table 1). At day 63 post-SNI, the number of transcriptionally altered mRNAs in the DRG decreased compared to day 4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). In the spinal cord, changes in gene expression were less pronounced and on day 4 post-SNI, a comparable number of differentially transcribed genes and differentially translated genes were identified (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Surprisingly, on day 63 post-SNI, changes in gene expression in the spinal cord occurred predominantly at the translational but not transcriptional level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). Pathway analysis of translationally regulated genes in the spinal cord on day 63 post-SNI showed changes in processes related to extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and its interaction with cell surface receptors, cell adhesion, and protein turnover (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that both transcriptional and translational mechanisms mediate changes in gene expression in the DRG in both the early and late phases of neuropathic pain and in the spinal cord in the early phase. In the late chronic phase, however, changes in gene expression in the spinal cord are largely controlled at the translational level.</p>

<title>Suppression of spinal translation alleviates established pain hypersensitivity</title>
<p>The important role of spinal translation in regulating changes in gene expression in the chronic phase of neuropathic pain prompted us to test whether targeting translation in the spinal cord can alleviate established pain hypersensitivity. Translation initiation and the activity of cap-binding protein eIF4E, which facilitates the recruitment of ribosomes to the mRNA, are rate-limiting steps in protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. eIF4E is a key translation initiation factor regulating pain-related plasticity as it integrates information from two signaling pathways that are activated in neuropathic pain to stimulate mRNA translation and promote pain hypersensitivity: the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as ERK and p38<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Moreover, previous studies have revealed that a partial reduction in eIF4E expression (e.g. in <italic>Eif4e</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice and in mice treated with eIF4E shRNA) is both well-tolerated and alleviates adverse phenotypes in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> mouse models. To study the role of mRNA translation in chronic pain hypersensitivity, we used an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) against mouse <italic>Eif4e</italic> to modulate eIF4E expression. To target eIF4E in the central nervous system but not the DRG, we injected eIF4E-ASO via the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v., 100 mg/kg) route<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, resulting in a ∼38% reduction in eIF4E protein expression in the lumbar spinal cord 2 weeks post-injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), without changing eIF4E levels in the DRG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We first assessed the effect of eIF4E downregulation on established pain hypersensitivity. Injection of eIF4E-ASO at week 6 post-SNI alleviated mechanical pain hypersensitivity in the von Frey test two weeks later (at week 8 post-SNI; the experimental time course is provided in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, von Frey data in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Reduced hypersensitivity persisted for 4 additional weeks (up to week 12 post-SNI), demonstrating a long-lasting effect following a single eIF4E-ASO administration. eIF4E-ASO also attenuated spontaneous pain, as assessed using the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) on week 8 post-SNI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>

<p>We then studied the effect of downregulating eIF4E during the early development phase of neuropathic pain by administering eIF4E-ASO and control-ASO ten days before the peripheral nerve injury. Surprisingly, we found no alleviation of mechanical hypersensitivity at day 4 post-SNI in eIF4E-ASO-injected mice (the experimental time course is provided in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, von Frey data in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). However, testing at later time-points showed that mice injected with eIF4E-ASO exhibited reduced mechanical pain hypersensitivity at week 2 after the nerve injury (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>) and the effect became more pronounced at weeks 4 and 8. The MGS was also reduced in eIF4E-ASO-injected mice at week 4 and 8 post-SNI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). These results indicate that downregulation of eIF4E in the spinal cord using ASO alleviates pain hypersensitivity in the late but not the acute stages of neuropathic pain.</p>

However, this approach does not allow the measurement of gene expression in distinct neuronal subtypes and cannot distinguish between neuronal and non-neuronal cells.

<p>Next, we employed the TRAP approach to identify specific mRNAs that are actively translated in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In TRAP, the eGFP-tagged ribosomal protein, L10a, is expressed in a genetically defined cellular population (via a specific gene promoter), followed by immunoprecipitation of tagged ribosomes with an anti-eGFP antibody and the sequencing of ribosome-bound mRNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We performed TRAP analysis on two major sub-populations of neurons: a subset of excitatory neurons, defined by Tac1 (using <italic>L10a-</italic>eGFP<italic>; Tac1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice); and inhibitory neurons, defined by GAD2 (using <italic>L10a</italic>-eGFP<italic>; Gad2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice). Tac1 is expressed in a subset of excitatory interneurons and projection neurons in the spinal cord that play important roles in processing nociceptive information, as well as driving spinal plasticity and chronic pain-related behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.

<title>eIF4E-dependent translation in inhibitory neurons promotes pain hypersensitivity</title>
<p>The pronounced upregulation of mRNA translation in inhibitory neurons after peripheral nerve injury prompted us to study its functional role in mediating pain hypersensitivity. mTORC1, a master regulator of mRNA translation, stimulates protein synthesis via phosphorylation of the translational repressor eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), triggering their dissociation from eIF4E to allow translation initiation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Accordingly, ablation of 4E-BPs, which mimics the activation of the mTORC1-eIF4E axis, stimulates translation. There are three isoforms of 4E-BP (4E-BP1, 4E-BP2, and 4E-BP3), which exhibit similar functions but have different tissue distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. 4E-BP1 is the main isoform in the pain pathway, as 4E-BP1, but not 4E-BP2 whole-body knockout mice show mechanical pain hypersensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, while 4E-BP3 expression is very low in the nervous system. To increase translation selectively in inhibitory or excitatory neurons, we generated mice lacking 4E-BP1 in each cell type (confirmation of 4E-BP1 ablation is shown in <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A-D</xref>). Deletion of 4E-BP1 in all inhibitory neurons (<italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>; Gad2</italic><sup>Cre</sup>) induced mechanical hypersensitivity without affecting heat sensitivity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). A subpopulation of inhibitory neurons, PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons, specifically gate mechanical allodynia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Peripheral nerve injury induces substantial plasticity in PV neurons, resulting in a decrease in their intrinsic excitability and spiking activity, and the consequent disinhibition of postsynaptic PKCɣ interneurons and engagement of myelinated primary afferents in spinal nociceptive circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Ablation of 4E-BP1 in PV neurons (<italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>;Pv</italic><sup>Cre</sup>) induced robust mechanical hypersensitivity, similar to <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>;Gad2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>; no change was found in heat sensitivity). Recording from lumbar spinal cord slices showed that PV neurons lacking 4E-BP1 exhibit reduced excitability, as evident by a decreased firing rate in response to a depolarization pulse (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>) and elevated rheobase compared to PV neurons from control mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>).

To study the role of translation in peripheral nerve injury-induced plasticity in spinal PV neurons, we selectively downregulated eIF4E in PV neurons in the lumbar spinal cord before SNI. To this end, an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-expressing shRNAmir against eIF4E (AAV9-CAG-DIO-eGFP-eIF4E-shRNAmir) was injected into the lumbar dorsal horn parenchyma of <italic>Pv</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice 14 days before the SNI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref> shows experimental design, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref> shows confirmation of reduced eIF4E levels). Recordings from PV neurons in spinal cord slices revealed that downregulation of eIF4E in PV neurons prevented the SNI-induced decrease in intrinsic excitability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). Whereas PV neurons from control mice (<italic>Pv</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice injected with AAV9-CAG-DIO-eGFP-eIF4E-scrambled) exhibited reduced spiking activity and increased rheobase 4 weeks post-SNI compared to sham animals, PV neurons with reduced eIF4E showed no change in their excitability after nerve injury (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>: firing frequency; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref>: rheobase).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies in animal models of neuropathic pain have largely focused on changes in the transcriptome and were mostly limited to early time points after peripheral nerve injury. The growing realization of the important role of translational control in neuronal plasticity and pain sensitization, as well as the uncovering of distinct mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance phases of neuropathic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, prompted us to study gene expression at both transcriptional and translational levels during early and late time points after peripheral nerve injury. Unexpectedly, we discovered that gene expression during the maintenance phase in the spinal cord is substantially regulated at the level of mRNA translation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the downregulation of a key translation initiation factor, eIF4E, in the spinal cord leads to a long-lasting alleviation of established pain hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>In the late phase of neuropathic pain, we found both transcriptional and translational changes in gene expression in DRG but markedly greater translational changes in the spinal cord than transcriptional changes. Alterations in the DRG transcriptome are consistent with previous analyses in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and human DRG tissue from individuals with neuropathic pain, which revealed substantial transcriptional changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> accompanied by neuronal hyperexcitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Gene expression datasets from human neuropathic spinal cord tissue are not yet available due to paucity of spinal cord samples from individuals with neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>Altered translation at late time points after nerve injury might be linked to maladaptive spinal plasticity. eIF4E downregulation in the spinal cord alleviated pain hypersensitivity at the late, but not early, time point. Since translation is the predominant gene expression mechanism in the spinal cord at the late stage, it is conceivable that downregulation of eIF4E normalizes the translational landscape, thus correcting maladaptive plasticity underlying spinal hyperexcitability. In the early stage after nerve injury, modifications of existing proteins (e.g. via phosphorylation) and transcriptional changes play significant roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, rendering suppression of translation less efficient.</p>
<p>In the maintenance phase of neuropathic pain, we observed greater translational changes, using FUNCAT and TRAP, in spinal inhibitory neurons compared to excitatory neurons. Moreover, enhancing 4E-BP1-dependent translation in GAD2<sup>+</sup> inhibitory and PV<sup>+</sup> neurons, but not excitatory neurons, induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Increasing translation was also sufficient to decrease the excitability and spiking of spinal PV interneurons, whereas suppression of translation in PV neurons prevented SNI-induced reduction in their excitability. Spinal disinhibition, induced by peripheral nerve injury, plays a key role in central sensitization. Numerous neuronal and non-neuronal mechanisms contribute to this disinhibition, including: K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>−</sup> cotransporter (KCC2) downregulation causing elevation of intracellular chloride and the resulting weakening of inhibitory neurotransmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, preferential removal of inhibitory synapses by microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, and the modulation of the extracellular matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. In addition, peripheral nerve injury induces substantial plasticity in spinal PV neurons, leading to the reduction in their synaptic output as well as intrinsic excitability, thereby resulting in the engagement of myelinated low-threshold mechanoreceptive (LTMR) afferents in spinal nociceptive lamina I circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The reduced synaptic output of PV neurons post-SNI is mediated by the retinoic acid receptor RARɑ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Our data demonstrate that the reduction in PV neuron intrinsic excitability and spiking activity are mediated, at least partially, by translational activation. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying this form of plasticity, downstream of translation, remain unknown; however, the identification of translationally altered genes in TRAP analysis might facilitate their discovery.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that pharmacological targeting of mTORC1 can alleviate hypersensitivity in animal models of inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> and inhibition of mTORC1 shortly before or after nerve injury transiently alleviates pain hypersensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. These effects could be mediated through the downregulation of translation in DRG neurons, or alternatively, via inhibiting translation-independent functions of mTORC1 such as lipid biogenesis, regulation of mitochondrial functions, and autophagy, which are all implicated in neuropathic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Targeting eIF4E in the spinal cord via eIF4E-ASO does not affect DRG neurons and specifically inhibits the translational control mechanism, without affecting other functions of mTORC1.</p>
<p>In summary, our study provides a characterization of the translational landscape at early and late time points of neuropathic pain and in a subset of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We identified the substantial role of spinal translation during the late stage of neuropathic pain, particularly in inhibitory neurons, and revealed that ASO-mediated downregulation of spinal translation provided a long-lasting alleviation of established pain hypersensitivity. These findings enhance our understanding of the cell-type- and phase-specific mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain, raising the possibility for the development of targeted therapeutics.</p>

<title>Spared Nerve Injury (SNI)</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized under 4% isoflurane for induction and 2% for maintenance. The mice were placed on a heated (36-37°C) surgical bed during the surgical procedure. The sciatic nerve was exposed by making an incision in the upper thigh and cutting through the femoris muscle. The tibial and common peroneal branches were ligated with 7.0 silk (Covidien, S-1768K) and a 2–4-mm section of the nerve below the ligation was removed using micro self-opening scissors and forceps, leaving the sural nerve fully intact. The muscle and skin were sutured using 6.0 Vicryl (Ethicon, J489G). All sham surgeries featured incisions to the thigh and cutting of the femoris muscle, however, the sciatic nerve was left untouched and intact.

Strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) was used to reveal genes with systematically altered expression percentile ranks between SHAM and SNI mice of the same cell-type and timepoint. SSMD is the difference of means controlled by the variance of the sample measurements. SSMD measured the effect size to control for within-group variability. Differentially expressed genes were determined between Sham and SNI of the same cell-type and timepoint by calculating the Bhattacharyya distance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. This measure is used to calculate the amount of overlap in the area under the curve of the two sample distributions (corresponding to each group). BD compares distribution of gene relative to abundance (in TPMs). The Bhattacharyya coefficient BC(Q)i ranges between 0 (for totally non-overlapping distributions) and 1 (for completely identical distributions) and is derived from the Bhattacharyya distance. In our analysis, we used a modified form of the Bhattacharyya coefficient that ranges between 0 (for completely identical distributions) and +1 or -1 (for totally non-overlapping distributions, sign defined by the log-fold change value). DE genes were identified if the absolute value of SSMD was higher or equal to 0.97, the absolute value of BC was higher or equal to 0.5 and fold change higher or equal to 1.33.

<title>Tissue homogenization</title>
<p>Tissue homogenization, RNA and footprint extraction, and library preparation were carried out according to the protocol described by Ingolia et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> with minor modifications as outlined in Uttam et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Briefly, frozen tissue (DRGs or spinal cord, pooled from 15 animals per replicate) was homogenized in 800 µl lysis buffer using pre-chilled 2-ml glass Dounce Homogenizers, performing 30 strokes each with pestle A followed by pestle B. The tissue lysate was collected in a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 16,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C. The total crude RNA content in the supernatant was determined using a NanoDrop1000. A fraction of tissue lysate containing 100 µg total crude RNA was reserved for mRNA-Seq and the remaining was used for ribosome footprinting.</p>

<title>Nuclease footprinting</title>
<p>It was ensured that one complete set of replicates had the same amount of crude total RNA to start with. The RNase I treatment was carried out as described by Ingolia et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> for 45 min at 4 °C using 5 µl of RNase I (Ambion, AM2295) per 250 µg of crude total RNA and quenched by adding 20 µl of SUPERase-In (Ambion, AM2694) per 5µl of RNase I used.</p>

<title>Recovery of ribosome-associated footprints</title>
<p>Ribosome-associated footprints were pelleted by ultra-centrifuging the RNAse I digestion mix (final volume 540 µL) layered on top of a 660 µL sucrose cushion at 71,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman Coulter TLA-120 rotor. The ribosomal pellet was resuspended in 600 µl of 10 mM Tris pH 7 (prepared from 1 M Tris pH 7, Ambion) and stored at –80 °C until all samples for each tissue type were processed until this step.</p>
<p>RNA was purified from the resuspended ribosomal pellet using the Hot-Phenol RNA Extraction method and precipitated with isopropanol. For the Hot-Phenol RNA extraction, the resuspended ribosomal pellet was brought to a final volume of 700 µl with 10 mM Tris pH 7 and supplemented with 40 µl of 20% SDS followed by heated incubation at 65 °C for 1 min at 1400 rpm in a thermomixer. The heated sample-SDS mix was equally split into two microcentrifuge tubes, containing hot acidic phenol (heated to 65 °C) and incubated at 65 °C, 1400 rpm for 5 min in the thermomixer. Subsequently, the tubes were chilled on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged at 2000 x <italic>g</italic> for 3 min at 4 °C to obtain a top aqueous phase, which was promptly collected in a fresh tube. Seven hundred µl of acidic phenol was added to the aqueous phase and incubated at 25 °C, 14000 rpm in a thermomixer followed by centrifugation to again obtain the top aqueous phase. The top aqueous phase was promptly collected in a fresh tube, to which 600 µl of chloroform was added and mixed by vortexing for 1 min at room temperature. The tubes were then centrifuged to recover the top aqueous phase which was transferred in a fresh tube. The volume of the aqueous phase was estimated using a pipette and 1/9<sup>th</sup> volume of 3M sodium acetate pH 5.5 (to a final concentration of at least 0.3 M sodium acetate) and 2 µl of 15 mg/ml Glycoblue were added. The tube was vortexed briefly and 1 volume of pre-chilled isopropanol was added followed by overnight storage at -80 °C overnight to aid precipitation. The next morning, the tubes were centrifuged at 20,000 x <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 30 min to pellet the precipitated RNA. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed with 750 µl of ice-cold 80% ethanol, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 x <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was air dried for up to 5 min before resuspending in 21 µl of 10 mM Tris, pH 7. One µl of the purified RNA was used to assess the RNA concentration on NanoDrop1000.</p>

<title>Purification of footprint fragments and dephosphorylation</title>
<p>Purification of footprint fragments from the ribosome-associated footprint complex and subsequent dephosphorylation was carried out as described in steps 18 to 29 of ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In step 25, we selected Rapid Gel Extraction method to extract RNA from polyacrylamide gels. The resultant RNA pellet (dephosphorylated footprints) was resuspended in 9 µl of 10 mM Tris pH7. One µl of the RNA was used to assess the size and concentration of the footprints obtained on the Agilent Bioanalyzer using a Small RNA Bioanalyzer Kit and manufacturer’s protocol. <italic>rRNA depletion.</italic> Half of the obtained dephosphorylated footprint RNA was processed further for rRNA depletion using Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) (Illumina, MRZG12324). For each reaction, 90 µl of magnetic beads were transferred to a RNase-free tube and washed two times (1 min each) with an equal volume of RNase-Free water (Ambion, 4387936) using a magnetic stand and resuspended in 35 µl of resuspension solution. To 4 µl of dephosphorylated RNA samples, 12 µl of RNase-free water, 2 µl of Ribo-Zero Reaction Buffer, and 2 µl of Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Solution was added, mixed by pipetting and incubated at 68 °C for 10 min, followed by a 5-min incubation at room temperature. The treated RNA samples were then transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 35 µl of washed magnetic beads and immediately mixed by pipetting at least 10 times followed by vortexing the tube for 10 s at medium setting. The treated RNA sample and beads mix were incubated at room temperature for 5 min, after which the tubes were vortexed for 10 s at medium speed and incubated at 50 °C for 5 min. Following this incubation, the tubes were immediately placed on a magnetic stand for at least 1 min and the supernatant was collected in a fresh 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The rRNA depleted samples were purified by adding 100 µl of RNase-free water, 18 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (Ambion), and 2 µl of 10 mg/ml glycogen, vortexed briefly followed by an addition of 600 µl of ice-cold isopropanol and incubated at -80 °C overnight. On the following day, the precipitated RNA was pelleted and purified as described above, and the rRNA-depleted dephosphorylated footprint sample was dissolved in 10 µl of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.</p>

<p>This study explores the role of protein synthesis in spinal cord neurons in the regulation of chronic pain. Using innovative techniques, this <bold>valuable</bold> study outlines cell-type specific gene changes that occur in the spinal cord in the early and late phases of nerve injury. The presented evidence and methods used are, however, <bold>incomplete</bold>: there are several major technical and analysis issues that need to be addressed, and in addition, deeper gene expression analysis and additional controls would have strengthened the conclusions. This work will be of broad interest to biologists studying pathological plasticity in circuits.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigated the role of transcriptional and translational controls of gene expression in dorsal root ganglia and lumbar spinal cord in neuropathic pain in mice. Using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP), they show changes in transcriptomic and translational gene expression at the peripheral and central levels rapidly after nerve injury. While translational changes in gene expression remained elevated for more than two months in both DRGs and the spinal cord, transcriptomic regulation was absent in the spinal cord long after the onset of neuropathy. Disrupting mRNA translation in dorsal horn neurons using antisense oligonucleotides reduced mechanical withdrawal threshold and facial expression of pain. Using fluorescent noncanonical amino acid tagging (FUNCAT), the authors further show that de novo protein expression primarily occurs in inhibitory neurons in the superficial dorsal horn after nerve injury. Accordingly, a selective increase in translational control of gene expression in spinal inhibitory neurons, or a subset of mainly inhibitory neurons expressing parvalbumin (PV), using transgenic mice, led to a decrease in the excitability of PV neurons and mechanical allodynia. In contrast, decreasing the translational control of spinal PV neurons prevented the alteration of the electrophysiological properties of the PV cells induced by nerve injury.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a well-written article that uncovers a previously unappreciated role of gene expression control in PV neurons, which seems to play an important part in the loss of inhibitory control of spinal circuits typically seen after peripheral nerve injury. The conclusions are generally well supported by the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study would benefit from further clarifications in the methods section and a deeper analysis of gene expression changes in mRNA expression and ribosomal footprint observed after nerve injury.</p>
<p>Antisense oligonucleotides used to reduce translation by disrupting eIF4E expression were administered i.c.v. It is unknown if the authors controlled for locomotor deficits, which might add confounds in the interpretation of behavioral results. A more local route should have been preferable to avoid targeting brain regions, which could potentially affect behavior.</p>
<p>Only female mice were used for Ribo-Seq, TRAP, FUNCAT, and electrophysiology, but both sexes were used for behavior experiments.</p>
<p>The conditional KO of 4E-BP1 using transgenic animals should be total in the targeted cells. However, only a partial reduction is reported in Figure S2 in GAD2, PV, Vglut2, or Tac1 cells. Again, proper methods for quantification of fluorescence in these experiments are lacking.</p>
<p>The elegant knockdown of eIF4E using AAV-mediated shRNAmir shows a recovery of the electrophysiological intrinsic properties of PV neurons after injury. It is unclear if such manipulation would be sufficient to reverse mechanical allodynia in vivo.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>I reviewed the manuscript titled &quot;Translational Control in the Spinal Cord Regulates Gene Expression and Pain Hypersensitivity in the Chronic Phase of Neuropathic Pain.&quot; This manuscript compares transcription and translation in the spinal cord during the acute and chronic phases of neuropathic pain induced by surgical nerve injury. The authors chose to focus their investigation on translation in the chronic phase due to its greater impact on gene expression in the spinal cord compared to transcription.</p>
<p>(1) The study is significant because the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic pain remain elusive. The role of translational regulation in the spinal cord has not been investigated in neuroplasticity and chronic pain mouse models. The manuscript is innovative and technically robust. The authors employed several cutting-edge techniques such as Rio-seq, TRAP-seq, slice electrophysiology, and viral approaches. Despite the technical complexity, the manuscript is well-written. The authors demonstrated that inhibition of eIF4E alleviates pain hypersensitivity, that de novo protein synthesis is more pronounced in inhibitory interneurons, and that manipulating mTOR-eIF4E pathways alters mechanical sensitivity and neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>(2) Strengths: innovation (conceptual and technical levels), data support the conclusions.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>Confusion about the sex of the animals. It is unclear whether eIF4E ASO affects translation and which cells. It is not determined that modulating translation in PV+ neurons impacts neuropathic pain behaviors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study provides evidence for translational changes in inhibitory spinal dorsal horn neurons following chronic nerve injury. Gene expression changes have been widely studied in the context of pain induction and provided key insights into the adaptation of the nervous system in the early phases of chronic pain. Whereas this is interesting biologically, most patients will arrive in the clinic beyond the acute phase of their injury, thus limiting the translational relevance of these studies. Recent studies have extended this work to highlight the difference between acute and chronic pain states, potentially explaining the cascading factors leading to chronic pain, and hopefully how to prevent this in vulnerable populations. The present study suggests that translational changes within spinal inhibitory populations could underlie long-term chronic pain, leading to decreased inhibition and heightened pain thresholds.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The approaches used and the broad outcomes of the manuscript are interesting and could be an exciting development in the field. The authors are using approaches more common in molecular biology and extending these into neuroscientific research, getting into the detail of how pathology could impact gene expression differentially across the course of an injury. This could open up new areas of research to selectively target not only defined populations but additionally help alleviate pain symptoms once an injury has already reached the maintenance phase. There is an opportunity to delve into what must be a very large data set and learn more about what genes are differentially translated and how this could affect circuit function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Whereas the authors approach a key question in pain chronicity, the manuscript falls a little short of providing any conclusive data.</p>
<p>The manuscript was in some areas very difficult to follow. Terminology was not always consistent or clear, and the flow of the manuscript could use some attention to highlight key areas. Whereas the overall message is clear in the summary, this would not necessarily be the case when reading the manuscript alone.</p>
<p>The study claims to show that translational control mechanisms in the spinal cord play a role in mediating neuropathic pain hypersensitivity, but the studies presented do not fully support this statement. The authors instead provide some correlation between translation and behavioural reflex excitability (namely vfh and Hargreaves).</p>
<p>It is difficult to fully interpret the work, as there are a number of inconsistencies, namely the range of timings pre- and post-injury, lack of controls for manipulations, the use of shmiRNA versus lineage deletions, and lack of detailed somatosensory testing. It is not completely clear how this work could be translatable as is, without a deeper understanding of how translational control affects circuit function and whether all of this is necessarily bad for the system, or whether this is a positive homeostatic adaptation to the hyperexcitability of the circuit following injury.</p>
<p>A large portion of the work is focussed on showing an inhibitory-selective change in translation following chronic nerve injury. The evidence for this is however lacking. Statistics to show that translational effects are restricted to inhibitory subpopulations are inadequate. The author's choice of transgenic lines is not clear and seems to rely on availability rather than hypothesis.</p>
