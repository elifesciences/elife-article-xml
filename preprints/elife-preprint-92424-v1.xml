<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The vertebrate kidneys play two evolutionary conserved roles in waste excretion and osmoregulation. Besides, the kidney of fish is considered as a functional ortholog of mammalian bone marrow that serves as a hematopoietic hub for generating blood cell lineages and immunological responses. However, knowledge about the properties of kidney hematopoietic cells, and the functionality of kidney in fish immune systems remain to be elucidated. To this end, our present study generated a comprehensive atlas with 59 hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) and immune-cell types from zebrafish kidney via single-cell transcriptome profiling analysis. These populations included almost all known cells associated with innate and adaptive immunity, and displayed differential responses to viral infection, indicating their diverse functional roles in antiviral immunity. Remarkably, HSPCs were found to have extensive reactivities to viral infection, and the trained immunity can be effectively induced in certain HSPCs. In addition, the antigen-stimulated adaptive immunity can be fully generated in kidney, suggesting kidney acting as a secondary lymphoid organ. These results indicated that fish kidney is a dual-functional entity with functionalities of both primary and secondary lymphoid organs. Our findings illustrated the unique features of fish immune system, and highlighted the multifaced biology of kidney in ancient vertebrates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Teleost fish are a group of indispensable model organisms for comprehending the evolutionary history and general principles underlying the design of the vertebrate immune system, since they stand as the earliest living jawed vertebrates known as an important link in vertebrate evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Over the recent decades, the field of fish immunology has made significant strides, notably hastening the identification and characterization of functional genes and signaling pathways intricately associated with both piscine innate and adaptive immunities. These advances stem from the progress in genome projects encompassing diverse fish species, and have markedly enriched our comprehension of the molecular underpinnings of fish immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Some breakthroughs have not only challenged established paradigms about the immune system but have also unveiled novel dimensions of mammalian immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Thus far, it was generally accepted that teleost fish possess the fundamental components of both innate and adaptive immune systems, akin to those seen in humans and other mammalian counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. However, our grasp of the precise architectural layout, cellular coordination, and functional attributes of the fish immune system, particularly the adaptive facet, remains incomplete<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Evolutionarily speaking, bony fish represent the earliest living organisms endowed with a rudimentary adaptive immune system encompassing basic molecular and cellular constituents. These encompass immunoglobulins (Igs), antigen-specific receptors (TCR/BCR) driven by the recombination-activating genes, major histocompatibility complex class I and II (MHC-I/II) molecules, as well as T and B lymphocytes. These cellular elements populate the primary and secondary lymphoid organs of fish, such as the thymus and spleen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Notwithstanding, the fish adaptive immune system is characterized by its own set of specializations and distinctive attributes. Notably absent in fishes are the bone marrow, histologically discernible lymph nodes, Peyer’s patches, and germinal centers—entities that define primary and secondary lymphoid organs in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Additionally, fishes lack antibody class-switch recombination activity, albeit retaining the ability to express activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. These revelations underscore the substantial diversity inherent in immune systems across distinct vertebrate taxonomic groups. Consequently, teleost fish emerge as invaluable primitive animal models, illuminating previously uncharted events during the emergence and phylogenetic progression of adaptive immune systems. Such endeavors stand to elucidate the distinct principles governing the immunology of ancient vertebrates, thereby furnishing scientific substantiation for a broader comprehension of the evolutionary trajectory of vertebrate immune systems.</p>
<p>In light of these considerations, we have recently generated a comprehensive atlas of immune cell types within the spleen of zebrafish, employing a single-cell transcriptome profiling approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Our work has entailed the classification of splenic leukocytes into 11 principal categories and the identification of over 50 subset populations within these categories. Moreover, we have delineated the differential responses of various subset cells—both innate and adaptive—to infection by the spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV). Particularly noteworthy was our discovery of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) existed within the spleen. This observation intimates that the fish spleen may well function as a hematopoietic site, transcending its established role as a secondary lymphoid organ. These insights offer fresh perspectives into the intricacies and distinctive attributes of the fish immune system, setting it apart from its mammalian counterparts. Seeking to attain a deeper understanding of the fish immune system, our present study has undertaken a further exploration of immune cell types and their functional characteristics within the kidney of zebrafish. This investigation places special emphasis on the hematopoietic activity of kidney HSPCs and the adaptive immune responses of kidney immune cells towards viral infections. As a result, our classification efforts have yielded 13 categories of cells from kidney leukocyte preparations, unearthing 59 potential subset cells spanning HSPCs and immune cell-associated categories. The observed subset populations manifest disparate reactions to SVCV infection. Most notably, some HSPC subsets exhibit a robust proliferative response to viral infection, capable of inducing trained immunity. Furthermore, we have successfully identified a comprehensive array of cells—encompassing diverse antigen-presenting cells (APCs) as well as effector T and B cells—integral for the full activation of adaptive immunity within the kidney. These adaptive immune-associated cells display marked responsiveness to SVCV infection and antigenic stimulation. Evidently, the complete process of adaptive immunity unfolds within the kidney, as evidenced by the substantial expansion, activation, and somatic hypermutation (SHM) of antigen-specific T and B cells upon exposure to cognate antigens. These results strongly affirmed the kidney’s dual role as a lymphoid organ, boasting both hematopoietic functionality and adaptive immune reactivity in adult fish. Consequently, our findings cast the fish kidney in the role of a secondary lymphoid organ, supplementing its recognized status as a primary lymphoid organ. This advancement significantly improved our current comprehension of fish hematopoietic and immune systems, thus advancing our insights into the multifaceted biology of the kidney in ancient vertebrates.</p>

<title>Categories of immune-associated cells in kidney</title>
<p>In order to profile distinct immune-cell categories within the kidneys, leukocytes were extracted from zebrafish kidney tissues. The experimental groups consisted of fish treated with PBS (control), fish infected with SVCV (infected), and fish that underwent both vaccination with inactivated SVCV and subsequent SVCV infection (vaccinated+infected). Each sample comprised leukocytes from 60 fish and was subjected to scRNA-seq using the 10× Chromium platform. Following sequencing, the control group exhibited mean reads/median genes per cell of 34,501/1,090, the infected group showed 29,706/1,383, while the vaccinated+infected group displayed 37,611/1,379. The total number of detected genes in leukocyte samples from the control, infected, and vaccinated+infected groups were 26,345, 26,865, and 25,342, respectively. Employing an unsupervised cluster detection algorithm (SEURAT), we identified 13 distinct clusters of cells exhibiting similar gene expression profiles (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Moreover, specific genes were pinpointed within each cluster. Notably, clear demarcation boundaries were evident for each cluster in the heatmap, while dot plot and violin plot analyses indicated that a PCA-based cell separation approach was indeed favorable for our investigation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref></bold>).</p>

Cluster 9, on the other hand, displayed elevated expression of <italic>hmgn2</italic>, <italic>hmgb2a</italic>, and <italic>top2a</italic>. The functional implications of these genes in neutrophils necessitate further exploration (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C and D</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary file 1</bold>). Cluster 1 was identified as a macrophage/myeloid population due to the expression of lineage-specific genes including <italic>mpeg1.1</italic>, <italic>ctss2.2</italic>, <italic>mpeg1.2</italic>, <italic>grn1</italic>, <italic>marco</italic> and <italic>grna</italic>.

<title>Characterization of kidney HSPCs</title>
<p>To achieve a more comprehensive understanding of kidney hematopoietic cell populations, subclustering was conducted exclusively on the three HSPC clusters depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. This analysis unveiled 11 enrichments (designated as H0–H10) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). To validate our outcomes, we aligned the subset-specific genes of each cluster and the ensuing heatmap indicated a distinct categorization for each cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Within this context, H0 manifested as a Nanos1<sup>+</sup>Spi2<sup>+</sup> phenotypic cluster expressing signature genes <italic>nanos1</italic> and <italic>spi2</italic>, alongside specific expressions of <italic>sla2</italic>, <italic>csf1rb</italic>, <italic>rn7sk</italic>, <italic>sik1</italic> and <italic>irf1b</italic>, forming a collection of potential new marker genes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref></bold>). Meanwhile, H1 was identified as a group of cycling HSPCs, characterized by the expression of the marker gene <italic>mki67</italic>.

The functional characteristics and developmental potential of these three clusters require further elucidation. H5 was categorized as a group of NK progenitors, exhibiting high expression of <italic>gata3</italic>, <italic>nkl.3</italic>, <italic>nkl.4</italic>, <italic>ccl34b.4</italic>, <italic>CR388164.2</italic>, <italic>ccl33.3</italic>, <italic>dusp2</italic>, <italic>BX005105.1, icn</italic>, <italic>bhlhe40</italic>, and <italic>coro1a</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary file 2</bold>). Cells within H6 represented myeloid progenitors, showing extensive expression of <italic>mmp13a.1</italic>, <italic>si:ch1073-429i10.1</italic>, <italic>il1b</italic>, <italic>cpa5</italic>, <italic>mpx</italic>, <italic>timp2b</italic>, <italic>BX908782.2</italic>, <italic>npsn</italic>, <italic>lect2l</italic> and <italic>lyz</italic> marker genes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref></bold>). H7 and H8 were identified as erythrocyte and lymphoid progenitor populations, denoted by their expression of <italic>hbba1.1</italic>, <italic>hbaa1</italic>, <italic>hbba1</italic>, <italic>si:ch211-5k11.8</italic>, <italic>hbba2</italic>, <italic>hbaa2</italic>, <italic>si:ch211-103n10.5</italic>, <italic>cahz</italic>, <italic>hemgn</italic> in H7, and <italic>pbx1a</italic>, <italic>pdpk1a</italic>, <italic>rag1</italic>, <italic>rag2</italic>, <italic>cxcr4b</italic>, <italic>h2afx</italic>, <italic>ccr9a</italic>, <italic>sid1</italic>, <italic>zgc:77784</italic>, <italic>nme3</italic>, <italic>kdm6bb</italic> in H8, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref></bold>). H9 and H10 clusters were discerned as endothelial and thrombocyte progenitors due to their expression of marker genes such as <italic>cdh5</italic>, <italic>kdrl</italic>, <italic>pecam1</italic>, <italic>igfbp5b</italic>, <italic>rbp4</italic>, <italic>cxcl18b</italic>, <italic>cxcl12a</italic>, <italic>selenop</italic>, <italic>jun</italic>, <italic>fosl1a</italic>, <italic>jdp2b</italic>, <italic>fosab</italic>, <italic>si:ch73-335l21.4</italic> in H9, and <italic>itga2b</italic>, <italic>fn1b</italic>, <italic>thbs1</italic>, <italic>sele</italic>, <italic>aldob</italic>, <italic>apln</italic>, <italic>tpm4a</italic>, <italic>hbegfb</italic>, <italic>cald1a</italic>, <italic>fgl2a</italic>, <italic>pim2</italic>, <italic>atp2b1a</italic> in H10 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref></bold>). The endothelial progenitors were also found in the bone marrow of mouse, and they are developmentally associated with a subset of CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells, and can differentiate ex vivo to an endothelial phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Subsequently, pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed that a significant portion of HSPCs were positioned within a primary trajectory characterized by five bifurcations and five stages (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref></bold>). The endothelial (H9) and thrombocyte (H10) progenitors were situated towards the trajectory’s origin. This arrangement partially validated the constructed trajectory (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). H4 cells were positioned towards the trajectory’s terminus (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). H2 cells, along with erythrocyte (H7) and lymphoid (H8) progenitors, were positioned towards the trajectory’s midpoint. H0 and H3 populations, along with NK (H5) and myeloid (H6) progenitors, were located towards both the origin and midpoint of the trajectory. Furthermore, an analysis of the pseudotime dynamics of significantly changed genes in the 11 HSPC clusters revealed three modules delineated by their pseudotemporal expression patterns (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D and E</xref></bold>). In addition, RNA velocity analysis showed the differentiation potential of H0, H1, H2, H3 and H4 subclusters into myeloid, thrombocyte/erythrocyte and lymphoid progenitors (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>). These findings collectively suggested that H0-H4 clusters potentially represent a group of stem and early progenitors that lead to late progenitors responsible for differentiation into erythroid, myeloid, and lymphocyte lineages. Notably, we recently detected the presence of HSPCs in zebrafish spleen tissues, indicating the spleen’s role as a hematopoietic organ in fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. To compare HSPC characteristics between the kidney and spleen, we integrated scRNA-seq data from both organs and subjected the merged dataset to cell classification. This assessment demonstrated that the newly generated atlas shared overall consistency with the kidney and spleen, merging proportional HSPCs and immune cells from the two organs to varying extents (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). These observations underscored the presence of substantial overlapping HSPCs and immune cell types in both the kidney and spleen. Furthermore, pseudotime trajectory analysis highlighted similar cell differentiation trajectories shared between the kidney and spleen (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-E</xref></bold>). Pseudotime dynamics of significantly altered genes across all categories were analyzed and organized into three modules based on their pseudotemporal expression patterns (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F and G</xref></bold>). In aggregate, our findings reveal overall similarities in HSCPs’ composition and differentiation potentials between the kidney and spleen, suggesting analogous functionalities in hematopoiesis and immunity across both organs. Nevertheless, the precise correlation between the fish kidney and spleen requires further clarification.</p>

<title>T and NK subsets in kidney</title>
<p>Subdividing the T/NK category in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> led us to observe 23 subset clusters (designated as T0–T22) enriched within the T/NK population through iterative subclustering (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). To validate the classification results, we assessed the most variably expressed genes among cell clusters, and the heatmap demonstrated effective classification for each cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). Subsequently, we analyzed the DEGs within the 23 clusters. Notably, clusters T5, T17, and T18 were identified as NKT subsets due to their widespread expression of NKT lineage genes, including <italic>cd3ζ</italic>, <italic>trbc</italic>, <italic>cd8a/cd4-1</italic>, <italic>zbtb32</italic>, <italic>nkl.2</italic>, <italic>il2rb</italic> and <italic>cd94</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary file 3</bold>). These NKT subset clusters exhibited substantial heterogeneity, as evident from their distinct transcriptional profiles, including the high expression of <italic>vmp1</italic>, <italic>BX649554.1</italic>, <italic>nkl.2</italic>, <italic>stim1a</italic>, <italic>ccl36.1</italic>, <italic>CABZ01044746</italic> in T5; <italic>gata3</italic>, <italic>cpa5</italic>, <italic>tppp</italic>, <italic>si:dkey-78l4.7</italic>, <italic>si:dkey-78l4.4</italic>, <italic>cfbl</italic>, <italic>si:dkey-21e2.3.1</italic>, <italic>BX322787.1</italic>, <italic>si:dkey-9i23.4</italic>, <italic>si:dkey-78l4.6</italic> in T17; and <italic>ccl39.7</italic>, <italic>ccl39.6</italic>, <italic>nfil3−4</italic>, <italic>ccl35.2</italic> in T18 (<bold>Supplementary file 3</bold>). Cluster T0 represented the CD3<sup>low</sup>CD4<sup>low</sup>CD8<sup>low</sup> T subset due to its low expression of <italic>cd3ζ</italic>, <italic>cd4-1</italic>, and <italic>cd8a</italic>. This subset likely represents an early developmental population of double positive (DP) T cells.

T3 was classified as a Th1 subset based on its expression of Th1-specific genes, including <italic>cd4-1</italic>, <italic>ifng1</italic>, <italic>il2</italic>, <italic>cxcr3.1.1</italic>, <italic>tnfa</italic>, and <italic>tnfb</italic>. Additionally, T3 expressed the cytotoxic T cell-related <italic>gzmk</italic> gene, suggesting its potential for both helper and cytotoxic activities (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary file 3</bold>). T4 was designated as a CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>-nkl.4 subset due to its high expression of <italic>nkl.4</italic> and <italic>trbc</italic>, coupled with the absence of <italic>cd4</italic>/<italic>cd8</italic> expression and low <italic>cd3ζ</italic> expression. Continuing the narrative, clusters T6, T7, T10, T13, T19, T20, and T21 were categorized as NK subsets due to their expression of NK signature genes, including <italic>zbtb32</italic>, <italic>nkl.2</italic>, <italic>il2rb</italic>, and <italic>cd94</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary file 3</bold>). Among these, T19 exhibited no expression of <italic>cd11b</italic> or <italic>cd27</italic>, T7 expressed both <italic>cd11b</italic> and <italic>cd27</italic>, and T10, T13, T20, and T21 expressed <italic>cd11b</italic> but not <italic>cd27</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary file 3</bold>). These observations suggested that T19, T7, and T6/10/13/20/21 represented CD11b<sup>−</sup>CD27<sup>−</sup>, CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>, and CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>−</sup> subset NK cells, demonstrating high differentiation potential, cytokine secretion, and cytolytic functions as observed in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.

Additionally, T20 and T21 cells specifically expressed <italic>grn2</italic> and <italic>diabloa</italic>, respectively (<bold>Supplementary file 3</bold>). These findings underscored the heterogeneity and functional diversity of zebrafish NK subsets. Clusters T8, T9, and T15 were identified as a group of CD8<sup>+</sup> CTL subsets, expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> CTL-specific genes, including <italic>cd8a</italic>, <italic>cd8b</italic>, <italic>gzma</italic>, <italic>gzmk</italic>, <italic>ifng1</italic>, and <italic>tnfb</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary file 3</bold>). T11 was labeled as a γδ T subset due to its high expression of <italic>trgc</italic>, <italic>trdc</italic>, <italic>sox13</italic>, and <italic>cd3ζ</italic>, combined with low expression of <italic>cd4-1</italic> and <italic>cd8a</italic>.

<title>B cell subsets in kidney</title>
<p>Nine subclusters of B cells (designated as B0–B8) were classified through unsupervised clustering of all B cells, based on their expression of distinct B-subset signature genes (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A and B</xref></bold>). B0 and B3 were designated as immature/mature B cells (im/mat. B) due to their expression of <italic>zfpm1</italic> and <italic>gata1a</italic> genes (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A and B</xref></bold>). B1 was categorized as a canonical IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup> B subset, characterized by its high expression of <italic>ighm</italic> and <italic>ighd</italic> genes. B2 and B7 were identified as pro/pre B subsets, exhibiting significant expression of <italic>pclaf</italic>, <italic>pdia4</italic>, <italic>pdia6</italic>, <italic>rag1</italic>, and <italic>rag2</italic> genes. B4 likely represented a population of plasma cells that highly expressed <italic>ighm</italic> or <italic>ighz</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A and B</xref></bold>). B5 displayed expression of genes related to germinal-center B cells, including <italic>aicda</italic> (AID), <italic>mki67</italic>, <italic>top2a</italic>, <italic>stmn1a</italic>, <italic>bach2b</italic>, <italic>bcl6aa</italic>, <italic>bcl6ab</italic>, <italic>cd81a</italic>, <italic>cd9a</italic>, <italic>irf8</italic>, <italic>lmo2</italic>, <italic>pclaf</italic> and <italic>nfkb2</italic>, which exhibited a notable increase following virus infection (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-C</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary file 4</bold>). Cluster B6 comprised activated B cells and plasmablasts (act. B/PBs), actively expressing <italic>dscamb</italic>, <italic>cpa5</italic>, <italic>fcer1g</italic>, <italic>mmp13a.1</italic>, <italic>mpx</italic>, <italic>timp2b</italic>, <italic>npsn</italic>, <italic>il1b</italic> and <italic>lect2l</italic>. It’s worth noting that B6 also expressed <italic>il10</italic> and <italic>tgfb1a</italic>/<italic>b</italic>, suggesting the potential presence of a regulatory B cell type within this subcluster (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A and B</xref></bold>). B8 was recognized as a B1-like subset with heightened immune activities, including chemokine production, based on its expression of <italic>cd5</italic>, <italic>ccl33.3</italic>, <italic>ccl34b.4</italic>, <italic>nkl.4</italic>, <italic>tnfrsf18</italic>, <italic>nkl.2</italic>, <italic>sla2</italic> and <italic>hmgn3</italic> genes (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A and B</xref></bold>). Interestingly, a distinct subset of IgM<sup>+</sup>β<sup>+</sup> cells was identified within B8 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A and B</xref></bold>). This lineage, known as dual expresser (DE), simultaneously expressing TCR and BCR, has been reported in humans and is also present in the spleen of zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The top 10 subset-specific genes with the greatest significance for each B-cell subset are visualized in a heatmap (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6_1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>). An analysis of the top 10 significantly enriched GO terms within the biological process (BP) for each B-cell subset was conducted. The results revealed varying metabolic processes enriched in each subset. For example, protein export emerged as a major BP category and the most notable KEGG pathway in plasma cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6_2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref></bold>). This outcome aligns with the understanding that plasma cells are actively engaged in antibody synthesis and secretion, underscoring the importance of protein synthetic metabolism in humoral immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, (im)mat. B subset cells exhibited significant enrichment in antigen processing and presentation BP pathways (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6_2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref></bold>). This finding is congruent with prior evidence highlighting the robust antigen presentation capability of teleost fish B cells, contributing to the initiation of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation in adaptive humoral immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, the translation process displayed enrichment across all B-cell subsets, indicative of ongoing protein synthesis during B cell development and maturation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6_2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-D</xref></bold>). These observations provide substantive support for subset classification from the perspective of cellular metabolism. Subsequently, Monocle2 pseudotime analysis was performed on B-cell subsets using Monocle to unveil potential relationships among different subsets during B-cell development. Distinct pseudotime trajectory states of the B-cell subsets were delineated and are presented in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-F</xref></bold>. Among these subsets, pro/pre B (B2), B1-like (B8), and germinal center B-like cells (B5) occupied state 1, representing the initial differentiation phase, followed by the im/mat. B (B0 and B3), IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup> B (B1), act. B/PBs (B6), and plasma (B4) cells. Notably, the identified B2, B5, and B8 clustered together in a single branch, while B0, B3, and B7 progressively differentiated into B6 and eventually into B4 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref></bold>). To explore the regulation of B-cell differentiation, a pseudotime analysis was conducted on the genes significantly altered within these clusters. These genes were categorized into three modules based on their pseudotemporal expression patterns, thereby yielding potential key regulators of teleost B-cell development (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6_1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Heterogeneity of kidney neutrophils</title>
<p>Neutrophils comprise the most prevalent subset of kidney leukocytes, constituting 45.00% within the immune-cell categories (clusters 0, 2, and 9 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), and accounting for 38.15% of the total sequenced cells in both the control and SVCV-infected groups (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A and B</xref></bold>). Subsequently, we undertook an analysis of neutrophil heterogeneity. Through iterative subclustering within the neutrophil category alone, we derived six distinct subgroups (designated as N0–N5) (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary file 6</bold>). A heatmap was constructed to display the top 10 most significant DEGs within each subcluster (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref></bold>). Subsequent annotation of each subcluster was performed based on their unique biological functions and signaling pathways utilizing GO and KEGG analyses (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8_1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>).

<title>Response of kidney HSPCs and immune-cells to SVCV infection</title>
<p>We subsequently investigated alterations in HSPCs and immune cell categories following SVCV infection to assess the potential involvement of these cells in antiviral immunity. The results revealed considerable changes in the abundance of most categories after seven days of SVCV challenge. Specifically, macrophage/myeloid cells (cluster 1), neutrophils 2 (cluster 2), and HSPCs 2 (cluster 6) exhibited an overall increase from 12.61% to 17.30%, 3.40% to 11.70%, and 1.64% to 9.72%, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A and B</xref></bold>). Conversely, neutrophils 1 (cluster 0), T/NK (cluster 5), and HSPCs 3 (cluster 8) demonstrated an overall decrease from 39.72% to 23.51%, 11.29% to 5.16%, and 6.27% to 2.08% (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A and B</xref></bold>). Notably, several subset cells within the neutrophil category displayed marked changes following SVCV infection. For instance, N0, N2, and N3 cells exhibited increases from 3.45% to 41.26%, 6.75% to 17.31%, and 0.10% to 26.05%, respectively, significantly contributing to the overall rise in neutrophils 2 (cluster 2 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). By contrast, N1 and N4 cells decreased from 71.87% to 1.30% and 13.64% to 6.69% (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A and B</xref></bold>). In the T/NK cell category, the abundance of NK (T6, T7, T13, T21), NKT (T5, T17), Th2-like (T22), and Th17 (T12) cells increased from 3.64% to 6.58%, 3.82% to 5.97%, 2.78% to 3.52%, 0.52% to 1.23%, 5.38% to 7.50%, 1.82% to 2.30%, 0.69% to 2.60%, and 1.65% to 3.52%, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C and E</xref></bold>). Conversely, Th1 (T3) and Treg (T16) cells decreased from 11.01% to 5.36% and 2.43% to 1.68%, accompanied by a decrease in CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs (T8, T9, and T15) (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C and E</xref></bold>), whose activation is regulated by Th1 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Simultaneously, the expression of these cell related genes was significantly downregulated (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref></bold>). In the macrophage/myeloid category, populations such as M1, M2, M4, and M5 experienced significant increases from 3.24% to 14.72%, 0.44% to 10.60%, 0.09% to 22.97%, and 0.09% to 23.26%, respectively, contributing to the overall category cell increase (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D and E</xref></bold>). By contrast, M1-type (M0, M7) and M2-type (M3, M8) macrophages, decreased from 30.56% to 11.43%, 27.50% to 2.59%, 23.12% to 8.01% and 9.02% to 0.65% (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D and E</xref></bold>). Among B-cell subsets, the abundance of (im)mat.

<p>We next investigated the key virus-responsive genes beyond interferons. By employing Model-based Analysis of Single-cell Transcriptomics (MAST), we identified the most significantly up-regulated genes in the DEGs of all kidney immune-cell categories. The results demonstrated a robust response of most immune cells to SVCV infection, evident from the considerable up-/down-regulation of numerous genes in these cells (<bold><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10D and E</xref></bold>). From the list of top up-regulated genes, six stood out as displaying the strongest responsiveness to SVCV infection. These genes included <italic>isg15</italic> (ISG15 ubiquitin-like modifier), <italic>CR318588.1</italic>, <italic>zgc:152791</italic> (interferon alpha-inducible protein 27.2, <italic>ifi27.2</italic>), <italic>ifi45</italic> (interferon alpha-inducible protein 27.1, <italic>ifi27.1</italic>), <italic>CR318588.2</italic>, and <italic>CR318588.3</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10F-J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10_1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>).

<title>Trained immune response of HSPCs to SVCV</title>
<p>Numerous studies have documented the phenomenon of enhanced resistance in innate immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils upon reinfection with the same or unrelated pathogens, a phenomenon termed trained immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.

However, this population exhibited minimal reduction in vaccinated zebrafish (referred to as “trained zebrafish”) upon the second SVCV challenge (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11_1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>).

Notably, the H0 subset exhibited the most pronounced response to trained immunity to SVCV within the HSPC categories (<bold><xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A</xref></bold>). Specifically, the proportion of H0 decreased from 27.81% in the PBS group to 19.87% in the SVCV group, then rapidly surged to 41.43% in the vaccinated + SVCV group. This trend was supported by the significant upregulation of numerous immune-related genes within H0 subset cells of trained zebrafish (<bold><xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B</xref></bold>). Thus, the shift in the H0 subset played a pivotal role in the overall heightened activity of the HSPCs 1 category within trained zebrafish. Collectively, these findings underscore an intensified immune response in kidney HSPCs of zebrafish subsequent to SVCV vaccination, suggesting the inducement of trained immunity in zebrafish kidney HSPCs for the generation of a memory response to SVCV infection. Furthermore, the neutrophils within the kidney of trained zebrafish exhibited enhanced antiviral immunity, showcasing potential innate immune memory characteristics.</p>

<title>Infection of SVCV in kidney immune cells</title>
<p>To delineate the potential immune cells susceptible to SVCV infection, we investigated the transcription of five subgenomic RNAs/genes (sgRNAs) encoding N, P, M, G, and L proteins during the SVCV replication cycle across diverse kidney immune-cell categories, following our recently described approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Applying an unsupervised cluster detection algorithm, we identified 10 clusters characterized by similar gene expression profiles. Importantly, the integration of viral sgRNA sequences into the kidney scRNA-seq datasets revealed an overall preservation of the composition of immune-cell categories (<bold><xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12A</xref></bold>). Subsequently, we scrutinized the transcripts of the five sgRNAs in scRNA-seq datasets from both control and SVCV-infected zebrafish. As anticipated, the five sgRNAs were present in cells from infected fish but absent in those from control fish, validating the effectiveness of our integration method (<bold><xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12B</xref></bold>). The representation of cells transcribing N-, M-, P-, G-, and L-protein encoding sgRNAs exhibited proportional variation, with approximately 0.15% of cells carrying sgRNA for N protein, followed by M (0.12%), P (0.12%), G (0.06%), and L (0.03%) proteins, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12C</xref></bold>). This distribution aligns with prior observations, confirming the heightened prevalence of N protein transcripts in SVCV-infected cells, followed by those for M, P, G, and L proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Refining our analysis to specific cell types, we discerned that viral sgRNAs were predominantly detected in macrophage/myeloid cells within cluster 3 and 9.

<title>Experimental assay for adaptive immunity occurring in kidney</title>
<p>The aforementioned observations underscore the immunologically responsive nature of the fish kidney, revealing innate and adaptive immune activities that extend beyond its previously recognized role in hematopoiesis. Among these activities, adaptive immunity has traditionally been attributed to secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. This study offers experimental confirmation for the occurrence of adaptive immunity in the zebrafish kidney following viral stimulation. To this end, zebrafish were exposed to inactivated SVCV (10<sup>6</sup> TCID50/fish) for 7 days, and the activation of kidney T and B cells was assessed by quantifying their heightened proliferation and increased expression of CD154 and CD40 costimulatory molecules through flow cytometry and RT-qPCR. As anticipated, CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, and IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells exhibited significant proliferation in the kidneys of zebrafish stimulated with SVCV compared to control fish that received mock PBS (<bold><xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13A-D</xref></bold>). In tandem, the transcriptional levels of CD154 and CD40 genes displayed marked upregulation, concurrent with the proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, and IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells (<bold><xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13E and F</xref></bold>). Importantly, parallel activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, and IgM<sup>+</sup> cells was also discerned in the spleens of SVCV-stimulated zebrafish (<bold><xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13G</xref></bold>). These results suggested that the zebrafish kidney assumes a central role in orchestrating adaptive immune responses to viral infection, a role that may be comparable to that of the spleen, a well-known secondary lymphoid organ crucial for initiating and advancing adaptive immunity. To substantiate this perspective, we proceeded to investigate the occurrence of SHM, a hallmark event driving antibody affinity maturation in adaptive humoral immunity, within kidney B cells upon antigenic stimulation. We employed RT-qPCR to examine the expression of the zebrafish AID gene (<italic>aicda</italic>), a pivotal initiator of SHM. As anticipated, AID transcript presence was evident in the zebrafish kidney, and its expression significantly increased in response to SVCV stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13H</xref></bold>). Correspondingly, SHM was identified in kidney B cells through PCR-based high-throughput sequencing. Notably, the frequency of mutagenesis within V regions (V4-9) of IgM genes demonstrated a substantial antigen-dependent increase (<bold><xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13I</xref></bold>). These findings offer novel insights into the dual-functionality of the zebrafish kidney, encompassing both hematopoietic and adaptive immunological responsiveness. This suggests that the fish kidney operates as a unique organ amalgamating the roles typically associated with primary and secondary lymphoid tissues.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The immune system constitutes a complex evolutionary entity marked by significant heterogeneity and structural-functional diversity across various taxa. The origin and phylogenetic evolution of the vertebrate immune system captivates the attention of comparative immunologists, particularly concerning teleost fish due to their pivotal phylogenetic standing. In human and other mammalian organisms, the immune system encompasses primary and secondary lymphoid organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, the former including bone marrow and thymus, facilitating hematopoiesis, lymphocyte maturation, and functional development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Secondary lymphoid organs, including lymph nodes, spleen, and sections of mucosal immune systems, trigger the activation of naïve lymphocytes by antigens, thereby initiating and advancing adaptive immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. In contrast to mammals, teleost fish lack bone marrow and lymph nodes. Instead, the anterior section of the fish kidney (referred to as the head kidney) emerges as an operational analog of mammalian bone marrow in adult fish. Accordingly, the fish kidney functions as the primary hematopoietic site, overseeing the generation of circulating blood cell lineages and B cell maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the fish kidney is also thought to be an immunologically responsive organ capable of eliciting immune responses against a spectrum of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. These findings establish the kidney’s pivotal role in fish immunity, although a comprehensive understanding of the cellular components and their attributes within the hematopoietic process and immune responses in the fish kidney remains elusive.</p>
<p>To address these gaps, we conducted a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of kidney leukocytes in zebrafish, unraveling the spectrum of hematopoietic and immune-associated cell types in adult fish. We identified 13 distinct cell categories, spanning three groups of HSPCs, six cohorts of innate and adaptive immune-related cells, and four renal cell types, which emerged as byproducts of cellular preparation. Further subdivisions of the three HSPC groups led to the identification of 11 potential subpopulations, each marked by unique gene expression profiles. Notable subsets, such as Nanos1<sup>+</sup>Spi2<sup>+</sup> HSPCs and cycling HSPCs, bore resemblances to previously described counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, six subsets exhibited the characteristics of progenitor cells, demonstrating both marker gene expression and the capacity to differentiate into diverse blood cell lineages encompassing NK cells, myeloid cells, lymphoid cells, erythrocytes, and thrombocytes. Yet, the properties of certain HSPC subsets, like H2, H3, and H4, remain undefined. Such subsets exhibit distinct gene expression profiles, which could potentially serve as candidate signatures for future subset classification. Correspondingly, numerous committed or terminal cell lineages, intricately associated with these HSPCs, were detected in the kidney. These lineages encompass a range of innate and adaptive immune-related cells at various developmental stages, prominently featuring neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, and various T and B cell subsets. Moreover, early developmental cells such as double negative (DN) T cells, double positive (DP) T cells, pro/pre B cells, and immature/mature B cells were found in the kidney. These cells are major committed immature or partially mature T and B lymphocytes at early stage of hematopoiesis, among them, the DN and DP T cells will enter the thymus, where they complete their maturation and maturing selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, while pro/pre B and im/mat B cells may continue to mature or partially mature in the kidney. These insights underscore the presence of diverse HSPCs fostering various blood cell lineages and reinforce the concept that the fish kidney functions as a primary lymphoid organ, mirroring the role of mammalian bone marrow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Comparatively, human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized by surface markers (such as CD34 and c-kit), coupled with the absence of lineage-specific markers typical of mature cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. HSCs yield common myeloid-lymphoid progenitors (CMLPs) and common myeloid-megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (CMMEPs). While CMLPs give rise to committed T and B cell precursors, ILCs, and certain myeloid cells, CMMEPs produce precursors for erythroid, megakaryocytic, monocytic, and granulocytic lineages. These precursors subsequently develop into mature erythrocytes, platelets, monocytes, and granulocytes, as well as dendritic cells and mast cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Notably, zebrafish exhibited detectable elementary progenitors responsible for generating principal blood cell lineages, suggesting the presence of conserved cellular components and developmental pathways underlying adult hematopoiesis across species. However, unresolved matters and fish-specific events within adult fish hematopoiesis persist, such as distinguishing HSCs from multiple HSPCs. Additionally, the existence of pluripotent common progenitors akin to CMLPs and CMMEPs, as well as committed precursors for lymphocytic, erythroid, megakaryocytic, monocytic, and granulocytic lineages, warrant clarification. Although pseudotime trajectory and RNA velocity analyses have shed preliminary light on relationships among partial HSPCs, the precise phenotypic features, developmental trajectories, and correlations of these HSPCs necessitate thorough elucidation. Unique HSPCs with unknown properties, like H0, H2, H3, and H4, accentuate the high heterogeneity within HSPCs in adult fish. Given the considerable number of fish-specific lineages, probing the relationship between these uncharacterized HSPCs and fish-specific lineages remains a promising avenue of exploration.</p>
<p>The extensive presence of immune cells associated with the kidney signifies the central role of this organ in fish immunity, extending beyond its hematopoietic function. Indeed, the kidney exhibited robust responsiveness to SVCV infection, evidenced by significant changes in the abundance of diverse immune cells, including both upregulated and downregulated subsets. Prominent upregulated populations consisted of neutrophils (N0, N2, N3), NK (T6, T7, T13, T21), NKT (T5, T17), Th17 (T12), Th2-like (T22), common IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup> B (B1), pro/pre B (B2), germinal center B-like (B5) cells, and macrophages (M1, M2, M4, M5), indicating their engagement in host defense against SVCV. Conversely, downregulated populations encompassed subsets of neutrophils (N1, N4), CD8<sup>+</sup> T (T8, T9, T15), Th1 (T3), Treg (T16), im/mat. B (B0), and M1-/M2-macrophages (M0, M3, M7, M8), implying their impairment during SVCV infection. For example, the impairment of im/mat. B (B0) cells may be caused by undergoing severe cell death under infection in this case, as determined by their highly expression of death-associated genes related to apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis. The reduction in this antibody-producing subset will attenuate the humoral adaptive immune protection of fish from SVCV infection. Notably, we found that the abundance of three HSPC subsets (H1, H3, and H4) were markedly upregulated by 24.09-, 255.22-, 258.44-folds, respectively. By contrast, six other HSPC subsets (H0, H2, H6, H7, H8 and H9) were downregulated, potentially hampering the differentiation of downstream lineage cells and attenuating antiviral immunity. Encouragingly, two HSPC subsets demonstrated the induction of trained immunity upon stimulation with SVCV vaccine, subsequently challenged by virulent SVCV. These findings not only underscore the role of HSPCs in viral responses but also signify a novel dimension of HSPC involvement in viral infections. Previous studies have highlighted the profound impact of infections on host immune homeostasis in various viral disease models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. The consequences range from excessive inflammation due to hyperactive immune responses to immune deficiency resulting from ineffective responses, the latter of which potentially favoring immune escape by viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. In the current study, multiple HSPCs and immune cell subset disturbances were observed under SVCV infection, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. However, the exact mechanisms of the disturbance of HSPCs and immune cells under infection remains to be studied, which will help clarify the pathogenesis of viremia during SVCV infection from the perspective of immunopathology.</p>
<p>The broader overview of kidney immune cell shifts in response to SVCV challenge reveals extensive innate and adaptive immune responses within the kidney during viral infections. This robust immune responsiveness aligns with the concept of the fish kidney as a potent immune organ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Particularly noteworthy, our investigation revealed a diverse range of adaptive immune-associated cells inhabiting the zebrafish kidney. These cells encompass various APCs, along with naïve T and B cells, plasmablasts, and plasma cells—key cell types crucial for initiating, activating, and executing adaptive immune responses. The profiles of adaptive immune cells within the kidney, alongside their responses, closely resemble those observed in the spleen—an evolutionarily conserved secondary lymphoid organ spanning vertebrates from fish to mammals. Consequently, our findings strongly imply that the zebrafish kidney might function as a secondary lymphoid organ, fostering the generation of adaptive immunity through interactions among APCs and antigen-specific T and B cells. To empirically substantiate this hypothesis, we examined the occurrence of antigen-stimulated adaptive immune responses in the kidney. As anticipated, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, and IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells exhibited pronounced activation in the zebrafish kidney under SVCV challenge. This activation was underscored by significant proliferation in CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, and IgM<sup>+</sup> B cell populations, followed by upregulated transcriptional expression of CD154 and CD40 genes on these cells. Furthermore, we also observed the occurrence of antigen-induced expression of AID and SHM in the kidney IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells, two hallmark events for the affinity maturation of antibodies in adaptive humoral immunity. These results collectively establish the zebrafish kidney as a distinct entity encompassing attributes of both primary and secondary lymphoid organs, thus offering fresh insights into the dual functional roles of the fish kidney, spanning hematopoiesis and adaptive immunity. While peripheral lymph nodes are absent, the spleen has historically stood as the predominant secondary lymphoid organ in fish. However, our current study introduces a novel member to the array of secondary lymphoid organs. The intricate interplay between the roles of the kidney and spleen in hematopoiesis and immune responses within fish warrants further elucidation. Moreover, unraveling the structural foundations accommodating diverse HSPCs and immune cell types and precisely orchestrating hematopoiesis and immune responses within the kidney and spleen emerges as a compelling area of inquiry. Addressing these queries necessitates the utilization of advanced techniques, such as single-cell spatiotemporal transcriptomic analysis at the level of cross-organ single-cell transcriptome profiling.</p>
<p>In summary, our study presents a comprehensive panorama of HSPCs and immune cell types within the zebrafish kidney under steady-state conditions, viral emergencies, and vaccine training. Our identification of a multitude of HSPCs, along with developmentally-linked progenitors and immune cell types, and their modifications under emergency and training scenarios, underscores the pivotal role of the kidney in fish defense against viral infections. Moreover, the revelation of trained immunity establishment within HSPCs holds significant implications for comprehending the novel pathways and mechanisms governing trained immunity formation. The paradigm shift—where the kidney, traditionally viewed as a primary lymphoid organ facilitating hematopoiesis—emerges as a secondary lymphoid organ, marks a pivotal transformation in understanding fish biology. Our study offers insights into the intricate and heterogeneous nature of the fish immune system, shedding light on the multifunctionality of the fish kidney, encompassing hematopoiesis, immune defense, waste excretion, and osmoregulation—mainstays of kidney function across diverse vertebrates.</p>

Pseudotime ordering was performed using the function “reduce dimension” with max_components set at 2 and reduction_method set as DDRTree. Next, the significantly affected genes were obtained from the top 50 markers among the clusters by using the function differentialGeneTest (fullModelFormulaStr = ∼Pseudotime) and were plotted with the function plot_pseudotime_heatmap. The num_cluster was set at 3 to obtain three modules of significantly changed genes that had similar trends according to their pseudotemporal expression patterns.</p>

<title>RNA velocity analysis</title>
<p>Cell RNA velocity analysis was performed using the velocyto (V0.17.17) program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. This approach uses the relative proportions of unspliced and spliced mRNA abundance to provide insights into the anticipated future state of cells. Initial annotation of spliced and unspliced reads was performed through the utilization of the “velocyto.py” commandline tools. Subsequently, downstream analysis was performed using the same “velocyto.py” framework. The resulting RNA velocity data represents a vector that predicts the transition dynamics of individual cells, with the direction and speed of each transition inferred from the amplitude and direction of the individual cell velocity arrows plotted on a t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) plot. By examining the directional flow within the RNA velocity vector field, the hierarchical relationship between two cell populations can be inferred.</p>

<title>Pathway enrichment analysis</title>
<p>Functional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), were conducted to determine which differentially expressed genes (DEGs) significantly enriched GO terms or metabolic pathways. Given that GO is an international standard classification system for gene function, DEGs are mapped to the GO terms (biological functions) in the database. The number of genes in each term was calculated, and a hypergeometric test was performed to identify significantly enriched GO terms in the gene list out of the background of the reference gene list. GO terms and KEGG pathways with false discovery rates <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered as significantly different.</p>

<title>Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and quantitative real-time PCR</title>
<p>MACS was employed to isolate T and B cells from kidney leukocytes in both SVCV-infected and PBS-administered (control) zebrafish. In this procedure, leukocytes were initially blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 15 minutes at 10°C, then incubated with rabbit anti-TCRα/β (1:200) or mouse anti-IgM Ab (1:200) for an additional 15 minutes at 10°C. Subsequent washing with MACS buffer (PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA) was followed by a 15-minute incubation at 10°C with anti-IgG magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). The cell suspension was introduced to a LS separation column following the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was extracted from positive cells, kidney, and spleen tissues using an RNAiso Plus kit (Takara Bio), and subsequently reverse transcribed into cDNAs. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was employed to analyze the transcript abundance of target genes on a CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The PCR protocol encompassed a total volume of 10 μl with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Reaction mixtures underwent an initial incubation at 95°C for 2 minutes, succeeded by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C, 15 seconds at 60°C, and 20 seconds at 72°C. Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2<sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> method, with β-actin as the reference gene. Each PCR trial comprised triplicate parallel reactions, and each experiment was independently repeated at least three times. The RT-qPCR primer sequences are detailed in <bold>Supplementary file 7</bold>.</p>

<title>ScRNA-Seq differential expression analysis and SVCV reads enrichment</title>
<p>Seurat package FindMarkers function with default parameters was used to perform differential gene expression analysis between the control and treatment groups of the same cell type. Within the FindAllMarkers function, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied to assess single-cell differential gene expression for identified cell subsets. Marker genes for each cluster were determined by contrasting them with all other cells in the experiment. Differential gene expression, reflecting diverse levels of upregulation and downregulation in different comparisons, was depicted through volcano plots. Enrichment of reads across SVCV genes was analyzed using the Integrative Genome Viewer to identify read pileups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>.

<title>Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis</title>
<p>For FCM analysis, cells underwent blocking with 5% normal goat serum at 4°C for 1 hour, followed by incubation with corresponding primary antibodies: rabbit anti-CD4-1 (1:200), rabbit anti-CD8α (1:200), and mouse anti-CD154 (1:200), at 4°C for 2 hours. As a control, non-specific mouse or rabbit IgG served as an isotype control. Subsequently, cells were washed and further incubated with secondary antibodies: PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, for 1 hour at 4°C. Fluorescence signals were detected using a FACScan flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) at 488 nm. FCM analysis was based on forward/side scatter (FSC/SSC) characteristics and PE/FITC-conjugated fluorescence with CellQuest program as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. A minimum of 10,000 events were collected from the lymphocyte gate. Data processing was executed using FlowJo 7.6 software (BD Biosciences). To examine CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation, zebrafish under PBS/inactivated SVCV treatment received intraperitoneal injections of 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine, Alexa Fluor 488 (EdU, Beyotime, 8 μg/fish) twice within a 24-hour interval two days before euthanization. Seven days after SVCV stimulation, leukocytes from the kidney were collected and incubated with rabbit anti-CD4/CD8 (1:500), followed by APC-conjugated rabbit anti-IgG secondary antibody (1:1,000; Thermo Fisher). Subsequently, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, and underwent click reaction according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BeyoClick EdU Cell Proliferation Kit with Alexa Fluor 488, Beyotime). The proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was subsequently analyzed using FCM (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Hu et al. performed sc-RNA-seq analyses of kidney cells with or without virus infection, vaccines, and vaccines+virus infections from pooled adult zebrafish. They compared within these experimental groups as well as kidney vs spleen. Their analyses identified expected populations but also revealed new hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC), even in the spleen. Their analyses show that HSPCs in the kidney can respond to virus infection differentially and can be trained to recognize the same infection and argue that zebrafish kidney can serve as a secondary immune organ. The findings are important and interesting. The manuscript is well written and a pleasure to read. However, there are several issues with their figure presentation and figure qualities, as well as the lack of clarity in some of figure legends. Some of the data presentation can be improved for better clarity. It is also important to outline what is conserved and what is unique for fish.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>1. The visualization for several figure panels is very poor. Please provide high resolution images and larger font sizes for gene list or Y and X axis labels. This includes Figure 1B, Figure 1-figure supplement 2, Figure 2B-2C, 3A-3D, 4F, 5B, 6G, Figure 6-figure supplement 1B, Figure 6-figure supplement 2. Figure 7B, 8C-8E, Figure 8-figure supplement 1., 10F, 10G-10J, Figure 10-figure supplement 1.</p>
<p>
2. What are the figures at the end of the manuscript without any figure legends?</p>
<p>
3. It would be better to use a Table to organize the gene signatures that define each unique population of immune cells such as T, B, NK, etc.</p>
<p>
4. What are the similarities for HSPC and immune cell populations between fish and man based on this research? It is better to form a table to compare and discuss.</p>
<p>
5. It is highly likely that sex and age could be the biological variation for how HSPC responds to virus infections and vaccination. The author should clearly state the fish sex and age from their samples and discuss their results taking into consideration of these variations.</p>
<p>
6. The authors claim that the spleen and kidney share HSPCs. However, their data did not demonstrate this result clearly in Figure 4A. Perhaps they should use different color to make the overlay becoming more obvious? Or include a table to show which HSPCs are shared between the kidney and spleen? Are they sure if these are just HSPCs seeding the spleen to differentiate into B cells or other immune cells?</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors have meticulously constructed a comprehensive atlas delineating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) and immune-cell types within the zebrafish kidney, employing single-cell transcriptome profiling analysis. Notably, these cell populations exhibited distinctive responses to viral infection. Intriguingly, the investigation revealed that HSPCs manifest positive reactivities to viral infection, indicating the effective induction of trained immunity in select HSPCs. Furthermore, the study unveiled the capacity for the generation of antigen-stimulated adaptive immunity within the kidney, suggesting a role for the zebrafish kidney as a secondary lymphoid organ. This research elucidates the distinctive features of the fish immune system and underscores the multifaceted biology of the kidney in ancient vertebrates.</p>
