<title>Abstract</title><p>The infralimbic cortex (IL) is essential for flexible behavioral responses to threatening environmental events. Reactive behaviors such as freezing or flight are adaptive in some contexts, but in others a strategic avoidance behavior may be more advantageous. IL has been implicated in avoidance, but the contribution of distinct IL neural subtypes with differing molecular identities and wiring patterns is poorly understood. Here, we study IL parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in mice as they engage in active avoidance behavior, a behavior in which mice must suppress freezing in order to move to safety. We find that activity in inhibitory PV neurons increases during movement to avoid the shock in this behavioral paradigm, and that PV activity during movement emerges after mice have experienced a single shock, prior to learning avoidance. PV neural activity does not change during movement toward cued rewards or during general locomotion in the open field, behavioral paradigms where freezing does not need to be suppressed to enable movement. Optogenetic suppression of PV neurons increases the duration of freezing and delays the onset of avoidance behavior, but does not affect movement toward rewards or general locomotion. These data provide evidence that IL PV neurons support strategic avoidance behavior by suppressing freezing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is essential for flexible behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Duncan, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>). Hallmarks of prefrontal damage in humans and animals include stimulus-bound and context- inappropriate behaviors, excessive reactivity, and impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Harlow, 1868</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bianchi and Macdonald, 1922</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lhermitte, 1983</xref>). The ventromedial part of the prefrontal cortex, the infralimbic cortex (IL), is important for supporting strategic behavior in the face of environmental threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Murphy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hardung et al., 2017</xref>). IL plays a critical role in fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Do-Monte et al., 2015</xref>), discrimination between safety and fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sangha et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">2020</xref>), and active avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Moscarello and LeDoux, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Halladay and Blair, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>During active avoidance, mice first freeze in response to shock-predicting tones, as they do in fear conditioning, but gradually learn that they can avoid the shock by crossing the chamber when a tone plays. This behavior requires both the suppression of cued freezing and movement toward a safe zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mowrer and Lamoreaux, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Koolhaas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Moscarello and LeDoux, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Krypotos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">LeDoux et al., 2017</xref>). Active avoidance is similar to fear extinction in that cue-elicited freezing behavior mediated by the amygdala is suppressed during both behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Phillips and LeDoux, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kim et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Herry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Milad and Quirk, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Moscarello and LeDoux, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">LeDoux et al., 2017</xref>). IL neural activity is higher in rats that successfully extinguish freezing to conditioned stimuli, and IL projects directly and indirectly to the central amygdala and is thought to suppress central amygdala outputs that mediate freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Vertes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">LeDoux et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>IL parvalbumin (PV) neurons synapse onto and inhibit local pyramidal neurons. Although we might expect that activation of IL PV neurons would inhibit avoidance behavior by inhibiting IL long-range projection neurons and disinhibiting central amygdala outputs that facilitate freezing, the relationship between PV and pyramidal neuron firing in cortex is complex. Cortical PV neurons have been reported to activate simultaneously with local pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Merchant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Okun and Lampl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Isomura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pinto and Dan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Estebanez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nashef et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Giordano et al., 2023</xref>), and it has been suggested that PV neurons may help to shape, rather than gate, the firing of local pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Isomura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Merchant et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The question thus arises whether the activation of IL PV neurons suppresses or facilitates active avoidance behavior. Using fiber photometry, we show that IL PV neuron activity increases specifically when mice suppress cue-elicited freezing and move to avoid a future shock, but does not increase when animals move to obtain a cued reward or move in a neutral context. Further, we show that movement-related IL PV neural activity precedes avoidance learning, and emerges after mice have experienced a single shock in an environment, a finding that links PV neural activity specifically with the suppression of freezing to enable movement. Finally, we show that optogenetic suppression of IL PV neural activity prolongs freezing and delays avoidance but does not affect movement toward cued rewards or general locomotion. These results reveal that IL PV neurons play an essential and counterintuitive role in supporting flexible behavior in the face of threat, and suggest a role for PV neurons in shaping IL function that goes beyond the suppression of local neural activity.</p>

<title>IL PV neurons signal active avoidance</title>
<p>We first asked how IL PV neurons respond during active avoidance behavior. To target this population for fiber photometry, we selectively expressed a genetically encoded calcium indicator in IL PV neurons by injecting AAV-CAG-Flex-GCaMP6f into IL in PV-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). In control mice we expressed GFP in IL PV neurons by injecting AAV-CAG-Flex-GFP. We implanted an optical fiber over IL to monitor calcium-dependent fluorescence, and recorded IL PV population activity via fiber photometry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<p>We used a two-way signaled active avoidance paradigm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). When an auditory cue (constant tone at 12 kHz or 8 kHz) was played, mice were required to cross the midline of the behavioral testing chamber within 5 seconds of tone onset to avoid an impending foot shock. If mice crossed the chamber during this 5-second period, no foot shock was delivered and the trial was scored as a successful avoidance. If not, a 2 second foot shock was delivered. Mice could terminate the foot shock early by crossing the chamber, which was scored as an escape. The tone terminated at either successful avoidance or shock offset. Prior to avoidance training, mice received two tone-shock pairings to learn the association between the auditory cue and the foot shock.</p>
<p>As IL inactivation impairs avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Moscarello and LeDoux, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Halladay and Blair, 2017</xref>), we predicted that the activity of inhibitory IL PV neurons would be low during successful avoidance trials. Contrary to expectations, we found that IL PV neural activity rose upon the initiation of avoidance movements and peaked at chamber crossing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-G, G</xref>: N = 8 mice, p=0.0077, paired t-test; <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âFigure supplement 1A-F, B</xref>: N = 8 mice, p = 0.0013, paired t-test, <bold>F</bold>: N = 8 mice, p = 0.4682, paired t-test). The trial-by-trial variability in the amplitude of IL PV neural activity was not correlated with variability in the speed or latency of the avoidance movement (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âFigure supplement 1G-L, H</xref>: N = 8 mice, p = 0.3541, one-sample t-test, <bold>K</bold>: N = 8 mice, p = 0.4132, one-sample t-test). IL PV neural activity during the avoidance movement was not attenuated by learning or repeated reinforcement (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âFigure supplement 1M</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">N</xref>, N = 8 mice, p = 0.8886, 1-way ANOVA).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>IL PV neural activity reflects the avoidance movement, not the predictive tone</title>
<p>During successful avoidance trials, two events happen simultaneously: the mouse crosses the chamber, and a shock-predicting tone is terminated. To determine whether PV neural activity better reflects the avoidance movement or the termination of the predictive auditory sensory cue, we designed a version of the avoidance task with additional trial types to uncouple these events. Regular trials (80%) were interleaved with trials with shortened (10%) or lengthened (10%) tones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In short-tone trials the tone lasted for only 1.5 seconds, and in long-tone trials the tone was not terminated until 1.5 seconds after successful avoidance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). IL PV neural activity at chamber crossing did not differ between regular and long-tone trials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B and D</xref>, N = 7 mice, p = 0.9546, paired t-test). Usually, the chamber was not crossed in short-tone trials, so short-tone trials were not included in this analysis. PV neural activity at tone offset was significantly different among short-tone, regular, and long-tone trials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C and E</xref>, N = 7 mice, p = 0.005, one-way repeated ANOVA. Multiple comparison, R and S, p=0.0045, R and L, p=0.0398, S and L, p=0.4620.). These results indicate that PV neural activity primarily reflects the avoidance movement and not tone offset.</p>

</fig>
<p>We extracted characteristic neural responses to each event without interference from other events close in time. We constructed a linear regression model to extract the isolated neural responses to chamber crossing and tone termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Parker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Musall et al., 2019</xref>), and all major events were included in the model. We assumed (1) that neural responses would be similar for the same events and dissimilar for different events, and (2) neural responses to events can be summed up linearly to form the recorded signals. With these assumptions and through linear regression, isolated neural responses to each event were extracted. The model-extracted isolated neural response to tone offset was flat, while the isolated avoidance signal peaked at chamber crossing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F and G</xref>). To further demonstrate that IL PV activity can be better accounted for by the action to avoid the shock than tone termination, we compared the explanatory power (R<sup>2</sup>, coefficient of determination) of the reduced model with shuffled time points to the full model. Shuffling the avoidance time points significantly reduced the explanatory power of the model (ÎR<sup>2</sup> different from zero, N = 7 mice, p = 0.0125, one-sample t-test), while shuffling the tone offset time points had no effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, N = 7 mice, p = 0.0802, one-sample t-test). Thus, IL PV neural activity at chamber crossing reflects the avoidance behavior and not the cessation of the predictive auditory cue.</p>

<title>IL PV neural activity does not reflect movement to obtain rewards</title>
<p>IL PV neural activity rises during movement to avoid a predicted future shock (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E and F</xref>), but it is unclear whether this neural activity specifically reflects avoidance, or if IL PV neural activity would be elevated during any movement. If IL PV neural activity reflects locomotor activity, we would expect to see elevated neural activity during movement to obtain rewards. To test this idea, we recorded IL PV neuronal activity during a reward approach task, which mirrored the avoidance design in temporal structure, but shock omission on successful chamber crossing was replaced with reward delivery (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In this task, chamber-crossing movements to obtain a water reward were not associated with elevated IL PV neural activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-E; E</xref>, N = 7 mice, p = 0.3003, paired t-test; <xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âFigure supplement 1A-C, C</xref>: N = 6 mice, p=0.0382, paired t-test; see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-G</xref> for comparison).</p>

<p>We observed an elevation of IL PV neuronal activity after chamber crossing when the animals started to consume the water reward (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, magenta dots, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). To test whether this transient increase in IL PV neuron activity after chamber crossing reflects water consumption or the preceding approach behavior, we introduced randomized water-omission trials in 10% of the trials (<xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âFigure supplement 1D-E</xref>). We found that the PV neuron signal rose both when water was received and when the water reward was omitted, and increases in IL PV activity preceded the first lick to consume water reward delivered after a successful crossing (<xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âFigure supplement 1E</xref>). We speculate that, rather than a reward signal related to water consumption, this signal may reflect the suppression of the habitual chamber-crossing movement in the approach task when the mouse nears the lick port.</p>
<p>To further investigate whether elevated IL PV neuronal activity reflected avoidance or locomotion, we recorded IL PV activity in an open field test (OFT) where animals were allowed to run freely without any defined task structure (<xref rid="fig3S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âFigure supplement 2A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig3S2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). When we aligned IL PV activity to movement peaks, no elevated activity was observed (<xref rid="fig3S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3â Figure supplement 2C</xref>). We varied the overhead lighting and found that IL PV neurons showed no elevated activity during movement under either a bright ceiling light, which is a more aversive setting to the mice, or a dim ceiling light, which is more comforting to the mice (<xref rid="fig3S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âFigure supplement 2D</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig3S2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>, N = 7 mice, bright light: p = 0.8705, dim light: p = 0.1475, paired t-test; <xref rid="fig3S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âFigure supplement 2F</xref>). It should be noted that the OFT is a relatively neutral context, regardless of lighting conditions, when compared to the appetitive reward approach or aversive active avoidance.</p>

<title>IL PV neural activity becomes positively correlated to movement after shock</title>
<p>In environments with different emotional valence animals engage in different suites of behaviors. For example, animals in threatening environments spend more time freezing and less time exploring than animals in rewarding environments. We hypothesized that IL neural activity may become positively correlated with movement when animals learn that their environment is threatening, and must suppress behaviors such as freezing in order to engage in behaviors such as exploration.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the recordings made on the first day of active avoidance training to determine how movement-related IL PV neural activity evolves as animals learn that the environment is threatening. On the first session, we habituated animals to the chamber for 5 minutes before the task started. During this habituation period, IL PV activity was not positively correlated with movement (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âFigure supplement 1A</xref>), similar to our observations in appetitive and neutral contexts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>; <xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âFigure supplement 1E-I</xref>). During avoidance behavior, we found that IL PV activity peaked during movements in the inter-trial interval (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âFigure supplement 1A</xref>). Considering that animals minimize their movements in threatening environments, movement outside of the tone-evoked trial could require suppression of this natural inclination.</p>

<p>Both the speed of the avoidance movement (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>, significant interaction between opsin and stimulation, N = 8 NpHR mice, N = 5 eYFP mice, p = 0.0281, 2-way ANOVA) and the probability of successful avoidance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>, N = 8 NpHR mice, N = 5 eYFP mice, p = 0.0058, unpaired t-test) were reduced by suppression of IL PV neurons. The speed of movement and the probability of successful reward delivery were not affected in the reward approach task (speed: <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5I</xref>, interaction between opsin and stimulation, N = 8 NpHR mice, N = 5 eYFP mice, p = 0.479, 2-way ANOVA; probability of approach: <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5K</xref>, N = 8 NpHR mice, N = 5 eYFP mice, p = 0.1204, unpaired t-test). This suggests that IL PV neuronal activity is not just correlated with avoidance behavior but plays a causal role. By further analyzing the video data, we found that freezing during tone presentation increased (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âFigure supplement 1E-G</xref><bold>, G</bold>: N = 8 NpHR mice, N = 5 eYFP mice, p = 0.0175, unpaired t-test; <bold>Video 1</bold>). In addition, the ratio of freezing duration to avoidance latency increased during IL PV inhibition (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âFigure supplement 1H</xref>, N = 8 NpHR mice, N = 5 eYFP mice, p = 0.0302, unpaired t-test; <bold>Video 1</bold>), suggesting that increased avoidance latency was primarily due to an increase in freezing. This finding supports the idea that IL PV neural activity promotes avoidance by suppressing freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Murphy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hardung et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We then asked whether inhibiting IL PV neuronal activity had an immediate effect on avoidance during the current trial or if instead inhibition influenced learning. To address this question, we investigated whether IL PV inhibition affected avoidance in trials following inhibition, using the task described in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>. Contrary to the learning hypothesis, we found that suppressing IL PV neurons delayed avoidance even on the first trial of a stimulation block. The latency of the first trial of inhibition blocks was significantly longer than the latency of pre-stimulation trials (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âFigure supplement 1I</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">J</xref><bold>,</bold> N = 8 NpHR mice, N = 5 eYFP mice, p = 0.0022, paired t test), but was not significantly different from the latency of subsequent inhibition trials (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âFigure supplement 1I</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">J</xref><bold>,</bold> N = 8 NpHR mice, N = 5 eYFP mice, p = 0.0943, paired t test). The latency of the first non-inhibited trial following an inhibition block is significantly different from the latency of the preceding inhibition trials (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âFigure supplement 1K</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">L</xref><bold>,</bold> N = 8 NpHR mice, N = 5 eYFP mice, p = 0.0343, paired t test) but is not significantly different from the latency of subsequent non-inhibited trials (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âFigure supplement 1K</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">L</xref><bold>,</bold> N = 8 NpHR mice, N = 5 eYFP mice, p = 0.8147, paired t-test). These results suggest that IL PV neuronal activity plays a causal role in modulating ongoing behavior.</p>
<p>To further tease apart the role of IL PV neural activity in learning, we inhibited IL PV neurons immediately after successful chamber crossing in the avoidance task, rather than during the tone (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âFigure supplement 1M</xref>). With this experimental design, speed was not affected by IL PV inhibition (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âFigure supplement 1N-P</xref>, <xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">P</xref>: N = 8 NpHR mice, N = 5 eYFP mice, p = 0.8846, 2-way ANOVA interaction term). The latency of the first trials in inhibition blocks showed no significant difference from the latency of the second trials in inhibition blocks (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âFigure supplement 1Q</xref>, N = 8 NpHR mice, N = 5 eYFP mice, p = 0.6944, paired t-test), and the latency of the first trials after the end of the inhibition block also showed no difference to the latency of the second trials after the inhibition block (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âFigure supplement 1Q</xref>, N = 8 NpHR mice, N = 5 eYFP mice, p = 0.6745, paired t-test). Thus, post-avoidance inhibition of IL PV neural activity did not affect avoidance latency in subsequent trials.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we show that IL PV neural activity rises during movement to avoid a cued future shock, but not during movement to obtain reward or movement in the open field. Further, this rise in activity during movement emerges immediately after the first shock and does not require avoidance learning. We also show that inhibiting IL PV neurons prolongs freezing and delays avoidance, but does not affect movement to obtain reward or movement in the open field. These results demonstrate that IL PV neurons play a key role in suppressing freezing in order to permit movement in threatening environments, an essential component of the avoidance response.</p>
<p>The rise in IL PV neural activity during movement does not require avoidance learning â IL PV neurons begin to respond during movement immediately after the animal has received a single shock in an environment, but learning to cross the chamber to avoid the signaled shock takes tens of trials. Why is there a discordance between the emergence of the IL PV signal during movement and avoidance learning? The components underlying active avoidance have been debated over the years, but are thought to involve at least two essential behaviors â suppressing freezing, and moving to safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">LeDoux et al., 2017</xref>). Freezing is the default response of mice upon hearing a shock-predicting tone, and can be learned in a single trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ledoux, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fanselow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zambetti et al., 2022</xref>). When a predator is in the distance, freezing can increase the chance of survival by reducing the chances of detection. However, a strategic avoidance behavior may prevent a future encounter with the predator altogether. The importance of IL PV neural activity in defensive behavior may be to suppress reactive defensive behaviors such as freezing in order to permit a flexible goal-directed response to threat.</p>
<p>The freezing suppression and avoidance movement components of the avoidance response are dissociable, both because freezing precedes avoidance learning, and because animals intermittently move prior to avoidance learning. Our finding that the rise in PV activity during movement emerges immediately after receiving a single shock, tens of trials before animals have learned the avoidance behavior, suggests that the IL PV signal is associated with the suppression of freezing. Further, IL PV neurons do not respond during movement toward cued rewards because in reward-based tasks there is no freezing response in conflict with reward approach behavior.</p>
<p>We think the IL PV signal is unlikely to be a safety signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sangha et al., 2020</xref>). First, the PV signal rises during movement not only in the avoidance context, but during any movement in a âthreateningâ context (i.e. a context where the animal has been shocked). For example, PV neural activity rises during movement during the intertrial interval in the avoidance task. Further, the emergence of the PV signal during movement happens quickly â after the first shock â and significantly before the animal has learned to move to the safe zone. This suggests a close association with enabling movement in a threatening environment, when animals must suppress a freezing response in order to move. Additionally, the rise in PV activity was specifically associated with movement and not with tone offset, the indicator of safety in this task. Finally, if IL PV neural activity reflects safety signals one would expect the response to be enhanced by learning, but the amplitude of the IL PV response was unaffected by learning after the first shock.</p>
<p>Finding that inhibitory IL PV neural activity suppresses freezing was counterintuitive, given the importance of IL for fear extinction and avoidance learning. We had predicted that IL PV neurons would be suppressed during avoidance, because IL is active when animals have successfully extinguished freezing in response to shock-predicting cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>), and muscimol inhibition of IL impairs avoidance learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Moscarello and LeDoux, 2013</xref>). However, recent studies have suggested that the role of cortical PV neurons goes beyond suppressing overall neural activity in a region, and likely plays a more delicate role in tuning local computations.</p>
<p>For example, PV neurons aid in improving visual discrimination through sharpening response selectivity in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). In prefrontal cortex, PV neurons are critical for task performance, particularly during performance of tasks that require flexible behavior such as rule shift learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cho et al., 2020</xref>) and reward extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sparta et al., 2014</xref>). Further, PV neurons play an essential role in the generation of cortical gamma rhythms, which contribute to synchronization of selective populations of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Courtin et al (2014)</xref> showed that brief suppression of dorsomedial prefrontal (dmPFC) PV neural activity enhanced fear expression, one of the main functions of the dmPFC, by synchronizing the spiking activity of dmPFC pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Courtin et al., 2014</xref>). This result is potentially relevant to our findings, but likely involves different circuit mechanisms because of the difference in timescale, targeted area, and downstream projection targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Vertes, 2004</xref>). These and other studies support the idea that PV neural activity supports the execution of a behavior by shaping rather than suppressing cortical activity, potentially by selecting among conflicting behaviors by the synchronization of different pyramidal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Warden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). The roles of other inhibitory neural subtypes (such as somatostatin (SOM)-expressing and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing IL GABA neurons) in avoidance behavior are currently unknown, but are likely important given the role of SOM neurons in gamma-band synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Veit et al., 2017</xref>), and the role of VIP neurons in regulating PV and SOM neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Cardin, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings have revealed the role of IL PV neural activity in facilitating flexible avoidance behavior by suppressing the conflicting freezing behavior. Though IL PV neurons comprise only a relatively sparse cortical population, inhibiting these neurons has a clear and specific detrimental effect on the initiation of avoidance behavior, which is vital for leaving a dangerous situation. Our work also suggests that the functional role of PV neurons extends beyond the overall suppression of the function of a brain region, and provides a conceptual framework of potential utility for deepening our understanding of the functional roles of PV neurons in mediating conflict between behaviors through coordination of local circuits.</p>

<title>Reward Approach (Photometry)</title>
<p>The reward approach task was performed in a 17.25â W x 6.75â D x 10â H metal rectangular shuttle box (MedAssociates, Fairfax, VT) divided into two equal compartments by Plexiglas semi-partitions, which allowed animals to move freely between compartments. A water sprout was located at the end of each compartment, and a syringe pump was connected to the sprout for water delivery. Licks were detected with a contact-based lickometer (MedAssociates, Fairfax, VT). Animals were water restricted prior to training. Body weight was checked daily and was maintained above 80% baseline. Animals were trained to first learn the association between tone and reward-licking at the waterspout in the opposite compartment, by playing a tone for an indefinite length of time (12 kHz or 8 kHz at 70-80 dB, counterbalancing between approach and avoidance) until successful reward collection. When an animal crossed the chamber in response to a tone, water was delivered in the goal compartment, and an indicator light above the targeted water sprout was terminated. After two to three days of training, the reward-indicating lights were removed. Tone duration was set to be turned off either at the chamber crossing or at maximum duration. Animals had to cross within the maximum duration of tone for successful water delivery. The maximum tone duration was shortened as animals progressed and were eventually set to 5 seconds. The inter-trial interval was pseudo-randomized at an average of 40 seconds. Animals were allowed to perform 30-50 trials each day during training and 100 trials on the recording day. The training lasted two to three weeks until animals reached a 70% success rate with a 5-second window. Animals were recorded the day after criterion was reached for 100 trials.</p>

<title>Active avoidance (Photometry)</title>
<p>Active avoidance was performed in a 14â W x 7â D x 12â H metal rectangular shuttle box (Coulbourn Instruments, Holliston, MA) divided into two equal compartments by Plexiglas semi-partitions. Animals were habituated to the chamber for at least 30 minutes, the day before training. On the first day, animals received five five-second habituation tones and two Pavlovian conditionings (a seven-second tone and a two-second shock at the last two-seconds of tone) prior to avoidance trials. The same frequency and amplitude of tone were used for habituation tones, Pavlovian tones, and avoidance tones (12 kHz or 8 kHz at 70-80 dB, counterbalancing between approach and avoidance). After habituation and Pavlovian trials, the task was switched to avoidance trials where animals could prevent the shock by crossing the chamber within 5 seconds from the onset of the tone. Otherwise, an electrical foot shock (0.3 mA) would be delivered through the grid floor for a 2-second maximum before the animal crossed the chamber to escape the shock. The tone was terminated when animals crossed the chamber or after 7 seconds. The inter-trial interval was pseudo-randomized for an average of 40 seconds. Animals performed 100 avoidance trials per day for two to three days or until reaching 70% successful rate. Photometry data was recorded during training.</p>

<title>Active avoidance with 10% shortened and extended tones (Photometry)</title>
<p>After active avoidance recording, animals were then recorded in an alternative version of active avoidance with 10% shortened and extended tones. The only change in this alternative version was to include 10% trials with shortened tones which were turned off after 1.5 seconds regardless, and 10% trials with extended tones, which were extended for 1.5 seconds after successful avoidance. The shortened and extended trials were selected pseudo-randomly at 10% chance for each trial. No shock was delivered in any shortened-tone and extended-tone trials.</p>

<title>Optogenetics</title>
<p>In the behavioral experiment, two external FC-FC optic fiber patch cords (200 Î¼m diameter, 0.22 NA, Doric Lenses, Quebec, Canada) were connected to two implanted fibers, respectively, each with a zirconia sleeve. These patch cords were then connected to a 1x2 fiber-optic rotary joint (FRJ_1x2i_FC-2FC_0.22, Doric Lenses, Quebec, Canada) for unrestricted rotation and to prevent tangling. Another FC-FC optic fiber patch cord was used to connect the rotary joint to a 100 mW 594 nm diode-pumped solid-state laser (Cobolt Mambo<sup>TM</sup> 100 594nm, HÃBNER Photonics, Sweden) for optogenetic stimulation. The power of the laser was programmed by the software and fine-tuned by a continuous filter (NDC-50C-2M, Thorlabs, NJ, USA) to 10 mW at the end of the patch cord (â¼71.59 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> at the end of the implanted fiber). The stimulation timing was controlled by a shutter (SRS470, Stanford Research System, Sunnyvale, CA) and a Master-8 stimulus generator (A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel). In avoidance and approach, a total of 72 trials were divided into 12 alternating blocks (OFF-ON-OFFâ¦), and 2-second continuous stimulation was delivered 0.5 seconds after the onset of a tone during stimulation blocks. In the open field test, a 32-minute test was divided into eight alternating stimulation blocks (OFF-ON-OFFâ¦), and a 2-second continuous stimulation was delivered every 40 seconds during the stimulation blocks.</p>
<p>For optogenetics animals, eight experimental and five controls were tested in the following order: open field test under dim light, reward approach, active avoidance, open field test under bright light.</p>

<p>A 26 W x 48 L x 21 H (cm) clean rectangular rat homecage with mouse homecage bedding placed in a sound-proof box (MedAssociates, Fairfax, VT) lit by a red LED strip was used for an open field test. Mice were first habituated with their cagemates, food, and water in the arena for an hour the day before testing. During the test, food and water were removed from the arena, and each mouse was tested individually.

<title>Perfusion and Histology Verification</title>
<p>After experiments, animals were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital at a dose of 90 mg/kg and perfused with 20 ml PBS, followed by 20 ml 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Brains were soaked in 4 Â°C 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 hours and then switched to 30% sucrose solution for 20-40 hours until the brains sank. Brains were sectioned coronally (40-50 Î¼m) with a freezing microtome and then washed with PBS and mounted with PVA-DABCO.

<title>Open field test analysis</title>
<p>Mouse speed was first grouped into three clusters, nonmovement, low movement, and high movement, using k-means. The movement threshold was thus defined by the lowest speed of the low movement cluster. Then the peak speed of the movement was detected by finding local maxima with absolute peak value larger than a threshold and at least 5 cm/s larger than the baseline. (This was performed using <italic>findpeak</italic> function in MATLAB and with âMinPeakProminence âset to 5 and with âMinPeakHeight âset to movement threshold.) Movement initiation was defined by when the speed first went above 10% of the peak speed within 2 seconds before the epoch. Only epochs with at least 1 second of less than threshold speed before movement initiation were included. Group photometry analyses compared mean ÎF/F 4 to 2 seconds before and 2 seconds around the peak speed of the movement. Optogenetic analyses compared speed differences of NpHR- and eYFP-expressing mice between mean speed during the 2-second stimulation period and mean speed at the 2-second period right before stimulation.</p>

<title>Movement Detection</title>
<p>Movement epochs in habituation and inter-trial intervals in avoidance tasks were detected by finding local maxima with absolute peak value larger than 10 cm/s and at least 3 cm/s larger than the baseline in smoothed speed traces. This was performed using <italic>findpeak</italic> function in MATLAB and with âMinPeakProminence âset to 3 and with âMinPeakHeight âset to 10. The speed traces were smoothed with Gaussian-weighted moving average with a window of seven frames by MATLAB function <italic>smoothdata</italic> before the movement epoch detection. (The video was recorded in 15 frames per second). The movement was excluded if it happened within 5 seconds after another movement. Habituation was defined as the time starting from when the animals were placed in the chamber to the start of the first Pavlovian conditioning trials on the first day of training.</p>
<p>Movement in the intertrial intervals was measured from 5 seconds after the end of the trial to 5 seconds before the start of the next trial in a well-learned session. Movement initiation was defined by when the speed first went above 10% of the peak speed within 2 seconds before the epoch.</p>

<title>Group Optogenetic Speed and Crossing Probabilities Analysis</title>
<p>Optogenetic speed analyses compared speed differences of NpHR- and eYFP-expressing mice during the 2-second stimulation period (0.5 seconds to 2.5 seconds from the tone onset) in stimulation trials to the same period in non-stimulation trials. Trials in which animals crossed before 0.5 seconds after tone onset or before the laser stimulation onset were excluded from speed analyses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 D-E</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H-I</xref> and <xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âFigure Supplement A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). To plot a histogram of crossing probabilities under optogenetic stimulation, we first binned the crossing latency of all trials into 0.25-second bins ranging from 0 to 7 seconds and then normalized by the total number of trials to obtain crossing probability. Optogenetic crossing probability analyses compared differences between NpHR- and eYFP-expressing mice in crossing probability during the 2-second stimulation period (0.5 seconds to 2.5 seconds from the tone onset) in stimulation trials to non-stimulation trials.</p>

<title>Freezing Detection</title>
<p>Freezing is detected from video based on changes in pixels by a MATLAB function written by David A. Bulkin and Ryan J. Post. To detect the freezing of animals, we used the code first to convert the video into grayscale, crop the window to include only the bottom of the chamber, and then set the pixels belonging to a mouse to 1 s by thresholding pixel values below 27 out of 255. Once the pixels belonging to a mouse were assigned, the code compared the number of pixels changed between frames to get raw movement data. Raw movement data was then filtered with a bandpass filter between 0.01 and 0.9 to ensure the frequency of switching between freezing and non-freezing states matches with the behavior observed. Freezing was then marked when less than 190 mouse pixels were changed in filtered movement data. For <xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âFigure Supplement H</xref>, duration of freezing was calculated by the total number of frames when the animals were detected freezing during avoidance latency.</p>

<title>Cross-covariance between photometry signals and speed</title>
<p>Photometry signals were first filtered by a lowpass IIR filter with half-power frequency at 7 Hz and then interpolated to match video recording timeframes (15 Hz). Each segment included photometry and speed data from 5 seconds after tone offset to 5 seconds before the next tone onset. Cross-covariance was calculated with an offset of Â± 2 seconds for each segment by the <italic>xcov</italic> function in MATLAB.

<title>Linear regression model</title>
<p>The calcium signal was modeled as a linear combination of characteristic neural responses to each sensory or action event following the scheme of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Musall et al. (2019)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Parker et al. (2016)</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Parker et al., 2016</xref>). These events included tone onset, tone offset, avoidance, escape, shock onset, and chamber crossing in the intertrial intervals. The model can be written as the following equation, where ÎF/F (t) is the recorded calcium dynamics at time t, k<sub>i</sub> and j<sub>i</sub> are the kernel coefficients of event type I, 1 is the relative time points in a kernel, n1 is the total number of action events, and n2 is the total number of sensory events. Each event kernel k<sub>a</sub> or j<sub>b</sub> was placed at the time point where the event a or b occurred. For action events, including avoidance, escape, and chamber crossing in intertrial intervals, we used kernels (k<sub>i</sub>) ranging from 1 second before to 2 seconds after the event to cover the action from initiation to termination. For sensory events, including tone onsets, tone offsets, and shock onsets, kernels (j<sub>i</sub>) started right at the moment where the event happened and lasted for 2 seconds afterwards to model the sensory responses.
<disp-formula id="eqn2">

</disp-formula>
ÎF/F (t) was modeled as the linear combination of all event kernels. Given the event occurrence time points of all event types, we can use linear regression to decompose characteristic kernels for each event type. Kernel coefficients of the model were solved by minimizing the mean square errors between the model and the actual recorded signals. To prove that kernel k<sub>i</sub> is an essential component for the raw calcium dynamics, we compared the explanation power of the full model to the reduced model where the time points of the occurrence of event k<sub>i</sub> were randomly assigned. Thus, the kernel coefficients should not reflect the response to the event in the reduced model. The coefficients of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) were compared between the reduced model and the full model to estimate the unique contribution of certain events to the explanation power of the model.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study extends our understanding of how the medial prefrontal cortex regulates flexible action during adversity. The data provide <bold>compelling</bold> evidence of a role for prefrontal PV neuron activity in active avoidance. This builds on the general idea that these neurons play a role in flexible behavior and demonstrates this in the context of freezing/avoidance conflict. The overall findings contribute to our understanding of mechanisms that support aversively motivated instrumental learning and may provide insight into both stress vulnerability and resilience processes. This work will be of interest to those interested in learning, aversive motivation, interneuron and/or prefrontal cortex function, or conditions relates to these processes and mechanisms.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study examined the role of a prefrontal cortex cell type in active avoidance behavior. The authors conduct a series of behavioral experiments incorporating fiber photometry and optogenetic silencing. The results indicate that prefrontal parvalbumin (PV) neurons play a permissive role in performing signaled active avoidance learning, for which details are sorely lacking. Notably, infralimbic parvalbumin activity resolves incompatible defensive responses to threat by suppressing conditional freezing in order to permit active instrumental controlling responses. The overall findings provide a significant contribution to our understanding of mechanisms that support aversively motivated instrumental learning and may provide insight into both stress vulnerability and resilience processes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The writing and presentation of data is clear. The authors use a number of temporally-relevant methods and analyses that identify a novel prefrontal mechanism in resolving the conflict between competing actions (freezing vs escape avoidance). The authors conduct an extensive number of experiments to demonstrate that the uncovered prefrontal mechanism is selective for the initiation of avoidance under threat circumstances, not reward settings or general features of movement.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study exclusively focuses on parvalbumin cells, thus questions remain whether the present findings are specific to parvalbumin or applicable to other prefrontal interneuron subtypes. The exact mechanisms that coordinate infralimbic parvalbumin cell activity and threat avoidance behavior are not explored.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here the authors study the role of parvalbumin (PV) expressing neurons in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) of mice in active avoidance behavior using fiber photometry and optogenetic inhibition.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The methods are appropriate, the experiments are well done, and the results are all consistent with the conceptual model in which vmPFC PV neurons inhibit freezing to enable avoidance movements. There are good controls to rule out a role for cue offset in triggering changes in PV neuron activity, or for a nonspecific role of vmPFC PV neurons in movement initiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although potential mechanisms, i.e., the impact of PV neuron activity on the broader circuit, are discussed, they are not directly examined here. There is some discordance between changes in neural activity and behavior: in Figure 4C, the relationship between PV neuron activity and movement emerges almost immediately during learning, but successful active avoidance emerges much more gradually. Again, this is discussed and plausible explanations for this discrepancy are provided.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additional Discussion Points</p>
<p>(1) There is not much exploration of potential mechanisms, i.e., the impact of PV neuron activity on the broader circuit. Additionally, the study exclusively focuses on PV cells and does not explore the role of other prefrontal populations, particularly those known to respond to cueevoked fear states. The discussion should consider how PV activity might impact the broader circuit and whether the present findings are specific to PV cells or applicable to other interneuron subtypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added an extensive discussion of potential mechanisms and the potential contributions of other interneuron subtypes:</p>
<p>âFor example, PV neurons aid in improving visual discrimination through sharpening response selectivity in visual cortex (Lee et al., 2012). In prefrontal cortex, PV neurons are critical for task performance, particularly during performance of tasks that require flexible behavior such as rule shift learning (Cho et al., 2020) and reward extinction (Sparta et al., 2014). Further, PV neurons play an essential role in the generation of cortical gamma rhythms, which contribute to synchronization of selective populations of pyramidal neurons (Sohal et al., 2009; Cardin et al., 2009). Courtin et al (2014) showed that brief suppression of dorsomedial prefrontal (dmPFC) PV neural activity enhanced fear expression, one of the main functions of the dmPFC, by synchronizing the spiking activity of dmPFC pyramidal neurons (Courtin et al., 2014). This result is potentially relevant to our findings, but likely involves different circuit mechanisms because of the difference in timescale, targeted area, and downstream projection targets (Vertes, 2004). These and other studies support the idea that PV neural activity supports the execution of a behavior by shaping rather than suppressing cortical activity, potentially by selecting among conflicting behaviors by the synchronization of different pyramidal populations (Warden et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2014).</p>
<p>The roles of other inhibitory neural subtypes (such as somatostatin (SOM)-expressing and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing IL GABA neurons) in avoidance behavior are currently unknown, but are likely important given the role of SOM neurons in gamma-band synchronization (Veit et al., 2017), and the role of VIP neurons in regulating PV and SOM neural activity (Cardin, 2018).â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) There is some discordance between changes in neural activity and behavior. For example, in Figure 4C, the relationship between PV neuron activity and movement emerges almost immediately during learning, but successful active avoidance emerges much more gradually. Why is this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added extensive text to the discussion that addresses this issue:</p>
<p>âInterestingly, the rise in IL PV neural activity during movement does not require avoidance learning. IL PV neurons begin to respond during movement immediately after the animal has received a single shock in an environment, but learning to cross the chamber to avoid the signaled shock takes tens of trials. Why is there a discordance between the emergence of the IL PV signal during movement and avoidance learning?</p>
<p>The components underlying active avoidance have been debated over the years, but are thought to involve at least two essential behaviors â suppressing freezing, and moving to safety (LeDoux et al., 2017). Freezing is the default response of mice upon hearing a shock-predicting tone, and can be learned in a single trial (Ledoux, 1996; Fanselow, 2010; Zambetti et al., 2022). When a predator is in the distance, freezing can increase the chance of survival by reducing the chances of detection. However, a strategic avoidance behavior may prevent a future encounter with the predator altogether. The importance of IL PV neural activity in defensive behavior may be to suppress reactive defensive behaviors such as freezing in order to permit a flexible goaldirected response to threat.</p>
<p>The freezing suppression and avoidance movement components of the avoidance response are dissociable, both because freezing precedes avoidance learning, and because animals intermittently move prior to avoidance learning. Our finding that the rise in PV activity during movement emerges immediately after receiving a single shock, tens of trials before animals have learned the avoidance behavior, suggests that the IL PV signal is associated with the suppression of freezing. Further, IL PV neurons do not respond during movement toward cued rewards because in reward-based tasks there is no freezing response in conflict with reward approach behavior.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) vmPFC was defined here as including the infralimbic (IL) and dorsal peduncular (DP) regions. While the role of IL has been frequently characterized for motivated behavior, relatively few studies have examined DP. Perhaps the authors are just being cautious, given the challenges involved in the viral targeting of the IL region without leakage to nearby regions such as DP. But since the optical fibers were positioned above the IL region, it is possible that DP did not contribute much to either the fiber photometry signals or the effects of the optogenetic manipulations. Perhaps DP should be completely omitted, which is more consistent with the definitions of vmPFC in the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we included DP to be cautious as our viral expression sometimes leaks into DP, though the optic fiber targets IL. We have replaced vmPFC with IL throughout the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In the Discussion, the authors should consider why PV cells exhibit increased activity during both movement initiation and successful chamber crossing during avoidance. While the functional contribution of the PV signal during movement initiation was tested with optogenetic inhibition, some discussion on the possible role of the additional PV signal during chamber crossing is of interest readers who are intrigued by the signaling of two events. Is the chamber crossing signal related to successful avoidance or learned safety (e.g., see Sangha, Diehl, Bergstrom, Drew 2020)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>IL PV neural activity starts to increase at movement initiation, peaks at chamber crossing (when movement speed is highest), and decreases after chamber crossing (Figure 1E). Thus, the increase in PV neural activity at movement initiation and at chamber crossing are different phases of the same event.</p>
<p>We think this signal is unlikely to be a safety signal, and have added text to the discussion to clarify this issue:</p>
<p>âWe think the IL PV signal is unlikely to be a safety signal (Sangha et al., 2020). First, the PV signal rises during movement not only in the avoidance context, but during any movement in a âthreateningâ context (i.e. a context where the animal has been shocked). For example, PV neural activity rises during movement during the intertrial interval in the avoidance task. Further, the emergence of the PV signal during movement happens quickly â after the first shock â and significantly before the animal has learned to move to the safe zone. This suggests a close association with enabling movement in a threatening environment, when animals must suppress a freezing response in order to move. Additionally, the rise in PV activity was specifically associated with movement and not with tone offset, the indicator of safety in this task. Finally, if IL PV neural activity reflects safety signals one would expect the response to be enhanced by learning, but the amplitude of the IL PV response was unaffected by learning after the first shock.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The primary conclusion here that PV cells control the fear response should be considered within the context of prior findings by the Herry laboratory. Courtin et al (2014) demonstrated a select role of prefrontal PV cells in the regulation of fear states, accomplished through their control over prefrontal output to the basolateral amygdala. The observations in this paper, which used both ChR2 and Arch-T to address the impact of vmPFC PV activity on reactive behavior, are highly relevant to issues raised both in the Introduction and Discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Courtin et al (2014)âs finding is very important. We did not discuss this paper originally because Courtin et al. is about dmPFC, which has a different role in fear processing than IL/vmPFC. We have added text about this finding to the discussion:</p>
<p>âCourtin et al (2014) showed that brief suppression of dorsomedial prefrontal (dmPFC) PV neural activity enhanced fear expression, one of the main functions of the dmPFC, by synchronizing the spiking activity of dmPFC pyramidal neurons (Courtin et al., 2014). This result is potentially relevant to our findings, but likely involves different circuit mechanisms because of the difference in timescale, targeted area, and downstream projection targets (Vertes, 2004).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additional analyses</p>
<p>(1) As avoidance trials progress (particularly on days 2 and 3), do PFC PV responses attenuate? That is, does continued unreinforced tone presentations lead to reduced reliance of PV cellmediated suppression in order for successful avoidance to occur?</p>

<p>We added Figure 1âFigure supplement 1M and 1N and a sentence on page 5: âIL PV neural activity during the avoidance movement was not attenuated by learning or repeated reinforcement (Figure 1âFigure supplement 1M and N, N = 8 mice, p = 0.8886, 1-way ANOVA).â We only included data from days 1 and 2, since we started to introduce short and long tone trials on day 3 which might interfere.</p>

<p>(2) In Figure 3D, it would be very informative and further support the claim of &quot;no role for movement during reward&quot; if the response of these cells during the &quot;initiation of movement during reward-approach&quot; was shown (similar to Figure 1F for threat avoidance).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the question. We added Figure 3âFigure supplement 1B and C to show IL PV neural activity aligned to initiation of movement during reward-approach. IL PV activity decreased after movement initiation for reward approach (N = 6 mice, p=0.0382, paired t-test). This further solidifies our claim that IL PV neuron activity only increases for threat avoidance.</p>

<p>(1) Fig1G shows the average response of PV cells during chamber crossing on an animal-toanimal basis. It would be informative to also see a similar plot for movement initiation.</p>

<p>We have added the suggested figure in Figure 1âFigure supplement 1B.</p>

<p>(2) In the Results section (Page 5), there is a small issue with the logic. It says: &quot;As vmPFC inactivation impairs avoidance behavior, the activity of inhibitory vmPFC PV neurons might be predicted to be low during successful avoidance trials.&quot; As opposed to &quot;low&quot;, it should say &quot;high&quot;, right? If inhibition impairs avoidance, then high responding by these cells would be presumed to drive the avoidance response, as supported by your findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have re-worded the text in this section. Based on prior findings that IL inactivation impairs avoidance (Moscarello et al., 2013), we predicted that inhibitory PV neurons would be less active during avoidance, because activating these neurons could suppress IL. However, we found that they were selectively active during avoidance.</p>

<p>(3) In the caption/legend for Fig1E, it says that the &quot;black ticks&quot; indicate &quot;tone onset&quot;. But it should say &quot;movement initiation&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this error. The ticks do indicate tone onset, and we have corrected the figure to reflect this.</p>

<p>(5) It would be useful to provide some (perhaps speculative) explanation for the discordance between the PV activity-movement relationship and success of active avoidance in Fig. 4C</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added text to the discussion that addresses this issue:</p>
<p>âInterestingly, the rise in IL PV neural activity during movement does not require avoidance learning. IL PV neurons begin to respond during movement immediately after the animal has received a single shock in an environment, but learning to cross the chamber to avoid the signaled shock takes tens of trials. Why is there a discordance between the emergence of the IL PV signal during movement and avoidance learning?</p>
<p>The components underlying active avoidance have been debated over the years, but are thought to involve at least two essential behaviors â suppressing freezing, and moving to safety (LeDoux et al., 2017). Freezing is the default response of mice upon hearing a shock-predicting tone, and can be learned in a single trial (Ledoux, 1996; Fanselow, 2010; Zambetti et al., 2022). When a predator is in the distance, freezing can increase the chance of survival by reducing the chances of detection. However, a strategic avoidance behavior may prevent a future encounter with the predator altogether. The importance of IL PV neural activity in defensive behavior may be to suppress reactive defensive behaviors such as freezing in order to permit a flexible goaldirected response to threat.</p>
<p>The freezing suppression and avoidance movement components of the avoidance response are dissociable, both because freezing precedes avoidance learning, and because animals intermittently move prior to avoidance learning. Our finding that the rise in PV activity during movement emerges immediately after receiving a single shock, tens of trials before animals have learned the avoidance behavior, suggests that the IL PV signal is associated with the suppression of freezing. Further, IL PV neurons do not respond during movement toward cued rewards because in reward-based tasks there is no freezing response in conflict with reward approach behavior.â</p>

<p>(6) I don't really understand what is shown in Figure 4D -- exactly what time points does this represent? Was habituation performed everyday?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 4D shows data from the approach task, not the avoidance task. This data is from welltrained mice, not the first day of training on this task. There was a pre-task recording period every day.</p>

<p>(7) Why was optogenetic inhibition only delivered from 0.5-2.5 sec after the tone cue?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We wanted to avoid any possibility that perception of the tone would be disrupted, so we delayed the onset of optogenetic inhibition. We chose 0.5 sec onset because animals typically begin to move ~1 second after tone onset.</p>

<p>(8) The regression analysis with shuffled time points is not well explained -- some additional methodological details are needed (Fig. 2H).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the following to the methods section to provide a clearer explanation:</p>
<p>âDF/F (t) was modeled as the linear combination of all event kernels. Given the event occurrence time points of all event types, we can use linear regression to decompose characteristic kernels for each event type. Kernel coefficients of the model were solved by minimizing the mean square errors between the model and the actual recorded signals. To prove that kernel ki is an essential component for the raw calcium dynamics, we compared the explanation power of the full model to the reduced model where the time points of the occurrence of event ki were randomly assigned. Thus, the kernel coefficients should not reflect the response to the event in the reduced model.</p>
