<title>Abstract</title><p>Saliva is essential for oral health. The molecular mechanisms leading to physiological fluid secretion are largely established, but factors that underlie secretory hypofunction, specifically related to the autoimmune disease Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) are not fully understood. A major conundrum is the lack of association between the severity of inflammatory immune cell infiltration within the salivary glands and glandular hypofunction. In this study, we investigated in a mouse model system, mechanisms of glandular hypofunction caused by the activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. Glandular hypofunction and SS-like disease were induced by treatment with 5,6-Dimethyl-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), a small molecule agonist of murine STING. Contrary to our expectations, despite a significant reduction in fluid secretion in DMXAA-treated mice, <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging demonstrated that neural stimulation resulted in greatly enhanced spatially averaged cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Notably, however, the spatiotemporal characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were altered to signals that propagated throughout the entire cytoplasm as opposed to largely apically confined Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises observed without treatment. Despite the augmented Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, muscarinic stimulation resulted in reduced activation of TMEM16a, although there were no changes in channel abundance or absolute sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, super-resolution microscopy revealed a disruption in the intimate colocalization of Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels in relation to TMEM16a. TMEM16a channel activation was also reduced when intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering was increased. These data are consistent with altered local coupling between the channels contributing to the reduced activation of TMEM16a. Appropriate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is also pivotal for mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics and secretion is an energetically expensive process. Disrupted mitochondrial morphology, a depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced oxygen consumption rate were observed in DMXAA-treated animals compared to control animals. We report that early in SS disease, dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals lead to decreased fluid secretion and disrupted mitochondrial function contributing to salivary gland hypofunction and likely the progression of SS disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Saliva plays crucial roles in oral health, including lubricating the mouth, maintaining pH balance, defense against microorganisms, aiding taste, and initiating digestion of macronutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Saliva is produced primarily by three major salivary glands; the submandibular gland (SMG), parotid gland (PG), sublingual gland (SLG), and some minor glands in the lower lip, tongue, and cheek. Saliva is generated in secretory acinar cells, with its content adjusted by ducts before reaching the mouth. The acinar cells are fundamental to the production of the primary salivary secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The fluid secretion process is driven by the trans-epithelial movement of Cl<sup>-</sup> across acinar cells. To accomplish vectorial movement of Cl<sup>-</sup>, acinar cells are polarized such that the basolateral plasma membrane (PM) faces the interstitium and is adjacent to blood vessels, while the apical PM forms a lumen with the distinct PM regions physically segregated by tight-junctional complexes. At the basolateral PM, Cl<sup>-</sup> are transported into the acinar cell cytoplasm against their electrochemical gradient <italic>via</italic> the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter, (NKCC1). Following mastication or the experience of the taste and the smell of food, the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh) is released from parasympathetic nerves and acts on muscarinic receptors on the basolateral PM. Activated muscarinic receptors promote the production of inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), and subsequently Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores <italic>via</italic> IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs) situated in the ER in the extreme apical aspects of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activates a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel named TMEM16a that allows Cl<sup>-</sup> to move through the apical PM to the ductal lumen which is continuous with the salivary intercalated duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In turn, Na<sup>+</sup> moves through the paracellular space to balance the Cl<sup>-</sup> and water follows osmotically both paracellularly and through the water channel aquaporin5 (AQP5) to generate the primary saliva(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of saliva is underappreciated in the absence of hypofunction. Reduced salivary secretion is termed xerostomia and can result from the iatrogenic effects of drugs, as collateral damage to salivary glands following radiotherapy for malignancy in the head and neck area, and commonly in Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). SS is a chronic autoimmune disorder, that is predominantly manifested as profound dry eye and dry mouth as ultimately the immune system targets and destroys lacrimal and salivary gland cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). SS can occur independently (primary SS, pSS) or concurrently with diseases such as arthritis or lupus (secondary SS, sSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). SS affects millions of people, predominantly females in their fourth and fifth decades of life. While treatments can alleviate symptoms, there is no cure or intervention to halt its progression. The etiology of SS remains largely unresolved, but it’s believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, hormonal, and possibly viral factors, causing an aberrant immune response directed against the exocrine glands. The identification of SS usually is scored by the extent of salivary hypofunction, the degree of immune infiltration, evidence of damage to minor salivary glands observed following biopsy, and the presence of autoantibodies, such as anti-SSA (Ro) and Anti-SSB (La) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) which are classically found in SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Notably, however, in the early phases of SS, there is minor immune infiltration and little overt damage to exocrine tissue despite profound hypofunction. Provocatively, these data indicate that loss of secretory tissue <italic>per se</italic> is not the causative event resulting in dryness early in the disease, and further indicates that a defect in the stimulus-secretion coupling mechanism precedes glandular destruction and possibly contributes to the progression of the disease.</p>
<p>Over the years, numerous mouse models both genetic and “induced” have been developed to study the pathogenesis of SS, with each exhibiting specific aspects of the human condition, including glandular dysfunction, autoantibody production, and lymphocytic infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). To investigate the early events in SS, we concentrated on an SS model induced by the activation of the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway. This is thought to mirror the molecular response to bacterial/viral infection. STING is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a crucial role in the innate immune response, especially against DNA viruses and intracellular bacteria. Activation of STING occurs upon sensing cytosolic DNA as a result of cell damage or from microbial origin following infection. When cytosolic DNA is detected, it is first recognized by a sensor molecule called cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase). Binding to DNA prompts cGAS to generate cGAMP (cyclic GMP-AMP), which, in turn, binds to and activates STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Once STING is activated, it undergoes a series of transformations that ultimately result in the transcription of type I interferon genes, especially interferon-β (IFN-β) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The production of type I interferons is a primary antiviral response and a significant characteristic of SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). STING can be activated pharmacologically by exposure to 5,6-Dimethyl-9-oxo-9<italic>H</italic>-xanthene-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), which faithfully reproduces the immune response observed following physiological STING activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the early events in the initiation of SS-like disease that lead to salivary gland hypo-function using the DMXAA SS model. We first utilized <italic>in vivo</italic> intravital imaging to investigate any potential dysregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the DMXAA-induced SS mouse model. Paradoxically, the spatially averaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels achieved following neural stimulation in mice treated with DMXAA were enhanced despite significantly reduced fluid secretion. Notably, however, the stereotypical spatial characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal were disrupted. Downstream of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, the activity of the TMEM16a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl channel stimulated by muscarinic secretagogues was reduced, despite no changes in the abundance or localization of the protein or absolute sensitivity to activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The intimate localization of IP<sub>3</sub>R and TMEM16a was however disrupted, contributing to the reduced activity of TMEM16a upon agonist stimulation as local peripheral coupling between channels is disrupted. Moreover, we observed disordered mitochondrial morphology, abundance, and function in the disease model. These data suggest that early in SS, reduced fluid secretion occurs because of a defect in the secretagogue activation of Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion. Further significant mitochondrial dysfunction is evident, possibly as a result of the aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that may contribute to the dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and/or progression of SS disease.</p>

<title>Saliva secretion is attenuated in both SMG and PG in the SS mouse model</title>
<p>Activation of the STING pathway in mice has been established as a model for the initiation of SS. This pathway is normally activated following exposure to foreign nucleic acids and is thought to mimic exposure of cells to DNA/RNA from viruses and bacteria. Activation of this pathway in salivary glands is characterized by initiation of a type-1 interferon response, mild immune cell infiltration, and a marked loss of saliva secretion without obvious morphological damage and therefore mimics the early clinical manifestations of SS disease. Thus, to investigate the early cellular events in acinar cells during the initiation of SS in mice, we chose to pharmacologically activate this pathway using DMXAA, a STING pathway agonist. As described in Methods, DMXAA (or control solution) was administered on day 0 and day 21 of the experimental timeline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunofluorescent staining in sliced SMG tissue indicated that STING protein was increased in SMG in the DMXAA-treated mouse on day 28, seven days after the final DMXAA administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">supplementary Figure 1</xref>) confirming the activation of the STING pathway. Whole saliva production from the major salivary glands was evaluated on day 28 following systemic stimulation with the muscarinic receptor agonist, pilocarpine. To avoid potential weight-related variations in saliva secretion, the total saliva output was normalized to the individual mouse’s body weight. Notably, the average saliva production was reduced from 130.1± 48.96 mg in vehicle-treated mice to 63.71± 30.41 mg in DMXAA-treated mice, a reduction in saliva production of 48.97% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Consequently, DMXAA treatment resulted in 51.99% saliva production compared to vehicle-treated mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, H&amp;E staining indicated that mild immune infiltration was observed in the DMXAA-treated mice with no overt changes to the morphology of the gland (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The mass of the SMG was also not significantly different in DMXAA vs. vehicle-treated animals, consistent with no loss of secretory tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that DMXAA-treated mice exhibit characteristics of early-stage SS and could be a useful model for investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying secretory dysfunction and advancing our understanding of the disease’s progression.</p>

</fig>
<p>To further investigate the individual relative contribution of the SMG and PG to the decrease in total saliva secretion using a more physiological stimulation paradigm, we performed experiments where the nerve bundle innervating a particular gland was electrically stimulated and saliva secretion quantitated. Previous research in our lab has established the range and parameters for physiological stimulation of secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The production of saliva was significantly diminished in DMXAA-treated animals compared with vehicle controls at stimulation frequencies of 7 and 10 Hz in SMG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) and at 5, 7, and 10 Hz in the PG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). These findings confirm that activation of the STING pathway reduces the function of both SMG and PG, consistent with the diminished production of whole saliva. Notably, the reduction in function of PG, the gland responsible for the majority of stimulated saliva secretion, was relatively greater than in SMG.</p>

<title>Altered spatiotemporal characteristics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the SS mouse model</title>
<p>An increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays a central role in regulating the cellular machinery underlying the fluid secretion mechanism. In particular, as noted, an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> is important for the activation of ion channels localized in particular domains of the polarized acinar cell which play a central role in saliva secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Given that the precise spatiotemporal characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in salivary acinar cells are thought to be fundamental to the appropriate activation of the fluid secretion machinery, we evaluated whether hypofunction following DMXAA treatment resulted from dysregulation of the stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Previous research in our lab developed a platform to study Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> using Multiphoton (MP) imaging in transgenic mice engineered to express a genetic-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, GCaMP6f, specifically in acinar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The protocol for STING pathway induction was applied to the Mist1<sup>CreERT+/-</sup>GCaMP6f<sup>+/-</sup> genetic mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Salivary gland function was assessed by the amount of pilocarpine-induced saliva secretion. The secretion deficiency observed in wild-type mice was recapitulated in these mice from a different genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). We reasoned that decreased fluid secretion could result from reduced or dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in DMXAA-treated mice. Therefore, next, we compared the spatially averaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal evoked by direct nerve stimulation in DMXAA-treated vs. vehicle control animals <italic>in vivo</italic> in SMG. SMG were stimulated at frequencies optimum for fluid secretion (1-10 Hz) for 10 seconds and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were recorded. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> are standard deviation (SD)-projection images visualizing the spatial and amplitude changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> throughout the field of view during the entire period of stimulation at the indicated frequencies. In vehicle-treated mice, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at low stimulus strengths occurred in a minority of the cells and predominantly propagated below the apical PM. As the stimulation strength increased, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals became more pronounced, and more acinar cells responded. Strikingly, acinar cells in DMXAA-treated mice demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to stimulation. At lower stimulation strengths, a larger number of acinar cells responded, and the spatially averaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in these cells were notably larger when compared to those in the control group. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> shows a time series of images following 7 Hz stimulation. This augmented response was manifested as an elevated maximum peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), shorter latency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), and larger area under the curve (AUC) during stimulation in DMXAA-treated animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition to the absolute magnitude of the spatially averaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, the subcellular spatial characteristics of the stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise are also important for appropriate stimulation of fluid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals stimulated following nervous stimulation in SMG are invariably initiated in the extreme apical pole of acinar cells and subsequently establish a standing gradient that dissipates rapidly to result in apically confined signals that do not substantially propagate to the basal aspects of the cell following physiological stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). We therefore investigated if the spatial characteristics of stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were altered in DMXAA-treated animals. SD image projections generated during the period of stimulation demonstrated that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase was tightly localized below the apical PM within the acinar cells in the vehicle-treated animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). However, in the DMXAA-treated animals, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> exhibited a more global distribution through the entire cell cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was visualized <italic>via</italic> line-scan plots revealing the temporal alterations along a line extending from the apical PM to the basolateral PM, traversing the nucleus, over time within an acinar cell. A significant [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation was evident at the basolateral aspects of the acinar cell in the DMXAA-treated animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) when compared to the vehicle-treated control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). As shown in the kinetic plots, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the apical region is greater in DMXAA-treated mice compared to the vehicle-treated mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Moreover, a significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was observed in the extreme basal region of the cell in DMXAA but not in vehicle-treated animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). The comparison of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal ratios at the apical versus basolateral PM indicated the most significant globalization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal occurred at 10 Hz stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>) which corresponds to the stimulation strength that results in maximal fluid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). In total, these data demonstrate that the magnitude of the spatially averaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, together with the spatiotemporal characteristics of the signal are altered in the DMXAA-treated animals, but that these changes can not readily account for the reduction in fluid secretion observed.</p>

<title>Secretagogue stimulated TMEM16a activity is suppressed in the SS mouse model</title>
<p>The rate-limiting step for the secretion of fluid is the activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, TMEM16a. We considered that a reduction in fluid secretion could conceptually occur by a reduction or mislocalization of TMEM16a protein, or by compromised muscarinic receptor-stimulated activation of the channel. Western blotting indicated the TMEM16a protein expression was comparable between the vehicle and SS mouse models (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). In addition, immunolocalization using confocal microscopy demonstrated that TMEM16a localization remained largely unchanged in the SS mouse model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, a decrease in protein expression or mislocalization of the protein does not result in a reduction in stimulated saliva secretion. We next investigated whether the activation of this ion channel was compromised in DMXAA-treated animals using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. In the absence of stimulation, no Cl<sup>-</sup> currents were observed in either vehicle or DMXAA animals following either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of −50 mV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In the presence of 1 μM of muscarinic agonist Carbachol (CCh), robust Cl<sup>-</sup> currents were measured in acini prepared from vehicle-treated animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), which were greatly reduced in DMXAA-treated animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Reduced CCh-stimulated Cl<sup>-</sup> currents could potentially occur because of altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of TMEM16a following disruption of the spatial characteristics of the stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Theoretically, it is also possible that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the immediate vicinity of TMEM16a was disrupted, despite the augmented spatially averaged peak response. We therefore next tested whether TMEM16a activity stimulated directly by 0.5, 1 or 5 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the pipette solution (and thus globally in the cytoplasm) was altered in DMXAA-treated animals. Surprisingly, TMEM16a was activated to a similar extent by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the SS mouse model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). In total, our data suggest that TMEM16a abundance, localization, or activity <italic>per se</italic> are not altered and thus do not explain the significant reduction in saliva secretion in the DMXAA-treated model.</p>

<p>An alternative mechanism could be that the microdomain between the apical ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sites and the apical PM TMEM16a is disrupted in the disease model, resulting in compromised local coupling between the ER and PM channels. Therefore, we investigated how the activation TMEM16a was affected by buffering the CCh-stimulated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> with slow and fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators. EGTA is a high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer with slow kinetics, while BAPTA has much more rapid kinetics. Experimentally, BAPTA can quickly buffer Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes close to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sites and limit local activation of effectors within 20 nm. In contrast, EGTA has been shown to attenuate the rise in the bulk cytosol but is too slow to buffer local Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a restricted microdomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). In the presence of BAPTA, no CI<sup>-</sup> currents were detected in either vehicle-treated or DMXAA-treated animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). However, in the presence of the slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator, EGTA, CCH-stimulated Cl<sup>-</sup> currents were observed in acinar cells from vehicle-treated animals but were absent in the DMXAA-treated animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). These data suggest that physiologically TMEM16a is activated by local changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as a result of IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in the apical domain of the acinar cell.</p>

<p>Next, we employed STED super-resolution microscopy to closely examine the spatial relationship between apical PM TMEM16a and IP<sub>3</sub>R3 on the apical ER (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Despite the cell-cell contact distance remaining consistent in the disease model, as indicated by the distance between TMEM16a on the PM of adjacent acinar cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>), a notable increase in distance between the apical TMEM16a and IP<sub>3</sub>R3 expressed on apical ER compared to the control group was observed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). In the control mice, the distance between TMEM16a and IP<sub>3</sub>R3 was on average 84 ± 17 nm, versus 155 ± 20 nm in the SS disease mice. Similarly, the distance between IP<sub>3</sub>R3 in adjacent cells was increased from 505 ± 34 nm to 689 ± 68 nm (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>). In total, these observations support the conclusion that the reduced activity of the TMEM16a channel is attributable to the disruption of the microdomain between TMEM16a and IP<sub>3</sub>R3, such that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through the IP<sub>3</sub>R is not communicated appropriately to its effector, TMEM16a.</p>

<title>Compromised mitochondrial morphology and metabolism in the SS mouse model</title>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> modulates cellular metabolism by the intricate bidirectional interaction between the ER and mitochondria. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between ER and mitochondria is essential for optimal bioenergetics, and dysregulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> can be deleterious to mitochondrial function and alter morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The transfer of Ca<sup>2+</sup> between ER and mitochondria is dependent on the intimate physical localization of the organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Notably, aberrant mitochondrial morphology has been reported in the salivary glands of SS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). We first investigated mitochondrial abundance and morphology by immunofluorescence staining with antibodies directed against ATP5A, a component of the ATP synthesis machinery to visualize mitochondria, and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase to localize the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Using previously published methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), quantification revealed a 22.16% ± 4.95 reduction in mitochondrial numbers in the SS mouse model relative to the vehicle-treated control (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Consistent with reduced mitochondrial numbers, less area was occupied by mitochondria in DMXAA-treated acinar cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Mitochondria morphology is intricately linked to their bioenergetic status We next evaluated mitochondrial morphology by their “so-called” aspect ratio (AR) and form factor (FF) in DMXAA and vehicle-treated animals. The AR, the length of the major over minor axes of mitochondria documents the degree of fragmentation or elongation of individual mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Mitochondria exhibited an 18.35% ± 4.62 decrease in mitochondrial elongation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>) and a 20.7% ± 7.78 decrease in mitochondrial branching (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>) in the disease model compared to the vehicle-treated control condition. Importantly, these changes in mitochondrial number and morphology were not exclusive to the SMG as similar patterns were observed in the PG mitochondria, again marked by reduced mitochondrial count, increased fragmentation, and decreased branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">supplementary Figure 3A-3E</xref>).</p>

In contrast, the ER structure was disrupted in the SS disease model (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>’). At higher magnification, the coordinated ER structure was largely absent in diseased mice (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9B</xref>’), and the proximity between ER and mitochondria was disrupted (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9H</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9I</xref>).

<p>Mitochondrial morphology is a dynamic process that is intimately associated with mitochondrial bioenergetics and alterations in both, occur in response to changes in cellular status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>).Therefore, we investigated if changes in morphology might be associated with the disrupted function of mitochondria in the disease model. We measured mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>), established by the electrochemical H<sup>+</sup> gradient, which is the driving force of ATP production. Isolated SMG acinar cells were loaded with TMRE, a ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>-specific dye, and MitoTracker Green, to confirm mitochondrial localization and to facilitate the normalization of indicator loading. The maximal z-stacks projection images taken by confocal microscopy revealed colocalization of TMRE with MitoTracker Green (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>). The basal TMRE fluorescence was reduced in cells from DMXAA vs. vehicle-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplemental Figure 4</xref>).

<p>An appropriate ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> mitochondrial membrane potential is vital for maintaining bioenergetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).

We employed sequential exposure to agents that target the function of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) using Seahorse technology (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SS is a complex inflammatory disease resulting from the intersection of genetics and environmental factors. This autoimmune disorder affects exocrine glands including salivary and lacrimal glands, leading to dry mouth and dry eyes, among other symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). SS animal models are crucial for understanding the pathogenesis, progression, and potential treatments for the disease, though like many animal models of disease, none can recapitulate all the aspects of SS. Currently, SS animal models are categorized as either those derived from genetically modified mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) or those where disease is induced by specific agents or environmental factors. In the context of SS, DMXAA-induced SS can be used to mimic the early stages of the disease which might be triggered in response to bacterial or viral infection. This model is particularly effective in simulating type-1 interferon immune responses seen in early SS, which is thought to contribute to the initial glandular inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). It should also be noted that DMXAA also has been reported to inhibit NAD(P)H quinone oxireductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) and thus the potential increase in free radical load in cells could contribute to the phenotype. The rapid symptom manifestation of disease in the DMXAA-induced model offers an advantage for investigating the early development of SS disease since DMXAA induction is a temporally controlled process, allowing the precise staging of disease onset, thus facilitating studies on the initiating events and ultimately potential early intervention and prevention strategies.</p>
<p>Our studies investigated stimulus-secretion coupling when fluid secretion from SMG and PG in response to physiological stimulation was significantly reduced. Previous work has established a crucial link between an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and stimulation of fluid secretion in the salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Efficient secretion is reliant on the specific spatiotemporal regulation of secretagogue-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signals. Given this idea, our initial hypothesis was that a deficiency in secretion after DMXAA administration could be due to reduced or disrupted secretagogue-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signals. Indeed, previous work has revealed that in human SS patient acinar cells and the IL14α knock-in transgenic SS mouse model, CCh-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] signals were diminished. This reduction was attributed to lower expression levels of the IP<sub>3</sub>R2 and IP<sub>3</sub>R3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). To probe this hypothesis, we employed transgenic Mist1<sup>CreERT2+/–</sup> x GCaMP6f<sup>+/–</sup> that expresses Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator-GCaMP6f specifically in the acinar cells. Firstly, we validated that the activation of the STING pathway leads to similar salivary gland hypofunction in this genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Surprisingly, however, DMXAA treatment led to a striking increase in the magnitude of neurally-induced spatially averaged [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signals. This observation is not consistent with the loss of IP<sub>3</sub>R proteins being responsible for reduced fluid secretion previously reported in other SS models. Indeed, the expression of IP<sub>3</sub>R proteins was unchanged following DMXAA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The discrepancy could be attributed to the stage of SS disease represented by the previous studies, with our data presenting an earlier initiating phase of SS disease prior to progression, at a time point before any notable decrease in IP<sub>3</sub>R proteins has occurred. The molecular mechanism responsible for augmented global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals following DMXAA treatment requires further study. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> release/influx, or conversely reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance might be responsible. It is tempting to speculate that reduced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and/or reduced PMCA and SERCA activity as a result of decreased ATP levels may contribute to enhanced cytosolic signals. Nevertheless, we suggest that the augmented Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals might represent a compensatory mechanism to drive fluid secretion in the face of compromised physiological stimulus-secretion coupling. Although the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were not reduced, the spatiotemporal characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal were markedly disrupted. Specifically, during neural stimulation, while in control animals there is a pronounced standing gradient of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] such that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is much greater in the apical <italic>vs.</italic> basal aspects of the cell, in DMXAA-treated animals this gradient is largely absent as large changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> are propagated to the basal regions of the cells. It is conceivable that the alteration in magnitude coupled with changes in the spatial characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal contributes to both the defect in fluid secretion and downstream cellular changes including mitochondrial damage to ultimately result in the progression of disease.</p>
<p>We investigated whether changes in the secretory machinery <italic>per se</italic> were altered in DMXAA-treated animals to result in hyposecretion. Salivary gland fluid secretion is dependent on TMEM16a facilitating CI<sup>-</sup> flux across the apical PM as the driving force for water transport paracellularly and through AGP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). The loss of either TMEM16a or AQP5 results in markedly attenuated fluid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). These findings indicate that alteration in expression level, localization, or regulation of these channels could potentially impact fluid secretion. Notably, in DMXAA-treated mice, the AQP5 expression and localization remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">supplementary Figure 5</xref>), consistent with a study in human labial minor salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). We next examined whether the TMEM16a channel function was compromised in the model. Our electrophysiological analysis revealed a significant decrease in TMEM16a activity following CCh-induced stimulation. Again, this reduced activity was not the result of overt mislocalization or lower expression levels of the protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). Interestingly, although the secretagogue-stimulated TMEM16a was reduced in acinar cells from DMXAA-treated animals, the sensitivity of the channel to direct activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the patch pipette appeared unaffected. IP<sub>3</sub>R3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels on the ER are located approximately 50-100 nm from TMEM16a on the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In this microdomain, confocal microscopy cannot easily distinguish the distinct localization of TMEM16a/IP<sub>3</sub>R, despite their localization on different membranes. However, STED super-resolution microscopy provides a much higher spatial resolution, achieving 20-80 nm to enable the differentiation of proteins within 20-80 nm of each other. Data using STED microscopy, suggest that the microdomain between apical ER IP<sub>3</sub>R3 and apical PM TMEM16a is disrupted in the disease model. The severe fragmentation of ER observed in EM images from DMXAA-treated animals also is consistent with an alteration in the relationship between ER and other intracellular domains. The disruption of the relative localization of these channels could conceivably result in diminished TMEM16a activity, if activation is dependent on the local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in its vicinity. Our data showing that the slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer EGTA eliminates TMEM16a activation in the disease model, but that currents can still be evoked in vehicle-treated controls is consistent with the activation of TMEM16a by the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal surrounding the channel rather than the global cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Thus, the disruption of this apical microdomain likely alters the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal that TMEM16a experiences leading to reduced activation and fluid secretion.</p>
<p>While changes in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] are vitally important for stimulating ion flux and hence fluid secretion, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is also critical for numerous other physiological processes in salivary gland acinar cells. We focused on the potential effects of the dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal on mitochondrial morphology and function. Secretion is an energy-demanding process, necessitating a constant supply of ATP for numerous functions, including vesicle transport, protein modification, membrane fusion, and maintaining ion gradients. For example, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump generates the Na<sup>+</sup> gradient, driving Cl<sup>-</sup> transport into the cytosol of acinar cells through NKCC1, and SERCA pumps replenish ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. In this context, mitochondria are essential as they provide ATP, regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, supply metabolic intermediates, and coordinate with the ER to orchestrate cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Notably, recent studies have highlighted that mitochondria are abundant and display varied positioning and dynamics in salivary gland cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). In SS patients, there are notable alterations in mitochondrial structure, including swelling and disrupted cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Correspondingly, mitochondrial-related genes, particularly those involved in metabolism, dynamics, and the electron transport complex, are significantly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Our data, employing fluorescent immunostaining and EM, mirrors these findings in DMXAA-treated animals. We observed that mitochondrial morphology is altered such that mitochondria are more swollen and rounded, with dispersed cristae, similar to that reported in human SS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Since optimal mitochondrial bioenergetics are also dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we assessed mitochondrial function by measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) using a membrane potential sensitive probe and the OCR using Seahorse technology. Our results show that in the SS mouse model, ΔΨm, which is critical for ATP synthesis, is diminished (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplementary Figure 4</xref>). While the ATP-linked OCR remained unchanged, both the basal and maximal OCR were reduced. This suggests that mitochondrial functionality is compromised in the disease model, indicating a decreased capacity to respond to additional cellular stress. An intriguing question arises from these findings: are defects in the function of mitochondria a primary cause of fluid secretion loss in SS, or alternatively is this a consequence of disrupted [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> regulation? Moreover, DNA from damaged mitochondria can activate the cGAS/STING pathway, leading to inflammation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). This implies that compromised mitochondria in early SS stages could trigger prolonged inflammation through the STING pathway, potentially contributing to SS progression. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective treatments to halt or slow the progression of SS.</p>

<title>Evaluation of saliva production</title>
<p>The mice were fasted for two hours prior to the evaluation of saliva production. The mice were anesthetized with a solution containing Ketamine (10 mg/mL) and Xylazine (1 mg/ml) by intraperitoneal injection (IP) at a dose of 7 μl/gm body weight over 2 minutes. The mouse was placed on a heating pad at 37℃ during experimentation. A Salimetrics Childen’s swab (Salimetrics; Cat. no. 5001.05) was placed within the oral cavity of each mouse. The mice were administered the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine (0.375 mg/kg body weight; Millipore Sigma; P6503) by IP injection. Two minutes after the pilocarpine injection, saliva was collected for the following 15 minutes. The saliva absorbed was subsequently separated from the moist swab through centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 minute. The measurement of saliva weight served as a quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of whole saliva secretion. To measure neurotransmitter-stimulated saliva secretion more directly, the mouse was anesthetized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and a surgical incision was made in the skin to expose the submandibular gland (SMG). The surrounding connective tissue was excised to facilitate positioning within a custom-made 3D-printed gland holder. A pair of stimulation electrodes were attached to the duct bundle and the SMG. The pre-weighed filter paper was positioned within the oral cavity of the mouse to capture saliva secretion. Secretion was initiated by electrical stimulation sequences generated by a stimulus isolator (Iso-flex, A.M.P.I.) set at 5 mA, 200 ms, at frequencies of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 Hz with train frequency and duration (typically 1 minute) controlled by a train generator (DG2A, Warner Instruments). The interval between each stimulus was 3 minutes. After stimulation, the filter paper was removed and weighed. The difference between the weight of filter paper before and after the electrode stimulation represented the saliva produced by the respective salivary gland during the given stimulation period.</p>

<p>Following verification of decreased saliva secretion in mice, glands were processed for immunocytochemistry. Briefly, the isolated salivary glands were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4℃ overnight. The fixed gland was processed, embedded in paraffin, and subsequently sliced into 5 μm thick sections. Two temperature-induced antigen retrieval protocols were used either based on HIER buffer (10 mM Tris-base, 1 mM EDTA-dehydrate, pH 9.2) or sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0).

<title>Patch clamp electrophysiology</title>
<p>Acinar cells were allowed to adhere to Cell-Tak-coated glass coverslips for 15 minutes before experimentation.

Cl<sup>-</sup> currents in individual cells were measured in the whole cell patch clamp configuration using pClamp 9 and an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Recordings were sampled at 2 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Pipette resistances were 3–5 MΩ, and seal resistances were greater than 1 GΩ. Pipette solutions (pH 7.2) contained 60 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 90 mM tetraethylammonium glutamate, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM HEDTA (N-(2-hydroxyethyl) ethylenediamine-N, N’, N’-triacetic acid) and 20 μM CaCl<sub>2</sub> were used to mimic physiological buffering and basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> conditions (∼100 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was estimated using Maxchelator freeware. Agonists were directly perfused onto individual cells using a multibarrel perfusion pipette. The pipette solution for the increased basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> contained hEDTA and a free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> of 500 nM, 1 μM, or 5 μM to induce calcium-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> currents without the addition of any agonists. Experiments comparing EGTA, BAPTA, and HEDTA effects upon chloride currents induced by CCh stimulation contained 5 mM free concentrations of the chelator and 100 nM free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the patch pipette. Chloride currents following agonist application were monitored with a single voltage step to 80 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV every second until current magnitudes reached a plateau.

<p>This manuscript presents <bold>important</bold> observations on the early changes that occur in calcium signaling, TMEM16a channel activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in salivary gland cells in a murine model of autoimmune Sjögren's disease. The study reports that in response to DMXAA treatment which induces a murine model of Sjögren's disease, salivary gland cells show significant changes in saliva release, calcium signaling, TMEM16a activation, mitochondrial function, and sub-cellular morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum. The work is <bold>compelling</bold> and will be of strong interest to physiologists working on secretion, calcium signaling, and mitochondria.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors address cellular mechanisms underlying the early stages of Sjogren's syndrome, using a mouse model in which 5,6-Dimethyl-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) is applied to stimulate the interferon gene (STING) pathway. They show that in this model salivary secretion in response to neural stimulation is greatly reduced, even though calcium responses of individual secretory cells was enhanced. They attribute the secretion defect to reduced activation of Ca2+ -activated Cl- channels (TMEM16a), due to an increased distance between Ca2+ release channels (IP3 receptors) and TMEM16a which is expected to reduce the [Ca2+] sensed by TMEM16a. A variety of disruptions in mitochondria were also observed after DMXAA treatment, including reduced abundance, altered morphology, depolarization and reduced oxygen consumption rate. The results of this study shed new light on some of the early events leading to the loss of secretory function in Sjogren's syndrome, at a time before inflammatory responses cause the death of secretory cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Two-photon microscopy enabled Ca2+ measurements in the salivary glands of intact animals in response to physiological stimuli (nerve stimulation. This approach has been shown previously by the authors as necessary to preserve the normal spatiotemporal organization of calcium signals that lead to secretion under physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Superresolution (STED) microscopy allowed precise measurements of the spacing of IP3R and TMEM16a and the cell membranes that would otherwise be prevented by the diffraction limit. The measured increase of distance (from 84 to 155 nm) would be expected to reduce [Ca2+] at the TMEM16a channel.</p>
<p>The authors effectively ruled out a variety of alternative explanations for reduced secretion, including changes in AQP5 expression, and TMEM16a expression, localization and Ca2+ sensitivity as indicated by Cl- current in response to defined levels of Ca2+. Suppression of Cl- currents by a fast buffer (BAPTA) but not a slow one (EGTA) supports the idea that increased distance between IP3R and TMEM16A contributes to the secretory defect in DMXAA-treated cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the Ca2+ distribution in the cells was less restricted to the apical region in DMXAA-treated cells, it is not clear that this is relevant to the reduced activation of TMEM16a or to pathophysiological changes associated with Sjogren's syndrome.</p>
<p>Despite the decreased level of secretion, Ca2+ signal amplitudes were higher in the treated cells, raising the question of how much this might compensate for the increased distance between IP3R and TMEM16a. The authors assume that the increased separation of IP3R and TMEM16a (and the resulting decrease in local [Ca2+]) outweighed the effect of higher global [Ca2+], but this point was not addressed directly.</p>
<p>The description of mitochondrial changes in abundance, morphology, membrane potential, and oxygen consumption rate were not well integrated into the rest of the paper. While they may be a facet of the multiple effects of STING activation and may occur during Sjogren's syndrome, their possible role in reducing secretion was not examined. As it stands, the mitochondrial results are largely descriptive and more studies are needed to connect them to the secretory deficits in SJogren's syndrome.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes a very eloquent study of disrupted stimulus -secretion coupling in salivary acinar cells in the early stages of an animal model (DMXAA) of Sjogren's syndrome (SS). The study utilizes a range of technically innovative in vivo imaging of Ca signaling, in vivo salivary secretion, patch clamp electrophysiology to assess TMEM16a activity, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy and a range of morphological and functional assays of mitochondrial function. Results show that in mice with DMXAA-induced Sjogren's syndrome, there was a reduced nerve stimulation induced salivary secretion, yet surprisingly the nerve stimulation induced Ca signaling was enhanced. There was also a reduced carbachol (CCh)-induced activation of TMEM16a currents in acinar cells from DMXAA-induced SS mice, whereas the intrinsic Ca-activated TMEM16a currents were unaltered, further supporting that stimulus-secretion coupling was impaired. Consistent with this, high resolution STED microscopy revealed that there was a loss of close physical spatial coupling between IP3Rs and TMEM16a, which may contribute to the impaired stimulus-secretion coupling. Furthermore, the authors show that the mitochondria were both morphologically and functionally impaired, suggesting that bioenergetics may be impaired in salivary acinar cells of DMXAA-induced SS mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this is an outstanding manuscript, that will have a huge impact on the field. The manuscript is beautifully well-written with a very clear narrative. The experiments are technically innovative, very well executed and with a logical design The data are very well presented and appropriately analyzed and interpreted.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The pathomechanism underlying Sjögren's syndrome (SS) remains elusive. The Authors have studied if altered calcium signaling might be a factor in SS development in a commonly used mouse model. They provide a thorough and straightforward characterization of the salivary gland fluid secretion, cytoplasmic calcium signaling and mitochondrial morphology and respiration. A special strength of the study is the spectacular in vivo imaging, very few if any groups could have succeeded with the studies. The Authors show that the cytoplasmic calcium signaling is upregulated in the SS model and the Ca2+ regulated Cl- channels normally localized and function, still fluid secretion is suppressed. They also find altered localization of the IP3R and speculate about lesser exposure of Cl- channels to high local [Ca2+]. In addition, they describe changes in mitochondrial morphology and function that might also contribute to the attenuated secretory response. Although, the exact contribution of calcium and mitochondria to secretory dysfunction remains to be determined, the results seem to be useful for a range of scientists.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the strengths of our in vivo Ca2+ measurements, super resolution microscopy and assessment of the secretory dysfunction in the Sjogrens syndrome mouse model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>Point 1: The less restricted Ca2+ signal to the apical region of the acinar cell is not really relevant to the reduced activation of TMEM16a by a local signal at the apical plasma membrane.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the spatially averaged Ca2+ signal is not indicative of the local Ca2+ signal that activates TMEM16a. The description of the disordered Ca2+ signal in the disease model was intended to simply convey that the Ca2+ signal is altered in the model. Whether or indeed how the altered spatial characteristics of the signal are deleterious is not known but we speculate in the discussion that this contributes to the ultrastructural damage observed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 2. Secretion is decreased but the amplitude of the globally averaged Ca2+ signals are increased. No proof is offered that the greater distance between IP3R and TMEM16a is the reason for decreased secretion in the face of this increased peak signal.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added new data that indicates that the local Ca2+ signal is indeed disrupted in the disease model. We show that in control animals, activation of TMEM16a by application of agonist occurs when the pipette is buffered with the slower buffer EGTA but not with the fast buffer BAPTA In contrast, in cells isolated from DMXAA -treated animals both EGTA and BAPTA abolish the agonist-induced currents (new Figure 6). These data are consistent with our super resolution data showing the distance between IP3R and TMEM16a being greaterand thus presumably is enough to allow buffering of Ca2+ release from IP3R such that it does not effectively activate TMEM16a. These data also would suggest that the increased amplitude of the spatially averaged Ca2+ signal is not sufficient to overcome this structural change.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 3. Lack of evidence that the mitochondrial changes are associated with the defect in fluid secretion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a causal link between the decreased secretion and altered mitochondrial morphology and function is not established. Nevertheless, we feel it is reasonable to contend that profound changes in mitochondrial morphology observed at the light and EM level, together with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption are consistent with contributing to altered fluid secretion given that this is an energetically costly process. We have altered the discussion to reflect these caveats and ideas.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their assessment of our work and constructive comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 3:</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their careful appraisal of our manuscript and insightful comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 1: Are all the effects of DMXAA mediated through the STING pathway?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important point because as noted DMXAA has been reported to inhibit NAD(P)H quinone oxireductase that could contribute to the phenotype reported here. In future studies we intend to test other STING pathway agonists such as MSA-2 and perhaps antagonists of the STING pathway. We have added text to the discussion indicating that all the effects observed may not be a result of activation of the STING pathway.</p>
<p>Point 2: As noted, and clarified in the text, the driving force for ATP production is the electrochemical H+ gradient which establishes the mitochondrial membrane potential.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 3:  The reviewer suggested there was a decrease mitochondrial membrane potential in the absence of a change in TMRE steady state.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion generated from the presentation of the figure. We normalized TMRE fluorescence against Mitotraker green fluorescence but as shown, the figure does not reflect that the absolute TMRE fluorescence was indeed decreased. Supplemental figure 4 now shows the basal TMRE fluorescence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 4: Indications that the disruption to ER structure seen in Electron Micrographs contributes to the changes in Ca2+ signal and fluid secretion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not focus on the relative distance between ER and apical PM in the EMs primarily because the ER that projects towards the apical PM is a relatively minor component of the specialized ER expressing IP3R and is difficult to identify. We note that the disruption of the bulk ER as quantitated by altered ER-mitochondrial interfaces and fragmentation is consistent with our super resolution data and thus likely plays a role in the mechanism that results in dysregulated Ca2+ signals and reduced secretion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations to Authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewing Editor:</bold></p>
<p>(1) The Editor suggests that we should use the activity of TMEM16a to directly measure the [Ca2+] experienced by the channel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now present new additional data.  First, we show an extended range of pipette [Ca2+] demonstrating identical Ca2+ sensitivity in DMXAA vs vehicle treated cells (Figure 5). Second, importantly, we now present data evaluating the ability of muscarinic stimulation to activate TMEM16a in the presence of either EGTA (slow Ca2+ buffer) or BAPTA (fast Ca2+ buffer). Notably, currents can be stimulated in control cells when the pipette is buffered with EGTA, but not in DMXAA treated cells. BAPTA inhibits activation in both situations (new Figure 6). These data are consistent with TMEM16a being activated by Ca2+ in a microdomain and that this is disrupted in the disease model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The Editor asks whether a decrease in IP3R3 in a subset of the samples could account for the decreased fluid secretion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think this is unlikely given, as noted by the Editor, that a reduction only occurred in a subset of the samples and statistically there was no significant difference to vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, we would note that there is also no difference in the expression of IP3R2 between experimental groups and in studies of transgenic mice where either IP3R2 or IP3R3 were knocked out individually, there was no effect on salivary fluid secretion, indicating that expression of a single subtype can support stimulus-secretion coupling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Absolute values for changes in fluorescence (over time) should be included together with SD images.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These have been added in Figure 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) DMXAA has additional effects to STING activation and thus other STING pathway modulators should be used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that additional STING agonists should be explored in the future but believe that this is beyond the scope of the present studies. Additional text has been added to the discussion acknowledging the additional targets of DMXAA and that they could contribute to the phenotype.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) No causal link between the observed Ca2+ changes and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that no experimental evidence is offered to directly support this contention. Nevertheless, dysregulated Ca2+ signals are well-documented to lead to altered mitochondrial structure and function and thus we feel it not unreasonable to speculate that this is a possibility.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The paper would be improved by directly assessing mechanistic connections between altered Ca2+ signaling and TMEM16a activation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree, please refer to point 1 and new figure 6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Standard Deviation images should be explained and the location of ROI identified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We contend that Standard Deviation images provide an effective visualization (in a single image) of both the magnitude of the Ca2+ increase and the degree of recruitment of cells in the field of view during the entire period of stimulation.  We have added text to describe the utility of this technique. Nevertheless, we now show kinetic traces of the changes in fluorescence over time in both apical and basal regions in Figure 3. We also clarify that the traces shown in Figure 2 are averaged over the entire cell.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The Authors should consider that reduced secretion is because cells are dying.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe this is unlikely given the lack of morphological changes in glandular structure and the minor lymphocyte infiltration observed in this model. Nevertheless, we now add data showing that the mass of SMG is not altered in the DMXAA-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated (Figure 1E).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The role of mitochondria in the DMXAA phenotype is unclear. What is the effect of acutely de-energizing mitochondria on fluid secretion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since fluid secretion is an energetically expensive undertaking, it is not unreasonable to suggest that compromised mitochondrial function may impact secretion. That being said this could occur at multiple levels- production of ATP to fuel the Na/K pump to establish membrane gradients or to provide energy to sequester Ca2+ among a multitude of targets. This will be a subject of ongoing experiments. We contend that experiments to acutely disrupt salivary mitochondria in vivo while assessing fluid secretion would be difficult experiments to perform and interpret given that local administration of agents to SMG would not effect the other major salivary glands and systemic administration would be predicted to have wide-ranging off target effects.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Could a subset of cells with low IP3R numbers contribute to reduced fluid secretion?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see the response to Reviewing Editors point 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) An attempt to estimate the effect of the spatial distruption of IP3R and TMEM16a localization should be made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see the response to Reviewing Editors point 1.</p>
<p>Minor Points</p>
<p>We have amended the statement form “Highly expressed” to increased.</p>
<p>Regions of the cell have been labelled for orientation in the line scans.</p>
<p>The molecular weight markers have been added in Figure 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Whether mitochondrial dysfunction is the initiator of the phenotype or a result of the dysregulated Ca2+ signal is unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that our data does not clarify a classic “Chicken vs Egg” conundrum. We plan further experiments to address this issue. Future plans include repeating the mitochondrial and Ca2+ signaling experiments at earlier time points where we know fluid secretion is not yet impacted. This may potentially reveal the temporal sequence of events. Similarly, we plan experiments to mechanistically address why the global Ca2+ signal is augmented- reduced Ca2+ clearance or enhanced Ca2+ release/influx are possibilities. We speculate that reduced Ca2+ clearance, either because mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is reduced or as a secondary consequence of reduced ATP levels on SERCA and PMCA is a likely possibility.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Measurement of ECAR and direct measurements of ATP and Seahorse methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In a separate series of experiments, we monitored ECAR. These data were unfortunately very variable and difficult to interpret, although no obvious compensatory increase was observed. We plan in the future to directly monitor ATP levels in acinar cells using Mg-Green. To normalize for cell numbers in the Seahorse experiments, following centrifugation, cell pellets of equal volume were resuspended in equal volumes of buffer. Acinar cells were seeded onto Cell Tak coated dishes. This information is added to the Methods section.</p>
