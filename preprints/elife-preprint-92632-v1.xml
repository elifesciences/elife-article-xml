<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cell chirality is an intrinsic property characterized by biased cell rotation or orientation. Although the importance of the right-handed double helix of actin is known, how a single form of molecular handedness manifests diverse forms of cell chirality remains unclear. Here, we found that the cell nucleus rotated with a clockwise (CW) bias in a small projected area, but this rotation reversed to an anticlockwise (ACW) bias as cell spreading increased. Actin analysis suggested that radial fiber polymerization accounts for the ACW bias. Alterations in transverse arc components (myosin II, mDia2, and tropomyosin 4) revealed that the CW bias is driven by the retrograde flow, originating from the tethered gliding motion of myosin II in the contractile structure of transverse arcs. Thus, an imbalance between radial fibers and transverse arcs results in cell chirality reversal. The findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying cell chirality reversal, providing a new perspective on mechanobiology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of an animal’s tissues or organs necessitates the establishment of left–right (LR) asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lobikin et al., 2012</xref>). This includes the LR body axis that is vital for visceral distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pohl and Bao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) and chiral morphogenesis, crucial for the formation of tissue/organ architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hozumi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Noël et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Spéder et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Veerkamp et al., 2013</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying the spontaneous emergence of LR asymmetry remains largely unknown. Cell chirality, a mechanical behavior characterized by biased cell orientation or rotation (either clockwise (CW) or anticlockwise (ACW)), has been proposed as the origin of LR asymmetry at the tissue level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Danilchik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lobikin et al., 2012</xref>). For example, blastomeres in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryos exhibit a chiral skew event, leading to uneven cell distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Naganathan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pohl and Bao, 2010</xref>). In a later stage of embryonic development, this chiral mechanics causes collective motion in epithelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hozumi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>), eventually affecting the formation of genitalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sato et al., 2015</xref>) and the axial torsion of the hindgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hozumi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>), In addition to its role in embryonic development, the presence of cell chirality can be recognized by its ability to generate cellular torque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Naganathan et al., 2014</xref>), promote cell migration with LR bias,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yao and Ding, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yao et al., 2021</xref>) or form specific alignment at the multicellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wan et al., 2011</xref>). Through cell–cell communication, the chiral behavior results in the LR-biased assembly of the multicellular structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chin et al., 2018</xref>) and regulates the permeability of intercellular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fan et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Actomyosin activity is crucial for chirality at the organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Spéder et al., 2006</xref>), tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>), and cellular levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tamada and Igarashi, 2017</xref>). In <italic>in vivo</italic> systems, the expression of cell chirality can be suppressed by inhibiting actomyosin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Noël et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>in vitro</italic> systems, the expression of cell chirality depends on actomyosin activity along micropattern boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tee et al., 2015</xref>). Two classes of actin filaments play major roles in actomyosin activity: dorsal stress fibers and transverse arcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tojkander et al., 2012</xref>). Dorsal stress fibers, also referred to as radial fibers, have one end anchored to the substrate through a focal adhesion, whereas the other end points radially toward the nucleus. Transverse arcs are curved actin filaments produced by the endwise annealing of myosin bundles, appearing as rings or nearly closed arcs centered around the nucleus. When cultured on micropatterned circles, radial fibers are unidirectionally tilted, forming a distinct chiral pattern of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tee et al., 2015</xref>). This pattern drives the chiral torque and rotation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kwong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>The molecular handedness of actomyosin filaments is essential for cell chirality. For example, formin-dependent actin polymerization has been proposed to cause the righthanded axial spinning of radial fibers, resulting in the ACW chiral pattern of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tamada and Igarashi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tee et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the overexpression of α-actinin-1 that crosslinks with the actin filament or modulates actin polymerization can lead to CW chirality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Djinović-Carugo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jalal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tee et al., 2023</xref>). However, because an actin filament is formed only as a right-handed double helix, it remains unclear how a single form of molecular handedness can manifest diverse chirality at the cellular level, which is even observed across different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wan et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the role of crosslinking or altered polymerization of right-handed actin filaments in chirality reversal remains vague and unresolved.</p>
<p>In this study, we report the reversal of cell chirality achieved by switching dominance between the two classes of actin fibers. During cell attachment and spreading, we first observed the reversal of chiral rotation of the nucleus, shifting from a CW-biased to an ACW-biased direction. Using micropatterning, we determined that the reversal of chirality was dependent on an increase in the projected cell area. This phenomenon was consistently observed across various cell types. Based on the analysis of actin distribution by using small-molecule drugs, we found that the polymerization of radial fibers originating from their barbed end near the cell edge is essential for ACW chirality. However, when cells were cultured on small islands or an inhibitor was used to suppress radial fibers, transverse arcs displayed a well-organized CW swirl approaching the cell center. Furthermore, perturbations in transverse arcs, either through the suppression of myosin IIa activity or gene silencing of mDia2 and tropomyosin 4 (Tpm4), enhanced ACW chirality. Because transverse arcs are formed at the dorsal surface of the cell cortex, the sarcomere-like contractile structure may serve as a torque dipole that rolls against the plasma membrane, eventually leading to the CW swirling of transverse arcs. Thus, an imbalance between the two classes of actin stress fibers results in the reversal of chirality. This study elucidated a general and previously unidentified mechanism underlying chirality reversal, providing a unique opportunity to further explore the role of cell chirality in regulating tissue morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Cell chirality is reversed from CW to ACW bias during cell spreading</title>
<p>Attachment to a cell-adherent substrate is a prerequisite for expressing cell chirality in 2D culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wan et al., 2011</xref>). We performed time-lapse microscopy to record cell spreading and nuclei rotation during the spreading of human foreskin fibroblast (HFF-1) on a culture dish. From 0 min to 240 min, cells underwent isotropic spreading and then anisotropic spreading until reaching their normal morphology on the culture dish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid1">Video 1</xref>). To assess cell chirality, cell nuclei were tracked using binarized nuclei images to record the angular velocity of nuclei at 5 min intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>). Notably, the nucleus rotation transitions several times from CW to ACW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To determine potential cell culture bias, we measured the angular velocity of 26 cells and calculated the percentage of CW and ACW rotation every 20 minutes throughout the timelapse imaging. Our results revealed that nucleus rotation was CW-biased at the beginning but reversed to ACW-biased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, the cell projected area increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and the circularity of cell morphology decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">H</xref>). Because cells with non-circular shape would inhibit the expression of chiral rotation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), the increased projection area is more likely the reason for chirality reversal. To clarify this, the probability of ACW/CW rotation was further analyzed against the averaged projected area with different circularity. For circularity greater than 0.7, reversal of chirality was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In contrast, reversal was not as apparent for cell circularity below 0.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Together, these results suggest that chiral nucleus rotation may require a circular cell shape and can be reversed from CW to ACW with the increase of cell projected area.</p>

<title>Cell chirality is reversed from CW to ACW bias with incremental change of micro-island area</title>
<p>During cell attachment and spreading, the actin cytoskeleton undergoes a complete reorganization, such as formation of focal adhesions, recruitment of formin, maturation of actin filament stress fibers, and activation of Arp2/3 in lamellipodia. Thus, the chirality reversal may be a result of those dynamic processes but not necessarily the cell projected area in the transient period. To directly assess the role of the cell projected area, we confined the cell spreading in an isotropic form through applying arrays of fibronectin-coated circular islands with different areas, surrounded by cell-repellent Pluronic coating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). On fibronectin-coated micro-islands, time-lapse measurement started after the cells had fully spread to the defined area without further morphological dynamics. HFF-1 fibroblasts were again used to record nucleus rotation on micro-islands. Interestingly, when cells spread on the 500 μm<sup>2</sup> pattern, the nucleus rotation was neutral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Starting from 750 μm<sup>2</sup>, nucleus rotation became CW-biased (45.83 ± 1.96 % ACW with p-value &lt; 0.01), which was consistent with the chiral bias of cells during spreading on culture dish. From 1000 μm<sup>2</sup> to 2500 μm<sup>2</sup>, the chiral nucleus rotation changed to neutral and then reversed to ACW-biased (63.43 ± 2.90 % ACW with p-value &lt; 0.0001) on 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> of micro-islands. Thus, the results on micro-islands provide direct evidence that cell projected area was responsible for chirality reversal. To further prove that high circularity is required for area-dependent chirality reversal, cells were cultured on other non-circular shapes, including a triangle, square, and rectangle, with areas exhibiting CW (750 μm<sup>2</sup>) or ACW (2500 μm<sup>2</sup>) bias on circular islands. The reversal of cell chirality from small to large island was not observed in these cases, indicating that circular islands are required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, to test the universality of such phenomenon, we performed nucleus rotation analysis on two other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">D</xref>), C2C12 mouse myoblasts and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). All assessments showed the same chirality reversal depending on cell projected area, demonstrating the universality of this relationship.</p>

<title>Actin distribution upon drug treatment</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism, we next examined the actin cytoskeleton on the aforementioned islands. Actomyosin cytoskeleton is known to play important role in the cell chirality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wan et al., 2011</xref>). More importantly, when cultured as single cells on micropatterned circles, a chiral swirling pattern of radial actin fibers has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tee et al., 2015</xref>).

<p>When cultured on the 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left), actin structure at the lamella arises as a chiral swirling pattern of radial fibers in conjunction with the transverse arcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tojkander et al., 2012</xref>). Using automated image processing to analyze the tilting angle of radial fibers with respect to the radial axis of each cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bao et al., 2020</xref>), an ACW tilting was revealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting the role of actin in nucleus rotation. To clarify the causal relationship between the nucleus and the actin structure, we observed actin organization of cell seeded on micropatterns after enucleation. By comparing actin filaments for the normal and enucleated HFF-1 fibroblasts on 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> island, the ACW bias of actin filament was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that the chiral rotation of the nucleus is likely a result of chiral structure of actin, rather than the chiral rotation of the nucleus causing the formation of actin chiral structure.</p>

<p>On the other hand, for cells on the 750 μm<sup>2</sup> pattern, CW rotation of nucleus was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, only ventral fibers and transverse arcs remained in these cells, while radial fibers were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left). To visualize this structural difference, we used image stacking. On 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> pattern, the highest intensity showed a ring shape where the radial fibers were located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right). In contrast, on 750 μm<sup>2</sup> pattern, the actin ring was replaced by an accumulation of actin at the cell center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right). Thus, while actin cytoskeleton was the major driver for chiral rotation of nucleus, the presence of radial fibers was not always necessary.</p>
<p>This absence of radial fibers is unexpected, as the chiral pattern of radial fibers is a hallmark of cell chirality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tee et al., 2015</xref>). To further investigate this, we applied a series of cytoskeleton-related inhibitors on HFF-1 fibroblasts on two representative micro-islands, 750 μm<sup>2</sup> (small island) and 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> (large island). We identified A23187 Calcium Ionophore (A23) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Shao et al., 2015</xref>), Latrunculin A (LatA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yarmola et al., 2000</xref>), NSC23677 (NSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Levay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Spiering and Hodgson, 2011</xref>), SMIFH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rizvi et al., 2009</xref>), and Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kranenburg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>), to modulate actin cytoskeleton. LatA inhibits F-actin polymerization by forming a 1:1 molar complex with G-actin. A23187 Calcium Ionophore (A23) stimulates calcium flux into the cell and perinuclear actin formation. LPA activates RhoA, stimulating actin stress fiber formation. NSC inhibits Rac1, which induces actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex actin polymerization. Formins were also studied with the formin FH2 domain inhibitor SMIFH2. On 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> island, the original nucleus ACW chirality (63.43 ± 2.90 % ACW) remained unchanged by A23 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), was neutralized by LPA treatment, and became even more ACW-biased under NSC and SMIFH2 treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, treatment of LatA could reverse the chirality to CW bias (45.58 ± 2.15% ACW, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Additionally, CW bias on 750 μm<sup>2</sup> island was unaffected by the LatA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), but neutralized by NSC, SMIFH2, and LPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). More interestingly, A23 reversed the nucleus rotation from its original 45.83 ± 1.96 % ACW to 54.00 ± 1.60 % ACW bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Based on the above results, treatment of LatA and A23 appears to be effective in reversing the induced ACW/CW bias on large and small island, respectively.</p>
<p>We next analyzed the actin distribution of HFF-1 fibroblasts in response to A23 and LatA treatment. Compared to untreated cells on 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> pattern, actin was lessened around the nucleus with A23 treatment. More ventral stress fibers across the cell nucleus could be seen with LatA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To statistically illustrate actin distribution upon treatment, we applied image stacking. On 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> pattern, A23 treatment pushes the actin toward the cell edge, while in contrast, the LatA treatment brought actin closer to the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Similar effects were seen for cells on 750 μm<sup>2</sup> pattern. More interestingly, radial fibers were restored under A23 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">H</xref>). To highlight this difference, we used a differential heatmap by subtracting the stacked actin image between treated and untreated cases. A23 clearly appeared to concentrate actin at the cell edge but reduce it at the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), and a distinct peak of actin intensity was observed immediately adjacent to the cell edge (dashed line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). In contrast, under LatA treatment, actin was concentrated around the nucleus while the peripheral ring of actin was more reduced than that of the untreated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">J</xref>). The same effects were also observed in cells on 750 μm<sup>2</sup> islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">L</xref>). As polymerization of radial fibers arose from the barbed end near the leading edge, this suggests an increased polymerization of radial fibers upon A23 treatment, which may account for the ACW chiral rotation. Particularly for cells on 750 μm<sup>2</sup> pattern, it was possible to change the original CW rotation to ACW rotation upon restoration of radial fibers. On the other hand, as an inhibitor of F-actin polymerization, LatA, appeared to reduce actin filament at the cell edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Higashida et al., 2008</xref>) on both 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> and 750 μm<sup>2</sup> patterns, suggesting a suppressed actin polymerization which may account for the CW chirality.</p>

<title>Role of actin polymerization of radial fibers for ACW chirality</title>
<p>How does actin polymerization near the cell edge affect cell chirality? A heatmap only shows the overall distribution of actin, but not its dynamics. To better elucidate this mechanism, we visualized live actin organization by transfection of either actin-GFP, or Lifeact, in HFF-1 fibroblasts. Cells on the 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> island were chosen due to their easier observation. We first examined the actin organization of the untreated control cells with Lifeact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Time-lapse microscopy showed that the centripetal growing radial fiber was pointed toward the cell center with an inward flow of transverse arcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid2">Video 2</xref>). Notably, the radial fibers began to tilt rightward with the increase in length in untreated control cells. Eventually, this right-tilted growth direction of radial fibers, accompanied by retrograde flow, drove an overall ACW rotation of the entire cytoskeleton around the cell nucleus. This resulted in a chiral swirling pattern of actin filament, showing a strong correlation with ACW nucleus rotation.</p>

The green dashed line indicates the photobleached location of actin-GFP, while red and green arrows show the elongation of radial fiber and translocation of transverse arc to the cell center, respectively. In each cell sample, radial fiber elongation velocity was compared against the transverse arc translocation velocity.

<p>To better elucidate the role of actin polymerization of radial fibers, we compared the elongation rate of the radial fibers and the retrograde flow velocity of the transverse arcs. Actin-GFP transfected HFF-1 cells on 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> pattern. We observed that the retrograde flow of transverse arcs was faster than the elongation rate of radial fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which is consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tee et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that the retrograde flow of transverse arcs is not dependent solely on the elongation of radial fibers. More importantly, the velocity of radial fiber elongation was reduced by LatA treatment, while the inward flow velocity of transverse arcs remained unchanged compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">D</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that actin polymerization directly contributes to the elongation of radial fibers but not the retrograde flow of transverse arcs.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results suggest that inward-growing radial fibers with rightward tilt are the main contributors to ACW chirality. When treated by LatA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) or cultured on small islands that suppress the radial fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid3">Video 3</xref>), the ACW bias was reversed to CW bias. Notably, rightward tilting during actin polymerization could be explained by the helical structures of actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tamada and Igarashi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tee et al., 2015</xref>). At focal adhesion, formin proteins cap and tether the barbed ends of actin filaments. When new actin monomers are incorporated into the right-handed double helix, which drives the other free end with a right-handed axial spinning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid4">Video 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tee et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>Transverse arcs contribute to CW chirality</title>
<p>While actin polymerization of radial fibers directly contributes to the ACW rotation of cells, the appearance of CW bias is unclear, as the reduced actin polymerization may simply neutralize chiral bias. For LatA-treated cells with Lifeact transfection, we noticed a very organized CW swirling of transverse arcs that approached the cell center during retrograde flow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid5">Video 5</xref>). Using optical flow analysis, such inward flow with CW-bias swirling was observed to drive the cell to commit CW rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This finding explains the increased actin concentration near the cell center shown by phalloidin staining of LatA-treated cells on the large island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Notably, in some cases, the CW-bias of nucleus rotation occurred only in the presence of transverse arcs that swirled and wrapped towards the cell center with CW-bias, without distinct, bundled radial fibers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid6">Video 6</xref>). Moreover, for cells on small islands, the nucleus rotation was solely driven by the retrograde flow of transverse arcs, without apparent radial fibers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid3">Video 3</xref>). Thus, such CW swirling of transverse arcs may occur on itself without the need for radial fibers.</p>
<p>To further investigate this, we disturbed the major components of the transverse arcs. Transverse arcs are comprised of curved actomyosin bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tamada and Igarashi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tee et al., 2015</xref>) form in a periodic pattern through end-to-end annealing of myosin II and α-actinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tojkander et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, myosin II bundles contribute to transverse arc contraction by walking on actin filament, which may lead to the higher speed in retrograde flow of transverse arcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, myosin II or α-actinin perturbation would directly influence the transverse arc. We first applied overexpression of α-actinin, which may enhance the CW chirality in two ways. First, as the main component of transverse arcs, α-actinin may enhance its formation. Second, it also cross-links radial fibers, which may restrict and suppress their axial spinning in ACW chirality. We found that the overexpression of α-actinin indeed enhanced CW rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5S1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we applied Y27632, an inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), to down-regulate the function of myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Salhia et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, treatment with Y27632 significantly reduced the highly enriched myosin II in transverse arcs observed in untreated cells, showing that actomyosin activity was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We then compared actin and myosin IIa intensity distribution using a heatmap of a 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> pattern. For non-treatment control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), myosin IIa was distributed with the highest intensity as a ring and colocalized with the actin ring. Remarkably, in the Y27632 treated cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), while the actin ring remained unchanged, the myosin IIa failed to colocalize with it, and the myosin ring was heavily damaged. To quantify this, we analyzed myosin IIa median intensity and its colocalization with actin filament using Pearson’s R-value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">D</xref>), in which a higher value of median intensity indicated more activated myosin IIa, and higher r value indicated more myosin IIa colocalized with actin filaments. Significant reductions in myosin IIa intensity and its colocalization with actin filament were seen upon Y27632 treatment. With such disruption of myosin IIa function, we measured nucleus rotation under Y27632 treatment on 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> and 750 μm<sup>2</sup> islands. The ACW nucleus rotation was enhanced on both islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">F</xref>). Similarly, this enhanced ACW rotation observed in cells treated with SMIFH2 and NSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) can also be explained by their cross-inhibition to myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nishimura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Shibata et al., 2015</xref>). In sum, these results suggest that myosin IIa activity of transverse arc is responsible for the CW-bias of cells.</p>

<title>Role of myosin IIa and transverse arc on CW chirality</title>
<p>To further investigate the role of myosin IIa and transverse arc in the CW chirality, we applied siRNA gene silencing on mDia2. mDia2 typically nucleates tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments, which recruit myosin II and anneal endwise with α-actinin-crosslinked actin filaments. The sarcomere-like contractile unit eventually condenses to myosin II-containing transverse arcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tojkander et al., 2011</xref>). We first evaluated the myosin IIa distribution of the control and mDia2-silenced cells. We reduced the protein expression upon siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, while the myosin ring was heavily disrupted by mDia2 silencing, some myosin IIa was still observed at the region of transverse arcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In addition, the actin ring remains unchanged. Myosin IIa median intensity analysis and its colocalization with actin show that myosin IIa only partially dislocates from the actin ring, without significant reduction of its intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Regarding nucleus rotation, mDia2 silencing appears to promote ACW rotation on both 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> and 750 μm<sup>2</sup> islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">E</xref>). An opposite effect was seen by transfection of GFP-mDia2 in the overexpression assay. Thus, myosin IIa binding on tropomyosin decorated actin is required for CW nucleus rotation, and mDia2 can serve as an upstream endogenous factor to regulate it.</p>

<p>To further prove the essence of myosin II binding on the tropomyosin-decorated actin, we applied siRNA gene silencing on tropomyosin 4 (Tpm4). Among the isoforms, Tpm4-decorated actin filaments were particularly important for recruitment of myosin II, as Tpm4’s presence on the transverse arcs coincides with the incorporation of myosin II. As an essential facilitator for the gliding motion of myosin II on actin filaments, tropomyosin would shift to cover or disclose the myosin-binding site on the actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ebashi, 1972</xref>) and accelerate myosin head translocation to each of the myosin-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hundt et al., 2016</xref>). We found that Tpm4 was colocalized with actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6S1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and could be significantly reduced upon siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Interestingly, based on the distribution heatmap of myosin IIa, the ring pattern in control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) was eliminated in Tpm4-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Moreover, the transverse arcs became less apparent, and the actin ring was closer to the periphery of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Notably, myosin IIa intensity and colocalization were both statistically lower in Tpm4-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), implying that the Tpm4 silencing strongly disrupts the attachment of myosin II on actin filaments. Compared to the silencing of upstream mDia2, under which actin condensation still occurs, Tpm4 silencing seems to have been more effective and specific in breaking the binding of myosin IIa on actin filaments. As a result, the condensation of actin filaments in the transverse arcs was also damaged. Critically, the nucleus rotation of HFF-1 under Tpm4 silencing exhibited much greater ACW chirality on both the 2500 μm<sup>2</sup> (from 63.43 ± 2.90 % ACW to 81.64 ± 2.79% ACW, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) and 750 μm<sup>2</sup> patterns (from 45.83 ± 1.96 % ACW to 61.37± 3.09 % ACW, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). In contrast, Tpm1, Tpm2, and Tpm3 knockdown did not show any noticeable effect on chirality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6S2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Based on the above results, we can conclude that the myosin IIa binding and its gliding motion on Tpm4-decorated actin filament is important for cell expression of CW chirality.</p>

<title>Actin height profile disclosed the transverse arcs and radial fibers layering</title>
<p>Myosin II and V have been shown to be left-handed spiral motors on the right-handed actin helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ali et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beausang et al., 2008</xref>). During the gliding motion, the left-handed walking of myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kovács et al., 2007</xref>) could, on the other hand, cause left-handed twirling of an actin filament about its axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beausang et al., 2008</xref>). When near a surface or a boundary, such chiral processes cause spinning of individual filopodia of a growth cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tamada et al., 2010</xref>), chiral flow of the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Danilchik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Furthauer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pohl and Bao, 2010</xref>), and right-handed clockwise cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tamada and Igarashi, 2017</xref>). Thus, the contractile unit composed of left-handed-walking myosin II on left-handed-twirling of actin filaments may also serve as active actomyosin torque dipoles. If located near a surface, such as the cell cortex, actomyosin torque dipoles could cause right-screw rotation against the surface, eventually causing the transverse arc to swirl in the CW direction.</p>
<p>To explore the location of the transverse arc, we observed the actin structure and myosin distribution in the height profile. According to previous findings, the actin network has two distinct, vertically separated layers. For example, in U2O2 cells, dorsal stress fibers, also called radial fibers attached to focal adhesion, are in the lower layer, while the contractile actin arcs are in the upper layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burnette et al., 2014</xref>). With fluorescence staining of actin and immunofluorescence staining of myosin IIa, we observed the actin structure and myosin IIa using z-stack with confocal microscopy. The maximum projection and height profiles were created using ImageJ. We found that the maximum projection of actin and myosin IIa was colocalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">B</xref>). More importantly, based on the height profile from ImageJ, two distinct layers of actin, one near the ventral substrate and one near to the dorsal surface of cells, were seen (green arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">B</xref>). However, myosin IIa was only seen near the dorsal surface, suggesting that the transverse arc was formed at the dorsal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, right). We then investigated the actin structure of the Tpm4-silenced sample. A distinct layering of actin could again be observed with z-direction scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid7">Video 7</xref>). To visualize the structure, part of the actin was zoomed in on, and the level of actin was given different colors. It was observed that the two layers were more separated, whereas the radial fibers near the cell periphery were indeed located at the ventral surface, and the transverse arcs were near the dorsal surface of the cells. Together, these results suggest that the CW-bias of transverse arcs could be a result of chiral processes near the dorsal surface. The transverse arcs could be observed above the nucleus with conjunction to a perinuclear actin cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7S1">Figure 7— figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the transverse arcs’ CW-bias swirling and wrapping may eventually exert force causing nucleus rotation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we first observed chiral reversal from CW to ACW bias during cell spreading. Using micropatterning, the CW bias of nucleus rotation on smaller islands was reversed to ACW bias with increased area of micro-islands, suggesting a dependence on cell projected area. We examined nucleus rotation and actin distribution with various actin-related drugs. Examination of actin distribution and their elongation rate indicated that actin polymerization plays a role in ACW chirality. In contrast, CW bias was associated with transverse arcs. Using time-lapse microscopy, we found that the transverse arcs swirl CW during retrograde flow, causing the nucleus to commit to the CW-biased rotation. Further study indicates that the binding of myosin IIa and actin at transverse arcs near the dorsal surface of cells is required for CW bias.</p>
<p>ACW chirality can be explained by the right-handed axial spinning of radial fibers during polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid4">Video 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tee et al., 2015</xref>). As actin filament is formed in a right-handed double helix, it possesses an intrinsic chiral nature. During the polymerization of radial fiber, the barbed end capped by formin at focal adhesion was found to recruit new actin monomers to the filament. The tethering by formin during the recruitment of actin monomers contributes to the right-handed tilting of radial fibers, leading to ACW rotation.</p>

</fig>
<p>Our results suggest that the chiral structure of the transverse arc could be responsible for CW-swirling. The actomyosin complex in fibroblasts is arranged in a sarcomere-like structure consisting of actin and non-muscle myosin IIa. The motor domain of myosin IIa consists of two heads that can bind to the myosin-binding site on an actin filament. Importantly, during contraction, the myosin IIa molecule progresses in a left-ward “walking” motion towards the barbed end on the myosin-binding site of the actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beausang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kovács et al., 2007</xref>), covering around 10-11 nm in each step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Veigel et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, the arrangement of myosin IIa filament is assembled by the tail domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Melli et al., 2018</xref>), forming a myosin IIa bipolar filament in parallel to the actin filaments in the sarcomere-like actomyosin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, the stepwise walking of myosin IIa, which is tethered by the bundled tail, could plausibly drive a left-handed twirling of the actin filaments towards the C-terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid8">Video 8</xref>). Thus, the contraction based on left-handed-walking myosin II on actin filaments could serve as a chiral motor with torque dipole. Previous studies indicate that, when near an interface, the frictional force due to relative motion between the torque dipole and the surface, such as the cell cortex, could lead to chiral processes of the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Furthauer et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we have consistently identified that transverse arcs are part of the actin filament network near the dorsal surface of cells. Thus, the contractile sarcomere-like unit may also act as a torque dipole that “rolls” against the plasma membrane, eventually leading the transverse arcs to tilt and swirl in a CW direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid9">Video 9</xref>).</p>
<p>We propose that the imbalance between radial fibers and transverse arcs could control the reversal of chirality at the cell level. When radial fibers are dominant, radial fibers with right-screw motion would tilt rightward, accompanied with retrograde flow to establish an overall ACW rotation of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). In contrast, when the transverse arcs are dominant, the chiral processes of torque dipoles of the transverse arcs would swirl in CW, causing an overall CW rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). The transmission of chirality from the transverse arcs or the radial fibers to nucleus positioning can be regulated by Transmembrane Actin-Associated Nuclear (TAN) Lines and perinuclear actin caps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Davidson and Cadot, 2021</xref>), with TAN lines related to retrograde growth and actin caps connected to dorsal or ventral fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Luxton et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, our proposed mechanism can be a universal, cell-type independent model. In previous results regarding cell alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wan et al., 2011</xref>), the chirality of C2C12 and hMSCs showed opposite, cell-type dependent chirality. In contrast, we found that C2C12 and hMSCs exhibited similar, cell-type independent chiral reversal. Such a difference can be explained by the cell spreading area when attached to a fibronectin surface in cell culture by staining cell tracker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8S1">Discussion—figure supplement 1</xref>). With different spreading sizes for HFF-1 (2294.55 ±976.5737 μm<sup>2</sup>), C2C12 (860.8984 ±352.624 μm<sup>2</sup>), and hMSCs (4026.123 ±1828.682 μm<sup>2</sup>), the opposite chirality observed previously may simply be due to the cell spreading area on fibronectin coated surfaces falling in the range of CW rotation (C2C12) or ACW rotation (HFF-1 and hMSCs).</p>
<p>In summary, using nucleus rotation, our results indicate the main drivers for chirality, ACW chirality originates from the right-handed axial spinning growth of radial fiber, while CW chirality is driven by the retrograde flow of transverse arcs with CW swirling. An imbalance between these two classes of actin fibers through adjustment of cell spreading area or regulation of the main components of actin fibers (myosin II, α-actinin-1, mDia2, or Tpm4), cell chirality can be reversed. This finding provides a general mechanism of chirality reversal, which has broad implications applicable to different cell types and understanding of tissue morphogenesis.</p>

<p>After confluence, the nuclei of HFF-1 cells were stained by applying 2 μg/ml H33342 trihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in medium for 30 min. Cells were suspended and reseeded onto a culture dish at a density of 5000 cells per cm<sup>2</sup> and incubated in an incubator at 37 °C for 15 min for cell attachment. After removing the non-attached cells and replenishing with fresh medium, the dish was placed in a live cell incubator on a microscope stage (ChamlideTM TC incubator system, Live Cell Instrument) with 100% humidity and 5% CO2 in 37˚C. To record nuclei rotation, fluorescence images of the nuclei and phase contrast images were acquired with an Nikon Eclipse Ti-E microscope at 5 min interval for 4 h. Cell tracking and labeling was performed based on the shortest displacement by comparing the locational information of each cell at the current image and previous time interval, as shown by the trajectory of cell location for 4 h following cell attachment to the culture dish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Automated image segmentation was used to measure the angular velocity of nuclei. In brief, after image binarization, the contour of the cell nuclei was fit by an oval shape to identify its long axis. By calculating the transient angular velocity of the long axis within the time interval, angular velocity was calculated by the angle difference of the nucleus at two consecutive images, which gives the transient angular velocity of each cell of each 5 min interval for the total 4 hour and 30 min time period. By grouping measurement of all cells every 20 min, the probability of ACW or CW rotation was determined. Then, the difference between the ACW/CW percentages was compared based on the projection area and circularity, which was calculated based on cells measured in the Nikon NIS-Elements.</p>

In brief, an adaptive threshold and Gaussian filter was applied to cropped actin images to generate a binarized image of actin.

The skeleton was classified as a straight line (the aspect ratio of surrounding ellipse of the line being greater than 4) or a curved line. For straight skeletons, orientation was obtained through the acute angle difference between the long axis of ellipse and the tangential direction to the center. For curved skeletons, the orientation was calculated according to the pixel location on the curved line, determined by the 3-point spline method and the tangential line to the center.

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>For gene silencing validation, 75 nM siRNA was transfected for 24 hours and recovered for 48 hours before cell lysis. Proteins were first separated by 4–12 % SDS polyacrylamide gel (ThermoFisher) electrophoresis and transferred to a PVDF membrane (ThermoFisher). The membrane was blocked for one hour before incubation in primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight with the following dilution: GAPDH (1/1000, Cell Signaling), Tpm4 (1/800, Merck), and Diaph3 (1/1000, Abcam). This was followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1/2000, Cell Signaling) for one hour at room temperature. Protein expression was detected with Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (ThermoFisher) and the BIO-RAD ChemiDoc MP Imaging System.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Kwong et al. present evidence that two actin-filament based cytoskeletal structures regulate the clockwise and anticlockwise rotation of the cytoplasm. These claims are based on experiments using cells plated on micropatterned substrates (circles). Previous reports have shown that the actomyosin network that forms on the dorsal surface of a cell plated on a circle drives a rotational or swirling pattern of movement in the cytoplasm. This actin network is composed of a combination of non-contractile radial stress fibers (AKA dorsal stress fibers) which are mechanically coupled to contractile transverse actin arcs (AKA actin arcs). The authors claim that directionality of the rotation of the cytoplasm (i.e., clockwise or anticlockwise) depends on either the actin arcs or radial fibers, respectively. While this would interesting, the authors are not able to remove either actin-based network without effecting the other. This is not surprising, as it is likely that the radial fibers require the arcs to elongate them, and the arcs require the radial fibers to stop them from collapsing. As such, it is difficult to make simple interpretations such as the clockwise bias is driven by the arcs and anticlockwise bias is driven by the radial fibers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are also multiple problems with how the data is displayed and interpreted. First, it is difficult to compare the experimental data with the controls as the authors do not include control images in several of the figures. For example, Figure 6 has images showing myosin IIA distribution, but Figure 5 has the control image. Each figure needs to show controls. Otherwise, it will be difficult for the reader to understand the differences in localization of the proteins shown. This could be accomplished by either adding different control examples or by combining figures.</p>
<p>It is important that the authors should label the range of gray values of the heat maps shown. It is difficult to know how these maps were created. I could not find a description in the methods, nor have previous papers laid out a standardized way of doing it. As such, the reader needs some indication as to whether the maps showing different cells were created the same and show the same range of gray levels. In general, heat maps showing the same protein should have identical gray levels. The authors already show color bars next to the heat maps indicating the range of colors used. It should be a simple fix to label the minimum (blue on the color bar) and the maximum (red on the color bar) gray levels on these color bars. The profiles of actin shown in Figure 3 and Figure 3- figure supplement 3 were useful for interpretating the distribution of actin filaments. Why did not the authors show the same for the myosin IIa distributions?</p>
<p>
Line 189 &quot;This absence of radial fibers is unexpected&quot;. The authors should clarify what they mean by this statement. The claim that the cell in Figure 3B has reduced radial stress fiber is not supported by the data shown. Every actin structure in this cell is reduced compared to the cell on the larger micropattern in Figure 3A. It is unclear if the radial stress fibers are reduced more than the arcs. Are the authors referring to radial fiber elongation?</p>
<p>
The choice of the small molecule inhibitors used in this study is difficult to understand, and their results are also confusing. For example, sequestering G actin with Latrunculin A is a complicated experiment. The authors use a relatively low concentration (50 nM) and show that actin filament-based structures are reduced and there are more in the center of the cell than in controls (Figure 3E). What was the logic of choosing this concentration? Using a small molecule that binds the barbed end (e.g., cytochalasin) could conceivably be used to selectively remove longer actin filaments, which the radial fibers have compared to the lamellipodia and the transverse arcs. The authors should articulate how the actin cytoskeleton is being changed by latruculin treatment and the impact on chirality. Is it just that the radial stress fibers are not elongating? There seems to be more radial stress fibers than in controls, rather than an absence of radial stress fibers. Similar problems arise from the other small molecules as well. LPA has more effects than simply activating RhoA. Additionally, many of the quantifiable effects of LPA treatment are apparent only after the cells are serum starved, which does not seem to be the case here. Furthermore, inhibiting ROCK with, Y-27632, effects myosin light chain phosphorylation and is not specific to myosin IIA. Are the two other myosin II paralogs expressed in these cells (myosin IIB and myosin IIC)? If so, the authors' statements about this experiment should refer to myosin II not myosin IIa. None of the uses of the small molecules above have supporting data using a different experimental method. For example, backing up the LPA experiment by perturbing RhoA tho.</p>
<p>
The use of SMIFH2 as a &quot;formin inhibitor&quot; is also problematic. SMIFH2 also inhibits myosin II contractility, making interpreting its effects on cells difficult to impossible. The authors present data of mDia2 knockdown, which would be a good control for this SMIFH2. However, the authors claim that mDia2 &quot;typically nucleates tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments, which recruit myosin II and anneal endwise with α-actinin- crosslinked actin filaments.&quot; There is no reference to this statement and the authors own data shows that both arcs and radial fibers are reduced by mDia2 knockdown. Overall, the formin data does not support the conclusions the authors report.</p>
<p>
The data in Figure 7 does not support the conclusion that myosin IIa is exclusively on top of the cell. There are clear ventral stress fibers in A (actin) that have myosin IIa localization. The authors simply chose to not draw a line over them to create a height profile.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Chirality of cells, organs, and organisms can stem from the chiral asymmetry of proteins and polymers at a much smaller lengthscale. The intrinsic chirality of actin filaments (F-actin) is implicated in the chiral arrangement and movement of cellular structures including F-actin-based bundles and the nucleus. It is unknown how opposite chiralities can be observed when the chirality of F-actin is invariant. Kwong, Chen, and co-authors explored this problem by studying chiral cell-scale structures in adherent mammalian cultured cells. They controlled the size of adhesive patches, and examined chirality at different timepoints. They made various molecular perturbations and used several quantitative assays. They showed that forces exerted by antiparallel actomyosin bundles on parallel radial bundles are responsible for the chirality of the actomyosin network at the cell scale.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Whereas previously, most effort has been put into understanding radial bundles, this study makes an important distinction that transverse or circumferential bundles are made of antiparallel actomyosin arrays. A minor point that was nice for the paper to make is that between the co-existing chirality of nuclear rotation and radial bundle tilt, it is the F-actin driving nuclear rotation and not the other way around. The paper is clearly written.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The paper could benefit from grammatical editing.</p>
