<title>Abstract</title><p>Rapid conversion of force into a biological signal enables living cells to respond to mechanical forces in their environment. The force is believed to initially affect the plasma membrane and then alter the behavior of membrane proteins. Phospholipase D2 (PLD2) is a mechanosensitive enzyme that is regulated by a structured membrane-lipid site comprised of cholesterol and saturated ganglioside (GM1). Here we show stretch activation of TWIK-related K<sup>+</sup> channel (TREK-1) is mechanically evoked by PLD2 and spatial patterning involving ordered GM1 and 4,5-</p>
<p>bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) clusters. First, mechanical force deforms the ordered lipids, which lowers membrane cholesterol, disrupts the interaction of PLD2 with the GM1 lipids, and allows a complex of TREK-1 and PLD2 to associate with PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters. The association with PIP<sub>2</sub> activates the enzyme, which produces the second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) that gates the channel. Co-expression of catalytically inactive PLD2 inhibits TREK-1 stretch currents in a biological membrane. Cellular uptake of cholesterol inhibits TREK-1 currents in culture and depletion of cholesterol from astrocytes releases TREK-1 from GM1 lipids in mouse brain. Depletion of the PLD2 ortholog in flies results in hypersensitivity to mechanical force. We conclude PLD2 mechanosensitivity combines with TREK-1 ion permeability to elicit a mechanically evoked response.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All cells respond to mechanical force, a phenomenon known as mechanosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hahn and Schwartz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Julius, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ranade et al., 2015</xref>). Mechanosensation requires the dual processes of sensing and transducing mechanical force into signals that cells can interpret and respond to. Ion channels serve as one type of transducer. While certain channels have been demonstrated to directly respond to mechanical force in purified lipid environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brohawn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cox et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Teng et al., 2015</xref>), others, such as TRP channels, can be downstream components of multi-step signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kwon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wilde et al., 2022</xref>) in cellular membranes, including those involving mechanosensitive G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gudi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Storch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2018</xref>),.</p>
<p>One of these channels is TWIK-related K<sup>+</sup> channel subtype 1 (TREK-1), a mechanosensitive member of the two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) family known for its analgesic properties. TREK-1 plays a role in inhibiting neuronal firing and reducing pain through the release of potassium ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">HonorÃ©, 2007</xref>). Intriguingly, the enzyme phospholipase D2 (PLD2) directly interacts with the C-terminus of TREK-1, activating the channel by locally producing phosphatidic acid (PA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Comoglio et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite lacking a transmembrane domain, PLD2 exhibits mechanosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pavel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>). This property arises from mechanically induced changes in spatial organization of the plasma membrane. Palmitoylations of cysteine residues near its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, enables PLD2 to bind to a specific site composed of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) lipids and cholesterol in the liquid ordered (L<sub>o</sub>) region of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McDermott et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yuan and Hansen, 2023</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplemental Fig. S1a-b</xref>). Anesthetics compete with palmitates at this site which we call an anesthetic-palmitate (AP) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Call et al., 2023</xref>). Application of mechanical force disrupts the AP site, releasing the palmitates of PLD2 and allowing the PH domain to interact with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) clusters in the liquid disordered (L<sub>d</sub>) region of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>). This, in turn, triggers enzyme activation through spatial redistribution and substrate presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Petersen et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplemental Fig. S1c</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, the C-terminus responsible for binding PLD2 is essential for TREK-1 mechanosensitivity in cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brohawn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chemin et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Patel et al., 1998</xref>). Our previous studies showed the same C-terminus is essential for binding PLD2 during anesthetic activation of TREK-1. In that system, the anesthetic-induced release of PLD2 from GM1 lipids was responsible for all the TREK-1 current evoked by anesthetic in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pavel et al., 2020</xref>). These results prompted us to investigate whether PLD2âs mechanical activation in HEK293T cells contributes to a mechanically evoked TREK-1 current. Analogous to our study on TREK-1 anesthetic sensitivity, here we show that the catalytic activity of PLD2 is indispensable for the generation of mechanically evoked TREK-1 currents in cultured HEK293T cellular membranes. We further show these PLD2-dependent TREK-1 currents result from the spatial patterning of the channel and enzyme within lipid nanodomains in HEK, N2a, C2C12, and primary neurons. In neurons, this regulatory process is influenced by astrocyte-derived cholesterol.</p>

<title>Dependence on PLD2 for TREK-1 activation</title>
<p>To assess the involvement of PLD2 mechanosensitivity to a mechanically evoked current from TREK-1 channels, we conducted pressure current measurements in HEK293T cells both with and without the expression of a catalytically inactive K758R PLD2 mutant (xPLD2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Toschi et al., 2009</xref>). We selected HEK293T cells for this study due to their minimal endogenous potassium currents, which allowed us to attribute the recorded currents specifically to TREK-1. The expression of TREK-1 was tracked using an EGFP tag attached to the channels C-terminus, and we confirmed successful expression of all constructs, observing their presence on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2A-B</xref>).</p>
<p>In intact HEK293T cells, the overexpression of xPLD2 substantially inhibited nearly all mechanically evoked TREK-1 currents (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). When currents were measured in the inside out configuration under negative pressure conditions (from 0 to â60 mmHg), they exhibited a reduction of over 80% from 0.181 Â± 0.04 to 0.035 Â± 0.013 pA/Âµm<sup>2</sup>, despite an overall increase in the total levels of TREK-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2B-C</xref>). This observation suggests that if the effect is through a specific PLD2-TREK-1 interaction, then removal of the PLD2 binding domain should also inhibit PLD2-evoked currents.</p>

</fig>
<p>To investigate further, we eliminated the putative PLD2 binding site on TREK-1 by truncating the C-terminus at residue 322 (TREK trunc) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3A</xref>). The pressure induced current in TREK trunc decreased by more than 85%, measuring 0.025 Â± 0.013 pA/Âµm<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3B</xref>). Remarkably, this reduction was nearly identical to the results obtained when full-length TREK-1 (TREK FL) was expressed in conjunction with xPLD2. Importantly, previous studies have confirmed the functionality and mechanosensitivity of this similar truncated TREK-1 when reconstituted into crude soy PC lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Stephen G Brohawn et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, the overexpression of TREK-1 with wild-type (WT) mouse PLD2 (mPLD2) resulted in a substantial augmentation of TREK-1 pressure-dependent currents within HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplemental Fig. S3B</xref> for raw traces). The TREK-1-evoked currents were markedly significant, both with and without overexpression of mPLD2, when compared to xPLD2 (p&lt;0.002 and 0.007 respectively; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). HEK293T cells, like all cells, have endogenous PLD2 (enPLD2). The xPLD2 expression is &gt;10x the endogenous PLD2 (enPLD2) which we previously showed outcompetes the binding of enPLD2 to TREK-1 under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pavel et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The threshold for PLD2-dependent TREK-1 activation proved to be quite sensitive. TREK-1 exhibited responsiveness to negative pressure (ranging from 0 to â60 mmHg, in a non-saturating regime) with a half maximal pressure requirement of approximately 32 mmHg. This pressure led to the generation of up to 200 pA of TREK-1 current (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplemental Fig. S3C</xref>), aligning with findings from prior investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Stephen G Brohawn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Patel et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, previous studies demonstrated TREK-1 direct sensitivity to mechanical force in purified lipids, independent of PLD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berrier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Stephen G Brohawn et al., 2014</xref>). To delineate a PLD2-independent (i.e., direct) component of TREK-1 mechanotransduction within a cellular membrane we conducted a comparative analysis between cells expressing TREK trunc and mock transfected HEK293T cells (lacking TREK-1 expression). Our results demonstrated that TREK trunc exhibited a modest increase in current, measuring 0.046 Â± 0.023 pA/Âµm<sup>2</sup> (p=0.08, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> inset), when compared to the condition with no TREK-1. Similarly, in cells expressing xPLD2 alongside full-length TREK-1, the channel exhibited a small increase in current measuring 0.060 Â± 0.035 pA/Âµm<sup>2</sup> (p=0.11). This PLD2 independent current aligns with direct mechanical activation of TREK-1 observed in liposomes. However, it is important to note that we cannot rule out the possibility of other contributing mechanisms.</p>
<p>Due to the minimal pressure-activated TREK-1 current observed in the presence of xPLD2, we conducted control experiments to validate the presence of functional TREK-1 on the plasma membraneâchannels capable of conducting current. TREK-1 is a potassium leak channel with inherent basal currents in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Comoglio et al., 2014</xref>). It is reasonable to assume that the basal current arises from the presence of basal levels of anionic lipids in the cellular membrane.</p>
<p>As anticipated, we observed TREK-1 basal current both in the presence (16.9 Â± 4.3pA/pF) and absences (24.0 Â± 4.2 pA/pF) of xPLD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Comoglio et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). These basal resting currents were recorded at 0 mV in HEK293T cells over expressing TREK-1 FL with and without xPLD2. Notably, the current in the presence of xPLD2 was significantly higher than that observed in a nonfunctional control TREK-1 (xTREK), which we previously determined to exhibit no measurable current in unrelated studies. These controls affirm that TREK-1 FL is expressed and functionally active in the presence of xPLD2. Moreover, they highlight the essential role of PLD2 in pressure-activated currents (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), contrasting with the basal leak currents (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>; TREK FL, grey bar vs. +xPLD2, red bar), which did not necessitate PLD2.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Mechanical activation of TREK-1 by movement between nanodomains</title>
<p>As previously reported in a prior publication, we proposed that fluid shear induces the disassociation of PLD2 with cholesterol dependent GM1 clusters and the association with PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters, leading to a change in spatial organization and activation of the enzyme (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>). Given that TREK-1 binds to PLD2, we hypothesized the channel could undergo a similar mechanically induced spatial reorganization between GM1 and PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters. To visualize this spatial patterning of TREK-1 in response to shear forces, we developed a method to chemically fix membranes during shear (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In our experiments, we employed cultured HEK293T cells expressing both TREK-1 and mPLD, which matched the conditions used in our electrophysiology experiments. These cells were subjected to shear forces of 3 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>, a physiologically relevant force to cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schneck, 1992</xref>), using a rotary shear approach. Subsequently, the cells were fixed and labeled for two- or three-color dSTORM. TREK-1 proteins were tagged with EGFP, leveraging its inherent self-blinking properties for detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Call et al., 2023</xref>). Lipids were labeled using Alexa 647 (A647) anti-PIP<sub>2</sub> antibodies or A647-labeled cholera toxin B (CTxB), which selectively bind to PIP<sub>2</sub> and GM1 clusters, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>). By concurrently labeling both lipids and proteins, we were able to monitor the dynamic changes in spatial organization within nanoscopic lipid domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yuan and Hansen, 2023</xref>). To access the PIP<sub>2</sub> domains on the inner leaflet, cells were permeabilized (see methods). The effectiveness of cellular staining was confirmed through confocal microscopy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2A-G</xref>).</p>

<p>Before the application of shear forces, TREK-1 and GM1 lipids displayed a robust correlation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C</xref>), suggesting a close association between TREK-1 and GM1 lipids. However, after the application of shear forces, this correlation significantly diminished (p&lt;0.01 at 50 nm). A similar experiment using a cy3b-labeled anti-TREK-1 antibody yielded nearly identical results, confirming the validity of both our EGFP-dSTORM method and the specificity of the TREK-1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2A</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the release of TREK-1 from GM1 lipids, we anticipated that it would undergo a nanoscale repositioning toward PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters. PIP<sub>2</sub> forms distinct nanodomains that are separate from GM1 clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">van den Bogaart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wang and Richards, 2012</xref>) by an average distance of approximately 133 nm in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>). Cells were subjected to shear forces of 3 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>, permeabilized, fixed, and subsequently labeled with an anti-PIP<sub>2</sub> antibody. As predicted, the correlation between TREK-1 and PIP<sub>2</sub> was initially low prior to shear application, but it significantly increased after shear forces were applied (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), in contrast to the observations made with GM1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Therefore, shear forces induce TREK-1 to disassociate from GM1 clusters and associate with PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters. Statistical analysis using a Studentâs t test confirmed the significance of TREK-1 clustering with PIP<sub>2</sub> at both a single radius and multiple point comparisons along the curve.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we investigated the rearrangement of TREK-1 induced by shear forces in the presence of xPLD2. Like mPLD2, we overexpressed xPLD2 in HEK293T cells, mirroring the conditions employed in our electrophysiology experiments in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>. Furthermore, as with mPLD2, HEK293T cells were subjected to shear forces, permeabilized, labeled, and imaged with two-color dSTORM.</p>
<p>In the presence of xPLD2, shear caused TREK-1 to leave GM1 domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). However, unlike the response observed with mPLD2, the association of TREK-1 with PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters remained relatively weak following shear forces (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), despite an overall increase in TREK-1 and PIP<sub>2</sub> levels in the membrane prior to shear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2C-D</xref>). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> shows a model of shear induced movement of TREK-1 from GM1 to PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters.</p>

<title>Mechanism of PLD2 activation by shear</title>
<p>It is presumed that TREK-1 translocates between nanodomains as a complex with PLD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Comoglio et al., 2014</xref>). Lacking its own palmitoylation, TREK-1 interacts with PLD2 through its unstructured C-terminus. In earlier research, we demonstrated that cholesterol drives PLD2 associates with GM1 lipids. The application of mechanical force activated PLD2, presumably through the release of PLD2 from GM1 lipids. However, this PLD2 patterning under mechanical shear has not been directly demonstrated with dSTORM.</p>
<p>To validate our proposed mechanism regarding the shear-induced movement of PLD2 with dSTORM, we employed calibrated shear chambers (ibidi Âµ-Slide I<sup>0.4</sup> parallel-plate) with cultured C2C12 muscle cells (mouse myocytes) and N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells, which naturally express TREK-1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2E</xref>). Utilizing endogenous expression helped circumvent potential artifacts that may arise from artificially saturating GM1 clusters through protein overexpression.</p>
<p>Our shear experiments were initiated by perfusing phosphate buffered saline (PBS) through the calibrated shear chambers, applying a precisely controlled force of 3 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>. To maintain a constant temperature of 37 â, we employed a digitally controlled inline heater. Immediately following the application of shear forces (within &lt;10 seconds), we introduced fixative agents into the shear buffer, facilitating the rapid fixation of cells in their mechanically stimulated state. This approach paralleled the methodology used in our experiments involving rotary shear (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5a</xref>), but with tighter control of temperature.</p>

<p>Utilizing two-color dSTORM and analysis by the pair correlation function, we observed that shear forces introduce the mobilization of PLD2 within the cell membrane, and this effect was independent of temperature fluctuations. Prior to the application of shear forces, PLD2 exhibited a strong association with GM1 clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). However, after the application of shear forces, the correlation of PLD2 with GM1 clusters decreased significantly, while it robustly increased in association with PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Notably, the release of PLD2 from GM1 domains induced by shear forces was more pronounced than the disruption caused by anesthetic agents, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pavel et al., 2020</xref>). The stability in temperature, maintained within a range of Â± 0.1â, suggests the mechanism is unlikely to be attributed to the thermal melting of ordered lipids near a phase transition state.</p>
<p>Conducting cluster analysis of GM1 particles subjected to shear revealed a notable reduction in the apparent size of GM1 clusters, decreasing from 167Â±3 to 131Â±3 nm (approximately 20%, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) in C2C12 cells. A similar effect on the size of GM1 clusters was also observed in N2a cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters also remained largely intact with a reduction in size (from 154Â±1 to 139Â±1) after shear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5B</xref>).</p>
<p>The observed reduction in cluster size closely resembled the outcomes of prior experiments in which we depleted cholesterol with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pavel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>). Given that MBCD is a known cholesterol removal agent, we conducted assays on N2a cells subjected to orbital fluid shear (3 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>) to examine changes in cholesterol levels. The cells were subjected to 10 min of shear at 37 â, followed by fixation.</p>
<p>Our results revealed a 25% reduction in free cholesterol levels in N2a cells exposed to orbital shear (p&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), which coincided with the activation of PLD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Importantly, this decrease in cholesterol was statistically significant p&lt;0.0001 and reversible. Allowing the cells to recover for approximately 30 seconds prior to fixation resulted in the restoration of cholesterol levels to those observed in non-sheared cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>In C2C12 cells, TREK-1 and PLD2 exhibited a strong correlation both before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5C</xref>, grey trace) and after shear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5C</xref>, red trace), providing further evidence that they form a complex at least intermittently, in both shear and unsheared states. Following shear, a minor fraction of TREK-1 was found to associate with PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5D</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to HEK293T cells, C2C12 cells displayed minimal TREK-1/GM1 correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5E</xref>, grey trace). Notably, PLD2 regulation is known to be influenced cholesterol(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>). In various cell types, we have observed that cultured cells tend to have lower cholesterol levels than human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>). These observations lead us to consider the possibility of higher levels of cholesterol in our experimental setup for cultured cells.</p>

<title>Regulation of TREK-1 clustering by cholesterol and GM1 lipids</title>
<p>Cholesterol levels, especially in the brain, can be notably high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hansen, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhang and Liu, 2015</xref>). We hypothesized that cholesterol might influence the endogenous TREK-1 to associate with PLD2 in GM1 clusters. To test this hypothesis, we introduced cholesterol into C2C12 cells using apolipoprotein E (apoE) lipidated with 10% serum, as apoE is a naturally occurring cholesterol transport protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>) (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Remarkably, lipidated apoE induced a substantial clustering of TREK-1 with GM1 lipids in membranes of C2C12 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). This effect was also observed with TREK-1 in N2a cells.

<p>We anticipated that the cholesterol-induced association of TREK-1 with GM1 lipids would lead to a reduction in TREK-1 currents, as PLD2 would be inhibited due to a lack of substrate. To directly assess the activity of TREK-1 under conditions of elevated cellular cholesterol, we overexpressed TREK-1 in HEK293T cells and quantified the current density in whole cell patch clamp mode, both with and without cholesterol uptake (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Consistent with our proposed model, TREK-1 current density decreased nearly 2.5-fold in cholesterol-loaded cells, and this reduction in current was statistically significant (p&lt; 0.05).</p>
<p>In our earlier investigation, we established that astrocytes play a pivotal role in regulating the clustering of proteins in neurons. This regulation is achieved through the release of apoE-containing particles, which are primarily laden with cholesterol. Remarkably, our studies revealed that cholesterol amplifies the clustering of proteins within GM1 domains. Furthermore, we demonstrated that disrupting the cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes leads to the reversal of protein clustering, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). It stands to reason that the same astrocytic cholesterol dynamics could govern the localization of TREK-1 within GM1 lipids in the brain of a mouse.</p>
<p>To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation of TREK-1 clustering by astrocytes, we stained 50-micron brain slices obtained from both control mice and mice specifically engineered to lack cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes. The depletion of cholesterol from astrocytes was achieved by targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), a crucial regulator of cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ferris et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Before slicing, the brains underwent fixation via whole-body perfusion. The resulting free-floating brain slices were mounted onto circular cover slips using a fiberglass filter paper, which facilitated dSTORM buffer access to the tissue with minimal background interference (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4E</xref>). These brain slices, taken from coronal sections near the hippocampus were subjected to staining with cy3b-anti-TREK-1 antibody and A647-CTxB. The imaging process encompassed multiple unspecified locations (approximately 10 regions), and subsequent analysis was performed employing the pair correlation function.</p>
<p>In flox control mice (wild type SREBP2), TREK-1/GM1 correlation exhibited a distinct pattern, with TREK-1 clustering near GM1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>), aligning with the GM1 correlation seen in N2a cells with elevated levels of cholesterol (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). As anticipated, in the brains of mice with astrocyte-specific SREBP2 deficiency, TREK-1 displayed a reduced association with GM1 lipids (p&lt;0.0001). These findings serve as compelling evidence that, in the brain of an animal, astrocytic cholesterol serves as a critical regulator of TREK-1âs affinity for inhibitory GM1 clusters.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref> presents a comprehensive model detailing the regulation of TREK-1 by astrocyte-derived cholesterol, using the insights derived from both cultured cells and <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies. In this model, cholesterol originating from astrocytes is transported to neurons via apoE. Under conditions of elevated membrane cholesterol, TREK-1 forms associations with inhibitory GM1 lipids, a scenario in which PLD2 has limited substrate availability. Conversely, when membrane cholesterol levels are reduced, TREK-1 relocates away from GM1 lipids toward activating PIP<sub>2</sub> lipids. In this context, PLD2 gains improved access to its substrate phosphatidylcholine (PC), leading to the production of lipid agonists such as PA, which ultimately evoke activation of the TREK-1 channel.</p>

<title>Direct activation of PLD2 by osmotic stretch</title>
<p>Osmotic stretch is a well-documented activator of TREK-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Patel et al., 1998</xref>). To investigate whether osmotic stretch also activates PLD2, we conducted experiments to monitor PLD product release in live cells subjected to hypotonic stretch.

<p>Subsequently, we conducted dSTORM experiments to investigate whether stretch had the capacity to release PLD2 from GM1 lipids within the membranes of N2a cells. In these experiments, cells were exposed to either a hypotonic solution with an osmolality of 70 mOsm (indicating a state of swelling) or an isotonic solution with an osmolality of 310 mOsm (representing a control condition) for 15 min at 37 â. Following this treatment, the cells were fixed, labeled, and subjected to imaging using the same procedures employed in the shear stress experiments. Our results, consistent with the outcomes of shear stress experiments and PLD2 assay, clearly demonstrated a discernible shift in the spatial distribution of PLD2, transitioning from ordered GM1 clusters to the PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters after osmotic stretch (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-D</xref>).</p>

Animals with or without the pld<sup>null</sup> gene were stimulated by increasing amounts of mechanical vibration (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">supplemental Fig. S6</xref>). Flies lacking PLD2 had a decreased threshold (i.e., more sensitivity to mechanical stimulation) compared to genetically matched controls (w1118) (p=0.02, n= 28-29), consistent with the prediction that PA decreases excitability of nerves.

(<bold>G</bold>) Proposed role of PLD2 in regulating mechanical thresholds. PA is a signaling lipid in the membrane that activates hyperpolarizing channels and transporters. When PA is low the membrane is less polarized, and cells are more sensitive to mechanical activation. The downstream targets are unknown (shown with a â?â). Flies lack a known mechanosensitive TREK-1 homolog.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Subsequently, we preceded to examine the <italic>in vivo</italic> role for PA in mechanosensation employing single-animal measurements of arousal threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Murphy et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">2016</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig. S6A</xref>). The arousal assay quantifies the amount of mechanical stimulation required to elicit movement from a resting fly. Over a period of 24 hours, the flies were exposed to a series of incremental vibrational stimuli every 30 minutes. For each series, the threshold of stimulation necessary to induce movement in the fly, as indicated by observable motion, was recorded using automated machine vision tracking. These recorded measurements were then compared to genetically matched control groups.</p>
<p>PLD<sup>null</sup> flies exhibited a notably lower arousal threshold compared to their control counterparts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). This lower arousal implies an increased sensitivity to mechanical force. Furthermore, we employed a neuronal-specific driver, Nsyb GAL4, in conjunction with a PLD RNAi line (PLD-KD) to investigate the role of PLD in the central nervous system. The neuronal knockdown of PLD yielded a similar increase in mechanosensitivity, providing clear evidence that this phenotype is specific to neuronal functions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we conducted assessments to determine the role of PLD in fly shock avoidance, serving as a measure of an adverse electrical stimulus. To assess their responses, PLD-KD flies were positioned at the choice-point of a T maze, where they were given the option to select between a chamber inducing a noxious shock or a non-shock control chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Drago and Davis, 2016</xref>). Flies were subjected to incrementally increasing voltages of electrical shock. Our findings revealed that PLD<sup>null</sup> flies exhibited heightened sensitivity to electric shock compared to control groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E-F</xref>). In <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>, we present a potential model illustrating how PA may contribute to mechanosensitivity in a fly.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, our findings collectively demonstrate that the spatial distribution of TREK-1 and PLD2 in association with GM1 and PIP<sub>2</sub> lipids, along with the generation of PLD2-derived PA, are essential for eliciting the complete mechanically evoked current from TREK-1 in a biological membrane. Furthermore, the disruption of PLD2 localization within a lipid nanodomain provides a compelling explanation for how the C-terminus confers mechanosensitivity to a channel, particularly when the domain lacks structural integrity.</p>
<p>In contrast, the activation of purified TREK-1 in soy PC does not necessitate the involvement of the C-terminus, as indicated by prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Stephen G Brohawn et al., 2014</xref>). This observation implies the existence of a PLD2-independent mechanism of action. The precise relative contributions of the two mechanisms in endogenous tissue remain unclear. Notably, in HEK293T cells, a current density of 0.05 pA/cm<sup>2</sup> current density (representing less than 10% of the total stretch current) was found to be PLD2 independent (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> inset). This observation raises the possibility that the localization of TREK-1 to mechanosensitive lipids essential for its activation might be lacking in this context, or alternatively, the propagation of tension within the plasma membrane might differ. Consequently, there is a need for a more comprehensive understanding of TREK-1 spatial patterning within specific cell types, coupled with an understanding of stretch induced tension in the different lipid nanodomains. Furthermore, it is plausible that a portion of the PLD2-dependent stretch current merely augments the direct mechanosensitivity of TREK-1. However, it is important to note that this enhancement mechanism is not obligatory, as the channel is directly activated by PA in purified lipids absent stretch and tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cabanos et al., 2017</xref>). This can also explain the discrepancies between liposome-based Mechanosensitivity since crude soy extracts (azolectin) are known to contain anionic lipids, thus may negate the need for a C-terminus and providing the PA needed for full TREK activation.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, PLD2 is a soluble enzyme that associates with the membrane through palmitate. Given its lack of a transmembrane domain, mechanisms of mechanosensation involving hydrophobic mismatch, tension, midplane bending, and curvature can be largely ruled out, leaving the kinetic mechanism as the most plausible. The palmate moiety establishes van der Waals bonds with the GM1 lipids. The disruption of these bonds is necessary for PLD to disassociate from GM1 lipids, suggesting a mechanism akin to âshear thinningâ within GM1 clusters. Shear thinning is a term in rheology that describes the phenomenon wherein viscous mixtures become less viscous in response to shear or stretching forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼ksÃ¶nmez and Servantie, 2020</xref>). This process is inherently kinetic in nature and operates by mechanically disrupting noncovalent bonds, thereby allowing the molecules to move relative to one another (See <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5F</xref> for detailed description).</p>
<p>The spatial patterning of TREK-1 with PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters may depend on the channelâs conformational state, as evidenced by the observation that xPLD/TREK-1 combination exhibited reduced associated with PIP<sub>2</sub> after shear compared to the mPLD/TREK-1 combination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D,F</xref>) despite an increase in the levels of PIP<sub>2</sub> and TREK-1 expression prior to shear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2C-D,G</xref>). This observation aligns with the up down model of the gating helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Stephen G. Brohawn et al., 2014</xref>). As illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, we propose a theoretical mechanism that accounts for the coordinated signaling involving PA and for combined PA signaling and direct force from lipid in a biological membrane. This mechanism suggests that conformational changes conducive to the helix-up (open) position is sustained only when PLD2 is present and capable of producing localized PA. In the absence of PA, PIP<sub>2</sub> forces the channel closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cabanos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chemin et al., 2007b</xref>) and the helix in the down position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3E-F</xref>).</p>
<p>In control experiments that estimated protein levels through fluorescent labeling, we observed a significant decrease in TREK-1 protein levels after fixation with mPLD2 or shear for 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2G</xref>). While it is conceivable that this decline in protein levels might have occurred in less than 2 milliseconds, i.e., faster than we are able to observe (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3D</xref>), which could explain the loss of TREK-1 current in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, independent of local PA gating of TREK-1, endocytosis, the process that removes TREK-1 from the plasma membrane, is not likely to occur in less than 2 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the reduction in TREK-1 levels was comparable when wt. PLD2 was employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2G</xref>), suggesting that alterations in protein levels are unlikely to account for the diminished TREK-1 pressure currents observed with xPLD2 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that PLD2 is recognized for its ability to enhance endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Du et al., 2004</xref>). Specifically, xPLD2 has been shown to inhibit both agonist induced and constitutive endocytosis of Âµ-opioid receptor, effectively retaining the receptor on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Koch et al., 2006</xref>). The phenomenon of membrane retention is not unique to the Âµ-opioid receptor but extends to many proteins including Rho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wheeler et al., 2015</xref>), ARF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rankovic et al., 2009</xref>), and ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Du et al., 2004</xref>) among others. Consequently, it is not surprising that the overexpression of xPLD resulted in an increase in TREK-1 surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2C,G</xref>). Conversely, the overexpression of mPLD led to the lowest levels of TREK_1 expression, which aligns with its propensity for promoting endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2G,H</xref>). Given that mPLD2 yielded the highest mechanically evoked TREK-1 current despite the lowest protein levels, it appears unlikely that protein expression levels are the limiting factor governing mechanically evoked TREK-1 currents in HEK293T cells.</p>
<p>The latency of PLD2 dependent activation is important as it offers insights into the potential physiological processes in which PLD2 may play a role in mechanotransduction. Drawing from estimates involving diffusion from GM1 to PIP<sub>2</sub>, we estimated a latency of â¼650 Î¼s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>). To establish an upper temporal limit for PLD2 to become activated and generate PA in proximity to TREK-1, we leveraged the rate of increase in TREK-1 activity observed with WT PLD2. We observed initial TREK-1 currents almost immediately and these currents became notably significant within 2.1 ms at a pressure of 60 mmHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3D</xref>). This timeframe is highly likely to be faster than the margin of error associated with our instrument setup. While we did not perform a precise calibration of our setupâs error, conservative estimates based on manufacturer specifications suggest an upper limit of approximately 10 milliseconds.</p>
<p>The requirement for both PLD2 activity and the C-terminus to activate TREK-1 by pressure provides further validation for the previously proposed conclusion that TREK-1 is gated by a local high concentration of PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cabanos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Comoglio et al., 2014</xref>). In theory, PLD2 activity could elevate global PA levels to a point where TREK-1 becomes activated without the need for spatial patterning through protein-protein interactions. However, our experiments with truncated TREK-1 and 60 mmHg pressure in HEK293T cells did not support this hypothesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings regarding the mechanism we identified remained consistent across cell types (HEK, N2a, C2C12, mouse neurons) despite their significant differences in cellular characteristics. We were able to induce protein-lipid domain associations in all these cell types through the manipulation of cholesterol levels. This intriguing observation suggests a potential avenue of research to investigate whether cholesterol or other lipids undergo significant changes at sites where mechanosensation is known to occur, such as at the termini of low- or high-threshold mechanoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Handler and Ginty, 2021</xref>). Itâs conceivable that various neuronal types and the channels localized within them adapt to different types of mechanosensation by modulating the lipid environment where sensory perception is most critical. For instance, inflammation-induced cholesterol uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hansen and Wang, 2023</xref>) might sensitize channels to pain perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Petersen et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, our experiments with flies highlight the importance of the upstream effectors in these systems. While the specific binding partners for PLD2 and its potential downstream effects in flies remain unknown, the observed phenotypes strongly suggest that PLD plays a crucial role in normal sensory perception which appears to be more evolutionarily conserved than TREK-1. It is possible that a single lipid or a mechanism regulating multiple channels simultaneously may have a more significant impact compared to the modulation of a single channel.</p>
<p>The regulation of mechanosensation and electric shock responses in Drosophila by PA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) provides <italic>in vivo</italic> support for the growing understanding of the role of anionic lipids in setting force-sensing thresholds. For example, PIP<sub>2</sub> sets the threshold for mechanical B-cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wan et al., 2018</xref>), while sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid similar to PA, regulates pain in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hill et al., 2018</xref>). The activation of PLD2 by mechanical force and substrate presentation helps elucidate how an enzyme could directly set pain thresholds and mechanosensitivity via canonical mechanosensitive ion channels and endocytosis.</p>
<p>Palmitoylation, a modification found in many important signaling molecules including tyrosine kinases, GTPases, CD4/8, and almost all G-protein alpha subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aicart-Ramos et al., 2011</xref>), can target proteins to GM1 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Levental et al., 2010</xref>). The spatial patterning of these palmitoylated proteins or their binding partner, by mechanical force may alter the availability of substrates and affect downstream signaling. Spatial patterning along with its effect on palmitoylated G-proteins likely contributes to the mechanosensitivity observed in many GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gudi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Storch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Many ion channels are also palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shipston, 2011</xref>). For example, the voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<sub>v</sub>)1.9 clusters with GM1 lipids, and disrupting this clustering (e.g., by chemically removing cholesterol) induces a corresponding pain response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amsalem et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wan et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), an anionic lipid similar to PA, regulates pain in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hill et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, itâs worth noting that PIP2 gates many ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cabanos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hansen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>), and the spatial patterning induced by PIP2 should be considered in combination with the direct effect of the lipid on the channel. Cholesterol, known to bind directly to and modulate channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Levitan et al., 2014</xref>), should also be considered separately from its influence on spatial patterning through GM1 lipids. These direct lipid effects are likely to interact with spatial patterning to collectively regulate the biochemical processes within a cell.</p>

<p>HEK293T cells (ATCC Cat# CRL-3216, RRID:CVCL_0063) were cultured in DMEM (Corning cellgro) with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Âµg/mL streptomycin. Cells were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated 12 mm microscope cover glass at approximately 12h, 36h, or 60 hours before transfection with genes for target proteins. Transfections were performed using X-tremeGENE 9 DNA transfection agent (Roche Diagnostics). Full-length human TREK-1(TREK-1 FL) with C-terminus GFP tag in pCEH vector was obtained from Dr. Stephen Long. Mouse PLD2 constructs (mPLD2) and inactive mutant (K758R single mutation, xPLD2) without GFP tag in pCGN vector were provided by Dr. Michael Frohman. TREK-1 constructs were co-transfected with mPLD2 or xPLD2 at a 1:4 ratio (0.5g of TREK-1 and 2g of PLD DNA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Comoglio et al., 2014</xref>). All the salts for internal/external solutions were purchased from either Sigma or Fisher Scientific.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>The transfected HEK293T cells were used in 24â¼36 hours after transfection for standard excised inside-out patch-clamp recordings of TREK-1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Stephen G Brohawn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Comoglio et al., 2014</xref>). Currents were recorded at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices). Borosilicate glass electrode pipettes (B150-86-10, Sutter Instrument) were pulled with the Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Model P-1000, Sutter instrument) resulting in 3â¼6 MÎ© resistances with the pipette solution (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 3 MgCl2, 10 TEA-Cl, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH). Bath solution consists of (in mM): 140 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 TEA-Cl, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted with KOH). Low concentration of TEA (10 mM), was added into both pipette/bath solutions to block the endogenous potassium channels in HEK293T cells. Patch electrodes were wrapped with parafilm to reduce capacitance. Currents measured using Clampex 10.3(Molecular Devices) were filtered at 1 kHz, sampled at 20 kHz, and stored on a hard disk for later analysis.</p>
<p>Pressure clamping on the patch was performed using high speed pressure clamping system (ALA Scientific) through the Clampex control. Data was analyzed off-line by a homemade procedure using IgorPro 6.34A (WaveMetrics).</p>
<p>TREK-1 current, either co-expressed with mPLD2 or xPLD2 was activated by negative pressure steps from 60 to 0 mmHg in 10 mmHg decrements at +30 mV membrane potential, and 5 traces for each case were recorded and averaged for the analysis. Patch size was estimated using the current density (I_density; pA/Âµm<sup>2</sup>). Then, a Boltzman equation, I_density = base + {max/[1+exp((P50-P)/slope)]} was used to fit the data with a constraint of base=1 due to poor saturation of the current at high pressure. P is the applied pressure, P50 is the pressure that activates 50% of maximum current measured (non-saturating), and slope shows the sensitivity of current activation by pressure. In some experiments with hTREK-1+xPLD2 co-expression where the activated currents were too small to fit to the Boltzman equation, the current amplitude at P=-30 mmHg (I_m30) was compared with its 5x standard deviation(I_5xSD). If I_m30 &lt; I_5xSD, the experiment was excluded from the Boltzman equation fitting and corresponding P50-slope analysis. This empirical rule (we call it 5xSD rule) can discern 4 out of 5 wild type (TREK-1 FL) cell-attached recording cases as null experiments suggesting that it could be a usable/useful empirical criterion for our experiment. Then, the current density at â60 mmHg and P50-slope data were used for statistical analysis. Mann Whitney test was done to assess statistical significance using Prism6 (GraphPad software), and outliers were eliminated using a built-in function in Prism with Q = 1 %. The values represented are Mean +/- SEM.</p>

<title>Fixed cell preparation</title>
<p>Cells (C2C12, HEK293T and N2a) were grown to 80% confluence (C2C12 were allowed to differentiate overnight in serum free media). Cells were rinsed, treated as needed, and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min to fix both protein and lipids. Glutaraldehyde was reduced with 0.1% NaBH4 for 7 min followed by three-10 min washes with PBS. Cells were permeabilized for 15 min with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% BSA/0.05% Triton/PBS at rt. for 90 min. Primary antibody (PLD2, Cell Signaling #13891; TREK-1, Santa Cruz #sc-50412; PIP<sub>2</sub>, Echelon Biosciences #z-P045) was added to a solution of 5% BSA/0.05% Triton/PBS for 60 min at rt at a concentration of 1:100 followed by 5 washes with 1%BSA/0.05% Triton/PBS for 15 min each. Secondary antibody (Life Technologies #A21244 and A21235; cy3B antibodies were produced as described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>)) was added in the same buffer as primary for 30 min at rt followed by 5 washes as above. A single 5 min wash with PBS was followed by a post-fix with fixing mixture, as above, for 10 min w/o shaking. This was followed by three-5 min. washes with PBS and two-3 min. washes with dH2O. Cells only receiving CTxB treatment were not permeabilized.</p>
<p>The dual-fixation protocol is used to minimize any effects from post-fixation aberrations. While always good practice for super-resolution in general, this dual fixation also ensures that the movement of any molecule of interest which may not have been immobilized by the initial fixation can be fully immobilized after labeling since the antibodies or toxins used for labeling will be efficiently cross-linked during this post-labeling fixation step. While some have proposed that this problem should be solved by adding the label before the initial fixation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>) we believe that in the absence of easily-attainable monomeric labeling molecules it would have likely led to clustering artifacts due to the (often) multimeric nature of the labeling proteins.</p>
<p>For cells loaded with cholesterol, 4 ug/mL apolipoprotein E3 (BioLegend, USA) was mixed with fresh 10% FBS and applied to the cells for 1hr prior to shear and or fixing.</p>
<p>Shear force was applied to cells in ibidi Âµ-Slide I<sup>0.4</sup> Luer chambers with a flow rate calibrated to apply 3.0 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>. Fixation media (see above) was applied to cells using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus PHD ULTRA) and kept at 37Â°C using an in-line heater (Warner SH-27B).</p>
<p>TREK-1 in HEK293T cells was labeled with a EGFP concatenated to the C-Terminus of full-length human TREK-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3b</xref>), or by applying anti-TREK-1 antibody (sc-398449, Santa Cruz) conjugated to cy3b(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>).

<title>Super-resolution dSTORM</title>
<p>Images were recorded with a Vutara 352 and VXL super-resolution microscopes (Bruker Nano Surfaces, Salt Lake City, UT) which is based on the 3D Biplane approach. Super-resolution images were captured using a Hamamatsu ORCA Flash4.0 sCMOS camera and a 60x water objective with numerical aperture 1.2. Data were analyzed by the Vutara SRX software (version 5.21.13 for the data in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>â<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and version 7.0.07 for the data in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Single molecules were identified by their brightness frame by frame after removing the background. Identified particles were then localized in three dimensions by fitting the raw data in a customizable region of interest (typically 16 X16 pixels) centered on each particle in each plane with a 3D model function that was obtained from recorded bead data sets. Fit results were stored as data lists for further analysis.</p>
<p>Fixed samples were imaged using a 647 nm and 561 nm excitation lasers, respectively, and 405 nm activation laser in photo switching buffer comprising of 20 mM cysteamine (Sigma, #30070), 1% betamercaptoethanol (BME) (Sigma, #63689) and oxygen scavengers (glucose oxidase, GLOX) (Sigma #G2133) and catalase (Sigma #C40)) in 50mM Tris (Affymetrix, #22638100)+10 mM NaCl (Sigma, #S7653) +10% glucose (Sigma, #G8270) at pH 8.0 at 50 Hz and maximal powers of 647 nm, 561 nm and 405 lasers set to 8, 10, and 0.05 kW cm-2 respectively.</p>
<p>Three-color EGFP-STORM. The dSTORM with EGFP (EGFP-STORM) was performed identical to the two-color dSTORM described above except that a 488 laser was also used to excite EGFP and PIP<sub>2</sub> and CTxB were directly conjugated with fluorescent dyes (Atto 647 and cy3b 555 respectively) obviating the need for fluorescent secondary antibodies. TREK-1 and PIP2 antibodies were conjugated with NHS esters of either Cy3B or Atto 647. 1.5 mg of antibody was conjugated to 3 ng of dye in 1M NaHCO3 buffer pH 8 for 1 hour at room tempurature and separate on a NAP-5 desalting column. The acquisition was performed with no 405-activation laser in GLOX/BME buffer. The GLOX/BME buffer was not required for EGFP blinking, but it did improve the fluorescence and the number of localization particles determined. The resolution TREK-1 localizations determined by EGFP_TREK-1 and cy3b labeled anti TREK-1 antibody were comparable (45-50 nm resolution).</p>
<p>The pair correlation function g(r) and cluster analysis were performed using the Statistical Analysis package in the Vutara SRX software. Pair correlation analysis is a statistical method used to determine the strength of correlation between two objects by counting the number of points of probe 2 within a certain donut-radius of each point of probe 1. This allows for localization to be determined without overlapping pixels as done in traditional diffraction-limited microscopy. For three-color EGFP-STORM probes 1 and 3 and 2 and 3 were also compared using the pair correlation function. Localization at super resolution is beyond techniques appropriate for diffraction-limited microscopy such as Pearsonâs correlation coefficient. Lipid cluster size was determined using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm also included as part of the Vutara SRX software.</p>

Flies were allowed to acclimate to behavior room conditions for &gt;30 min (dim red light, â¼75% humidity) before each assay. Shock avoidance was tested by placing flies in a T-maze where they could choose between an arm shocking at the indicated voltage every 2 seconds and an arm without shock. Flies were given 2 min to choose which arm, after which flies were collected and counted to determine the shock avoidance index for each voltage and genotype. Control and knockout flies were alternated to avoid any preference and the arm used for shock was also alternated to control for any non-shock preference in the T-maze itself. Shock avoidance index (AI) was calculated as AI= (# flies shock arm-# flies control arm)/# flies total.

<title>Supplemental Discussion</title>
<p>In our study, we utilized cholera toxin B (CTxB) and antibody probes for lipid labeling, recognizing that these lipid probes have previously been shown to induce artificial clustering in unfixed cells a phenomenon referred to as âantibody patchingâ(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Moon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Petersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>). Antibody patching has historically served as a useful tool to segregate proteins within biological membrane, facilitating the determination of their precise localization(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yuan and Hansen, 2023</xref>). In the context of our research, we anticipate that antibody patching might similarly affect lipid distribution, offering a valuable advantage in clearly elucidating the co-localization of proteins with lipids in the membrane.</p>
<p>To address concerns related to potential artifacts stemming from clustering, we adopted a two-step fixation procedure. Initially, cells were fixed during treatment to minimize lipid mobility, followed by a second fixation step after labeling, ensuring fixed antibodies and high localization precision during dSTORM. Additionally, we assessed lipid diffusion after fixing, using our typical experimental protocols. In our system, combined paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde effectively inhibited GM1 lipid diffusion, as confirmed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments conducted in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5g-h</xref>)).</p>
<p>It is also worth considering potential artifacts arising from variations in labeling density and overcounting, which could impact the size of the lipid clusters analyzed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. We quantified the amount of fluorescent labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5h</xref>) and observed a slight reduction in GM1 and PIP<sub>2</sub> labeling after shear, although this change did not reach statistical significance.</p>
<p>The mechanical disruption of PLD2 with GM1 lipids and its association with PIP<sub>2</sub> was determined by the pair correlation function, a method that is robust against artifacts associated with changes in labeling density(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Coltharp et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, our data indicating the movement of proteins between domains remains largely independent of potential artifacts stemming from artificial clustering(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Moon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Petersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>). This conclusion is further supported by the consistency of dSTORM results obtained using both EGFP and cy3b-anti-TREK-1 antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>The role of lipids and lipid order in mechano-transduction.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>)The plasma membrane is composed of lipids which can cluster into separate and distinct domains with unique properties such as thickness and charge. Domains for saturated gangliosides (GM1) are shown separate from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>). These domains contain proteins which are targeted to the domain through post-translational acylation. (<bold>B</bold>) The types of acylation are shown along with their targeting location. (<bold>C</bold>, top) The enzyme phospholipase D2 (PLD2, green) is shown with its acylation that binds to the saturated ordered site in GM1. The site discriminates palmitoylated proteins from prenylated proteins.

After mechanical stretching, the membrane relaxes, allowing the palmitates from PLD2, to re-associate with the GM1 lipids. Consequently, TREK is drawn into GM1 clusters through its interaction with PLD2.

(<bold>F</bold>) Direct inactivation of TREK-1 through an intermediate. Upon reversal of mechanical stretch (relaxation of the membrane), the channel may transition into a closed conformation due to direct pressure exerted on the channel (indicated by the large red arrows). In a thin membrane this action could displace the gating helix up to 8 â« away from the membrane, disrupting the PLD2/TREK-1 interaction. This putative intermediate state is expected to be transient as TREK-1 would likely re-associate in thicker lipid regions.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Proposed model for domain-mediated mechanosensation of TREK-1 by spatial patterning.</title>
<p>(top) In domain-mediated mechanosensation, in an unstimulated state, the palmitate site within GM1 domains is intact and binds tightly to palmitates. This tight affinity sequesters the PLD2/TREK-1 complex away from its activating lipids phosphatidylcholine (PC, yellow) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>, blue). (right) Upon mechanical stimulation, the palmitate site is disrupted and the PLD2/TREK-1 complex is released, allowing it to diffuse within the plasma membrane and bind to PIP<sub>2</sub>. (bottom) Upon PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, PLD2 is becomes activated and makes phosphatidic acid (PA, red), transducing the mechanical signal into a chemical signal. This chemical signal then binds to and activates TREK-1, initiating chemical-to-electrical signal transduction. (left) When the stimulation is removed, the lipid domain reforms, causing the complex to be re-sequestered. The process results in a return to steady-state conditions, as depicted in the top panel</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study poses a provocative mechanism of channel activation of the mechanically activated ion channel TREK-1. The data provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that the application of shear to cells causes a redistribution of both TREK-1 and an associated enzyme, PhospholipaseD2 in the membrane that increases the enzyme activity. The work offers a new mechanism, but note that this is only one possible method of channel activation, and mechanisms independent of PLD2 are also probable.</p>

<p>Force sensing and gating mechanisms of the mechanically activated ion channels is an area of broad interest in the field of mechanotransduction. These channels perform important biological functions by converting mechanical force into electrical signals. To understand their underlying physiological processes, it is important to determine gating mechanisms, especially those mediated by lipids. The authors in this manuscript describe a mechanism for mechanically induced activation of TREK-1 (TWIK-related K+ channel. They propose that force induced disruption of ganglioside (GM1) and cholesterol causes relocation of TREK-1 associated with phospholipase D2 (PLD2) to 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) clusters, where PLD2 catalytic activity produces phosphatidic acid that can activate the channel. To test their hypothesis, they use dSTORM to measure TREK-1 and PLD2 colocalization with either GM1 or PIP2. They find that shear stress decreases TREK-1/PLD2 colocalization with GM1 and relocates to cluster with PIP2. These movements are affected by TREK-1 C-terminal or PLD2 mutations suggesting that the interaction is important for channel re-location. The authors then draw a correlation to cholesterol suggesting that TREK-1 movement is cholesterol dependent. It is important to note that this is not the only method of channel activation and that one not involving PLD2 also exists. Overall, the authors conclude that force is sensed by ordered lipids and PLD2 associates with TREK-1 to selectively gate the channel.</p>
<p>The proposed mechanism is solid and the authors have revised the manuscript to address previous issues with the first version</p>

<p>This manuscript by Petersen and colleagues investigates the mechanistic underpinnings of activation of the ion channel TREK-1 by mechanical inputs (fluid shear or membrane stretch) applied to cells. Using a combination of super-resolution microscopy, pair correlation analysis and electrophysiology, the authors convincingly show that the application of shear to a cell can lead to changes in the distribution of TREK-1 and the enzyme PhospholipaseD2 (PLD2), relative to lipid domains defined by either GM1 or PIP2. The activation of TREK-1 by mechanical stimuli was shown to be sensitized by the presence of PLD2, but not a catalytically inactive xPLD2 mutant. In addition, the activity of PLD2 is increased when the molecule is more associated with PIP2, rather than GM1 defined lipid domains. The presented data do not exclude direct mechanical activation of TREK-1, rather suggest a modulation of TREK-1 activity, increasing sensitivity to mechanical inputs, through an inherent mechanosensitivity of PLD2 activity. The authors additionally demonstrate that cellular uptake of cholesterol inhibits TREK-1 activation and, in ex vivo studies, that depletion of cholesterol from astrocytes reduces correlation of TREK-1 and G1 lipids in mouse brain slices. In vivo studies, using Drosophila melanogaster behavioural assays, were used to demonstrate that disrupting PLD2 altered behavioural responses to mechanical and electrical inputs. These data demonstrate that manipulation of PLD2 analogue in the fly can alter sensory transduction, suggesting that PLD functions to regulate sensitivity to mechanical force. However, as the authors note, there is no TREK-1 homologue in this organism: thus the identity of the downstream effectors of PLD in D. melanogaster remain unknown. This work will be of interest to the growing community of scientists investigating the myriad mechanisms that can tune mechanical sensitivity of cells, providing valuable insight into the role of functional PLD2 in sensitizing TREK-1 activation in response to mechanical inputs, in some cellular systems.</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate that, post application of shear, an alteration in the distribution of TREK-1 and mPLD2 (in HEK293T cells) from being correlated with GM1 defined domains (no shear) to increased correlation with PIP2 defined membrane domains (post shear). The association of TREK-1 with PIP2 required functional mPLD2. These data were generated using super-resolution microscopy to visualise, at sub diffraction resolution, the localisation of labelled protein, compared to labelled lipids. The use of super-resolution imaging enabled the authors to visualise changes in cluster association that would not have been achievable with diffraction limited microscopy.</p>
<p>This work provides further evidence of the astounding flexibility of mechanical sensing in cells. By outlining how mechanical activation of TREK-1 can be sensitised by mechanical regulation of PLD2 activity, the authors highlight a mechanism by which TREK-1 sensitivity could be regulated under distinct physiological conditions.</p>

<p>The manuscript &quot;Mechanical activation of TWIK-related potassium channel by nanoscopic movement and second messenger signaling&quot; presents a new mechanism for the activation of TREK-1 channel. The mechanism suggests that TREK1 is activated by phosphatidic acids that are produced via a mechanosensitive motion of PLD2 to PIP2-enriched domains. Overall, I found the topic interesting but several typos and unclarities reduced the readability of the manuscript. Additionally, I have several major concerns on the interpretation of the results. Therefore, the proposed mechanism is not fully supported by the presented data. Lastly, the mechanism is based on several previous studies from the Hansen lab, however, the novelty of the current manuscript is not clearly stated. For example, in the 2nd result section, the authors stated, &quot;fluid shear causes PLD2 to move from cholesterol dependent GM1 clusters to PIP2 clusters and this activated the enzyme&quot;. However, this is also presented as a new finding in section 3 &quot;Mechanism of PLD2 activation by shear.&quot;</p>
<p>
In the revised manuscript, the authors addressed most of my concerns. I still have the following suggestions/confusions.</p>
<p>
1. the reviewer would highly appreciate verification of the cholesterol assay, either by additional experiment or by citations of independent work.</p>
<p>2. The claim on &quot;shear thinning&quot; is still very confusing. First, asymmetric insertion of molecules to one monolayer of the membrane is a main mechanism for membrane bending and curvature formation. Second, why is &quot;shear thinning&quot; equivalent to entropy/order?</p>

<p>Response: Figure 5d is the summary figure for the entire paper. We have made this clearer in the figure legend and we deleted the title above the figure that gave the appearance that the panel relates to swell only.  It is the proposed model based on what we show in the paper and what is known about the activation mechanism of TREK-1.</p>
<p>Figure 6 is supposed to be simple. It is to help the reader understand that when PA is low mechanical sensitivity is high. Without the graphic, previous reviewers got confused about threshold going down and mechanosensitivity going up and how the levels of PA relate. Low PA= high sensitivity. Weâve added a downstream effector to the right side of the panel to avoid any biased to a putative downstream channel effector. The purpose of the experiment is to show PLD has a mechanosensitive phenotype in vivo.</p>

<p>This manuscript outlines some really interesting findings demonstrating a mechanism by which mechanically driven alterations in molecular distributions can influence a) the activity of the PLD2 molecule and subsequently b) the activation of TREK-1 when mechanical inputs are applied to a cell or cell membrane.</p>
<p>The results presented here suggest that this redistribution of molecules represents a modulatory mechanism that alters either the amplitude or the sensitivity of TREK-1 mediated currents evoked by membrane stretch. While the authors do present values for the pressure required to activate 50% of channels (P50), the data presented provides incomplete evidence to conclude a shift in threshold of the currents, given that many of the current traces provided in the supplemental material do not saturate within the stimulus range, thus limiting the application of a Boltzmann fit to determine the P50. I suggest adding additional context to enable readers to better assess the limitations of this use of the Boltzmann fit to generate a P50, or alternately repeating the experiments to apply stimuli up to lytic pressures to saturate the mechanically evoked currents, enabling use of the Boltzmann function to fit the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree the currents did not reach saturation. Hence the term P50 could be misleading, so we have removed it from the paper. We now say âhalf maximalâ current measured from non-saturating pressures of 0-60 mmHg. We also deleted the xPLD data in supplemental figure 3C since there is insufficient current to realistically estimate a half maximal response.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In my opinion, the conclusions presented in this manuscript would be strengthened by an assessment of the amount of TREK-1 in the plasma membrane pre and post application of shear. While the authors do present imaging data in the supplementary materials, these data are insufficiently precise to comment on expression levels in the membrane. To strengthen this conclusion the authors could conduct cell surface biotinylation assays, as a more sensitive and quantitative measure of membrane localisation of the proteins of interest.</p>

<p>1. Response: as mentioned previously, we do not have an antibody to the extracellular domain. Nonetheless to better address this concern we directly compared the levels of TREK-1, PIP2, and GM1;  in xPLD2, mPLD2, enPLD2 with and without shear. The results are in supplemental figure 2.  PLD2 is known to increase endocytosis1 and xPLD2 is known to block both agonist induced and constitutive endocytosis of Âµ-opioid receptor2. The receptor is trapped on the surface. This is true of many proteins including Rho3, ARF4, and ACE21 among others. In agreement with this mechanism, in Figure S2C,G we show that TREK increases with xPLD and the localization can clearly be seen at the plasma membrane just like in all of the other publications with xPLD overexpression. xPLD2 would be expected to inhibit the basal current but we presume the increased expression likely has compensated and there is sufficient PA and PG from other sources to allow for the basal current. It is in this state that we then conduct our ephys and monitor with a millisecond time resolution and see no activation. We are deriving conclusion from a very clear responseâFigure 1b shows almost no current, even at 1-10 ms after applying pressure. There is little pressure current when we know the channel is present and capable of conducting ion (Figure 1d red bar).
After shear there is a strong decrease in TREK-1 currents on the membrane in the presence of xPLD2. But it is not less than TREK-1 expression with mPLD2. And since mouse PLD2 has the highest basal current and pressure activation current. The amount of TREK-1 present is sufficient to conduct large current. To have almost no detective current would require at least a 10 fold reduction compared to  mPLD2 levels before we would lack the sensitivity to see a channel open. Lasty endocytosis typically in on the order of seconds to minutes, no milliseconds.</p>
<p>2. We have shown an addition 2 independent ways that TREK-1 is on the membrane during our stretch experiments.  Figure 1d shows the current immediately prior to applying pressure for wt TREK-1. When catalytically dead PLD is present (xPLD2) there is almost normal basal current. The channel is clearly present. And then in figure 1a we show within a millisecond there is no pressure current. As a control we added a functionally dead TREK-1 truncation (xTREK). Compared to xPLD2 there is clearly normal basal current. If this is not strong evidence the channel was available on the surface for mechanical activation please help us understand why. And if you think within 2.1 ms 100% of the channel is gone by endocytosis please provide some evidence that this is possible so we can reconsider.</p>
<p>3. We have TIRF super resolution imaging with ~20 nm x-y resolution and ~ 100nm z resolution and Figure 2b clearly shows the channel on the membrane. When we apply pressure in 1b, the channel is present.</p>
<p>4. Lastly, In our previous studies we showed activation of PLD2 by anesthetics was responsible for all of TREK-1âs anesthetic sensitivity and this was through PLD2 binding to the C-terminus of TREK-15. We showed this was the case by transferring anesthetic sensitivity to an anesthetic insensitive homolog TRAAK. This established conclusively the basic premise of our mechanism. Here we show the same C-terminal region and PLD2 are responsible for the mechanical current observed by TREK-1. TRAAK is already mechanosensitive so the same chimera will not work for our purposes here. But anesthetic activation and mechanical activation are dramatically different stimuli, and the fact that the role of PLD is robustly observed in both should be considered.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors discuss that the endogenous levels of TREK-1 and PLD2 are &quot;well correlated: in C2C12 cells, that TREK-1 displayed little pair correlation with GM1 and that a &quot;small amount of TREK-1 trafficked to PIP2&quot;. As such, these data suggest that the data outlined for HEK293T cells may be hampered by artefacts arising from overexpression. Can TREK-1 currents be activated by membrane stretch in these cells C2C12 cells and are they negatively impacted by the presence of xPLD2? Answering this question would provide more insight into the proposed mechanism of action of PLD2 outlined by the authors in this manuscript. If no differences are noted, the model would be called into question. It could be that there are additional cell-specific factors that further regulate this process.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The low pair correlation of TREK-1 and GM1 in C2C12 cells was due to insufficient levels of cholesterol in the cell membrane to allow for robust domain formation. In Figure 4b we loaded C2C12 cells with cholesterol using the endogenous cholesterol transport protein apoE and serum (an endogenous source of cholesterol). As can be seen in Fig. 4b, the pair correlation dramatically increased (purple line). This was also true in neuronal cells (N2a) (Fig 4d, purple bar). And shear (3 dynes/cm2) caused the TREK-1 that was in the GM1 domains to leave (red bar) reversing the effect of high cholesterol. This demonstrates our proposed mechanism is working as we expect with endogenously expressed proteins.</p>
<p>There are many channels in C2C12 cells, it would be difficult to isolate TREK-1 currents, which is why we replicated the entire system (ephys and dSTORM) in HEK cells. Note, in figure 4c we also show that adding cholesterol inhibits TREK-1 whole cell currents in HEK293cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As mentioned in the public review, the behavioural experiments in D. melanogaster can not solely be attributed to a change in threshold. While there may be a change in the threshold to drive a different behaviour, the writing is insufficiently precise to make clear that conclusions cannot be drawn from these experiments regarding the functional underpinnings of this outcome. Are there changes in resting membrane potential in the mutant flys? Alterations in Nav activity? Without controlling for these alternate explanations it is difficult to see what this last piece of data adds to the manuscript, particularly given the lack of TREK-1 in this organism. At the very least, some editing of the text to more clearly indicate that these data can only be used to draw conclusions on the change in threshold for driving the behaviour not the change in threshold of the actual mechanotransduction event (i.e. conversion of the mechanical stimulus into an electrochemical signal).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree; features other than PLDs direct mechanosensitivity are likely contributing. This was shown in figure 6g left side.  We have an arrow going to ion channel and to other downstream effectors. Weâve added the putative alteration to downstream effectors to the right side of the panel.  This should make it clear that we no more speculate the involvement of a channel than any of the other many potential downstream effectors.  As mentioned above, the figure helps the reader coordinate low PA with increased mechanosensitivity. Without the graphic reviewers got confused that PA increased the threshold which corresponds to a decreased sensitivity to pain. Nonetheless we removed our conclusion about fly thresholds from the abstract and made clearer in the main text the lack of mechanism downstream of PLD in flies including endocytosis. Supplemental Figure S2H also helps emphasize this. .</p>
<p>Nav channels are interesting, and since PLD contribute to endocytosis and Nav channels are  also regulated by endocytosis there is likely a PLD specific effect using Nav channels. There are many ways PA likely regulates mechanosensitive thresholds, but we feel Nav is beyond the scope of our paper. Someone else will need to do those studies.  We have amended a paragraph in the conclusion which clearly states we do not know the specific mechanism at work here with the suggestions for future research to discover the role of lipid and lipid-modifying enzymes in mechanosensitive neurons.</p>

<p>There may be fundamental flaws in how the statistics have been conducted. The methods section indicates that all statistical testing was performed with a Student's t-test. A visual scan of many of the data sets in the figures suggests that they are not normally distributed, thus a parametric test such as a Student's t-test is not valid. The authors should assess if each data set is normally distributed, and if not, a non-parametric statistical test should be applied. I recommend assessing the robustness of the statistical analyses and adjusting as necessary.</p>

<p>The references provided for the statement regarding cascade activation of the TRPs are incredibly out of date. While it is clear that TRPV4 can be activated by a second messenger cascade downstream of osmotic swelling of cells, TRPV4 has also been shown to be activated by mechanical inputs at the cell-substrate interface, even when the second messenger cascade is inhibited. Recommend updating the references to reflect more current understanding of channel activation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have updated the references and changed the comment to âcan beâ instead of âareâ. The reference is more general to multiple ion channel types including KCNQ4. This should avoid any perceived conflict with the cellsubstrate interface mechanism which we very much agree is a correct mechanism for TRP channels.</p>

<p>The central messages of the manuscript would benefit from extensive work to increase the precision of the writing of the manuscript and the presentation of data in the figures, such textual changes alone would help address a number of the concerns outlined in this review, by clarifying some ambiguities. There are numerous errors throughout, ranging from grammatical issues, ambiguities with definitions, lack of scale bars in images, lack of labels on graph axes, lack of clarity due to the mode of presentation of sample numbers (it would be far more precise to indicate specific numbers for each sample rather than a range, which is ambiguous and confusing), unnecessary and repeat information in the methods section. Below are some examples but this list is not exhaustive.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you, reviewer # 1 also had many of these concerns. We have gone through the entire paper and improved the precision of the writing of the manuscript. We have also added the missing error bar to Figure 6. And axis labels have been added to the inset images.  The redundancy in cell culture methods has been removed. Where a range is small and there are lots of values, the exact number of ânâ are graphically displayed in the dot plot for each condition.</p>

<p>Text:</p>
<p>I recommend considering how to discuss the various aspects of channel activation. A convention in the field is to use mechanical activation or mechanical gating to describe that process where the mechanical stimulus is directly coupled to the channel gating mechanism. This would be the case for the activation of TREK-1 by membrane stretch alone. The increase in activation by PLD2 activity then reflects a modulation of the mechanical activation of the channel, because the relevant gating stimulus is PA, rather than force/stretch. The sum of these events could be described as shear-evoked or mechanically-evoked, TREK-1 mediated currents (thus making it clear that the mechanical stimulus initiates the relevant cascade, but the gating stimulus may be other than direct mechanical input.) Given the interesting and compelling data offered in this manuscript regarding the sensitisation of TREK-1 dependent mechanicallyevoked currents by PLD2, an increase in the precision of the language would help convey the central message of this work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response; We agree there needs to be convention. We have taken the suggestion of mechanically evoked and we suggest the following definitions:</p>
<p>1. Mechanical activation of PLD2: direct force on the lipids releasing PLD2 from nonactivating lipids.</p>
<p>2. Mechanical activation/gating of TREK1: direct force from lipids from either tension or hydrophobic mismatch that opens the channel.</p>
<p>3. Mechanically evoked: a mechanical event that leads to a downstream effect. The effect is mechanically âevokedâ.</p>
<p>4. Spatial patterning/biochemistry: nanoscopic changes in the association of a protein with a nanoscopic lipid cluster or compartment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>An example of where discussion of mechanical activation is ambiguous in the text is found at line 109: &quot;channel could be mechanically activated by a movement from GM1 to PIP2 lipids.&quot; In this case, the sentence could be suggesting that the movement between lipids provides the mechanical input that activates the channel, which is not what the data suggest.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Were possible we have replaced âmovementâ with âspatial patterningâ and âassociationâ and âdissociationâ from specific lipid compartment. This better reflects the data we have in this paper. However, we do think that a movement mechanically activates the channel, GM1 lipids are thick and PIP2 lipids are thin, so movement between the lipids could activate the channel through direct lipid interaction. We will address this aspect in a future paper.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Force sensing and gating mechanisms of the mechanically activated ion channels is an area of broad interest in the field of mechanotransduction. These channels perform important biological functions by converting mechanical force into electrical signals. To understand their underlying physiological processes, it is important to determine gating mechanisms, especially those mediated by lipids. The authors in this manuscript describe a mechanism for mechanically induced activation of TREK-1 (TWIK-related K+ channel. They propose that force induced disruption of ganglioside (GM1) and cholesterol causes relocation of TREK-1 associated with phospholipase D2 (PLD2) to 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) clusters, where PLD2 catalytic activity produces phosphatidic acid that can activate the channel. To test their hypothesis, they use dSTORM to measure TREK-1 and PLD2 colocalization with either GM1 or PIP2. They find that shear stress decreases TREK-1/PLD2 colocalization with GM1 and relocates to cluster with PIP2. These movements are affected by TREK-1 C-terminal or PLD2 mutations suggesting that the interaction is important for channel re-location. The authors then draw a correlation to cholesterol suggesting that TREK-1 movement is cholesterol dependent. It is important to note that this is not the only method of channel activation and that one not involving PLD2 also exists. Overall, the authors conclude that force is sensed by ordered lipids and PLD2 associates with TREK-1 to selectively gate the channel. Although the proposed mechanism is solid, some concerns remain.</p>
<p>1. Most conclusions in the paper heavily depend on the dSTORM data. But the images provided lack resolution. This makes it difficult for the readers to assess the representative images.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The images were provided are at 300 dpi. Perhaps the reviewer is referring to contrast in Figure 2? We are happy to increase the contrast or resolution.</p>
<p>As a side note, we feel the main conclusion of the paper, mechanical activation of TREK-1 through PLD2, depended primarily on the electrophysiology in Figure 1b-c, not the dSTORM. But both complement each other.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The experiments in Figure 6 are a bit puzzling. The entire premise of the paper is to establish gating mechanism of TREK-1 mediated by PLD2; however, the motivation behind using flies, which do not express TREK-1 is puzzling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The fly experiment shows that PLD mechanosensitivity is more evolutionarily conserved than TREK-1 mechanosensitivity. We have added this observation to the paper.</p>
<p>-Figure 6B, the image is too blown out and looks over saturated. Unclear whether the resolution in subcellular localization is obvious or not.</p>
<p>Response: Figure 6B is a confocal image, it is not dSTORM. There is no dSTORM in Figure 6. We have added the error bars to make this more obvious. For reference, only a few cells would fit in the field of view with dSTORM.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript by Petersen and colleagues investigates the mechanistic underpinnings of activation of the ion channel TREK-1 by mechanical inputs (fluid shear or membrane stretch) applied to cells. Using a combination of super-resolution microticopy, pair correlation analysis and electrophysiology, the authors show that the application of shear to a cell can lead to changes in the distribution of TREK-1 and the enzyme PhospholipaseD2 (PLD2), relative to lipid domains defined by either GM1 or PIP2. The activation of TREK-1 by mechanical stimuli was shown to be sensi&gt;zed by the presence of PLD2, but not a catalytically dead xPLD2 mutant. In addition, the activity of PLD2 is increased when the molecule is more associated with PIP2, rather than GM1 defined lipid domains. The presented data do not exclude direct mechanical activation of TREK-1, rather suggest a modulation of TREK-1 activity, increasing sensitivity to mechanical inputs, through an inherent mechanosensitivity of PLD2 activity. The authors additionally claim that PLD2 can regulate transduction thresholds in vivo using Drosophila melanogaster behavioural assays. However, this section of the manuscript overstates the experimental findings, given that it is unclear how the disruption of PLD2 is leading to behavioural changes, given the lack of a TREK-1 homologue in this organism and the lack of supporting data on molecular function in the relevant cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree, the downstream effectors of PLD2 mechanosensitivity are not known in the fly. Other anionic lipids have been shown to mediate pain see ref 46 and 47. We do not wish to make any claim beyond PLD2 being an in vivo contributor to a flyâs response to mechanical force. We have removed the speculative conclusions about fly thresholds from the abstract.</p>
<p>That said we do believe we have established a molecular function at the cellular level. We showed PLD is robustly mechanically activated in a cultured fly cell line (BG2-c2) Figure 6a of the manuscript. And our previous publication established mechanosensation of PLD (Petersen et. al. Nature Com 2016) through mechanical disruption of the lipids. At a minimum, the experiments show PLDs mechanosensitivity is evolutionarily better conserved across species than TREK1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This work will be of interest to the growing community of scientists investigating the myriad mechanisms that can tune mechanical sensitivity of cells, providing valuable insight into the role of functional PLD2 in sensi&gt;zing TREK-1 activation in response to mechanical inputs, in some cellular systems.</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate that, post application of shear, an alteration in the distribution of TREK-1 and mPLD2 (in HEK293T cells) from being correlated with GM1 defined domains (no shear) to increased correlation with PIP2 defined membrane domains (post shear). These data were generated using super-resolution microticopy to visualise, at sub diffraction resolution, the localisation of labelled protein, compared to labelled lipids. The use of super-resolution imaging enabled the authors to visualise changes in cluster association that would not have been achievable with diffraction limited microticopy. However, the conclusion that this change in association reflects TREK-1 leaving one cluster and moving to another overinterprets these data, as the data were generated from sta&gt;c measurements of fixed cells, rather than dynamic measurements capturing molecular movements.</p>
<p>When assessing molecular distribution of endogenous TREK-1 and PLD2, these molecules are described as &quot;well correlated: in C2C12 cells&quot; however it is challenging to assess what &quot;well correlated&quot; means, precisely in this context. This limitation is compounded by the conclusion that TREK-1 displayed little pair correlation with GM1 and the authors describe a &quot;small amount of TREK-1 trafficked to PIP2&quot;. As such, these data may suggest that the findings outlined for HEK293T cells may be influenced by artefacts arising from overexpression.</p>
<p>The changes in TREK-1 sensitivity to mechanical activation could also reflect changes in the amount of TREK-1 in the plasma membrane. The authors suggest that the presence of a leak currently accounts for the presence of TREK-1 in the plasma membrane, however they do not account for whether there are significant changes in the membrane localisation of the channel in the presence of mPLD2 versus xPLD2. The supplementary data provide some images of fluorescently labelled TREK-1 in cells, and the authors state that truncating the c-terminus has no effect on expression at the plasma membrane, however these data provide inadequate support for this conclusion. In addition, the data reporting the P50 should be noted with caution, given the lack of saturation of the current in response to the stimulus range.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for his/her concern about expression levels. We did test TREK-1 expression. mPLD decreases TREK-1 expression ~two-fold (see Author response image 2 below). We did not include the mPLD data since TREK-1 was mechanically activated with mPLD. For expression to account for the loss of TREK-1 stretch current (Figure 1b), xPLD would need to block surface expression of TREK-1 prior to stretch. The opposite was true, xPLD2 increased TREK-1 expression (see Figure S2c). Furthermore, we tested the leak current of TREK-1 at 0 mV and 0 mmHg of stretch. Basal leak current was no different with xPLD2 compared to endogenous PLD (Figure 1d; red vs grey bars respectively) suggesting TREK-1 is in the membrane and active when xPLD2 is present. If anything, the magnitude of the effect with xPLD would be larger if the expression levels were equal.</p>

<title>TREK expression at the plasma membrane.</title>
<p>TREK-1 Fluorescence was measured by GFP at points along the plasma membrane. Over expression of mouse PLD2 (mPLD) decrease the amount of full-length TREK-1 (FL TREK) on the surface more than 2-fold compared to endogenously expressed PLD (enPLD) or truncated TREK (TREKtrunc) which is missing the PLD binding site in the C-terminus. Over expression of mPLD had no effect on TREKtrunc.</p>

<p>Finally, by manipulating PLD2 in D. melanogaster, the authors show changes in behaviour when larvae are exposed to either mechanical or electrical inputs. The depletion of PLD2 is concluded to lead to a reduction in activation thresholds and to suggest an in vivo role for PA lipid signaling in setting thresholds for both mechanosensitivity and pain. However, while the data provided demonstrate convincing changes in behaviour and these changes could be explained by changes in transduction thresholds, these data only provide weak support for this specific conclusion. As the authors note, there is no TREK-1 in D. melanogaster, as such the reported findings could be accounted for by other explanations, not least including potential alterations in the activation threshold of Nav channels required for action potential generation. To conclude that the outcomes were in fact mediated by changes in mechanotransduction, the authors would need to demonstrate changes in receptor potential generation, rather than deriving conclusions from changes in behaviour that could arise from alterations in resting membrane potential, receptor potential generation or the activity of the voltage gated channels required for action potential generation.</p>

<p>Response: We are willing to restrict the conclusion about the fly behavior as the reviewers see fit.  We have shown PLD is mechanosensitivity in a fly cell line, and when we knock out PLD from a fly, the animal exhibits a mechanosensation phenotype.  We tried to make it clear in the figure and in the text that we have no evidence of a particular mechanism downstream of PLD mechanosensation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This work provides further evidence of the astounding flexibility of mechanical sensing in cells. By outlining how mechanical activation of TREK-1 can be sensitised by mechanical regulation of PLD2 activity, the authors highlight a mechanism by which TREK-1 sensitivity could be regulated under distinct physiological conditions.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript &quot;Mechanical activation of TWIK-related potassium channel by nanoscopic movement and second messenger signaling&quot; presents a new mechanism for the activation of TREK-1 channel. The mechanism suggests that TREK1 is activated by phosphatidic acids that are produced via a mechanosensitive motion of PLD2 to PIP2-enriched domains. Overall, I found the topic interesting, but several typos and unclarities reduced the readability of the manuscript. Additionally, I have several major concerns on the interpretation of the results. Therefore, the proposed mechanism is not fully supported by the presented data. Lastly, the mechanism is based on several previous studies from the Hansen lab, however, the novelty of the current manuscript is not clearly stated. For example, in the 2nd result section, the authors stated, &quot;fluid shear causes PLD2 to move from cholesterol dependent GM1 clusters to PIP2 clusters and this activated the enzyme&quot;. However, this is also presented as a new finding in section 3 &quot;Mechanism of PLD2 activation by shear.&quot;</p>
<p>For PLD2 dependent TREK-1 activation. Overall, I found the results compelling.
However, two key results are missing.</p>
<p>1. Does HEK cells have endogenous PLD2? If so, it's hard to claim that the authors can measure PLD2-independent TREK1 activation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: yes, there is endogenous PLD (enPLD). We calculated the relative expression of xPLD2 vs enPLD. xPLD2 is &gt;10x more abundant (Fig. S3d of Pavel et al PNAS 2020, ref 14 of the current manuscript). Hence, as with anesthetic sensitivity, we expect the xPLD to out compete the endogenous PLD, which is what we see. We added the following sentence and reference : âThe xPLD2 expression is &gt;10x the endogenous PLD2 (enPLD2) and out computes the TREK-1 binding site for PLD25.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Does the plasma membrane trafficking of TREK1 remain the same under different conditions (PLD2 overexpression, truncation)? From Figure S2, the truncated TREK1 seem to have very poor trafficking. The change of trafficking could significantly contribute to the interpretation of the data in Figure 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: If the PLD2 binding site is removed (TREK-1trunc), yes, the trafficking to the plasma membrane is unaffected by the expression of xPLD and mPLD (Author response image 2 above). For full length TREK1 (FL-TREK-1), co-expression of mPLD decreases TREK expression (Author response image 2) and coexpression with xPLD increases TREK expression (Figure S2f). This is exactly opposite of what one would expect if surface expression accounted for the change in pressure currents. Hence, we conclude surface expression does not account for loss of TREK-1 mechanosensitivity with xPLD2. A few sentences was added to the discussion.  We also performed dSTORM on the TREKtruncated using EGFP. TREK-truncated goes to PIP2 (see figure 2 of 6)</p>

<p>To better compare the levels of TREK-1 before and after shear, we added a supplemental figure S2f where the protein was compared simultaneously in all conditions. 15 min of shear significantly decreased TREK-1 except with mPLD2 where the levels before shear were already lowest of all the expression levels tested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For shear-induced movement of TREK1 between nanodomains. The section is convincing, however I'm not an expert on super-resolution imaging. Also, it would be helpful to clarify whether the shear stress was maintained during fixation. If not, what is the &gt;me gap between reduced shear and the fixed state. lastly, it's unclear why shear flow changes the level of TREK1 and PIP2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Shear was maintained during the fixing. xPLD2 blocks endocytosis, presumably endocytosis and or release of other lipid modifying enzymes affect the system. The change in TREK-1 levels appears to be directly through an interaction with PLD as TREK trunc is not affected by over expression of xPLD or mPLD.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the mechanism of PLD2 activation by shear. I found this section not convincing. Therefore, the question of how does PLD2 sense mechanical force on the membrane is not fully addressed. Par&gt;cularly, it's hard to imagine an acute 25% decrease cholesterol level by shear - where did the cholesterol go? Details on the measurements of free cholesterol level is unclear and additional/alternative experiments are needed to prove the reduction in cholesterol by shear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  The question âhow does PLD2 sense mechanical force on the membraneâ we addressed and published in Nature Comm. In 2016. The title of that paper is âKinetic disruption of lipid rafts is a mechanosensor for phospholipase Dâ see ref 13 Petersen et. al.  PLD is a soluble protein associated to the membrane through palmitoylation. There is no transmembrane domain, which narrows the possible mechanism of its mechanosensation to disruption.</p>
<p>The Nature Comm. reviewer identified as âan expert in PLD signalingâ wrote the following of our data and the proposed mechanism:</p>
<p>âThis is a provocative report that identi0ies several unique properties of phospholipase D2 (PLD2). It explains in a novel way some long established observations including that the enzyme is largely regulated by substrate presentation which 0its nicely with the authors model of segregation of the two lipid raft domains (cholesterol ordered vs PIP2 containing). Although PLD has previously been reported to be involved in mechanosensory transduction processes (as cited by the authors) this is the 0irst such report associating the enzyme with this type of signaling... It presents a novel model that is internally consistent with previous literature as well as the data shown in this manuscript. It suggests a new role for PLD2 as a force transduction tied to the physical structure of lipid rafts and uses parallel methods of disrup0on to test the predic0ons of their model.â</p>
<p>Regarding cholesterol. We use a fluorescent cholesterol oxidase assay which we described in the methods. This is an appropriate assay for determining cholesterol levels in a cell which we use routinely. We have published in multiple journals using this method, see references 28, 30, 31. Working out the metabolic fate of cholesterol after sheer is indeed interesting but well beyond the scope of this paper. Furthermore, we indirectly confirmed our finding using dSTORM cluster analysis (Figure 3d-e). The cluster analysis shows a decrease in GM1 cluster size consistent with our previous experiments where we chemically depleted cholesterol and saw a similar decrease in cluster size (see ref 13). All the data are internally consistent, and the cholesterol assay is properly done. We see no reason to reject the data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Importantly, there is no direct evidence for &quot;shear thinning&quot; of the membrane and the authors should avoid claiming shear thinning in the abstract and summary of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  We previously established a kinetic model for PLD2 activation see ref 13 (Petersen et al Nature Comm 2016). In that publication we discussed both entropy and heat as mechanisms of disruption. Here we controlled for heat which narrowed that model to entropy (i.e., shear thinning) (see Figure 3c).  We provide an overall justification below. But this is a small refinement of our previous paper, and we prefer not to complicate the current paper. We believe the proper rheological term is shear thinning. The following justification, which is largely adapted from ref 13, could be added to the supplement if the reviewer wishes.</p>
<p>Justification: To establish shear thinning in a biological membrane, we initially used a soluble enzyme that has no transmembrane domain, phospholipase D2 (PLD2). PLD2 is a soluble enzyme and associated with the membrane by palmitate, a saturated 16 carbon lipid attached to the enzyme. In the absence of a transmembrane domain, mechanisms of mechanosensation involving hydrophobic mismatch, tension, midplane bending, and curvature can largely be excluded. Rather the mechanism appears to be a change in fluidity (i.e., kinetic in nature). GM1 domains are ordered, and the palmate forms van der Waals bonds with the GM1 lipids. The bonds must be broken for PLD to no longer associate with GM1 lipids.  We established this in our 2016 paper, ref 13. In that paper we called it a kinetic effect, however we did not experimentally distinguish enthalpy (heat) vs. entropy (order). Heat is Newtonian and entropy (i.e., shear thinning) is non-Newtonian. In the current study we paid closer attention to the heat and ruled it out (see Figure 3c and methods). We could propose a mechanism based on kinetic disruption, but we know the disruption is not due to melting of the lipids (enthalpy), which leaves shear thinning (entropy) as the plausible mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors should also be aware that hypotonic shock is a very dirty assay for stretching the cell membrane. Ouen, there is only a transient increase in membrane tension, accompanied by many biochemical changes in the cells (including acidification, changes of concentration etc). Therefore, I would not consider this as definitive proof that PLD2 can be activated by stretching membrane.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Comment noted. We trust the reviewer is correct. In 1998 osmotic shock was used to activate the channel. We only intended to show that the system is consistent with previous electrophysiologic experiments.</p>
