<abstract>
<p>HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) is critical for viral fusion and entry into host cells and remains a primary target for vaccine and antiviral drug development. Advances in soluble gp140 trimer design have provided insight into the ectodomain structure and dynamics. However, the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) and transmembrane domain (TMD) are comparatively understudied, and knowledge of the cytoplasmic tail (CT) is virtually absent. Additionally, the ectodomain and TMD have been investigated separately in previous studies. To investigate the trimeric gp120–gp41 as a complete entity and its structural flexibility, we built a full-length model of the gp120–gp41 trimer that is fully glycosylated with N-linked glycans and embedded in a lipid bilayer, and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that the ectodomain maintains a rigid internal structure stable in the prefusion state, whereas the intrinsic flexibility of the MPER enables the ectodomain to adopt a range of tilted orientations, potentially enhancing spatial alignment for receptor engagement. The centrally positioned R696 residue in the TMD interacts with lipid headgroups, ions, and the CT residues, resulting in conformational variability in the TMD and perturbations in the surrounding membrane that may facilitate the fusion process. Finally, we demonstrate how simulation trajectories can be leveraged to evaluate the accessibility of antibody epitopes across different regions of the protein.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the most prevalent strain of HIV responsible for the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The HIV-1 envelop (Env) consists of a host cell-derived lipid membrane and viral glycoproteins that play a crucial role in mediating viral entry into host cells. The Env glycoprotein is initially synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a precursor gp160 and cleaved by furin into two subunits, gp120 and gp41. The non-covalently associated gp120–gp41 complex is transported to the cell surface in the form of a trimer, where it is subsequently incorporated into the envelope of nascent virions during viral assembly. The exposure of Env protein is essential for binding to the primary receptor CD4 and the co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, triggering membrane fusion and viral entry. However, this exposure also renders the virus susceptible to immune attack. In response to host immune pressure, Env is densely coated with N-linked glycans added during post-translational modification in the ER and Golgi apparatus, which effectively shield vulnerable epitopes from immune recognition.</p>
<p>Since HIV-1 was identified as the cause of AIDS in the early 1980s, extensive research has been conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of viral infection and immune response. A major breakthrough was the design of soluble gp140 trimers, composing gp120 and part of the gp41 subunit. Native-like Env trimers, such as SOSIP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> native flexibly linked (NFL),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and uncleaved prefusion-optimized (UFO) constructs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> mimic the structure of viral spike and serve as valuable antigen targets for developing small molecule inhibitors and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). With advances in structure determination techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), numerous high-resolution structures of gp140, both unliganded and antibody-bound, are now available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Even with such progresses, however, the remaining portions of gp41, including the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), transmembrane domain (TMD), and cytoplasmic tail (CT), are relatively understudied. The MPER is a highly conserved region targeted by several bNAbs, including 10E8, 2F5, 4E10, and Z13e1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> However, in most studies, MPER is examined as a monomeric peptide bound to antibodies or within membrane mimetics such as bicelles and nanodiscs, which do not capture the structure and dynamics of unliganded MPER in the context of the gp120–gp41 trimer embedded in a membrane bilayer. Despite the critical roles of the MPER and TMD in mediating the fusion of viral and host cell membranes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> they are often excluded from structural studies due to difficulties in crystallization of hydrophobic TM segments while maintaining their native conformations. Therefore, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy remains one of the few viable methods for obtaining structural information of MPER and TMD. However, the NMR studies from different research groups have yielded conflicting conclusions regarding the oligomeric state of the TMD. Reported TMD structures include trimeric coiled coils,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> monomeric helices,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and trimers that are not tightly bundled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Similarly, there are different conclusions about the conformation and orientation of MPER. Some studies suggest that gp41 bends at the MPER-TMD boundary (around residue 673), with the entire MPER adopting a helical conformation that lies nearly parallel to the membrane,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> while others show that the C-terminal residues of MPER forms a continuous helix with the TMD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> In addition, the exceptionally long CT plays an important role in facilitating the incorporation of the Env glycoprotein into virions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> While it is known to contain three conserved amphipathic α-helical segments, referred to as lentiviral lytic peptides (LLPs), proposed models differ in the arrangement of LLPs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and the complete structure of CT and its location in the membrane remains inconclusive.</p>
<p>In this work, we built a model of full-length gp120–gp41 trimer embedded in a lipid bilayer mimicking the lipid composition of the mammalian plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We prepared simulation systems varying in the presence of the cleavage site and CT, as well as the initial position of protein in the membrane. Multiple microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for each system to explore the motions of individual protein domains and the membrane, and to examine how their conformational variability is affected by the difference in the initial configurations. Our results show that the ectodomain undergoes substantial tilting relative to the membrane plane while maintaining a rigid internal structure. In contrast, the MPER and TMD display highly diverse conformations, and their structural variations are influenced by the presence of the CT and the initial TMD position in the membrane. Moreover, we selected several bNAbs targeting the epitopes across different regions of the Env protein and demonstrate that the simulation trajectories can be used to assess the epitope accessibility.</p>

<title>The ectodomain maintains a rigid internal structure and tilts independently of the TMD</title>
<p>As described in the Methods section, multiple simulation systems were constructed, varying in cleavage, TMD positioning, and CT truncation. Simulations trajectories are denoted as CH<sup>CT</sup>1, UL<sup>CT</sup>2, CL<sup>ΔCT</sup>3, UH<sup>ΔCT</sup>3, etc., where the first letter (C/U) indicates cleaved or uncleaved, the second letter (H/L) indicates the high or low initial TMD position, CT/ΔCT indicates the presence or absence of the CT, and the numeric suffix specifies the trajectory index among three replicas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S1</xref>). In all simulations, both the ectodomain and TMD adopted variable orientations relative to the bilayer plane. To quantify the tilt of two domains, we defined the tilt angles for the ectodomain (<italic>θ</italic><sub>EC</sub>) and TMD (<italic>θ</italic><sub>TM</sub>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>θ</italic><sub>EC</sub> is measured between the bilayer normal and the vector from the center of mass (COM) of G594 (on all three protomers) to the COM of D167, while <italic>θ</italic><sub>TM</sub> is measured between the bilayer normal and the vector from the COM of I684 to the COM of V705. Across trajectories, <italic>θ</italic><sub>EC</sub> typically ranges from 0° to 40°, with occasional tilting up to 50°. Representative structures for different <italic>θ</italic><sub>EC</sub> values are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. In contrast to the wide range of <italic>θ</italic><sub>EC</sub>, <italic>θ</italic><sub>TM</sub> generally remained within 0° to 20° with rare excursions to 30° observed in a small fraction of trajectories. We split each 1-µs trajectory into four 0.25-µs intervals, and the variations of <italic>θ</italic><sub>EC</sub> and <italic>θ</italic><sub>TM</sub> over time show that large conformational changes occurred during the first 0.5 µs, followed by convergence of <italic>θ</italic><sub>EC</sub> and <italic>θ</italic><sub>TM</sub> distributions during the second 0.5 µs of most trajectories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figures S2-S5</xref>). For CH<sup>ΔCT</sup>, CL<sup>ΔCT</sup>, UH<sup>ΔCT</sup> and UL<sup>ΔCT</sup> systems, the <italic>θ</italic><sub>EC</sub> and <italic>θ</italic><sub>TM</sub> distributions calculated from the second 0.5 µs of three independent trajectories are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, and the data for CH<sup>CT</sup>, CL<sup>CT</sup>, UH<sup>CT</sup> and UL<sup>CT</sup> systems are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S6</xref>. Although the combined dataset spans a wide range of <italic>θ</italic><sub>EC</sub> (0°–50°) and <italic>θ</italic><sub>TM</sub> (0°–30°), each individual trajectory explores only a portion of this space. For instance, CH<sup>ΔCT</sup>1 samples large <italic>θ</italic><sub>EC</sub> with small <italic>θ</italic><sub>TM</sub>, whereas CH<sup>ΔCT</sup>3 samples small <italic>θ</italic><sub>EC</sub> with medium-to-large <italic>θ</italic><sub>TM</sub>. Thus, multiple independent simulations are essential to capture a wide region of the conformational space. Most importantly, no consistent correlation was observed between <italic>θ</italic><sub>EC</sub> and <italic>θ</italic><sub>TM</sub>, either within single trajectories or across all trajectories combined. Pearson correlation coefficients of <italic>θ</italic><sub>EC</sub> and <italic>θ</italic><sub>TM</sub> in single trajectories varies between -0.5 and 0.5, with examples such as CH<sup>ΔCT</sup>1 and CH<sup>ΔCT</sup>2 showing similar <italic>θ</italic><sub>TM</sub> but distinct θ<sub>EC</sub> values, and CL<sup>ΔCT</sup>1 and CL<sup>ΔCT</sup>3 showing similar θ<sub>EC</sub> but distinct <italic>θ</italic><sub>TM</sub> values.</p>

<p>Despite the considerable tilting of the ectodomain relative to the membrane, its internal structure remains rigid and well-preserved throughout the simulations. The root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the ectodomain were calculated after the snapshots from each trajectory were aligned to the initial structure by maximizing the overlap in the ectodomain. The majority of the ectodomain displays low RMSF (&lt; 2 Å), and the RMSD stabilized around 4 Å after an initial rise during the first 250 ns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S7</xref>). Higher RMSF values were observed in the residues missing from the cryo-EM structure highlighted in red in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A and B</xref>, and in part of HR1 (Q551-H564) that forms a flexible loop at the interface between two neighboring protomers. In addition, the RMSF of the MPER was also calculated with the trajectories aligned by the ectodomain. The entire MPER (K665–R683) and the adjacent HR2 segment (L660–D664) at the C-terminus of the ectodomain exhibited elevated fluctuations. The gp120–gp41 model was built based on the NMR structure in which the MPER adopts a bent conformation consisting of two helices joined by a sharp turn. The resulting trimer widens from the HR2 helix to the midpoint of the MPER (F673) and narrows from F673 to the TMD. However, this specific conformation was not maintained throughout the simulations. We measured the inter-chain distances between the Cα atoms of corresponding residues (G644, E654, D664, and F673) on neighboring protomers to characterize the structural variation along the HR2 helix and the MPER (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The inter-chain distances of G644 and E654 maintained narrow distributions centered on their initial values, while those of D664 and F673 exhibited broader distributions, reflecting inward shifts of three protomers. This effect was more pronounced in uncleaved systems. In cleaved systems, the HR2 helix interacted with residues M530-N543 and L619-N625 of neighboring protomers, which helps to stabilize the bent MPER conformation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C and D</xref>). However, these interactions were not consistently observed across all protomers and all simulations, and therefore we still observed considerable conformational variability in this region. In uncleaved systems, the closed loop at the cleavage site occupied the space between the HR2 helix and the neighboring protomer, disrupting their interactions and facilitating inward shifts of the HR2 helix (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E and F</xref>).</p>

<title>The energetically unfavorable R696 in the hydrophobic core results in asymmetric, kinked TMD conformations and disrupts membrane integrity</title>
<p>Unlike the predominantly hydrophobic TMDs commonly found in many viral envelop proteins, the gp41 TMD contains multiple charged residues: R683 at the N-terminal boundary, R707 and R709 at the C-terminal boundary, and a central arginine, R696 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In simulations, R683 consistently interacted with lipid headgroups in the exoplasmic leaflet, while R707 and R709 interacted with those in the cytoplasmic leaflet, together acting as anchors that secure the TMD within the bilayer. In the cryo-EM structure (PDB ID: 7LOI), the side chain of R696 forms cation-π interaction with the side chain of F699 and a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl group of L692, but it is oriented outward from the helical bundle. When embedded in the bilayer, however, this configuration is energetically unfavorable, as the positively charged side chain directly contacts hydrophobic lipid tails.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> Early in the simulations, the TMD rapidly rearranged to allow R696 to interact with more favorable partners, including negatively charged lipid headgroups from either leaflet, ions and water molecules diffusing into the bilayer center, as well as the polar and positively charged groups in the CT when it is present. Because the limited space at the TMD core can only accommodate at most two inward-facing arginine residues, at least one R696 is forced outward to interact with lipid headgroups or CT residues. The differences in arginine orientation and interacting partners give rise to asymmetric protomer conformations and distinct TMD tilts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A–F</xref>). When R696 points outward, its interactions with lipid head groups or CT residues can be strong enough to destabilize the local helix, introducing a kink into the TMD. Representative snapshots from different trajectories illustrate these asymmetric kinked conformations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S8–S15</xref>). Beyond local deformation of the TMD, R696–lipid interactions perturb bilayer organization, inducing the translocation of lipid headgroups and water molecules toward the bilayer center (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). We calculated the interaction frequencies of each TMD residue with lipid headgroups, lipid tails, and water molecules. The results show that the membrane disruption is persistent since many non-terminal TMD residues maintain frequent contacts with water and lipid headgroups throughout the simulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>).</p>

<p>To explore whether R696 exhibits a preference for the exoplasmic versus cytoplasmic leaflet, or interacts with either randomly, we generated two initial structures (high and low) with the TMD positioned at two distinct positions, separated by 4 Å along the membrane normal (see Methods). In simulations initiated from the “high” TMD configuration, R696 residues in three protomers interacted with the lipid headgroups in either leaflet (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S8 and S10</xref>) In contrast, in simulations initiated from the “low” TMD configuration, R696 residues interacted exclusively with the headgroups in the cytoplasmic leaflet (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S9 and S11</xref>). In the full-length systems, the plate-shaped CT occupies substantial space in the cytoplasmic leaflet, displacing lipids during model construction. Because the CT is not thick enough to fully span the cytoplasmic leaflet, an empty gap remained between the CT and the exoplasmic leaflet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1D</xref>). Over time, lipids in the exoplasmic leaflet shifted downward while the CT residues moved upward to fill this space, causing local bilayer thinning. Under these conditions, upward-oriented R696 can still interact with the headgroups in the exoplasmic leaflet, but downward-oriented R696 primarily contacted CT residues, with rare cases of lipids migrating upward from the cytoplasmic leaflet and approaching the protein. A comparison of all full-length systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figures S12–S15</xref>) shows that R696 preferentially adopted downward orientations in the simulations initiated from the “low” TMD configuration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figures S13 and S15</xref>). In these cases, upward-shifted CT residues interact with the C-terminal half of the TMD, rather than solely with R696, resulting in deeper burial of the TMD in the membrane.</p>

<title>MPER adopts diverse conformations, and its exposure depends on both MPER and TMD conformations</title>
<p>Starting from the initial helix-turn-helix conformation consisting of two separate helical segments, the N-terminal half (MPER-N) and the C-terminal half (MPER-C), MPER underwent rapid rearrangements, and a wide variety of conformations were sampled across all trajectories. In the initial structure, the trimeric MPER was positioned perpendicular to the membrane, with the helical MPER-N tilted inward and MPER-C tilted outward (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Such conformation and orientation were maintained in some trajectories such as CL<sup>ΔCT</sup>3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S9C</xref>), but in others the helix-turn-helix MPER shifted into a horizontal orientation parallel to the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S13A</xref>) or a more vertical arrangement with both MPER-N and MPER-C tilted outward (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S111A</xref>). It was also observed that the HR2 helix in the ectodomain, MPER, and TMD merged into a continuous long helix (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C, F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S10C</xref>). In addition, it was common for part of the MPER, particularly the MPER-C, to lose its helical structure and become a random coil. Therefore, the distinct MPER conformations reported in various experimental studies can be all valid as each captures a possible state within the highly flexible conformational landscape of the MPER. It is noteworthy that the MPER in three protomers can adopt different conformations and orientations, resulting in asymmetric local structures.</p>
<p>Because the MPER is a target of multiple bNAbs, we next examined how its exposure is affected by TMD conformation. As described above, interactions between R696 and lipid headgroups affect the burial depth of the TMD, thereby influencing the positioning of the adjacent MPER. To quantify MPER exposure, we measured the vertical distance from the Cɑ of F673, approximately the midpoint of MPER, to the highest point of the neighboring lipid headgroups, denoted by <italic>d</italic><sub>F673</sub>. Positive values indicate that F673 lies above the bilayer surface, and negative values indicate its membrane burial. In the initial ‘low’ and ‘high’ TMD configurations, <italic>d</italic><sub>F673</sub> was 6.1 Å and 9.1 Å, respectively, but across simulations it spanned a wide range from -15 Å to 20 Å (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A and B</xref>). Two examples illustrate this variability. In the first example, all three R696 residues interacted with the cytoplasmic leaflet, drawing the TMD deeper into the membrane. Consequently, the entire MPER-C and most of MPER-N were buried in the membrane, with one F673 positioned 11.3 Å below the membrane surface, thus bringing the ectodomain in close proximity to the membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C and E</xref>). In the second example, two R696 residues interacted with the exoplasmic leaflet, while one interacted with the cytoplasmic leaflet. In the protomer with upward-oriented R696, the MPER-N, MPER-C, and TMD formed a continuous helix. As a result, most of the MPER extended outside the bilayer, with <italic>d</italic><sub>F673</sub> reaching 18.0 Å and the ectodomain displaced farther from the membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D and F</xref>). The <italic>d</italic><sub>F673</sub> distributions across all cleaved CT-truncated systems suggest that <italic>d</italic><sub>F673</sub> tends to be smaller when the simulations started from the “low” TMD configuration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). In both “high” and “low” configurations, the mean <italic>d</italic><sub>F673</sub> calculated from the simulation trajectories is smaller than its value calculated from the initial structure, due to both protein conformational change and lipid diffusion. In the “low” configuration, <italic>d</italic><sub>F673</sub> decreased by 5.0 Å (from 6.1 Å to 1.1 Å), a slightly larger reduction than in the “high” configuration where <italic>d</italic><sub>F673</sub> dropped by 3.5 Å (from 9.1 Å to 5.6 Å), indicating that deeper MPER burial arises from a larger-scale protein motion rather than merely from a lower initial placement.</p>

</fig>
<p>The epitope of PGT128 consists of the V3 loop and N332 glycan, and it is widely recognized that PGT128 binding is mediated by the protein-protein interaction with V3 loop and the protein-glycan interaction with N332 glycan, facilitated by its extra-long HCDR3 loop penetrating the glycan shield (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S16</xref>). Due to the absence of defined secondary structures, glycans exhibit greater conformational flexibility than the protein, although the crowded surface of gp120–gp41 may partially restrict the motion of glycans. N332 glycan must adopt specific conformations to enable specific interactions with PGT128, whereas most conformations block antibody approach. Additional glycans on N137, N156, and N301 can further occlude the site (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Epitope accessibility to PGT128 varied widely across protomers and trajectories, with many cases exceeding 35%. In about half trajectories, at least one protomer exhibited &gt;35% accessibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S2</xref>). For instance, in system CH<sup>ΔCT</sup>1, two protomers showed accessibility &gt;40%, whereas in system CL<sup>CT</sup>2, all three protomers are &lt;5%. The second antibody, PG9, targets the V1/V2 apex, where binding can be hindered by six glycans, N156, N160, and N185E on the same protomer, and N160, N185E, and N185H on the neighboring protomer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S17</xref>). In most trajectories, the epitopes on all three protomers were occluded in &gt;95% of the snapshots, with the exception of a few systems (CH<sup>ΔCT</sup>1, CH<sup>ΔCT</sup>2, and CL<sup>ΔCT</sup>3) where accessibility was non-negligible. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S3</xref>). The third antibody, VRC01, targets the CD4 binding site where six glycans, N185H, N197, N276, N363, and N462 on the same protomer and N301 on the neighboring protomer, can interfere with antibody binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S18</xref>). Similar to PGT128, the VRC01 epitope is moderately to highly accessible to at least one protomer in many trajectories, whereas in some trajectories, the epitopes on all three protomers are nearly completely shielded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S4</xref>).</p>
<p>35O22 targets the gp120–gp41 interface that is not intrinsically membrane-proximal. However, its binding orientation combined with ectodomain tilting can lead to clashes of 35O22 with the membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S19</xref>). Comparing accessibility with and without including the steric effects of membrane lipids shows that the membrane can hinder 35O22 binding, particularly when it approaches from the direction of ectodomain tilt (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). For example, in system UH<sup>ΔCT</sup>2, the accessibility frequencies of the three protomers were 49%, 5%, and 25%, when only the shielding of three glycans (N88, N234, and N618) was considered. When the steric effects of both glycans and membrane lipids were included, the first protomer’s frequency dropped from 49% to 1%, while the other two remain essentially unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S5</xref>).</p>
<p>The last two antibodies, 10E8 and 4E10, target the MPER. In the PDB structures of 10E8, the epitope is a 17-residue peptide corresponding to residues 671-687 in this work. In the PDB structure of 4E10, the epitope is a 12-residue peptide corresponding to residues 669-680. Superposition of these antibodies onto the initial simulation structure revealed extensive clashes with the protein and glycans linked to N611, N618, and N637 on the neighboring protomer, as well as slight steric clashes with the membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figures S20 and S21</xref>). Using the strict criteria (≤10 heavy-atom clashes with protein/glycan and ≤20 with lipids), no snapshot was identified in which the epitope of either antibody was accessible. Even with relaxed criteria (≤20 heavy-atom clashes with protein/glycan or ≤40 with lipids), accessible cases remain rare, which require either large ectodomain tilts to create space on the opposite side or the MPER transitioning into continuous helices to displace the ectodomain from the membrane (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S22–S25</xref>). Given the extremely low frequency of such specific conformations, MPER epitopes are effectively inaccessible in the prefusion trimer, suggesting that MPER-targeting antibodies such as 10E8 and 4E10 act at later stages of viral entry.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The hydrophobic and flexible nature of the MPER has made it difficult to crystallize, and most structural insights have come from NMR studies. However, structural information on the MPER and TMD has been inconsistent in the literature. For example, one study of the MPER in DPC micelles suggested that the MPER adopted a distorted helical structure lying parallel to the membrane surface,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> while NMR studies using gp41 fragments containing part of the MPER and TMD embedded in bicelles or bilayers reached conflicting conclusions. Some proposed a kink<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> or turn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> between the MPER and TMD, whereas others suggested that the MPER and TMD formed a continuous helix aligned perpendicular to the membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> In the NMR structure (PDB ID: 7LOI) used to build our model structure, a kink appears between the MPER and TMD, along with a turn in the middle of the MPER.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Crystal structures of MPER peptides bound to various antibodies show that in addition to the helix-turn-helix conformation, MPER can also adopt alternative structures in which the MPER-C remains helical while part of the MPER-N becomes unstructured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> Such variability underscores the intrinsic structural flexibility of the MPER, with each experimental method capturing only a subset of possible states under specific conditions. In this study, we employed MD simulations to sample a broader conformational landscape and gain a more comprehensive view of the structural heterogeneity of the MPER. The results reveal that the MPER can adopt all of the conformations reported experimentally. While MPER plasticity has been linked to its role in virus-host membrane fusion because it enables the ectodomain and TMD to adopt distinct orientations during large-scale structural rearrangements, our results show that this flexibility is already present in the prefusion state. At this stage, the MPER functions as a flexible hinge that facilitates ectodomain tilting, which can be critical for the spatial alignment of the CD4-binding site with the host receptor for efficient receptor engagement.</p>
<p>To probe antibody recognition, we assessed epitope accessibility using snapshots extracted from simulation trajectories. Unlike static experimental structures, this approach incorporates protein dynamics as well as the influence of glycans and membrane lipids, yielding a frequency-based measure indicating how often each epitope is accessible to its corresponding antibody, rather than a binary accessible/occluded classification. It is worth noting that viral glycans are highly variable in both site occupancy and the specific glycoform present at each glycosylation site, as indicated by mass spectrometry data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> For structure modeling, however, we assumed full occupancy at all glycosylation sites and selected a single representative glycoform per site. As a result, the estimated glycan shield may not fully reflect the in vivo situation, and the calculated frequency of antibody accessibility should be regarded as an approximation. Our results indicate that epitopes on the ectodomain, though heavily shielded by glycans, can still become transiently accessible in the closed prefusion state. The frequency provides a quantitative measurement of how vulnerable each epitope is to antibody binding. When estimating steric clashes between the membrane and antibodies, we adopted relaxed cutoffs to account for lipid fluidity, but the membrane due to fast lipid dynamics may in reality accommodate even greater steric overlap. Although the MPER can transiently extend out of the membrane when gp120–gp41 remains in the prefusion state, MPER-targeting antibodies still encounter substantial steric hindrance from the bulky gp120 subunit, surrounding glycans, and the membrane throughout nearly all simulations. Therefore, these antibodies are unlikely to adopt the proper orientations required to bind their epitopes. This is consistent with experiment studies indicating that MPER-targeting antibodies bind effectively only after the gp120–gp41 trimer undergoes major conformational rearrangements toward a fusion-intermediate or post-fusion state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Overall, the data presented here demonstrate that structural modeling integrated with molecular dynamic simulations can be applied to complex biomolecular systems, such as the gp120–gp41 trimer embedded in a membrane bilayer, which enables detailed characterization of protein dynamics at the molecular level and facilitates the investigation of antigen-antibody interactions, thereby offering potential guidance for rational vaccine design.</p>

<title>Modeling of full-length gp120–gp41 trimer</title>
<p>The full-length gp120–gp41 trimeric model was generated by combining the crystal structure of the ectodomain with the NMR structure containing the MPER, TMD, and CT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S1A</xref>). Considering structure resolution and the number of missing residues, we selected the crystal structure of a soluble Env trimer exhibiting a closed-from, native-like prefusion conformation (PDB ID: 6B0N),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> which contains the entire ectodomain including the V1-V5 loops, fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast to the ectodomain well represented in the PDB with numerous crystal and cryo-EM structures, structural data for the TMD are scarce. For this region, we chose the NMR structure (PDB ID: 7LOI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> containing the MPER, TMD, and CT. Both 6B0N and 7LOI are trimeric structures and the C-terminus of 6B0N includes five residues (L660–D664) overlapping with the N-terminus of 7LOI. Measurement of the Cα–Cα distances for D664 in the three protomers revealed that the inter-protomer spacing in 7LOI (16 Å) was much shorter than in 6B0N (39 Å) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S26A</xref>). To reconcile this difference, we performed short MD simulations on 6B0N with residues E32–Q640 fixed and a distance restraint applied to D664 in order to reduce the Cα– Cα distance to 33 Å. Similarly, for 7LOI, residues I675–L856 were fixed, and a distance restraint was applied to D664 to increase the distance to 33 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S26B</xref>). The two adjusted structures were then combined by aligning the overlapping residues. The missing loops in the ectodomain (T63, D149, E185A–N185I, S401–G409) and the unresolved region between the TM and CT (F717–G738) were grafted from a modeled structure generated by I-TASSER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S26C</xref>). 6B0N is a native flexibly linked (NFL) trimer in which the furin cleavage site <sup>508</sup>REKR<sup>511</sup> is substituted with a 10-residue linker <sup>508</sup>GG<underline>GGSGGGG</underline>S<sup>511</sup>, but the underlined residues are unresolved in the structure. To construct the cleaved gp120–gp41 model, we removed the initial “GG” and final “S” from 6B0N. For the uncleaved gp160 model, we closed the cleaved loop by adding <sup>508</sup>REKR<sup>511</sup> back to the structure. If we simply connect G507 and A512 without adjusting the conformation of flanking loops on both sides of the cleavage site, two neighboring protomers become entangled, yielding a knot-like fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figures S27A and B</xref>). In 6B0N, the helical HR2 region lies at the C-terminus of each protomer, allowing it to thread through a loop formed by the neighboring protomer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S27C</xref>). However, in the context of the full-length gp120–gp41, it is implausible that the three protomers are entangled as it does not conform to a realistic folding pathway. Therefore, we performed short MD simulations with restraints to adjust the conformations of the flanking loops and the HR2 helix before closing the loop with REKR fragment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figures S27D and E</xref>). Two mutations (S764C and S837C) were applied to CT to reintroduce the palmitoylation sites, and lipid tails oriented towards the hydrophobic core of the bilayer were added to the palmitoylation sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1D</xref>). In addition to the full-length model, we built the CT-truncated model by removing the modeled residues F717–G738 that are originally unresolved in the PDB structure 7LOI, and the residues E739– L856 that form the large CT plate.</p>

<p>The full-length and CT-truncated gp120–gp41 models were embedded into an asymmetric lipid bilayer with the lipid composition corresponding to a mammalian plasma membrane,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> which consists of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidic acid (PA), sphingomyelin (SM), cholesterol (CHOL), and glucosylceramide (GlcCer). In the CT-truncated system, the exoplasmic and cytoplasmic leaflets contain similar numbers of lipids, although their compositions differ. In the full-length system, the cytoplasmic leaflet contains approximately 100 fewer lipids than the exoplasmic leaflet due to the space occupied by the CT. The lipid composition is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S7</xref>. Although it is recognized that the charged residues R683, R707, and R709, flanking the N- and C-termini of the TMD, are anchored within the lipid headgroups, there remains some flexibility to shift the TMD slightly up or down within the membrane. Assuming the lipid bilayer is aligned parallel to the xy-plane, the protein was positioned at two distinct depths along the z-axis, differing by approximately 4 Å, referred to as the “high” and “low” TMD configurations. To examine whether this subtle difference in the initial configurations leads to distinct conformational changes during simulations, we initiated independent simulations from each configuration.

<title>Assessment of Antibody Epitope Accessibility</title>
<p>We selected six antibodies based on epitope location and the availability of PDB structures containing both antibody and epitope: PGT128 targeting the V3 loop and the N332 glycan (PDB ID: 5JSA);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> PG9 targeting the V1/V2 loop (PDB ID: 3U2S);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> VRC01 targeting the CD4 binding site (PDB ID: 4LST);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> 35O22 targeting the gp120–gp41 interface (PDB ID: 4TVP);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> 10E8 (PDB ID: 6VPX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> and 4E10 (PDB ID: 1TZG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> targeting the MPER. For each antibody– epitope complex, TM-align<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> was used to identify the optimal alignment between the epitope from the PDB structure and each protomer of the trimeric protein, and the resulting rotation matrix was applied to place the antibody relative to each protomer. Steric clashes were then assessed by counting any heavy atom of protein, glycan, or lipid within 2 Å of a heavy atom of the antibody. An epitope was considered occluded by protein and glycans if more than 10 heavy-atom clashes occurred with these components. To account for membrane flexibility, we adopted a more permissive cutoff for lipids: the epitope was classified as occluded by the membrane if more than 20 lipid heavy-atom clashes were detected. To calculate the frequency of epitope accessibility, snapshots were extracted from simulation trajectories, and structural alignment and assessment of steric clashes were performed on each snapshot.</p>

<p>In this <bold>useful</bold> study, the authors conducted an impressive amount of atomistic simulations with a realistic asymmetric lipid bilayer to probe how the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) transmembrane domain, cytoplasmic tail, and membrane environment influence ectodomain orientation and antibody epitope exposure.

With stronger integration of prior experimental and computational literature, this work has the potential to serve as a reference for how Env behaves in a realistic, glycosylated, membrane-embedded context.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript &quot;Conformational Variability of HIV-1 Env Trimer and Viral Vulnerability&quot;, the authors study the fully glycosylated HIV-1 Env protein using an all-atom forcefield. It combines long all-atom simulations of Env in a realistic asymmetric bilayer with careful data analysis. This work clarifies how the CT domain modulates the overall conformation of the Env ectodomain and characterizes different MPER-TMD conformations. The authors also carefully analyze the accessibility of different antibodies to the Env protein.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper is state-of-the-art, given the scale of the system and the sophistication of the methods. The biological question is important, the methodology is rigorous, and the results will interest a broad audience.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript lacks a discussion of previous studies. The authors should consider addressing or comparing their work with the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Tilting of the Env ectodomain has also been reported in previous experimental and theoretical work:</p>

<p>(1) Summary</p>
<p>In this work, the authors aim to elucidate how a viral surface protein behaves in a membrane environment and how its large-scale motions influence the exposure of antibody-binding sites. Using long-timescale, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a fully glycosylated, full-length protein embedded in a virus-like membrane, the study systematically examines the coupling between ectodomain motion, transmembrane orientation, membrane interactions, and epitope accessibility. By comparing multiple model variants that differ in cleavage state, initial transmembrane configuration, and presence of the cytoplasmic tail, the authors aim to identify general features of protein-membrane dynamics relevant to antibody recognition.</p>
<p>(2) Strengths</p>
<p>A major strength of this study is the scope and ambition of the simulations. The authors perform multiple microsecond-scale simulations of a highly complex, biologically realistic system that includes the full ectodomain, transmembrane region, cytoplasmic tail, glycans, and a heterogeneous membrane. Such simulations remain technically challenging, and the work represents a substantial computational and methodological effort.</p>
<p>The analysis provides a clear and intuitive description of large-scale protein motions relative to the membrane, including ectodomain tilting and transmembrane orientation. The finding that the ectodomain explores a wide range of tilt angles while the transmembrane region remains more constrained, with limited correlation between the two, offers useful conceptual insight into how global motions may be accommodated without large rearrangements at the membrane anchor.</p>
<p>Another strength is the explicit consideration of membrane and glycan steric effects on antibody accessibility. By evaluating multiple classes of antibodies targeting distinct regions of the protein, the study highlights how membrane proximity and glycan dynamics can differentially influence access to different epitopes. This comparative approach helps place the results in a broader immunological context and may be useful for readers interested in antibody recognition or vaccine design.</p>
<p>Overall, the results are internally consistent across multiple simulations and model variants, and the conclusions are generally well aligned with the data presented.</p>
<p>(3) Weaknesses</p>
<p>The main limitations of the study relate to sampling and model dependence, which are inherent challenges for simulations of this size and complexity. Although the simulations are long by current standards, individual trajectories explore only portions of the available conformational space, and several conclusions rely on pooling data across a limited number of replicas. This makes it difficult to fully assess the robustness of some quantitative trends, particularly for rare events such as specific epitope accessibility states.</p>
<p>In addition, several aspects of the model construction, including the treatment of missing regions, loop rebuilding, and initial configuration choices, are necessarily approximate. While these approaches are reasonable and well motivated, the extent to which some conclusions depend on these modeling choices is not always fully clear from the current presentation.</p>
<p>Finally, the analysis of antibody accessibility is based on geometric and steric criteria, which provide a useful first-order approximation but do not capture potential conformational adaptations of antibodies or membrane remodeling during binding. As a result, the accessibility results should be interpreted primarily as model-based predictions rather than definitive statements about binding competence.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the study provides a valuable and carefully executed contribution, and its datasets and analytical framework are likely to be useful to others interested in protein-membrane interactions and antibody recognition.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study uses large-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to examine the conformational plasticity of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) in a membrane context, with particular emphasis on how the transmembrane domain (TMD), cytoplasmic tail (CT), and membrane environment influence ectodomain orientation and antibody epitope exposure. By comparing Env constructs with and without the CT, explicitly modeling glycosylation, and embedding Env in an asymmetric lipid bilayer, the authors aim to provide an integrated view of how membrane-proximal regions and lipid interactions shape Env antigenicity, including epitopes targeted by MPER-directed antibodies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key strength of this work is the scope and realism of the simulation systems. The authors construct a very large, nearly complete Env-scale model that includes a glycosylated Env trimer embedded in an asymmetric bilayer, enabling analysis of membrane-protein interactions that are difficult to capture experimentally. The inclusion of specific glycans at reported sites, and the focus on constructs with and without the CT, are well motivated by existing biological and structural data.</p>
<p>The simulations reveal substantial tilting motions of the ectodomain relative to the membrane, with angles spanning roughly 0-30{degree sign} (and up to ~50{degree sign} in some analyses), while the ectodomain itself remains relatively rigid. This framing, that much of Env's conformational variability arises from rigid-body tilting rather than large internal rearrangements, is an important conceptual contribution. The authors also provide interesting observations regarding asymmetric bilayer deformations, including localized thinning and altered lipid headgroup interactions near the TMD and CT, which suggest a reciprocal coupling between Env and the surrounding membrane.</p>
<p>The analysis of antibody-relevant epitopes across the prefusion state, including the V1/V2 and V3 loops, the CD4 binding site, and the MPER, is another strength. The study makes effective use of existing experimental knowledge in this context, for example, by focusing on specific glycans known to occlude antibody binding, to motivate and interpret the simulations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the simulations are technically impressive, the manuscript would benefit from more explicit cross-validation against prior experimental and computational work throughout the Results and Discussion, and better framing in the introduction. Many of the reported behaviors, such as ectodomain tilting, TMD kinking, lipid interactions at helix boundaries, and aspects of membrane deformation, have been described previously in a range of MD studies of HIV Env and related constructs (e.g., PMC2730987, PMC2980712, PMC4254001, PMC4040535, PMC6035291, PMC12665260, PMID: 33882664, PMC11975376). Clearly situating the present results relative to these studies would strengthen the paper by clarifying where the simulations reproduce established behavior and where they extend it to more complete or realistic systems.</p>
<p>A related limitation is that the work remains largely descriptive with respect to conformational coupling. Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated functional and conformational coupling between the TMD, CT, and the antigenic surface, with effects on Env stability, infectivity, and antibody binding (e.g., PMC4701381, PMC4304640, PMC5085267). In this context, the statement that ectodomain and TMD tilting motions are independent is a strong conclusion that is not fully supported by the analyses presented, particularly given the authors' acknowledgment that multiple independent simulations are required to adequately sample conformational space. More direct analyses of coupling, rather than correlations inferred from individual trajectories, would help align the simulations with the existing experimental literature. Given the scale of these simulations, a more thorough analysis of coupling could be this paper's most seminal contribution to the field.</p>
<p>The choice of membrane composition also warrants deeper discussion. The manuscript states that it relies on a plasma membrane model derived from a prior simulation-based study, which itself is based on host plasma membrane (PMID: 35167752), but experimental analyses have shown that HIV virions differ substantially from host plasma membranes (e.g., PMC46679, PMC1413831, PMC10663554, PMC5039752, PMC6881329). In particular, virions are depleted in PC, PE, and PI, and enriched in phosphatidylserine, sphingomyelins, and cholesterol. These differences are likely to influence bilayer thickness, rigidity, and lipid-protein interactions and, therefore, may affect the generality of the conclusions regarding Env dynamics and antigenicity. Notably, the citation provided for membrane composition is a laboratory self-citation, a secondary source, rather than a primary experimental study on plasma membrane composition.</p>
<p>Finally, there are pervasive issues with citation and methodological clarity. Several structural models are referred to only by PDB ID without citation, and in at least one case, a structure described as cryo-EM is in fact an NMR-derived model. Statements regarding residue flexibility, missing regions in structures, and comparisons to prior dynamics studies are often presented without appropriate references. The Methods section also lacks sufficient detail for a system of this size and complexity, limiting readers' ability to assess robustness or reproducibility.</p>
<p>With stronger integration of prior experimental and computational literature, this work has the potential to serve as a valuable reference for how Env behaves in a realistic, glycosylated, membrane-embedded context. The simulation framework itself is well-suited for future studies incorporating mutations, strain variation, antibodies, inhibitors, or receptor and co-receptor engagement. In its current form, the primary contribution of the study is to consolidate and extend existing observations within a single, large-scale model, providing a useful platform for future mechanistic investigations.</p>

<p>In response to the comments raised, we outline below the revisions we plan to strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<p>First, we will expand the Introduction and Discussion sections to provide clearer comparison with prior experimental and computational studies of ectodomain tilting, MPER–TMD conformational heterogeneity, and membrane deformation, and to discuss how our simulations reproduce and extend these earlier observations.</p>
<p>Second, we plan to add analyses that more directly assess the coupling between ectodomain and TMD motions. We will also revise the text to emphasize the limits imposed by sampling and model dependence and to discuss the potential benefits of enhanced sampling methods.</p>
<p>Third, we will clarify the rationale for the chosen membrane composition and discuss how differences in lipid content between host plasma membranes and HIV virions may influence bilayer properties and Env dynamics.</p>
<p>Fourth, we will supplement the Methods section to improve clarity and address issues of citation throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>Finally, we intend to deposit MD trajectories to a public research data repository to the extent permitted by available storage capacity.</p>
