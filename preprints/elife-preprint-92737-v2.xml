<title>Abstract</title><p>Deeper understanding of the crosstalk between host cells and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) provides crucial guidelines for the rational design of novel intervention strategies against tuberculosis (TB). Mycobacteria possess a unique complex cell wall with arabinogalactan (AG) as critical component. AG has been identified as a virulence factor of Mtb which is recognized by host galectin-9. Here we demonstrate that galectin-9 directly inhibited mycobacterial growth through AG-binding property of carbohydrate-recognition domain 2. Furthermore, IgG antibodies with AG specificity were detected in serum of TB patients. Based on the interaction between galectin-9 and AG, we developed monoclonal antibody (mAb) screening assay and identified AG-specific mAbs which profoundly inhibit Mtb growth. Mechanistically, proteomic profiling and morphological characterizations revealed that AG-specific mAbs regulate AG biosynthesis, thereby inducing cell wall swelling. Thus, direct AG-binding by galectin-9 or antibodies contributes to protection against TB. Our findings pave the way for the rational design of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for TB control.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosi</italic>s (Mtb) remains a considerable threat to human health. In 2021, 10.6 million people fell ill with TB, 1.6 million people died from the disease, and 450,000 new TB cases suffered from rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB on this globe <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Although TB treatment measures are in place in many parts of the world, cure rates are insufficient due to the increasing emergence of drug resistance. Therefore, novel intervention strategies are urgently needed. Rational design of novel TB therapeutics depends on better understanding of the crosstalk between Mtb and host cells.</p>
<p>Following inhalation of aerosols carrying Mtb, innate immune responses are initiated which constitute a first line of defense. Firstly, Mtb are engulfed by mononuclear phagocytes into the phagosome which matures and then fuses with lysosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from Mtb are recognized by a variety of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), Nod-like receptors (NLRs), C-type lectins receptors (CLRs) and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), resulting in production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and anti-bacterial peptides to restrict bacterial growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Mtb can escape from the phagosome into the cytosol and can be recaptured in autophagosomes, through a process termed xenophagy, to form a degradative autolysosome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Cell-autonomous defense mechanisms also include production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, hypoxia, mild acidity and nutrition deprivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. These mechanisms help to limit growth and spread of the bacteria within the cell, and contribute to the initiation of an adaptive immune response. However, our knowledge about host immune factors that target Mtb components and directly inhibit replication is limited.</p>
<p>Mtb can evade and resist immune defense by entering a state of dormancy which can last for years. This is due to the capacity of Mtb to synthesize a sturdy cell wall, slow down metabolism to promote growth arrest and implement the so-called stringent response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. These mechanisms provide the basis for long-term persistence of Mtb until immune control weakens. Once immune control deteriorates, Mtb acquires a metabolic active stage and induces progression to active TB.</p>
<p>The complex cell wall of Mtb provides a barrier not only for host defense, but also for antibiotics. Accordingly, components of the cell wall are well-established drug targets. The essential core cell wall structure is composed of three distinct layers: a) the cross-linked network of peptidoglycan (PGN), b) the highly branched arabinogalactan (AG) polysaccharide, and c) the characteristic long-chain mycolic acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Among these, AG has been an important target for anti-TB drugs, though understanding of its biological functions is limited. E.g., ethambutol, one of the front-line anti-TB drugs, targets the arabinosyltransferases EmbA, EmbB and EmbC, which are critical for AG synthesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, it remains unclear whether AG is directly targeted by natural host immune factors in TB.</p>
<p>Recently, we identified AG as a virulence factor of Mtb that is recognized by galectin-9, a member of the β-galactoside binding gene family. Upon AG binding, galectin-9 initiates the downstream TAK1-ERK-MMP signaling cascade leading to pathologic impairment of the lung <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Galectin-4 and galectin-8 directly kill <italic>E.coli</italic> by recognizing blood group antigens of bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. This raises the question whether galectin-9 inhibits mycobacterial growth via targeting AG. Here, we demonstrate a novel cell-autonomous mechanism by which galectin-9 impedes mycobacterial growth via its AG-binding property in a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) 2-dependent mode. Moreover, in sera of TB patients, we identified anti-AG IgG antibodies which were supposed to defend against TB. Employing a monoclonal antibody (mAb) screening array, we identified anti-AG mAbs, CL010746 and CL046999, which were capable of restraining Mtb growth by regulating AG biosynthesis. Thus, AG possesses characteristic features of protective antigens. In sum, our work identified a previously unknown role of galectin-9 and anti-AG antibodies in TB control. Hence, our findings provide the basis for rational design of mAb-based immunotherapy of TB as a novel approach towards host-directed therapy of one of the deadliest infectious diseases globally.</p>

<title>Galectin-9 inhibits mycobacterial growth</title>
<p>Our previous work demonstrated that galectin-9 directly interacts with AG and AG-containing bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Given the capacity of galectin-4 and galectin-8 to kill <italic>E.coli</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, we interrogated whether galectin-9 directly interferes with mycobacterial replication. Real-time monitoring of <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures revealed that recombinant galectin-9 protein inhibits growth of Mtb at a concentration as low as 10 ng/mL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Native structural conformation of galectin-9 was required for its bacteriostatic effect since heat inactivation at 95 [for 5 min abrogated this activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). CFU assays further validated that galectin-9 inhibited Mtb growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Galectin-9 also impaired replication of the fast-growing <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistently, ELISA revealed profoundly higher abundance of galectin-9 in serum from TB patients than that from heathy donors, implying that galectin-9 contributes to resistance against Mtb infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Of note, average concentration of galectin-9 in sera of healthy donors was 3.602 ng/mL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). We speculate that this high abundance of galectin-9 contributes to maintenance of latent TB infection by restricting Mtb spreading from granuloma, where the pathogen is contained. In sum, we conclude that galectin-9 directly inhibits mycobacterial growth.</p>

<p>Macrophages are part of the first line defense against invading mycobacteria. When human monocytic THP-1 cells were infected with <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG fused with DsRed, immunofluorescence assays revealed recruitment of galectin-9 to mycobacteria in a time-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). In line with this observation, robust accumulation of galectin-9 around invading Mtb H37Rv-GFP was also observed in THP-1 cells post infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>). Though galectin-9 has been reported to be critical for initiation of mTOR signaling and induction of autophagy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, our work revealed a novel cell-autonomous mechanism whereby galectin-9 recruitment restricts mycobacterial growth in an autophagy-independent manner.</p>

<title>Carbohydrate recognition is essential for galectin-9-mediated inhibition of mycobacterial growth</title>
<p>Given that galectin-9 binds to β-galactoside, we interrogated whether carbohydrate recognition by galectin-9 is essential for inhibition of mycobacterial growth. Addition of lactose rich in β-galactoside (generally used for neutralization of carbohydrate binding of galectin-9) completely reversed mycobacterial growth inhibition by galectin-9 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, addition of glucose had no such effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). These results indicate that the β-galactose binding property of galectin-9 is involved in mycobacterial activity. Moreover, addition of AG reversed growth inhibition by galectin-9 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that the AG-binding property of galectin-9 is involved in anti-mycobacterial activity. Our previous work had demonstrated that CRD2, but not CRD1, of galectin-9 mediated its interaction with AG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. As expected, addition of purified CRD2, but not of CRD1, to some extent hindered Mtb growth, emphasizing that AG binding to galectin-9 was sufficient for anti-mycobacterial effects (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). aken together, carbohydrate recognition is essential for galectin-9-mediated inhibition of mycobacterial growth.</p>

<title>Identification of anti-AG antibodies from TB patients</title>
<p>Given the higher abundance of galectin-9 in serum from active TB patients, we next interrogated whether anti-AG antibodies are present in serum of TB patients. An ELISA assay was developed for identification of anti-AG antibodies by coating AG on plates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). An adequate window of serum dilutions allowed a linear correlation between OD<sub>450</sub> and dilution over an appropriate range (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Subsequently, we determined the relative abundance of anti-AG serum antibodies in 17 healthy donors and 25 active TB patients, all of whom had received BCG vaccination within 24 hours after birth. Our findings revealed a significant increase in the abundance of anti-AG antibodies among TB patients when compared to healthy donors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). We speculate that during Mtb infection, anti-AG IgG antibodies are induced, which potentially contribute to protection against TB by directly inhibiting Mtb replication albeit seemingly in vain. Whether anti-AG antibody levels at site of Mtb growth in patients are too low or whether growth inhibition is nullified by excessive replication of Mtb remains to be solved in the future.</p>

<title>Generation of anti-AG mAb</title>
<p>Based on the finding that AG binding of galectin-9 inhibits mycobacterial growth, we embarked on the development of anti-AG mAbs with blocking acivity. Given the high affinity between galectin-9 and AG, we developed an antibody chip comprising 62,208 mAbs to screen for anti-AG activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.

<title>Proteomics profiling of the mycobacterial response to anti-AG mAb</title>
<p>To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying inhibition of mycobacterial growth by anti-AG antibodies, we conducted proteomic profiling of Mtb in response to anti-AG mAb1 treatment. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of numerous cellular and metabolic processes, primarily related to biosynthesis of outer membrane, upon treatment with anti-AG mAb1. These processes include cell periphery, external encapsulating structure, organic substance metabolic process, cellular metabolic process, primary metabolic process, nitrogen compound metabolic process, and biosynthetic process (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, the formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase N-terminal domain was enriched based on the analysis of functional enrichment and protein domain of differentially expressed antigens (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B, C</xref>). Additionally, the KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated a significant enrichment of lipoarabinomannan (LAM) biosynthesis pathways (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).

<title>Targeting AG by mAbs modulates the cell wall of Mtb</title>
<p>To verify the impact of anti-AG mAbs on the biosynthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall, we characterized the morphological changes of Mtb treated with or without mAbs.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mtb, the etiologic agent of TB, is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, further aggravated by increasing incidences of antibiotic resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Hence, TB remains a major contributor to the global disease burden. Host-directed therapy is increasingly recognized as an alternative or adjunct to antibiotic therapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, deeper insights into the interactions between Mtb and the host immune system are warranted. We previously demonstrated that mycobacterial AG binds to the galactoside-binding protein galectin-9, causing pathologic impairments in the lung via the TAK1-ERK-MMP signaling pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrate that galectin-9 directly impedes mycobacterial growth through its AG-binding property. Further, we identified natural anti-AG antibodies in sera of TB patients, which are predicted to inhibit Mtb growth. Based on these findings, we generated mAbs capable of binding AG and hindering Mtb replication. Proteomics profiling of Mtb revealed that the binding of anti-AG antibodies regulates AG biosynthesis which leads to swelling of the cell wall, as validated by morphological characterization. We conclude that galectin-9 and anti-AG antibodies serve as immune factors that restrain bacterial growth by targeting AG in the cell wall. Increasing evidence suggests a role for antibodies in protection against TB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. It is generally assumed that the role of antibodies in TB is based on their interactions with macrophages, which promote anti-mycobacterial activities such as phago-lysosome fusion and production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In striking contrast, our findings demonstrate that anti-AG antibodies directly impair Mtb growth and thus emphasize that AG comprises features of protective antigens.</p>
<p>Galectins are a highly conserved class of molecules that play critical roles in multiple biological processes. Fifteen different types of galectins are known in humans, which can be classified based on their structure, subcellular localization, and function. For instance, galectin1 participates in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses through interactions with specific glycosylated receptors on the cell surface, such as integrins and CD45 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. More recently, it was shown that galectin-4 disrupts bacterial membranes and kills <italic>E.coli</italic> through interactions with lipopolysaccharides on the bacterial outer membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrate that galectin-9 significantly inhibits replication of Mtb by interacting with AG in Mtb via its CRD2 domain. Similar to galectin-9, galectin-4, galectin-6 and galectin-8 also comprise 2 CRDs in tandem connected by a linker sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. It remains to be explored whether and how these galectins exert anti-mycobacterial activities via the CRD2 domain, thereby providing general insights into the role of galectin family cognates in immunity to TB.</p>
<p>After phagocytosis by pulmonary macrophages of the newly infected host, Mtb ends up inside phagosomes, where it downregulates its metabolism and enters a non-replicating persistent (NRP) state, termed dormancy, in response to host stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Once the immune response “breaks down”, Mtb transits into a metabolically active and replicative state which ultimately results in progression to active TB disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.We demonstrated that galectin-9 accumulates around invading mycobacteria in host cells. However, whether Mtb recruit galectin-9 during dormancy, its active stage, or during both stages, has not been investigated. Of note, AG is hidden by mycolic acids in the outer layer. We speculate that during Mtb replication, cell wall synthesis is active and AG becomes exposed, thereby facilitating its binding to galectin-9 and leading to Mtb growth arrest.</p>
<p>Major drugs in clinical use for TB treatment inhibit Mtb growth by targeting different essential components and processes. For instance, Isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis by targeting InhA enzyme <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, Ethambutol blocks AG biosynthesis by targeting EmbCAB complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, and Pyrazinamide disrupts the pH balance within the bacterial cell, thereby impairing mycobacterial growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Although the mycobacterial cell wall has been widely exploited as antibiotic target, to date, drugs that directly bind AG and inhibit Mtb growth have not been reported. Here, we identified host galectin-9 and anti-AG antibodies (both serum antibodies from patients and mAbs) which recognize AG and thus inhibit Mtb replication. Hence, anti-AG mAbs can be harnessed for design of novel biologics which address the challenge of drug resistance in TB.</p>
<p>We observed elevated levels of galectin-9 in the serum of active TB patients, consistent with reports indicating that cleaved galectin-9 levels in the serum serve as a biomarker for severe infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. We consider that the elevated levels of galectin-9 in the serum of active TB may be an indicator of the host immune response to Mtb infection, however, the magnitude of elevated galectin-9 is not sufficient to control Mtb infection and maintain latent infection. This is highly similar to other protective immune factors such as interferon gamma, which is elevated in active TB as well <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. On the other hand, mechanisms underlying inhibition of mycobacterial growth induced by galectin-9 or anti-AG mAbs remain elusive. We propose they interfere with the activity of enzymes involved in AG biosynthesis and/or modify the physical properties of the cell wall, leading to disruption of AG side chain extension, thereby increasing Mtb vulnerability to host immunity. They may also function through the two-component system, that is commonly found in bacteria and allows bacteria to sense and respond to changes in the environment, such as nutrient availability or stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Interactions between galectin-9 and AG in the cell wall may alter membrane permeability, which restrains nutrient uptake and activates sensor proteins, causing bacterial growth arrest.</p>
<p>Aside from their direct anti-Mtb activity, anti-AG antibodies in serum of TB patients probably also opsonize Mtb, thereby promoting phagocytosis by mononuclear phagocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms by which galectin-9 or antibodies inhibit mycobacterial growth depend on the details of the molecular interactions and require further investigation.</p>
<p>Our knowledge about antibodies which target glycans is scarce, not the least due to technical challenges. Glycan antigens have been identified on the surface of numerous microorganisms and are also expressed by certain cancer cells. Antibodies that recognize and bind these glycan antigens, therefore, are promising candidates for therapy and diagnosis of infectious and malignant diseases. For instance, the mAb 2G12 neutralizes human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) by recognizing oligomannose-type N-glycans on the HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein, and the mAb FH6 specifically binds the Sialyl Lewis X (SLeX) antigen on the surface of various cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. In this study, we not only discovered anti-AG mAbs which directly impair Mtb growth, but also developed an efficient high-throughput screening for identifying mAbs with specificity for glycans.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we (i) discovered a novel cell-autonomous mechanism by which galectin-9 protects against TB via targeting AG in the cell wall of Mtb, (ii) identified neutralizing antibodies against AG in serum of TB patients, (iii) selected anti-AG mAbs for passive immunization against TB by means of a mAb screening array, (iv) characterized inhibition of Mtb replication by induction of cell wall swelling as critical mechanism of protection through AG targeting (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Our findings, thus, not only provide deeper insights into humoral immune mechanisms involved in protection against TB, but also serve as basis for new intervention strategies against TB in adjunct to chemotherapy.</p>

The pathway with a corrected p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. These pathways were classified into hierarchical categories according to the KEGG website.</p>

<title>Enrichment of protein domain analysis</title>
<p>For each category proteins, InterPro database (a resource that provides functional analysis of protein sequences by classifying them into families and predicting the presence of domains and important sites) was researched and a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was employed to test the enrichment of the differentially expressed protein against all identified proteins. Protein domains with a corrected p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p>

<title>Morphologic characterization of Mtb</title>
<p>Mtb strains were cultured in 96 U well culture plates containing Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium with anti-AG antibody or without anti-AG antibody at 37 [, and were grown for 10-14 days until the formation of colonies. Morphologic characterization of tested strains in liquid medium were observed by 2 x magnifier. At the same time, 10µl of culture were spread onto a glass slide. Smears on glass slides were fixed under ultraviolet light overnight. Glass slides were stained with Ziehl–Neelsen stain using a TB Stain Kit (Baso DIAGNOTICS TAIWAN, Zhuhai, China). Morphological characteristics or cell lengths of tested strains were observed using a Leica DM2500 microscope using the 100× objective.</p>
<p>For ultrastructural characteristics, strains at mid-log phase were collected, and analyzed by Tecnai transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with 160 kV according the procedures of the manufacturer (GOODBIO, Wuhan, China). A 10<sup>7</sup>-10<sup>8</sup> bacterial suspension was used for TEM examination.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The statistical significance of comparisons was analyzed with two tailed unpaired Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney U test in GraphPad Prism version 8.0.1.. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data are showed as mean ± SD of two or more independent experiments performed in triplicate. Detailed statistical information on each experiment is provided in the respective figure legends.</p>

<p>The main idea tested in this work is that host galectin-9 inhibits Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth by recognizing the Mtb cell wall component arabinogalactan (AG) and, as a result, disrupting mycobacterial cell wall structure. Moreover, a similar effect is achieved by anti-AG antibodies. While the hypothesis is intriguing and the work has the potential to make a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution to Mtb therapy, the evidence presented is <bold>incomplete</bold> and does not explain several critical points including the dose-independent effect of galectin-9 on Mtb growth and how anti-AG antibodies and galectin-9 access the AG layer of intact Mtb.</p>

<p>The molecular interactions which determine infection (and disease) trajectory following human exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are critical to understanding mycobacterial pathogenicity and tuberculosis (TB), a global public health threat which disproportionately impacts a number of high-burden countries and, owing to the emergence of multidrug-resistant Mtb strains, is a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In this submission, Qin and colleagues extend their own previous work which identified a potential role for host galectin-9 in recognizing the major Mtb cell wall component, arabinogalactan (AG). First, the authors present data indicating that galectin-9 inhibits mycobacterial growth during in vitro culture in liquid and on solid media, and that the inhibition depends on carbohydrate recognition by galectin-9. Next, the authors identify anti-AG antibodies in sera of TB patients and use this observation to inform isolation of monoclonal anti-AG antibodies (mAbs) via an in vitro screen. Finally, they apply the identified anti-AG mAbs to inhibit Mtb growth in vitro via a mechanism which proteomic and microscopic analyses suggest is dependent on disruption of cell wall structure. In summary, the dual observation of (i) the apparent role of naturally arising host anti-AG antibodies to control infection and (ii) the potential utility of anti-AG monoclonal antibodies as novel anti-Mtb therapeutics is compelling; however, as noted in the comments below, the evidence presented to support these insights is not adequate and the authors should address the following:</p>
<p>(1) The experiment which utilizes lactose or glucose supplementation to infer the importance of carbohydrate recognition by galectin-9 cannot be interpreted unequivocally owing to the growth-enhancing effect of lactose supplementation on Mtb during liquid culture in vitro.</p>
<p>(2) Similar to the comment above, the apparent dose-independent effect of galectin-9 on Mtb growth in vitro is difficult to reconcile with the interpretation that galectin is functioning as claimed.</p>
<p>(3) The claimed differences in galectin-9 concentration in sera from tuberculin skin test (TST)-negative or TST-positive non-TB cases versus active TB patients are not immediately apparent from the data presented.</p>
<p>(4) Neither fluorescence microscopy nor electron microscopy analyses are supported by high-quality, interpretable images which, in the absence of supporting quantitative data, renders any claims of anti-AG mAb specificity (fluorescence microscopy) or putative mAb-mediated cell wall swelling (electron microscopy) highly speculative.</p>
<p>(5) Finally, the absence of any discussion of how anti-AG antibodies (similarly, galectin-9) gain access to the AG layer in the outer membrane of intact Mtb bacilli (which may additionally possess an extracellular capsule/coat) is a critical omission - situating these results in the context of current knowledge about Mtb cellular structure (especially the mycobacterial outer membrane) is essential for plausibility of the inferred galectin-9 and anti-AG mAb activities.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors work to extend their previous observation that galectin-9 interacts with arabinogalactans of Mtb in their EMBO reports 2021 manuscript. Here they provide evidence for the CARD2 domain of galectin-9 can inhibit the growth of Mtb in culture. In addition, antibodies that also bind to AG appear to inhibit Mtb growth in culture. These data indicate that independent of the common cell-associated responses to galectin-9 and antibodies, interaction of these proteins with AG of mycobacteria may have consequences for bacterial growth.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provided several lines of evidence in culture media that the introduction of galectin-9 proteins and antibodies inhibit the growth rate of Mtb.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The methodology for generating and screening the anti-AG antibodies lacks pertinent details for recapitulating and interpreting the results.</p>
<p>The figure legends and methods associated with the microscopy assays lack sufficient details to appropriately interpret the experiments conducted.</p>
<p>The galectin-9 measured in the sera of TB patients does not approach the concentrations required for Mtb growth restriction in the in vitro assays performed by the authors. It remains difficult to envision how greater levels of galectin-9 release might contribute to Mtb control in severe forms of TB, since higher levels of serum Gal9 has been observed in other human studies and correlate with poorly controlled infection. The authors over-interpret the role of Gal9 in bacterial control during disease/infection without any evidence of impact on in vivo (animal model) control.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>Question 1: The experiment that utilizes lactose or glucose supplementation to infer the importance of carbohydrate recognition by galectin-9 cannot be interpreted unequivocally owing to the growth-enhancing effect of lactose supplementation on Mtb during liquid culture in vitro.</p>

<p>Thank you for this very constructive comment. We repeated the experiments by lowering the concentration of lactose or AG from 10 μg/mL to 1 μg/mL. We found that low concentration of lactose or AG showed neglectable effect on Mtb growth, however, they still reversed the inhibitory effect of galectin-9 on mycobacterial growth (revised Fig. 2A, C). Therefore, we consider that the supplementation of lactose or AG reverse galectin-9 mediated inhibition of Mtb growth largely through its carbohydrate recognition rather than their growth-enhancing effect.</p>

<p>Question 2: Similar to the comment above, the apparent dose-independent effect of galectin-9 on Mtb growth in vitro is difficult to reconcile with the interpretation that galectin is functioning as claimed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the correction. Indeed, as the reviewer pointed out, galectin-9 inhibits Mtb growth in dose-independent manner. We had corrected the claim in the revised manuscript (Line 114).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 3: The claimed differences in galectin-9 concentration in sera from tuberculin skin test (TST)-negative or TST-positive non-TB cases versus active TB patients are not immediately apparent from the data presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your concern. Previous samples are from a cohort set up in Max Plank Institute for Infection Biology. We have performed the detection of galectin-9 in sera in another independent cohort of active TB patients and healthy donors in China. And we found higher abundance of galectin-9 in serum from TB patients than that from heathy donors (revised Fig. 1E).</p>

<p>Question 4: Neither fluorescence microscopy nor electron microscopy analyses are supported by high-quality, interpretable images which, in the absence of supporting quantitative data, renders any claims of anti-AG mAb specificity (fluorescence microscopy) or putative mAb-mediated cell wall swelling (electron microscopy) highly speculative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your concern. We have improved the procedure of the immunofluorescence assay and obtained high-quality and interpretable images with quantitative data (revised Fig. 4F). As for electron microscopy analyses, we added clearer label indicating cell wall in revised manuscript (revised Fig. 7C).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 5: Finally, the absence of any discussion of how anti-AG antibodies (similarly, galectin-9) gain access to the AG layer in the outer membrane of intact Mtb bacilli (which may additionally possess an extracellular capsule/coat) is a critical omission - situating these results in the context of current knowledge about Mtb cellular structure (especially the mycobacterial outer membrane) is essential for plausibility of the inferred galectin-9 and anti-AG mAb activities.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Exactly, AG is hidden by mycolic acids in the outer layer of Mtb cell wall. As we have discussed in the Discussion part of previous manuscript (line 285), we speculate that during Mtb replication, cell wall synthesis is active and AG becomes exposed, thereby facilitating its binding to galectin-9 or AG antibody and leading to Mtb growth arrest. It’s highly possible that galectin-9 or AG antibody targets replicating Mtb.</p>

<p><bold>To Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Question 1: In light of other observations that cleaved galectin-9 levels in the plasma is a biomarker for severe infection (Padilla A et al Biomolecules 2021 and Iwasaki-Hozumi H et al. Biomoleucles 2021) it is difficult to reconcile the author's interpretation that the elevated gal-9 in Active TB patients (Figure 1E) contributes to the maintenance of latent infection in humans. The authors should consider incorporating these observations in the interpretation of their own results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these very insightful comments. We observed elevated levels of galectin-9 in the serum of active TB patients, consistent with reports indicating that cleaved galectin-9 levels in the serum serve as a biomarker for severe infection (Iwasaki-Hozumi et al., 2021; Padilla et al., 2020). We consider that the elevated levels of galectin-9 in the serum of active TB may be an indicator of the host immune response to Mtb infection, however, the magnitude of elevated galectin-9 is not sufficient to control Mtb infection and maintain latent infection. This is highly similar to other protective immune factors such as interferon gamma, which is elevated in active TB as well (El-Masry et al., 2007; Hasan et al., 2009). We have included the discussion in the revised manuscript (line 298).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 2: The anti-AG titers were measured only in individuals with active TB (Figure 3C), generally thought to be a less protective immunological state. The speculation that individuals with anti-AG titers have some protection is not founded. Further only 2 mAbs were tested to demonstrate restriction of Mtb in culture. It is possible that clones of different affinities for AG present within a patient's polyclonal AG-antibody responses may or may not display a direct growth restriction pressure on Mtb in culture. The authors should soften the claims about the presence of AG-titers in TB patients being indicative of protection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your concern. As per your suggestion, we have softened the claim to that “We speculate that during Mtb infection, anti-AG IgG antibodies are induced, which potentially contribute to protection against TB by directly inhibiting Mtb replication albeit seemingly in vain.”</p>
