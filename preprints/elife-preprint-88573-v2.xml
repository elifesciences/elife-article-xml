<title>Abstract</title><p>The role of Processing bodies (P-bodies) in tumorigenesis and tumor progression is not well understood. Here, we showed that the oncogenes YAP/TAZ promote P-body formation in a series of cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, both transcriptional activation of the P- body-related genes SAMD4A, AJUBA, and WTIP and transcriptional suppression of the tumor suppressor gene PNRC1 are involved in enhancing the effects of YAP/TAZ on P- body formation in CRC cells. By reexpression of PNRC1 or knockdown of P-body core genes (DDX6, DCP1A, and LSM14A), we determined that disruption of P-bodies attenuates cell proliferation, cell migration and tumor growth induced by overexpression of YAP<sup>5SA</sup> in CRC. Analysis of a pancancer CRISPR screen database (DepMap) revealed codependencies between YAP/TEAD and the P-body core genes and correlations between the mRNA levels of SAMD4A, AJUBA, WTIP, PNRC1 and YAP target genes. Our study suggests that the P-body is a new downstream effector of YAP/TAZ, which implies that reexpression of PNRC1 or disruption of P-bodies is a potential therapeutic strategy for tumors with active YAP.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Hippo pathway is an evolutionally conserved signaling pathway that regulates organ size and plays vital roles in development and tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Driskill &amp; Pan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ma et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Russell &amp; Camargo, 2022</xref>). The transcriptional output of the Hippo pathway is mainly mediated by the YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcription complex. In response to various extracellular or intracellular signals, including cell–cell contact, mechanical force, serum stimulation, cellular stress and cellular energy status, the YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex modulates target gene expression to respond to environmental cues(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Calvo et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Misra &amp; Irvine, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yu et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhao et al, 2007</xref>). Although initially identified as transcriptional coactivators, YAP/TAZ can also function as corepressors to inhibit target gene transcription by recruiting the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim et al, 2015b</xref>). The evidence of Hippo pathway dysregulation in a variety of cancers and the list of YAP/TAZ target genes continue to increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calses et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kulkarni et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nguyen &amp; Yi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zanconato et al, 2016</xref>). Dysregulation of YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcriptional output endows tumor cells with every hallmark of cancer, including sustained proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, tumor- promoting inflammation, tumor immune escape, dysregulated tumor metabolism, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calses et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hanahan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kulkarni et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nguyen &amp; Yi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zanconato et al, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>At the cellular organization level, the YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcription complex modulates mitochondrial fusion; cytoskeleton, primary cilium, and focal adhesion assembly; and caveolae formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim et al, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mason et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nagaraj et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Qiao et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rausch et al, 2019</xref>). Processing bodies (P-bodies) are cytoplasmic membraneless organelles that consist of ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) and are formed by phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luo et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Riggs et al, 2020</xref>). Although initial studies hypothesized that mRNAs in P-bodies are targeted for decay and translational repression, it was subsequently suggested that P-bodies are not required for mRNA decay and that repressed mRNAs can be recycled from P-bodies to reenter translation; thus, the primary function of P-bodies is controlling the storage of untranslated mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Decker &amp; Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hubstenberger et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luo et al, 2018</xref>). The role of P-bodies in tumorigenesis and tumor progression is not well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lavalee et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Riggs et al, 2020</xref>). The formation of P-bodies is correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hardy et al, 2017</xref>). In contrast, there is also evidence that an increase in P-bodies leads to attenuated growth, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bearss et al, 2021</xref>). Recently, YAP was reported to be a negative regulator of P- bodies and to be involved in Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KHSV)-induced P- body disassembly in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Castle et al, 2021</xref>). However, this regulatory axis and the potential function of P-bodies in YAP-induced tumorigenesis remain unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, we discovered that YAP/TAZ are enhancers but not negative regulators of P- body formation in a series of cancer cell lines. YAP/TAZ modulate the transcription of multiple P-body-related genes, especially repressing the transcription of the tumor suppressor proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (PNRC1) through cooperation with the NuRD complex. As a direct YAP/TAZ target gene, PNRC1 functions as a critical effector in YAP-induced biogenesis of P-bodies and tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Furthermore, disruption of P-bodies by knockdown of core component genes of P-bodies attenuated the protumorigenic effects of YAP in CRC. Thus, our study reveals a YAP–P- body positive regulatory axis in colorectal cancer, which exposes the vital role of YAP/TAZ in the biogenesis of P-bodies in tumors and implies that reexpression of PNRC1 or disruption of P-bodies is a potential therapeutic strategy for cancers with active YAP.</p>

<title><bold>YAP/TAZ regulates the transcription of P-body-related genes</bold></title>
<p>Previously, to identify the new target genes and molecular signatures of YAP/TAZ in colorectal cancer, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of HCT116 CRC cells with simultaneous knockdown of YAP and TAZ (GSE176475) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guo et al, 2022</xref>). Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the 674 differentially expressed genes upon knockdown of YAP/TAZ (FC&gt;2, p&lt;0.05) revealed that the genes downregulated by YAP/TAZ knockdown were enriched in the term P-body in the cellular component category (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We further expanded our analysis to the moderately differentially expressed genes (FC&lt;0.66 or &gt;1.5) that were annotated as related to P-bodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-Figure Supplement 1A, Appendix Table S1). Through integration with the public ChIP-seq data for TEAD4 in HCT116 cells from the ENCODE database, AJUBA, WTIP, NOCT, SAMD4A and PNRC1 were selected for in-depth investigation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-Figure Supplement 1A). Intriguingly, the public TEAD4 ChIP-seq datasets for the other three cancer cell lines (A549, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231), not just HCT116 cells, also showed strong TEAD4 binding peaks in the genomic loci of these five P-body-related genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-Figure Supplement 1B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mei et al, 2017</xref>). HCT116, A549, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231 are well established cell models for exploring YAP/TAZ function and the cell proliferation of these four cell lines are dependent on YAP/TAZ activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rosenbluh et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shreberk-Shaked et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zanconato et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhu et al, 2019</xref>). It is worth noting cell contact inhibition were observed in HCT116 and MDA-MB-231 and YAP remains in the nucleus regardless of cell–cell contact in A549 and MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fan et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kim et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wu et al, 2019</xref>). The ChIP–qPCR results in HCT116 cells further confirmed that TEAD4 bound to the promoter regions of AJUBA, WTIP, NOCT, SAMD4A and PNRC1 and to the intronic region of PNRC1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, we confirmed the significantly downregulated mRNA expression of AJUBA, WTIP, SAMD4A and NOCT and moderately increased expression of PNRC1 in YAP/TAZ knockdown HCT116 cells by qPCR analysis; this pattern was also observed in A549 lung cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with these findings, overexpression of the constitutively active YAP<sup>5SA</sup> mutant but not the TEAD binding-defective YAP<sup>5SA-S94A</sup> mutant significantly decreased the mRNA level of PNRC1 and increased the mRNA level of SAMD4A in HCT116, MCF7 and A549 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Enhanced expression of AJUBA and WTIP was observed in HCT116 and MCF7 cells but not in A549 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Since NOCT was not affected by overexpression of YAP<sup>5SA</sup> in either MCF7 or A549 cells, we did not investigate NOCT in subsequent functional experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Finally, we confirmed that the protein level of PNRC1 was increased by knockdown of YAP/TAZ in HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-Figure Supplement 1C). Additionally, overexpression of YAP<sup>5SA</sup> but not YAP<sup>5SA-S94A</sup> decreased the protein level of PNRC1 in HCT116, A549 and MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-Figure Supplement 1D). Overall, these data demonstrate that YAP/TAZ modulate the transcription of P-body-related genes through the TEAD transcription factors.</p>

<title>YAP/TAZ enhances P-body formation</title>
<p>In contrast to stress granule (SG) formation, P-body formation is constitutive and independent of the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luo et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Riggs et al, 2020</xref>). DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase 6 (DDX6) and mRNA- decapping enzyme 1A (DCP1A) are the essential components of P-bodies and are normally used as the biomarkers for P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">James et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lavalee et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luo et al, 2018</xref>). To explore whether YAP/TAZ regulate P-body formation, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of DDX6 and DCP1A in YAP/TAZ knockdown cells plated at a low density. We found that knockdown of YAP/TAZ significantly decreased but overexpression of YAP<sup>5SA</sup> increased the number of DDX6/DCP1A-positive foci in HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, 2B). HCT116 cells expressing YAP<sup>5SA-S94A</sup> and control HCT116 cells showed similar numbers of P-bodies, which indicated that the TEAD transcription factors mediate the enhanced effects of YAP/TAZ on P-body formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar results were observed in YAP/TAZ knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells and YAP<sup>5SA</sup>/YAP<sup>5SA-S94A</sup>- expressing A549 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-Figure Supplement 1A, B).</p>

<p>Upregulation of <italic>Ajuba, Samd4</italic> (mouse ortholog of human SAMD4A) and <italic>Noct</italic> and downregulation of <italic>Pnrc1</italic> was also observed in NIH3T3 cells overexpressed with YAP<sup>5SA</sup> but not cells with YAP<sup>5SA-S94A</sup> overexpression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-Figure Supplement 2E). Moreover, despite their constitutive formation in cells, the size and number of P-bodies are altered in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luo et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Riggs et al, 2020</xref>). Next, we evaluated P-bodies under exposure to different stimuli. We observed that serum stimulation led to rapid induction of P-body formation in HCT116 and NIH3T3 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-Figure Supplement 2B). Knockdown of YAP/TAZ attenuated the enhancement of P-body formation induced by serum stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-Figure Supplement 1C). Conversely, at a high cell density, the number of P-bodies was significantly decreased in HCT116 and NIH3T3 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-Figure Supplement 2C). Consistent with this finding, the expression of SAMD4A, NOCT, and WTIP in HCT116 cells was induced by serum stimulation and suppressed by culture at a high cell density (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, 2F). Similar results were also observed in NIH3T3 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-Figure Supplement 2F, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-Figure Supplement 2G). Intriguingly, both serum starvation and culture at a high cell density dramatically increased the expression of PNRC1, consistent with the tumor suppressor function of PNRC1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, 2F, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-Figure Supplement 2F, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-Figure Supplement 2G). Recent studies have revealed that mechanical cues as an important signal modulating YAP/TAZ activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aragona et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dupont et al, 2011</xref>). Diverse mechanical forces, such as increased ECM rigidity, cell stretching, shear stress, or the increased area of cell adhesion, can all activate YAP, which is dominant over Hippo signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dasgupta &amp; McCollum, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Piccolo et al, 2014</xref>). Next, we examined whether ECM stiffness affected P-body formation. When NIH3T3 cells were shifted from soft (1kPa) to stiff (40kPa) matrices, YAP was translocated into nucleus and activated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-Figure Supplement 2D). Furthermore, the P-body formation was enhanced which was associate with decreased mRNA level of <italic>Pnrc1</italic> and increased mRNA levels of <italic>Ajuba, Samd4</italic> and <italic>Noct</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-Figure Supplement 2D, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-Figure Supplement 2H). Collectively, our data indicate that YAP/TAZ could be positive regulators of P-body formation in response to various stimuli, probably by modulating the expression of P-body-related genes.</p>

<title>SAMD4A, AJUBA and PNRC1 mediate the functions of YAP/TAZ in regulating P-body formation</title>
<p>Next, we investigated whether the P-body-related genes transcriptionally regulated by YAP/TAZ mediate the biological functions of YAP/TAZ in regulating P-body formation. The LIM-domain proteins AJUBA, WTIP and LIMD1 are known as negative regulators of LATS1 (Das Thakur et al, 2010). They are also components of P-bodies and are required for miRNA-mediated silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">James et al, 2010</xref>). SAMD4A is the mammalian homolog of Drosophila Smaug, which is involved in translational repression and localized in P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baez &amp; Boccaccio, 2005</xref>). First, we knocked down AJUBA and SAMD4A in HCT116 cells overexpressing YAP<sup>5SA</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-Figure Supplement 1A, B). As expected, knockdown of both AJUBA and SAMD4A significantly diminished the promoting effect of YAP<sup>5SA</sup> overexpression on P-body formation in HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Unlike AJUBA and SAMD4A, PNRC1 is a tumor suppressor that inhibits P-body formation by recruiting cytoplasmic DCP1A/DCP2 into the nucleolus, thus loss of cytoplasmic DCP1A/DCP2 results in disruption of P-body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gaviraghi et al, 2018</xref>). Overexpression of YAP<sup>5SA</sup> suppressed PNRC1 expression; thus, WT PNRC1 and PNRC1 with the W300A mutation, which disrupts the interaction between PNRC1 and DCP1A/DCP2, were overexpressed in YAP<sup>5SA</sup>-expressing HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-Figure Supplement 1C, D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gaviraghi et al, 2018</xref>). We observed that overexpression of WT PNRC1 but not the W300A mutant dramatically decreased the number of P-bodies in YAP<sup>5SA</sup>-expressing HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We also examined whether the attenuation of P-body formation by knockdown of YAP/TAZ can be restored by knockdown of PNRC1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-Figure Supplement 1E). Consistent with the above findings, the reduction in the P-body number was reversed by knockdown of PNRC1 in YAP/TAZ knockdown HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-Figure Supplement 1F). Collectively, these findings indicate that YAP/TAZ enhance P-body formation through modulation of a series of P-body-related genes. Both activation of SAMD4A and AJUBA expression and downregulation of PNRC1 are involved in YAP/TAZ-induced P-body formation.</p>

<title>YAP/TAZ inhibit PNRC1 gene transcription by recruiting the NuRD complex</title>
<p>PNRC1 is a newly identified tumor suppressor gene whose expression is frequently downregulated in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gaviraghi et al, 2018</xref>). Thus, we further explored the molecular mechanism of YAP/TAZ in inhibiting the PNRC1 gene transcription. The ChIP-seq data for TEAD4 at the PNRC1 gene locus in multiple cancer cells implicated PNRC1 as a potential direct target gene of YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcription complexes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-Figure Supplement 1B). As ChIP–qPCR analysis of TEAD4 in HCT116 cells revealed one TEAD4 binding site at the PNRC1 promoter and another in the PNRC1 intron, we constructed PNRC1 promoter and PNRC1 intron luciferase reporter plasmids. We observed that overexpression of YAP<sup>5SA</sup> significantly decreased the luciferase activity of both the PNRC1 promoter and intron reporters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Compared with the 5SA mutation in YAP, the S94A mutation resulted in a decreased suppressive effect on PNRC1 promoter and intron luciferase reporter activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, the luciferase activity of both the PNRC1 promoter and intron reporters was significantly enhanced in YAP/TAZ knockdown HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-Figure Supplement 1A). Bioinformatic analysis of TEAD4 ChIP peaks in the PNRC1 promoter and intronic regions with JASPAR revealed the existence of one TEAD binding motif in each peak region; thus, we further constructed PNRC1 luciferase reporter plasmids with mutated TEAD binding sites. Consistent with the above results, mutation of the TEAD binding sites abolished the inhibitory effect of YAP<sup>5SA</sup>on the PNRC1 promoter and intron luciferase reporters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Similarly, mutation of the TEAD binding sites escaped the derepression of PNRC1 promoter and intron luciferase reporters by YAP/TAZ knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, the ChIP–qPCR results confirmed that YAP bound to the promoter and intronic regions of PNRC1, which required its interaction with TEADs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-Figure Supplement 1B, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-Figure Supplement 1C).</p>

<p>In addition to functioning as transcriptional coactivators, YAP/TAZ can also act as transcriptional corepressors by recruiting the NuRD complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim et al, 2015b</xref>). The ChIP–qPCR results showed that the NuRD complex component CHD4 was recruited to the promoter and intronic regions of the PNRC1 gene by overexpressed YAP<sup>5SA</sup> but not by the TEAD binding-defective YAP<sup>5SA-S94A</sup> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Compared to the genomic locus of PNRC1, the binding enrichment of CHD4 at the YAP target genes activated by YAP/TAZ were relative lower and wasn’t affected by overexpression of YAP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-Figure Supplement 1D). Moreover, knockdown of the NuRD complex components CHD4 and RBBP4 significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of PNRC1 in HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Consistently, knockdown of CHD4 significantly decreased the number of DDX6/DCP1A-positive foci in HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-Figure Supplement 1E). Taken together, these data demonstrate that YAP/TAZ inhibit PNRC1 gene transcription through direct binding of TEADs to the PNRC1 gene locus and that the NuRD complex is required for the transcriptional repression of PNRC1 by YAP/TAZ.</p>

<title>PNRC1 suppresses the oncogenic function of YAP in CRC</title>
<p>Analysis of colorectal (COAD) and rectal (READ) TCGA datasets revealed that the mRNA level of PNRC1 was significantly decreased in CRC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-Figure Supplement 1A). We further confirmed the decreased mRNA level of PNRC1 in CRC by qPCR analysis of 16 CRC tissues with paired normal mucosal tissues; this finding implies that PNRC1 is a potential tumor suppressor also in CRC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-Figure Supplement 1B). Thus, we sought to explore whether downregulation of PNRC1 mediates the oncogenic function of YAP in CRC. To this end, we examined whether the YAP overexpression-induced oncogenic phenotype can be attenuated by coexpression of YAP<sup>5SA</sup> with WT PNRC1 or the W300A mutant in HCT116 cells. We observed that reexpression of WT PNRC1 almost completely abolished the increases in cell proliferation and colony formation induced by YAP<sup>5SA</sup> overexpression in HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, 5B). Re-expression of the PNRC1 W300A mutant did not affect the proliferation and colony formation of YAP<sup>5SA</sup>-expressing HCT116 cells, which implied that the suppressive effect of PNRC1 on YAP relies on the recruitment of cytoplasmic DCP1A/DCP2 into the nucleolus by PNRC1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, 5B). Similarly, overexpression of PNRC1 WT but not PNRC1 W300A suppressed the increase in migration induced by YAP<sup>5SA</sup> in HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). To verify the tumor-suppressive effect of PNRC1 on YAP in CRC <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed a xenograft assay by subcutaneously injecting HCT116 cells into nude mice. Consistent with the above findings, reexpression of WT PNRC1 but not the W300A mutant dramatically inhibited the growth of YAP<sup>5SA</sup>-expressing HCT116 xenografts, and xenograft tumors formed from HCT116 cells coexpressing YAP<sup>5SA</sup> and PNRC1 were significantly smaller than tumors formed from HCT116 cells expressing YAP<sup>5SA</sup> alone or in combination with the PNRC1 W300A mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Ki67 staining of xenograft tumors further showed fewer Ki67-positive cells in xenograft tumors formed from HCT116 cells coexpressing YAP<sup>5SA</sup> and PNRC1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-Figure Supplement 1C). Next, we examined whether the YAP/TAZ knockdown- induced attenuation of the oncogenic phenotype can be restored by knockdown of PNRC1 in HCT116 cells. Intriguingly, the decrease in proliferation and attenuation of migration induced by YAP/TAZ knockdown were reversed by knockdown of PNRC1 in HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-Figure Supplement 1D, E). Overall, these results indicate that YAP promotes tumorigenesis by downregulating PNRC1 expression and that reexpression of PNRC1 suppresses YAP-driven tumor growth.</p>

<title>P-body disassembly attenuates YAP-driven cell proliferation and migration in CRC</title>
<p>Due to the inhibitory effects of PNRC1 on P-body formation and the YAP-induced oncogenic phenotype, we evaluated whether enhanced P-body formation plays a vital role in YAP-driven cancer cell proliferation and migration. The proteins LSM14 homolog A (LSM14A) and DDX6 are essential nucleating proteins for P-body assembly, and DCP1A plays a vital role in further RNP aggregation, which is required for stress-dependent P- body aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lavalee et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luo et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Riggs et al, 2020</xref>). To explore the requirement of P-body formation for the YAP-induced oncogenic phenotype, we generated YAP<sup>5SA</sup>-expressing HCT116 cell lines with stable knockdown of DCP1A, LSM14A and DDX6 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-Figure Supplement 1A, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-Figure Supplement 2A-C). By immunofluorescence analysis of DDX6 and DCP1A, we further confirmed the knockdown of DCP1A and DDX6 and observed a reduced number of P-bodies upon knockdown of DCP1A, LSM14A or DDX6 in YAP<sup>5SA</sup>-expressing HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-Figure Supplement 1B). Next, by using a CCK8 assay, we found that knockdown of DCP1A, LSM14A and DDX6 suppressed the proliferation of YAP<sup>5SA</sup>-expressing and control “parental” HCT116 cells, consistent with the results of the colony formation assay (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, 6B). As an oncogene, YAP is known to promote cell division and inhibit cell apoptosis of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">He et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jang et al, 2017</xref>). By analyzing the cell cycle and cell apoptosis, we further found that knockdown of DCP1A, LSM14A and DDX6 all led to downregulation of cell mitosis and increased cell apoptosis, which was opposite to the effect of YAP<sup>5SA</sup> overexpression in HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-Figure Supplement 3A-B). Furthermore, knockdown of either DCP1A or LSM14A significantly attenuated the enhancement of cell migration induced by overexpression of YAP<sup>5SA</sup> in HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of DDX6 showed stimulative effect on the migration of both control and YAP<sup>5SA</sup>-expressing HCT116 cells, possibly due to the diverse functions of DDX6 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-Figure Supplement 4A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Di Stefano et al, 2019</xref>). To further demonstrate the potential role of P-body mediating the function of YAP/TAZ in CRC, we established YAP<sup>5SA</sup>-expressing HCT116 cell lines with stable knockdown of AJUBA and SAMD4A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-Figure Supplement 4B, C). Indeed, both knockdown of AJUBA and SAMD4A suppressed the proliferation and cell migration of YAP<sup>5SA</sup>-expressing and control “parental” HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-Figure Supplement 4D, E).

<title>Codependency of YAP/TEAD and essential P-body-related genes in pancancer CRISPR screens</title>
<p>Based on the observation that P-body disassembly attenuates YAP-driven cell proliferation in CRC cells, we speculated that cancer cells whose proliferation is dependent on YAP should also be vulnerable to knockout of essential P-body genes. To this end, we analyzed the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap), which aims to systematically assess the effect of single-gene inactivation on cell proliferation by CRISPR and shRNA screens and define genetic dependencies in hundreds of cancer cell lines by integrating data pertaining to multiple molecular characteristics, such as Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dempster et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tsherniak et al, 2017</xref>). As expected, by analyzing gene expression data from the CCLE, we observed a strong positive correlation between YAP-regulated P- body-related genes (SAMD4A, AJUBA, and WTIP) and canonical target genes of YAP (CTGF, CYR61, AXL, and AMOTL2) in cell lines across cancers or in cell lines of colorectal, breast and lung lineages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7A</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-Figure Supplement 1A, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-Figure Supplement 1B). IHC analysis of 294 CRC tissues further showed the positive correlation between the expression of AJUBA/SAMD4A and YAP (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-Figure Supplement 1D). Although there were no correlations between PNRC1 and YAP target genes in cell lines across cancers, we found that the mRNA level of PNRC1 was negatively correlated with that of YAP target genes in cancer cells of thyroid and central nervous system (CNS) lineages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-Figure Supplement 1C). Next, we analyzed the effect of P- body core gene knockout in 1070 cancer cell lines (DepMap 22Q1 Public+Score, Chronos). Strikingly, knockout of the P-body -nucleation-determining genes DDX6 and LSM14A inhibited proliferation in multiple cancer cell lines (negative Chronos score) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Similar results were observed for EDC4, which is required for P-body aggregation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Logically, correlations between dependency profiles suggests functionality in the same pathway or regulatory axis; thus, EDC4 is strongly associated with multiple known P-body genes (DDX6, DCP2, EIF4ENIF1, etc.) (Appendix Table S2). Furthermore, we found that YAP ranked 14th among genes correlating with EDC4 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, Appendix Table S2). In addition, the YAP dependency score was positively correlated with the DDX6 and LSM14A scores (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Similar relationships were observed between EDC4/DDX6/LSM14A and TEAD1/3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-Figure Supplement 2). Last, we examined whether cell proliferation and cell migration are affected by the knockdown of DCP1A or LSM14A and overexpression of PNRC1 in MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and A549 cell lines, whose proliferation are dependent on YAP/TAZ activity. In consistent to the observation in HCT116 cells, the knockdown of DCP1A/LSM14A and overexpression of PNRC1 attenuated both cell proliferation and cell migration in these three YAP-dependent cancer cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>- Figure Supplement 3-5). Collectively, the codependencies of YAP/TEAD and essential P-body genes further suggests that enhanced P-body formation plays a vital role in YAP- induced tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway occurs in a variety of cancers, leading to cell transformation and diverse changes in tumor cells through activation of the YAP/TEAD transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calses et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kulkarni et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nguyen &amp; Yi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zanconato et al, 2016</xref>). Here, we demonstrated a crucial role of YAP/TEAD in regulating P-body formation in multiple cancer cell lines. Through transcriptional stimulation of positive regulators of P-body formation (AJUBA, WTIP, and SAMD4A) and suppression of negative regulators of P-body formation (PNRC1), YAP enhances P-body formation and increases the number of P-bodies in cancer cells, which suggests that YAP is a positive regulator of P-body formation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Studies of P-bodies in yeast have shown that the size and number of P-bodies increase upon exogenous and endogenous stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luo et al, 2018</xref>). In addition, our study revealed that the number of P-bodies decreases under serum starvation, contact inhibition and decreased ECM rigidity, possibly due to inactivation of YAP/TEAD. In contrast, a recent study, which provided the first link between YAP and P-bodies, implicated YAP as a negative regulator of P-bodies in KHSV- infected HUVECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Castle et al, 2021</xref>). Elizabeth L. Castle et al. reported that virus-encoded Kaposin B (KapB) induces actin stress fiber formation and disassembly of P-bodies, which requires RhoA activity and the YAP transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Castle et al, 2021</xref>). YAP- enhanced autophagic flux was proposed to participate in KapB-induced P-body disassembly, consistent with the concept that stress granules and P-bodies are cleared by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buchan et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Castle et al, 2021</xref>). However, an increasing number of studies have reported the contradictory role of YAP in autophagy regulation, which suggests that YAP-mediated autophagy regulation is cell type- and context-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jin et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pei et al, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Totaro et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, though YAP is required for the cell proliferation in HUVEC, transformed cell lines often display elevated baseline YAP/TAZ activity compared to normal cells and possess many alterations in growth signaling pathways including autophagy signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nguyen &amp; Yi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shen &amp; Stanger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zanconato et al, 2016</xref>). Thus, the contradictory observations regarding the role of YAP in modulating P-body formation between Elizabeth L. Castle et al.’s study and our study could be due to the different cell contexts and different cell conditions (baseline vs. KHSV infection).</p>
<p>In addition to the transcriptional regulation, P-body dynamics can also be modulated by post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luo et al, 2018</xref>). P-body constituent proteins, such as DCP1A and DCP2, are phosphorylated, which affects the protein interaction between DCP1A and DCP2 and subsequent P-body assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chiang et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yoon et al, 2010</xref>). Previous studies have shown that DCP1A is hyperphosphorylated during mitosis and P- body assembly is dynamically changed across the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aizer et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yang et al, 2004</xref>). Meanwhile, Hippo signaling is intrinsically regulated and YAP can also be directly phosphorylated by CDK1 during cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kim et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yang et al, 2013</xref>). Besides, as a direct regulator of P-body formation, AJUBA is also phosphorylated by CDK1 and mitotic phosphorylation of AJUBA promotes cancer cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al, 2016</xref>). Thus, we speculated that mitotic phosphorylation of YAP and AJUBA might also play a potential role in modulating P-body dynamics during cell cycle.</p>
<p>Compared with the role of stress granules, the role of P-bodies in tumorigenesis and tumor progression is not well studied and is considered to be cancer type- or context-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lavalee et al, 2021</xref>). TGF-β induces P-body formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in mammary epithelial cells, while inhibition of P-body formation by knockdown of DDX6 reverses EMT and suppresses breast cancer metastasis, implying a prometastatic function of P-bodies during the progression of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hardy et al, 2017</xref>). In prostate cancer cells, dephosphorylation of EDC3 promotes the localization of EDC3-containing P-bodies and increases the P-body number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bearss et al, 2021</xref>). The increase in EDC3-containing P-bodies leads to sequestration or decay of a subset of mRNAs related to cell attachment and cell growth, such as ITGB1, ITGA6 and KLF4, which ultimately inhibits cell proliferation and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bearss et al, 2021</xref>). Of note, EDC3 and LSM14A compete for binding to the P-body core protein DDX6, and P-body formation still occurs constitutively in EDC3 KO prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bearss et al, 2021</xref>). Therefore, it can be speculated that there might be different types of P-bodies that contain different RNAs and exert protumorigenic or tumor-suppressive functions in different cell contexts. In CRC, DCP1A expression is elevated, which is associated with advanced TNM stages, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis, and overexpression of DCP1A enhances P- body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wu et al, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wu et al, 2018b</xref>). These studies imply the potential protumorigenic function of P-bodies in CRC. Furthermore, our study showed that disruption or attenuation of P-body formation by knockdown of YAP-regulated P-body-related genes or the P-body core genes (DDX6, DCP1A, LSM14A) suppressed YAP-induced oncogenic phenotypes in CRC cells, such as cell proliferation and cell migration, further indicating the protumorigenic function of P-bodies in CRC or at least in CRC with active YAP. Numerous studies have demonstrated the YAP/TAZ promote cancer cell growth through directly transcriptional regulation of genes related with cell cycle and cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">He et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jang et al, 2017</xref>). Since P-bodies control the storage of untranslated mRNAs, YAP/TAZ might modulate gene expression through indirectly promoting P-body formation and the storage of untranslated target mRNAs. Future work is needed to explore P-body-enriched RNAs in CRC cells, which will further uncover the underlying mechanism by which P- bodies mediate the oncogenic function of YAP.</p>
<p>Recently, a study exploring new TSGs based on hemizygous deletions in multiple cancers revealed that PNRC1 is a novel tumor suppressor gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gaviraghi et al, 2018</xref>). PNRC1 translocates the cytoplasmic DCP1A/DCP2 decapping complex into the nucleolus, which subsequently impedes rRNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gaviraghi et al, 2018</xref>). This translocation of DCP1A/DCP2 also leads to disassembly of P-bodies; thus, PNRC1 could also inhibit tumor cell proliferation by disrupting P-body formation. Moreover, hemizygous deletion of the 6q15 locus, where PNRC1 is located, occurs in multiple cancers, including prostate, pancreatic, breast and liver cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gaviraghi et al, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that transcriptional downregulation of PNRC1 by YAP activation could be a new mechanism of PNRC1 dysregulation during tumorigenesis. In addition, multiple oncogenes, such as MYC, RAS and PI3K, can activate rRNA transcription and boost ribosome biogenesis to support cancer cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pelletier et al, 2018</xref>). The presence of the YAP-PNRC1 regulatory axis implies a potential role of YAP in ribosome biogenesis, which warrants further investigation in follow-up studies.</p>
<p>It has been shown that PNRC1 inhibits RAS- and MYC-driven tumor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gaviraghi et al, 2018</xref>). In addition, YAP acts downstream of mutant KRAS, and activation of YAP was found to drive KRAS-independent tumor relapse in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kapoor et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shao et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al, 2014</xref>). Strikingly, reexpression of PNRC1 also dramatically diminished the cell proliferation induced by YAP overexpression in CRC cells in our study. These data indicate that PNRC1 is a tumor suppressor gene with a strong antitumor effect on various oncogenes; thus, reexpression of PNRC1 could be a promising anticancer therapeutic strategy. In addition, as an alternative to targeting the YAP/TEAD complex, drugs that inhibit downstream effectors of YAP/TAZ have shown efficacy in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gay et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Neesse et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nguyen &amp; Yi, 2019</xref>). The identification of the P-body as a new downstream effector of YAP/TAZ suggests that disruption of P-bodies might be a potential therapeutic strategy for tumors with active YAP. Although each P-body core gene performs multiple biological functions, unbiased functional CRISPR screening across cancer cell lines (DepMap) revealed that LOF of a series of P-body core genes significantly suppresses proliferation in various tumor cell lines. The functional overlap in P-body assembly and the positive correlation between the dependency profiles of these P-body core genes imply the important role of P-bodies in tumor cell proliferation and cell survival. Several compounds, including translation inhibitors, have been reported to inhibit P-body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Martinez et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Stribinskis &amp; Ramos, 2007</xref>). Notably, actin polymerization can activate YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sun &amp; Irvine, 2016</xref>). Methyl-chivosazol, an actin polymerization inhibitor, was found to be a strong inhibitor of P-body formation by screening of a library of compounds derived from myxobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Martinez et al, 2013</xref>). However, these small molecules indirectly target P-bodies and show extensive effects on cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Martinez et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Stribinskis &amp; Ramos, 2007</xref>). Thus, the development of inhibitors directly targeting P-body core proteins will provide a chemical tool for exploring the function of P-bodies in tumors and assess the therapeutic efficacy of P-body disassembly in cancer. Overall, our study reveals the P-body as a new downstream effector of YAP/TAZ, which opens a new possibility of targeting P-body assembly to combat tumors (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>

<body>
<p>In a study by Shen et al.. al., the authors investigated YAP/TAZ target genes that play a role in the formation of processing bodies (P-bodies). P-bodies are membraneless cytoplasmic granules that contain translationally repressed mRNAs and components of mRNA turnover. GO enrichment analysis of the RNA-Seq data of colorectal cancer cells (HCT116) after YAP/TAZ knockdown showed that the downregulated genes were enriched in P-body resident proteins. Overexpression, knockdown, and ChIP-qPCR analyses showed that SAMD4A, PNRC1, AJUBA, and WTIP are YAP-TEAD target genes that also play a role in P-body biogenesis. Using P-body markers such as DDX6 and DCP1A, the authors showed that knockdown of YAP in the HCT116 cell line causes a reduction in the number of P-bodies. Similarly, overexpression of constitutively active YAP (YAP 5SA) increased the P-body number. The YAP-TEAD target genes SAMD4A and AJUBA positively regulate P-body formation, because lowering their expression levels using siRNA reduces the number of P-bodies. The other YAP target gene, PNRC1, is a negative regulator of P-body biogenesis and consistently YAP suppresses its expression through the recruitment of the NuRD complex. YAP target genes that modulate P-body formation play prominent roles in oncogenesis. PNRC1 suppression is key to YAP-mediated proliferation, colony formation, and tumorigenesis in HCT116 xenografts. Similarly, SAMD4 and AJUBA knockdown abrogated cell viability. In summary, this study demonstrated that SAMD4, AJUBA, WTIP, and PNRC1 are bona fide YAP-TEAD target genes that play a role in P-body formation, which is also linked to the oncogenesis of colon cancer cells.</p>
<p>Major Strengths:</p>
<p>The majority of the experiments were appropriately planned so that the generated data could support the conclusions drawn by the authors. The phenotype observed with YAP/TAZ knockdown correlated inversely with YAP5SA overexpression, which is complementary. Where possible, the authors also used point mutations that selectively disrupt protein-protein interactions, such as YAP S94A and PNRC1 W300A. The CRC cell line HCT116 was used throughout the study; additionally, data from other cancer cell lines were used to support the generality of the findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors did not elucidate the mechanistic link between P-body formation and oncogenesis; therefore, it is unclear why an increase in the number of P-bodies is pro-tumorigenic. The authors extrapolated and suggested that PNRC1 expression could be exploited therapeutically, without providing much detail. How do they plan to stimulate the expression of PNRC1? It is not necessary for every scientific finding to lead to a therapeutic benefit; therefore, they can tone down such statements if therapeutic exploitation is not realistic. The authors elucidated a mechanism for PNRC1 repression and one wonders why no attempts were made to understand the mechanism of activation of SAMD4, AJUBA, and WTIP expression.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors demonstrated that YAP/TAZ promotes P-body formation in a series of cancer cell lines. YAP/TAZ modulates the transcription of multiple P-body-related genes, especially repressing the transcription of the tumor suppressor proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (PNRC1) through cooperation with the NuRD complex. PNRC1 functions as a critical repressor in YAP-induced biogenesis of P-bodies and tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Reexpression of PNRC1 or disruption of P-bodies attenuated the protumorigenic effects of YAP. Overall, these findings are interesting and the study was well conducted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments for our work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) RNAseq data indicated that Yap has the capacity to suppress the expression of numerous genes. In addition to PNRC1, could there be additional Yap targeting factors involved in Yap-mediated the formation of P-bodies?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, indeed. Additional YAP target genes, such as AJUBA, SAMD4A, are also involved in YAP-mediated the formation of P-bodies (Fig. 1B-D). Knockdown of either SMAD4A or AJUBA attenuated the P-body formation induced by overexpression of YAP5SA (Fig. 3A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It is still not clear how PNRC1 regulates P-bodies. Knockdown of PNRC1 prevented the reduction of P-bodies caused by Yap knockdown. How do the genes related to P-bodies that are positively regulated by Yap, such as SAMD4A, AJUBA, and WTIP, change in this scenario? Given that the expression of Yap can differ considerably among various cell types, is it possible for P-bodies to be present in tumor cells lacking Yap expression?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The detail mechanism of PNRC1’s suppressive effect on P-body formation was well explored in Gaviraghi et al.’s paper, in which PNRC1 was first identified as a tumor suppressor gene (EMBO, 2018, PMID: 30373810). Gaviraghi et al. revealed that overexpression of PNRC1 leads to translocation of cytoplasmic DCP1A/DCP2 into the nucleolus, which subsequently attenuates rRNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis. Since DCP1A and DCP2 are essential for formation of P-bodies, loss of cytoplasmic DCP1A/DCP2 also disrupts P-body formation. This background information has been included in the Results and Discussion sections in the manuscript:</p>
<p>Previously, we have performed the RNA-seq analysis of HCT116 cells with overexpression of PNRC1. Compared with YAP5SA overexpression (520 differentially expressed genes), overexpression of PNRC1 showed less effect on the gene expression profile (147 differentially expressed genes) and expression of SAMD4A, AJUBA and WTIP were not affected by PNRC1 overexpression.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that YAP could promote P-body formation in a series of cancer cell lines. During the exploration, we observed that P-bodies hardly existed in the RKO colorectal cancer cell line (Figure 1 for the reviewer). However, the regulatory effect of YAP/TAZ on SAMD4A, AJUBA, and WTIP was still observed (Figure 2 for the reviewer). These data suggest that YAP’s activity could be sufficient but not required for the P-body formation. So, we agree that P-bodies could be present in tumor cells lacking Yap expression.</p>

<p>(3) The authors demonstrated that CHD4 can bind to Yap target genes, such as CTGF, AJUBA, SAMD4A (Figure 4 - Figure Supplement 1D). Does the NuRD complex repress the expression of these genes? the NuRD complex could prevent the formation of P-bodies?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Good point! Following the reviewer’s suggestions, we detected the mRNA levels of AJUBA, WTIP and SAMD4A, and the P-body formation the CHD4 knockdown cells. Interestingly, knockdown of CHD4 induced mild downregulation of AJUBA, WTIP and SAMD4A in HCT116 cells (Figure 3 for the reviewer). Of note, NuRD complex is involved in both transcriptional repression and activation (PNAS 2011, PMID: 21490301; Stem Cell Reports. 2021, PMID: 33961790). As expected, knockdown CHD4 induced decreased number of P-bodies in HCT116 cell (new Figure 4-Supplement 1E), which is consistent to the enhanced expression of PNRC1 (Figure 4F).</p>

<p>(4) YAP/TAZ promotes the formation of P-bodies which contradicts the previous study's conclusion (PMID: 34516278). Please address these inconsistent findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The contradictory observations between our and the previous studies could be due to the different cell lines (HUVEC vs cancer cell lines) and different stimuli (KHSV infection vs normal culture condition or serum stimulation, cell density and stiffness). Actually, we have discussed the contradictory observation in the previous study in the Discussion section as followed:</p>
<p>“In contrast, a recent study, which provided the first link between YAP and P-bodies, implicated YAP as a negative regulator of P-bodies in KHSV-infected HUVECs (Castle et al, 2021). Elizabeth L. Castle et al. reported that virus-encoded Kaposin B (KapB) induces actin stress fiber formation and disassembly of P-bodies, which requires RhoA activity and the YAP transcriptional program (Castle et al, 2021). YAP-enhanced autophagic flux was proposed to participate in KapB-induced P-body disassembly, consistent with the concept that stress granules and P-bodies are cleared by autophagy (Buchan et al, 2013; Castle et al, 2021). However, an increasing number of studies have reported the contradictory role of YAP in autophagy regulation, which suggests that YAP-mediated autophagy regulation is cell type- and context-dependent (Jin et al, 2021; Pei et al, 2022; Totaro et al, 2019; Wang et al, 2020). Furthermore, though YAP is required for the cell proliferation in HUVEC, transformed cell lines often display elevated baseline YAP/TAZ activity compared to normal cells and possess many alterations in growth signaling pathways including autophagy signaling (Nguyen &amp; Yi, 2019; Shen &amp; Stanger, 2015; Zanconato et al, 2016). Thus, the contradictory observations regarding the role of YAP in modulating P-body formation between Elizabeth L. Castle et al.’s study and our study could be due to the different cell contexts and different cell conditions (baseline vs. KHSV infection).”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In a study by Shen et al., the authors investigated YAP/TAZ target genes that play a role in the formation of processing bodies (P-bodies). P-bodies are membraneless cytoplasmic granules that contain translationally repressed mRNAs and components of mRNA turnover. GO enrichment analysis of the RNA-Seq data of colorectal cancer cells (HCT116) after YAP/TAZ knockdown showed that the downregulated genes were enriched in P-body resident proteins. Overexpression, knockdown, and ChIP-qPCR analyses showed that SAMD4A, PNRC1, AJUBA, and WTIP are YAP-TEAD target genes that also play a role in P-body biogenesis. Using P-body markers such as DDX6 and DCP1A, the authors showed that the knockdown of YAP in the HCT116 cell line causes a reduction in the number of P-bodies. Similarly, overexpression of constitutively active YAP (YAP 5SA) increased the P-body number. The YAP-TEAD target genes SAMD4A and AJUBA positively regulate P-body formation, because lowering their expression levels using siRNA reduces the number of P-bodies. The other YAP target gene, PNRC1, is a negative regulator of P-body biogenesis and consistently YAP suppresses its expression through the recruitment of the NuRD complex. YAP target genes that modulate P-body formation play prominent roles in oncogenesis. PNRC1 suppression is key to YAP-mediated proliferation, colony formation, and tumorigenesis in HCT116 xenografts. Similarly, SAMD4 and AJUBA knockdown abrogated cell viability. In summary, this study demonstrated that SAMD4, AJUBA, WTIP, and PNRC1 are bona fide YAP-TEAD target genes that play a role in P-body formation, which is also linked to the oncogenesis of colon cancer cells.</p>

<p>Major Strengths:</p>
<p>The majority of the experiments were appropriately planned so that the generated data could support the conclusions drawn by the authors. The phenotype observed with YAP/TAZ knockdown correlated inversely with YAP5SA overexpression, which is complementary. Where possible, the authors also used point mutations that selectively disrupt protein-protein interactions, such as YAP S94A and PNRC1 W300A. The CRC cell line HCT116 was used throughout the study; additionally, data from other cancer cell lines were used to support the generality of the findings.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments regarding the strength and significance of our work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors did not elucidate the mechanistic link between P-body formation and oncogenesis; therefore, it is unclear why an increase in the number of P-bodies is pro-tumorigenic. AJUBA and SAMD4 may have housekeeping functions and reduce the proliferation of YAP-independent cell lines. Figure 6 - Figure Supplement 4 shows a reduction in cell viability and migration in control HCT116 cell lines upon AJUBA/SAMD4 knockdown. Therefore, it is unclear whether their tumor suppressive role is YAP-dependent. The authors extrapolated and suggested that their findings could be exploited therapeutically, without providing much detail. How do they plan to stimulate the expression of PNRC1? It is not necessary for every scientific finding to lead to a therapeutic benefit; therefore, they can tone down such statements if therapeutic exploitation is not realistic. The authors elucidated a mechanism for PNRC1 repression and one wonders why no attempts were made to understand the mechanism of activation of SAMD4, AJUBA, and WTIP expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these issues to further improve the quality of our study. As mentioned in the Abstract section, the role of P-bodies in tumorigenesis and tumor progression is not well studied. In this study, we revealed that disruption of P-body formation by knockdown of essential P-body-related genes attenuates YAP-driven oncogenic function in CRC, which provides evidence implicating the pro-tumorigenic role of P-bodies. We agree with the reviewer that the mechanism of P-body formation promoting tumorigenesis is an important scientific question warranting exploration and plan to investigate this fancy question in next study.</p>
<p>AJUBA has been known to act as a signal transducer in oncogenesis and promote CRC cell survival (Pharmacol Res. 2020, PMID: 31740385; Oncogene. 2017, PMID: 27893714). Furthermore, as the reviewer suggested, we found that knockdown of both AJUBA and SAMD4A suppressed the cell proliferation in the YAP-deficient cell line, SHP-77, which further implicates the oncogenic role of AJUBA and SAMD4A (Figure 4 for the reviewer). Numerous studies have shown that YAP/TAZ knockdown suppressed the cell proliferation of HCT116 cells. Thus, not surprisingly, knockdown of AJUBA and SAMD4A also repressed the cell proliferation of the “parental” control HCT116 cells. Since the molecular mechanistic studies identified the AJUBA and SAMD4A were bona fide YAP-TEAD target genes, the co-dependencies of YAP and AJUBA/SAMD4A in the HCT116 cells imply that the pro-tumorigenic function of YAP could be dependent on activation of AJUBA/SAMD4A, in some extent (due to the large amount of YAP target genes).</p>

<p>Tumor suppressor genes are frequently epigenetically silenced in cancer cells, so is PNRC1. In our preliminary study, we found that the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Azacytidine dramatically increased the mRNA level of PNRC1 in HCT116 cells (Figure 5 for the reviewer), which suggests that PNRC1 is epigenetically suppressed by DNA methylation in CRC cells and could be re-activated or re-expressed by DNA methyltransferase inhibitor for the cancer treatment.</p>

<p>YAP/TAZ are well-known as transcriptional co-activators and the mechanism of transcriptional activation of target genes has been well-studied (Cell Stress. 2021, PMID: 34782888). However, years later, the function of YAP/TAZ as the transcriptional co-repressors was brought to the forefront. Both NuRD and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) are involved in the transcriptional repressor function of YAP (Cell Rep. 2015, PMID: 25843714; Cancer Res. 2020, PMID: 32409309). Thus, we focused on exploring mechanism for PNRC1 repression in this study, but not the mechanism of activation of SAMD4A, AJUBA, and WTIP expression.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggested experiments: The suggested experiments were aimed at minimizing the weaknesses of the manuscript. The roles of AJUBA and SAMD4 can be elucidated in a YAP-independent cell line. After knockdown of AJUBA or SAMD4 in a YAP-independent cell line, the effects on proliferation and migration should be determined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewer’s suggestions, we explored the role of AJUBA and SAMD4A in the YAP-independent cell line, SHP-77 (Cancer Cell. 2021, PMID: 34270926). Unfortunately, SHP-77 cells are suspension cells mixed with some loosely adherent cells, and we found that SHP-77 cells are not available for cell migration assay. By CCK8 assay, we found that knockdown of both AJUBA and SAMD4A suppressed the cell proliferation in SHP-77 cells, which further implicates the oncogenic role of AJUBA and SAMD4A.</p>

<p>Experiments directed at elucidating whether the mRNAs of tumor suppressor genes undergo sequestration and decay in P-bodies that ultimately promote tumorigenesis will provide a mechanistic link between P-body formation and tumorigenesis. The enrichment of P-bodies through biochemical methods has been employed in other studies. RNA-seq after P-body enrichment may provide opportunities to unravel the link between P-body formation and tumorigenesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive suggestions to further improve the significance of our study. We do have plans to purify the P-bodies to further elucidate underlying mechanisms of pro-tumorigenic role of P-bodies tumor cells. However, we are newcomers in the P-body field and encountered a lot of issues to establish the biochemical assays of P-bodies. Hopefully, we can solve these technical issues soon and present our new data in the next paper.</p>
