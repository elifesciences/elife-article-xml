<abstract><p>In eukaryotes with DNA methylation, the histone variant H2A.Z and DNA methylation are maintained in mutually exclusive sections of the genome. How this antagonism is established, however, remains an open question. Here, we examined the impacts of DNA methylation on both the intrinsic stability of H2A.Z nucleosomes and chaperone-mediated H2A.Z deposition. Cryo-EM and endonuclease accessibility analyses show that H2A.Z nucleosomes with methylated DNA are more open and accessible compared to their unmethylated counterparts. In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, H2A.Z preferentially associates with unmethylated DNA in both the fibroblast cell line XTC-2 and sperm pronuclei formed in the transcriptionally silent egg extract. The proportion of H2A.Z that colocalizes with methylated DNA, however, is higher in sperm pronuclei than in XTC-2. By monitoring nucleosome assembly on synthetic DNA constructs in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, we find that the H2A.Z bias for unmethylated substrates is dependent on the SRCAP complex, the major H2A.Z deposition chaperone. Consistently, recruitment of the SRCAP complex to DNA is suppressed by DNA methylation. Altogether, we propose that the SRCAP complex is the major determinant for preferential H2A.Z enrichment on unmethylated DNA, whereas DNA methylation destabilizes DNA wrapping in H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Structural features of the nucleosome, a protein-DNA complex composed of ∼146 bp DNA wrapped around a histone octamer, directly affect and regulate genomic accessibility to a diversity of DNA binding proteins, in part, through incorporating histone variants with unique physical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kurumizaka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Talbert and Henikoff, 2016</xref>). The highly evolutionarily conserved H2A variant, H2A.Z, is involved in transcriptional regulation with a well described localization at the transcription start sites (TSSs) of active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bönisch and Hake, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Giaimo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Zlatanova and Thakar, 2008</xref>). However, while typically associated with gene activation, H2A.Z has also been connected to a range of functions including DNA repair, chromosome segregation, heterochromatin maintenance, and transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Colino-Sanguino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Giaimo et al., 2019</xref>). Loss of H2A.Z induces lethality in many eukaryotes, such as mice, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Faast et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Van Daal and Elgin, 1992</xref>), and dysregulation of its localization has been linked to several diseases, including various cancers and the developmental disorder Floating-Harbor syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Buschbeck and Hake, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Diegmüller et al., 2025</xref>). What mechanisms mediate proper H2A.Z localization, and how that connects with its broad-reaching functions, represents an important area of study.</p>
<p>Genomic sequencing analysis of a wide range of eukaryotes have found H2A.Z and DNA methylation, typically occurring as 5-methylcytosine (5mC), to be strikingly anti-correlated across the genome, at both a global and local level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Coleman-Derr and Zilberman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Conerly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Nie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Zilberman et al., 2008</xref>). The high conservation of this antagonism points to the existence of a shared fundamental pathway involved in creating this dichotomy and emphasizes its functional importance. In <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> H2A.Z mediates recruitment of the demethylase ROS1, thereby promoting DNA demethylation; however, this pathway uses plant-specific machinery that targets only a particular set of genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Nie et al., 2019</xref>). More general mechanisms for how the mutually exclusive H2A.Z and DNA methylation compartments exist at large remain to be resolved.</p>
<p>DNA methylation may mediate H2A.Z exclusion via two distinct mechanisms: 1) influencing the intrinsic physical stability of the nucleosome, and/or 2) modulating the activity of nucleosome-remodelers. H2A.Z and H2A diverge in sequence along areas important for stabilizing intra-nucleosome interactions, such as the L1 loop, docking domain, and C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bönisch and Hake, 2012</xref>). DNA methylation can influence the geometry of DNA, particularly its roll and twist, which then likely affect nucleosome wrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Li et al., 2022b</xref>). A large body of work has been conducted on the physical impacts of either H2A.Z or DNA methylation on the nucleosome, but conflicting conclusions have been reported; incorporation of H2A.Z or DNA methylation independently has been shown to cause stabilizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Choy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Collings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ishibashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Lee and Lee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Thambirajah et al., 2006</xref>), destabilizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Horikoshi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jimenez-Useche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jimenez-Useche and Yuan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ngo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Rudnizky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Weber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), or no detectable effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fujii et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Langecker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Osakabe et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, it is possible that the combination of H2A.Z and DNA methylation’s effects may physically bias against retention of H2A.Z nucleosomes on methylated DNA and contribute to their overall antagonism.</p>
<p>H2A.Z remodeling is primarily carried out by the Ino80 family of nucleosome remodelers. Both the SRCAP complex (SRCAP-C) and Tip60 complex (Tip60-C) mediate exchange of canonical H2A to H2A.Z within a nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Ruhl et al., 2006</xref>), while the Ino80 complex (Ino80- C) has been reported to evict H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Scacchetti and Becker, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Watanabe and Peterson, 2010</xref>). Tip60-C can also associate with the H2A.Z chaperone, ANP32e, to evict H2A.Z from nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Mao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Obri et al., 2014</xref>). Members of this remodeler family are prime candidates for enforcing the separation of H2A.Z and DNA methylation; however, it is unknown whether any of these complexes exhibit DNA methylation sensitivity.</p>
<p>To determine molecular mechanisms contributing to the mutual exclusion of H2A.Z and DNA methylation within the genome, here we investigated the effects of DNA methylation on both the physical stability of H2A.Z nucleosomes and remodeler-mediated deposition of H2A.Z onto synthetic DNA constructs by employing cryo-EM structural analysis and the physiological <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract system, respectively.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM analysis of H2A.Z nucleosomes in the presence or absence of DNA methylation</title>
<p>To assess the physical impacts of DNA methylation on H2A.Z nucleosomes, we solved cryo-EM structures of human H2A.Z nucleosomes reconstituted with either methylated (Me) or unmethylated (UM) Sat2R-P DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Suppl Table 1</xref>). The Sat2R-P sequence is a 152 bp artificial palindromic sequence containing 9 evenly distributed CpG sites and was engineered from a published canonical nucleosome crystal structure containing a methylated derivative of the human satellite II sequence (termed Sat2R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Osakabe et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). This sequence was chosen for two reasons: 1) human satellite II (HSat2) represents a highly abundant methylated sequence which undergoes disease-associated differential methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ehrlich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Jackson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Tilman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Unoki, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Wong et al., 2001</xref>), and 2) the symmetric palindromic sequence was needed to increase final structure resolutions due to the two-fold pseudo symmetry about the nucleosome dyad axis. Prepared nucleosomes were run on a native PAGE gel to assess for quality, where both samples appeared as a singular band with minor comparable populations of unincorporated DNA (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Cryo-EM structures of UM and Me Sat2R-P H2A.Z nucleosomes were solved at a final resolution of 3.05 Å and 2.78 Å, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and C</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 1</xref>). We found that the nucleosome dyad was shifted roughly two base pairs from the center of the Sat2R-P palindrome, introducing a sequence asymmetry despite our intended use of the palindromic sequence. The shifted nucleotide positions were determined using the higher resolution densities surrounding the nucleosome dyad, which allowed for pyrimidine and purine distinction (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 2A-D</xref>). Two atomic models (termed v1 and v2) with mirrored DNA sequences were generated for each structure to account for the resultant sequence asymmetry, with the final EM densities likely reflecting an average of these two models (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>As a whole, both the methylated and unmethylated structures resembled previously published H2A.Z nucleosome structures and exhibited a linker DNA asymmetry where one side of the nucleosome (distal face 2, DF2) contained a highly flexible linker DNA region compared to the other (distal face 1, DF1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Horikoshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Suto et al., 2000</xref>). As a palindromic DNA sequence was used, it is likely that the asymmetrical faces in the cryo-EM structures arose due to an averaging of closed and open H2A.Z nucleosome particles into the same structure rather than representing an asymmetry found in individual particles.</p>
<p>In a direct comparison of DF2 linker DNA lengths, we found that the Me Sat2R-P map had much weaker linker DNA density than UM Sat2R-P, resulting in a ∼7 bp shorter resolved DNA model for the methylated structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). This loss of linker density indicates destabilized histone-DNA interactions and increased DNA structural variability in the presence of DNA methylation. Along similar lines, Root Mean Squared Distance (RMSD) analysis identified the H2A.Z-H2B dimer of DF2, as well as the overall DNA backbone, as regions of considerable difference between the methylated and unmethylated structures, whereas DF1, the closed side of the nucleosome with a highly resolved linker DNA, was largely similar between the two (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>DNA methylation creates open H2AZ nucleosome structures</title>
<p>To further characterize areas of change, maps of unmethylated and methylated H2A.Z structures were filtered and resampled to the same resolution (∼3 Å) for fair comparison (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Three major differences between the maps were identified. First, cryo-EM densities of the H3 N-terminus and H2A.Z C-terminus on DF2 were much weaker in the methylated structure as compared to unmethylated, preventing model construction in these areas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Second, an extra density on the H2A.Z-H2B acidic patch was seen on the methylated map but was not present on the unmethylated map (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Third, between the two major orientations the H4 N-terminal tail can adopt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arimura et al., 2021</xref>), the unmethylated map showed a strong preference for the inward orientation whereas the methylated structure exhibited similar populations of inward and outward orientations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>The H3 N-terminus interacts with the H2A/H2A.Z C-terminus and DNA to hold the linker DNA close to the body of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Li and Kono, 2016</xref>). Loss of the H3 N- terminal density from the methylated structure suggests destabilized DNA-histone interactions that are consistent with the shorter resolved linker DNA on DF2 of the methylated model compared to unmethylated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). The H4 N-terminal tail, on the other hand, mediates inter- nucleosomal interactions through contacts with a neighboring acidic patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). The extra density on the Me Sat2R-P acidic patch may then have come from the H4 tail of another nucleosome, in line with the changes also observed in H4 tail orientation. These observations may be consistent with reports that DNA methylation increases condensation of nucleosomes, as well as bare DNA, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buitrago et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jimenez-Useche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Yang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>To more quantitatively assess methylation-dependent structural changes, we conducted an <italic>in silico</italic> mixing 3D classification analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arimura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hite and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>) by combining micrographs collected from both methylated and unmethylated nucleosome samples and then sorted particles picked from the combined micrographs into six 3D classes of nucleosomes, each with varying degrees of open or closed linker DNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E and F</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 3</xref>). Most of the unmethylated particles (&gt;60%) were sorted into the closed linker classes (Class 1 and 2) whereas the majority of methylated particles (∼60%) belonged to classes with open linkers (Classes 3, 4, 6) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). The fraction of hexasomes (Class 5) is minor in both conditions with a slight increase in methylated particles (Class 5). Among these open linker classes that are preferentially found in methylated particles, class 4 also represents nucleosomes where the palindromic center of the DNA has slid and is considerably offset from the dyad axis of the histone octamer. This may explain the weaker DF2 linker density seen in the high resolution Me Sat2R-P structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Additionally, the DNA backbone of the methylated nucleosome structure had a lower local resolution compared to unmethylated, despite the methylated map having a higher global resolution (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 4</xref>). This is consistent with the increased population of open linker and slid nucleosome particles in the methylated structure. Altogether, our cryo- EM structural analysis suggests that the presence of DNA methylation creates open and potentially destabilized H2A.Z nucleosome structures.</p>

<title>DNA methylation increases accessibility of H2A.Z but not H2A nucleosomes</title>
<p>In order to validate the observed opening of the H2A.Z nucleosome structure by DNA methylation, and to determine if this methylation effect is also present on nucleosomes containing canonical H2A, we measured nucleosome DNA accessibility via restriction enzyme digest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 7</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We tested both human H2A and H2A.Z nucleosomes reconstituted with methylated and unmethylated versions of 152 bp non-palindromic Sat2R DNA that was modified to include a singular HinfI site 18 bp in from the 5’-end containing a Cy5-fluorophore (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Homogeneity of the reconstituted nucleosomes was assessed via native PAGE and mass photometry analysis prior to restriction digest analysis (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 7A-C</xref>). Digest of bare control DNA confirmed that HinfI behaved similarly on both methylated and unmethylated Sat2R substrates over the time scale used in the experiment (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 7D</xref>). We found that H2A.Z nucleosomes were more accessible to enzymatic digest than H2A nucleosomes, independent of DNA methylation status (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B and C</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 8</xref>). When comparing methylation-dependent differences for each type of nucleosome, methylated and unmethylated H2A nucleosomes were largely digested at the same rate. Methylated H2A.Z nucleosomes, on the other hand, exhibited a small but more pronounced increase in accessibility as compared to its unmethylated counterpart (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B and C</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 8</xref>). These results corroborate our structural findings and also suggest that the effects of DNA methylation may be negligible on an intrinsically stable nucleosome (i.e. containing H2A) but can further destabilize, in a selective manner, the already open and accessible H2A.Z nucleosome.</p>

<title>H2A.Z and DNA methylation localization in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> sperm pronuclei and a fibroblast cell line</title>
<p>Results from our structural and biochemical experiments indicate decreased wrapping stability of H2A.Z nucleosomes on methylated DNA. While functional implications likely exist, this subtle effect on the intrinsic physical stability of the H2A.Z nucleosome is unlikely to be the sole driver of the mutually exclusive H2A.Z and DNA methylation compartmentalization in cells. To identify the major biochemical mechanism underlying this dichotomy, we turned to the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extract system, a unique cell-free system that allows for characterization of chromatin proteins under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Lohka and Maller, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Postow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Wassing et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Xue et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Zierhut et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>To ensure that <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract is a valid tool for studying the H2A.Z-DNA methylation antagonism, we conducted CUT&amp;Tag – Bisulfite Sequencing (CnT-BS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Li et al., 2021</xref>), a method which allows for the direct assessment of DNA methylation on CUT&amp;Tag reads, against H2A.Z of <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm nuclei incubated in interphase extract. This condition mimics fertilization and allows for full nucleosome assembly onto sperm (primarily composed of protamines and H3/H4 tetramers) to create functional pronuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Oikawa et al., 2020</xref>). We also collected samples against H3 to serve as a pan-nucleosome control. Since sperm pronuclei in egg extract represents a unique transcriptionally silent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Engelke et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Newport and Kirschner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Veenstra et al., 1999</xref>), we also performed CnT-BS on XTC-2 cells, a <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> fibroblast cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Pudney et al., 1973</xref>), to assess changes in DNA methylation and H2A.Z overlap across different nuclei types.</p>
<p>Initial comparisons of CnT-BS reads across two biological replicates of our four conditions demonstrated good reproducibility between replicates, while each set of experimental conditions exhibited distinct characteristics. A greater than 99 % bisulfite conversion efficiency rate, as assessed through our unmethylated lambda DNA spike-in, was achieved, and correlation matrices of both the mapped reads and methylation calls were highly similar between biological replicates (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 9</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Suppl Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). When comparing across conditions, for both the H3/H2A.Z mapped reads and DNA methylation sites, the first degree of difference seen was between XTC-2 and sperm samples, and then H3 vs H2A.Z following after, indicating that large-scale changes in the DNA methylation and genomic landscape occurred between the two different nuclear states (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 9</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess characteristics of H2A.Z and H3 genomic distributions, we subset the <italic>Xenopus</italic> genome into 1,000 bp bins and classified the top 20 % of bins containing the most mapped reads for each condition based on annotated functionalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fisher et al., 2023</xref>). We found that a greater proportion of highly mapped H2A.Z bins were located near promoter regions as compared to H3 for both sperm and XTC-2 samples (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 10A</xref>). Although transcription is suppressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, H2A.Z in sperm pronuclei were well positioned at TSSs, as generally seen for actively transcribed genes in somatic cells (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 10B and C</xref>).

<title>The SRCAP complex mediates H2A.Z’s preferential deposition on unmethylated DNA</title>

Depletion of SRCAP-C from extract using a custom antibody against <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> SRCAP greatly reduced the amount of H2A.Z associated with unmethylated DNA compared to control depletion (ΔIgG), while its levels on methylated DNA were not affected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A-C</xref>, <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 13A</xref>). Consequently, in SRCAP-C-depleted (ΔSRCAP) extracts, residual H2A.Z binding to DNA became insensitive to DNA methylation status, while the amount of H2A.X-F on DNA was not affected by SRCAP-C depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B and D</xref>, <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 13A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found that DNA methylation can affect H2A.Z deposition and stability via two distinct mechanisms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). DNA methylation directly opposes H2A.Z deposition by inhibiting SRCAP-C DNA binding. SRCAP-C accounts for the majority of H2A.Z deposition on unmethylated DNA and is the primary mediator behind DNA methylation’s exclusion of H2A.Z in the transcriptionally inactive <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract. A subpopulation of H2A.Z, however, is still deposited onto methylated DNA, driven by methylation insensitive mechanism(s) whose identity remains to be established. Once formed, H2A.Z nucleosomes on methylated DNA are more open and accessible compared to their unmethylated counterparts. This decrease in DNA-histone contact stability of methylated H2A.Z nucleosomes may then further facilitate clearance of H2A.Z from methylated regions of the genome.</p>

<caption><title>DNA methylation prevents SRCAP-C mediated H2A.Z deposition and creates more open and accessible H2A.Z nucleosome structures.</title>
<p>Left, SRCAP-C is capable of depositing H2A.Z on unmethylated substrates, but presence of DNA methylation prevents binding and deposition activity. Another unidentified mechanism deposits H2A.Z in a DNA methylation insensitive manner. Right, DNA methylation decreases DNA wrapping stability, an effect felt greatest on the already open H2A.Z nucleosomes compared to the more tightly wrapped H2A nucleosomes, creating more open and accessible H2A.Z nucleosome structures.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Supporting our observation that a SRCAP-independent mechanism(s) exists to deposit H2A.Z on methylated DNA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract, a substantial fraction (∼40%) of H2A.Z-associated genomic DNA is methylated in sperm pronuclei. In the fibroblast cell line XTC-2, that methylated H2A.Z fraction is greatly reduced to 3%. However, due to the accessibility bias inherent within CUT&amp;Tag, our data likely underestimates the true degree of H2A.Z and DNA methylation overlap, particularly in the XTC-2 samples. For comparison, a previous study in human myometrium reported that ∼20% of CpGs overlapping with H2A.Z are methylated, indicating that a sizeable population of colocalized H2A.Z and DNA methylation exists in somatic cells which warrants further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berta et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, we believe the decreased trend in H2A.Z and DNA methylation overlap of XTC-2 cells holds true and suggests that the high degree of H2A.Z and DNA methylation coincidence in sperm pronuclei reflects its unique early development and/or transcriptionally silent state. Given the strong preference of SRCAP-C binding to unmethylated DNA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, we predict that additional pathways missing in the egg extract system are necessary to reinforce the antagonism between DNA methylation and H2A.Z enrichment.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest difference between XTC-2 cells and <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs is the presence of transcription, which is one of the main evictors of H2A.Z and necessary for global H2A.Z turnover as well as pruning of randomly deposited H2A.Z within gene bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hardy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lashgari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Ranjan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Tramantano et al., 2016</xref>). Traversing of RNA polymerase (Pol) II across nucleosomes, aided by the FACT complex, results in transient histone dimer displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Belotserkovskaya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bevington and Boyes, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bintu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kireeva et al., 2002</xref>), leading to the possibility that the more accessible H2A.Z nucleosome structures formed on methylated DNA may have increased susceptibility to Pol II disruption.</p>
<p>Furthermore, FACT and Spt6 do not reincorporate H2A.Z into the reassembled nucleosome post Pol II encounter, reinforcing selective loss of H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Heo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Jeronimo et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Outside of transcription, the egg extract system also lacks both the DNMT3 enzymes responsible for <italic>de novo</italic> methylation and the TET system responsible for DNA methylation removal in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Wühr et al., 2014b</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, H2A.Z promotes ROS1-associated DNA demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Nie et al., 2019</xref>) and must be excluded to ensure faithful heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, H2A.Z-driven mechanisms to limit DNA methylation remain relevant pathways to increase the H2A.Z/DNA methylation separation within the genome which may be missing in eggs/early embryonic states.</p>
<p>Exactly how SRCAP-C senses DNA methylation remains a pertinent question. Recent structural work on the yeast SWR1 complex and human SRCAP-C indicate that both the ATPase and the ZNHIT1 subunit (Swc6 in yeast) mediate binding of, and one-dimensional diffusion on, naked DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Louder et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Park et al., 2024</xref>), marking them as likely candidates responsible for methylation sensing. Additionally, the YEATS domain-containing subunit GAS41, found in both SRCAP-C and Tip60-C, recognizes H3K14ac and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hsu et al., 2018a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">2018b</xref>), and deposition of H3K27ac, itself, is antagonized by DNA methylation at enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">King et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that both direct recognition of DNA methylation and changes in the PTM landscape of methylated chromatin play a role in dictating SRCAP-C localization and activity.</p>
<p>Although a consensus on how DNA methylation influences nucleosome stability has yet to be achieved, our results indicate that DNA methylation creates more open nucleosome structures, particularly on H2A.Z nucleosomes, similar to reports from FRET-based and molecular simulation studies on the canonical H2A nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jimenez-Useche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jimenez-Useche and Yuan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Li et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ngo et al., 2016</xref>). Although the ambiguity in DNA positioning of our cryo-EM structures prevents us from discussing the structural coordination of specific CpG sites, we favor the idea that the increase in accessibility is due to effects of DNA methylation on global DNA structure rather than at specific methylated segments. This is in line with observations that methylation increases overall DNA stiffness, making it harder for the DNA to bend and wrap around histone octamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ngo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Pérez et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Our restriction enzyme accessibility assay shows that H2A.Z nucleosomes are considerably more open and accessible compared to canonical H2A, regardless of methylation status. This difference is substantially larger than that induced by DNA methylation on H2A.Z, suggesting that the physical influence of DNA methylation on nucleosomes is overall subtle. This apparent subtlety, however, may be due to the internal placement of the cut site that we tested, and thus the effect of DNA methylation was preferably observed on an already destabilized nucleosome with H2A.Z. Similar findings have been reported on canonical H2A 601 nucleosomes, where the effects of DNA methylation manifest greatest on an open nucleosome sub-population compared to their closed counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jimenez-Useche and Yuan, 2012</xref>). This is likely why we saw no methylation-dependent structural differences with the 601L sequence (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 5</xref>), as its innate nucleosome wrapping and positioning ability is even stronger than the classic Widom 601. Overall, we suggest that the subtle nucleosome destabilization effect of DNA methylation is selectively pronounced on H2A.Z nucleosomes, which already exhibit an intrinsic instability compared to canonical H2A nucleosomes.</p>
<p>Beyond its interaction with DNA methylation, we show that H2A.Z promoter localization occurs immediately upon conditions mimicking fertilization in a transcription-independent manner. Unlike the almost complete loss of histones seen in mammalian sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Ward and Coffey, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Wykes and Krawetz, 2003</xref>), <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm is packaged as a mixture of protamines and H3/H4 tetramers with very low levels of H2A/H2B dimers, which are then remodeled into full nucleosomes upon fusion with an egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Katagiri and Ohsumi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Mann et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Oikawa et al., 2020</xref>). In our egg extract system, which lacks the maternal genome, we expect the bulk of H2A.Z in sperm pronuclei to be newly deposited and find that H2A.Z is still specifically targeted to promotors either via underlying sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ibarra-Morales et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>) or tetramer modifications maintained in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Oikawa et al., 2020</xref>). This is similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> where H2A.Z is recruited to TSSs prior to both Pol II binding and ZGA, marking genes for zygotic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ibarra-Morales et al., 2021</xref>), indicating conservation of this initial transcription-independent H2A.Z positioning across both vertebrates and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Our work here provides a critical step in the pathways dictating genomic organization by uncovering the previously undescribed methylation sensitivity of SRCAP-C along with the destabilizing effects of DNA methylation on H2A.Z nucleosomes. Together, these findings provide molecular mechanisms driving the conserved antagonism between H2A.Z and DNA methylation in the genome. However, many questions remain to be answered, such as why the existence of both methylation sensitive and insensitive H2A.Z deposition pathways, the broader functional implications of the H2A.Z-DNA methylation antagonism as a whole, and mechanisms driving its maintenance in species that experience periods of global demethylation. These questions represent important areas of future study for our understanding of epigenome dynamics throughout development.</p>

Downstream analysis was conducted in CryoSPARC v4.6 (Structura Biotechnology Inc.). Motion-corrected micrographs then underwent patch CTF correction. Particles were picked using Topaz v0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bepler et al., 2019</xref>) trained on a set of 1,000-2,000 manually picked nucleosome-like particles and then extracted to 384 pix (∼330 Å) boxes with 4x binning and used for 2D classification into 200-250 classes. Particles from selected classes were then run through a series of heterogeneous refinements with 1-2 nucleosome-like models and 4 decoy models generated through <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction to sort out junk particles from those containing nucleosomes. The heterogenous refinements were iterated until greater than 90 % of particles in the round were classified as nucleosome-like. These particles were then further refined either via Refine 3D, CTF refinement, and polishing in Relion v4 (601L structures) or homogeneous and non-uniform refinements in CryoSPARC v4.6 (Sat2R-P). Particles for the methylated Sat2R-P structure underwent another heterogeneous refinement using a closed nucleosome, open, and hexasome model as starting classes to select for the highest resolved closed nucleosome structure. Final resolutions were determined using the gold standard FSC threshold (FSC = 0.143).

Samples were then incubated with 50 µl of transposome complex (1:1 pG-Tn5:adaptor primer mix, ∼0.1-0.2 µM final to each sample) in CnT-300 [CnT-WB with 300 mM NaCl] for 1 h at RT then washed with CnT-300. Transposome activity was initiated with addition of 300 µl Tagmentation Buffer [20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1x ROCHE cOmplete™ protease inhibitor cocktail, 0.1 % Tween-20] and incubated 37 ᵒC, 1500 rpm on thermomixer, 1 h. Reactions were stopped with addition of stop buffer [15 mM EDTA, 0.1 % SDS, 0.2 mg/mL Proteinase K final concentrations] and incubated at 55 ᵒC overnight, then phenol-chloroform extracted. Purified samples were resuspended in 11 µl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and oligonucleotide replacement/gap repaired carried out through addition of 2 µl of 10 µM Tn5mC-ReplO1 DNA oligo (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), 2 µl 10x Ampligase Buffer (Lucigen), 2 µl dNTP mix (2.5 mM for each dNTP). Solutions were subject to the following heating protocol: 50 ᵒC 1 min, 45 ᵒC 10 min, cool to 37 ᵒC at -0.1 ᵒC/second. Once at 37 ᵒC, 3U of T4 DNA polymerase and 12.5U of Ampligase (Lucigen) were added and samples incubated for 30 min.

<p>Libraries were sent to Novogene for sequencing on the NovaSeqX Plus system (PE150). XTC-2 data was then downsampled to 30 million reads using seqtk (v1.5-r133) to have all samples at similar read depths. Adapter trimming and dedeuplication of the demultiplexed reads was then done using fastp v0.24.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen, 2023</xref>) [--adapter_sequence CTGTCTCTTATACAC --adapter_sequence_r2 CTGTCTCTTATACAC -g --poly_g_min_len 5 -p -l 20 --cut_tail -y -Y 20 -q 20 –dedup].

<title>Count matrix generation and sequencing depth normalization</title>
<p>The <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> genome was subset into 1000 bp bins. Reads from processed bam files were then tallied according to bins to generate a genome-wide count matrix. Mitochondrial associated reads and bins which contained no reads across all samples were removed. Size factors were then estimated using DESeq2 v1.42.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Love et al., 2014</xref>) to generate sequence depth normalized bigwig files. Count matrices were also vst transformed in DESeq2 then used to generate the read fragment correlation plot.

<title>DNA Methylation analysis</title>
<p>To get methylated CpG proportions for each sample (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), H2A.Z peaks were first identified with SEACR (v1.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Meers et al., 2019</xref>) using a cutoff of 0.025 by AUC with a stringent threshold. Individual CpG data was then extracted using Bismark with a cutoff of 5 reads and disregarding the first 9 bp of read 2 (due to adapter fill-in). Methylation proportions for H2A.Z samples were then calculated for CpGs overlapping with H2A.Z peaks. For H3, only regions outside of identified H2A.Z peaks were used to assess the CpG methylation status of general genomic background non-coincident with H2A.Z enriched areas. To generate H3-associated methylation 500 bp tiles for use in plotting (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 9B-D</xref>), methylation data was extracted with a specified cutoff of 1 read and disregarding the first 9 bp of read 2 then imported into a methylRawList object with a minimum read coverage of 2 and counted over 500 bp tiles with a 500 bp step size and a minimum of 2 CpG sites using methylKit v1.28.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akalin et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

DNA fragments containing the array sequence were then purified through a PEG precipitation titration, starting at 4.5 % of PEG (MW8000) and increasing in 0.5 % increments until 8 % (NaCl added to 0.5 M final concentration in the starting solution). Fragment containing fractions were then assessed via agarose gel and purified via phenol-chloroform extraction. Fragment ends were biotinylated with biotin-14-dATP (Jena Bioscience, Cat# NU-835-BIO14-S) using Klenow Fragment (3’→ 5’ exo-) (NEB Cat# M0212) following manufacturer’s protocol. Biotinylated DNA was phenol-chloroform extracted and bound to M-280 Streptavidin Dynabeads™ (Invitrogen, Cat# 11206D) at 300 ng DNA per 1 µl of beads.

<p>Summary and Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents a thoughtful and well-executed analysis of how S. aureus adapts to disulfide stress using a redox-sensitive regulator, Spx, as a lynchpin to coordinate nutrient uptake, redox balance, and growth. The work is strengthened by a systematic and complementary experimental approach that combines genetic, biochemical, and physiological measurements. The authors carefully test alternative explanations and build a coherent model linking stress sensing to downstream metabolic consequences. Several results, particularly those connecting cysteine uptake to growth defects, provide convincing support for the proposed trade-off. Overall, the authors largely achieve their aims, and the evidence generally supports the central conclusions. The conceptual framework and experimental approaches should be of broad interest to researchers studying S. aureus physiology and pathogenesis and to those studying bacterial stress responses and metabolic trade-offs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Clarifying several interpretive points would further strengthen confidence in the proposed model. Some conclusions rely on data presentations or experimental designs that are not immediately clear to the reader. In particular, aspects of the protein stability analysis, global regulatory comparisons, and assays linking cysteine uptake to iron limitation would benefit from clearer justification and more precise interpretation. In addition, certain conclusions could be more carefully framed to reflect partial rather than complete rescue effects.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript titled &quot;Activation of the Spx redox sensor counters cysteine-driven Fe(II) depletion under disulfide stress&quot; by Hall and colleagues describes that an active redox switch is required for surviving under the diamide-induced disulfide stress. Furthermore, the SpxC10A mutant exhibits transcriptional dysregulation of genes involved in thiol maintenance and disulfide repair. The authors further demonstrate a role for Spx in regulating the uptake of L-cysteine, which otherwise leads to the chelation of intracellular iron and thus the repression of growth.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that the SpxC10A mutant accumulates high levels of thiols, leading to the chelation of intracellular iron and subsequent repression of the SpxC10A mutant's growth.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors did not show a direct regulation of L-cysteine uptake through CymR.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper from Hall et al. reports the effects of an altered function spx allele on the physiology of S. aureus. Since Spx is essential in this organism, the authors compare WT with a spx C10A allele that retains Spx functions that are independent of the formation of a C10-C13 disulfide. However, the major role of Spx in maintaining disulfide homeostasis in this organism appears to be reduced by this mutation, including a reduction (relative to WT) in the DIA-induction of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and BSH biosynthesis and reduction enzymes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Based on a wide range of studies, the authors develop a model in which Spx is required for adaptation to disulfide stress, and this adaptation involves (in part) induction of both cystine/Cys uptake and the Fur regulon. Overall, the results are compelling, but further efforts to clarify the presentation will aid readers in being able to follow this very complicated story.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) More details are needed on how relative growth is defined and calculated (e.g., line 145 and Figure 1C). The raw data (growth curves) should be included when reporting relative growth so that readers can see what changed (lag, growth rate, final OD?). Later in the paper, the authors refer to &quot;the diamide-induced growth delay of the spxC10A mutant&quot; (line 379), but this is not apparent from the presented data.</p>
<p>(2) Are the spx C10A, spx C13A, and spx C10A,C13A all really equivalent? In all cases, the Spx protein is presumably made (as confirmed for C10A in panel 1D). However, the only evidence to suggest that they are equivalent is the similar growth effects in panel 1C, and (as noted above), this data presentation can mask differences in how the mutations affect protein activity.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 1D and Figure 1 Supplement 2 report results related to the effect of diamide treatment on protein half-life (t1/2). Only single results are shown for both panels, and the conclusions do not seem to be statistically robust. For example, in Figure 1, Supplement 2 concludes that Spx C10A has a t1/2 is 3.38 min (this should be labeled correctly in the Figure legend as the red line). and WT Spx is 8.69 min. However, Figure 1D suggests that the protein levels at time 0 may not be equivalent, and this is lost in the data processing. Indeed, there are significant differences in Spx levels between time 0 - and + DIA, which is curious. Further, the authors' conclusion relies very heavily on line-fitting that includes a final point that has very low signal intensity (as judged from Figure 1D) and therefore is likely the least reliable of all the data. It might be worth showing curve fitting for multiple gels. Regardless of the overfitting of the data, the general conclusion that Spx is partially stabilized against proteolysis by ClpXP, and that the C10A mutant is reduced in stabilization, is probably correct.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 2 concludes that despite differences in the mRNA profiles between WT and spx C10A after 15 min. of DIA treatment, the overall level of responsiveness of the bacillithiol pool is unchanged. The authors find it &quot;surprising&quot; that the BSH pool responds normally despite some differences in gene expression. This is not surprising. The major events visualized in panel 2D are the chemical oxidation of BSH to BSSB and, presumably, the re-reduction by Bdr(YpdA). While it is seen that BSH synthesis (bshC) and ypdA expression may be less induced by DIA in the C10A mutant (2C), there is no evidence that the basal levels are different prior to stress. Therefore, the chemical oxidation and enzymatic re-reduction might be expected to occur at similar rates, as observed.</p>
<p>(5) Line 215. For the reason stated above, there is no reason to invoke Cys uptake as needed for the reduction of BSSB. Further, since CySS (presumably an abbreviation for cystine) is imported, this itself can contribute to disulfide stress.</p>
<p>(6) Line 235. Following on the above point, &quot;diamide-induced disulfide stress increased L-CySS uptake in the spxC10A mutant to re-establish the BSH redox equilibrium.&quot; This is counterintuitive since LCySS is itself a disulfide and is thought to be reduced to 2 L-Cys in cells by BSH (leading to an increase in BSSB, not a reduction). Is there a known cystine reductase? Could cystine or L-cys be affecting gene regulation? (e.g., through CymR or Spx or ?). Cystine can also lead to mixed disulfide formation (e.g., could it modify Spx on C13?).</p>
<p>(7) l. 247 &quot;a functional Spx redox switch allows S. aureus to avoid this trade-off and maintain thiol homeostasis without excessive L-CySS uptake.&quot; Can the authors expand on how this is thought to work? Does Spx normally affect cystine uptake? I thought this was CymR? I am not following the logic here.</p>
<p>(8) Line 258. &quot;The fur mutant, which is known to accumulate iron...&quot;. My understanding is that fur mutant strains typically have higher bioavailable (free) Fe pools. This is seen in E. coli, for example, using EPR methods. However, they also often have lower total Fe due to the iron-sparing response, which represses the expression of abundant, Fe-rich proteins. Please provide a reference that supports this statement that in S. aureus fur mutants have higher total iron per cell.</p>
<p>(9) Figure 4. For the reasons stated above (point 1), it is hard to interpret data presented only as &quot;Rel. Growth&quot;. Perhaps growth curve data could be included in a supplement.</p>
<p>(10) The interpretation of Figure 4 is complicated. It is not clear that there is necessarily a change in bioavailable Fe pools, although it does seem clear that Fe homeostasis is perturbed. It has been shown that one strong effect of DIA on B. subtilis physiology is to oxidize the BSH pool to BSSB (as shown also here), and this leads to a mobilization of Zn (buffered by BSH). Elevated Zn pools can inactivate some Fe(II)-dependent enzymes, which could account for the rescue by Fe(II) supplementation. Zn(II) can also dysregulate PerR and likely Fur regulons.</p>
