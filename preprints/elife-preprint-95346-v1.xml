<title>Abstract</title><p>Antibodies are powerful tools for the therapy and diagnosis of various diseases. In addition to conventional hybridoma-based screening, recombinant antibody-based screening has become a common choice; however, its application is hampered by two factors: 1) screening starts only after Ig gene cloning and recombinant antibody production, and 2) the antibody is composed of paired chains, heavy and light, commonly expressed from two independent expression vectors. Here, we introduce a method for the rapid screening of recombinant monoclonal antibodies by establishing a Golden Gate-based dual-expression vector and <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of membrane-bound antibodies. Using this system, we demonstrated the efficient isolation of influenza cross-reactive antibodies with high affinity from mouse germinal center B cells over 4 days. This system is particularly useful for isolating therapeutic or diagnostic antibodies (e.g., during foreseen pandemics).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Technical improvements in the rapid isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are critical for their diagnostic and therapeutic development. This need became apparent to the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. Antibodies isolated from convalescent COVID-19 patients are valuable resources for the development of mAb therapeutics and rapid diagnostic tools. Human antibodies can be administered to other patients without the need to humanize in an emergency and with a slight modification of Fc receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) to increase the half-life or reduce the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement. Although production costs remain high, the efficiency of generating recombinant antibodies has dramatically improved with the use of mammalian cell lines, and the application of therapeutic antibodies is likely to expand in the near future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>The gold standard method for isolating mAbs is the hybridoma technology developed by Kohler and Milstein in 1975 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), in which antibody-producing B cells are fused with immortal B cells, called myelomas, to produce long-lasting antibody-producing B cells. In addition to hybridoma technology, new methods have been developed to increase mAb screening efficiency. These include direct immortalization of B cells by gene reprogramming using the Epstein–Barr virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) or retrovirus-mediated gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), cloning of variable region-encoding genes by single-cell PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), single-cell culture screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), and <italic>in vitro</italic> screening of recombinant antibody libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Some of these methods successfully yield high-affinity antibodies in various formats, including single variable domain on a heavy chain or single-chain fragment variable antibodies. Although hybridoma technology is highly reliable for the isolation of valuable antibodies from animal models, such as mice, rats, and hamsters, it is time-consuming and requires technical skill. The development of a new fusion partner cell line, SPYMEG, has enabled the production of human hybridomas and opened a new direction for the isolation of human mAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Although many of these new technologies have increased the throughput of mAb isolation, the procedure still requires significant resources and time.</p>
<p>To dramatically enhance the efficiency of mAb isolation, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, which has changed the method for sequencing immunoglobulin (Ig) variable-region genes. For instance, tens of thousands of Ig genes specific to certain antigens can be identified by combining droplet-based single-cell isolation with DNA barcode antigen technology, followed by NGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Although Ig genes can be sequenced at a high throughput, there is no method for screening antibodies in a high-throughput format that is compatible with NGS technology.</p>
<p>In this study, we developed a new functional screening method that is compatible with NGS to rapidly identify antigen-specific clones. We first generated an Ig dual-expression vector using Golden Gate Cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), which enabled the linkage of heavy-chain variable and light-chain variable DNA fragments obtained from a single-sorted B cell, followed by the expression of membrane-bound Ig. This single-step procedure enabled the enrichment of antigen-specific, high-affinity Igs by flow cytometry, which was significantly faster than conventional cloning-based methods that require sequential steps. To demonstrate the efficiency of our new method, we screened for potent broadly reactive antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) against the influenza virus in an experimental mouse model using our technology. Broad reactivity allows for influenza vaccines that work across seasonal variations in influenza strains, which can only be accomplished by screening a large number of candidate antibodies. We first raised cross-reactive B cells against various hemagglutinin (HA) antigens from the influenza virus by sequential immunization with heterotypic HA antigens from group 1 influenza. Using this technology, we obtained several mAbs that bind to other group 1 HA antigens and even to group 2 HA antigens of the influenza virus. Our technology can also be applied to human antibody screening and represents a new line of mAb screening that accelerates the isolation of therapeutic and diagnostic mAbs.</p>

<title>Rapid membrane-bound dual Ig expression screening system</title>
<p>Cloning-based Ig screening involves several steps: cloning two Ig gene fragments encoding heavy and light chains independently from a single cell, co-expressing these Ig chains, and purifying individual recombinant antibodies. These steps are labor intensive. We established a new antibody screening system for the isolation of valuable mAbs (details in the method). Eventually, the antigen-binding Ig transformants were collected by sorting in a bulk fashion, and the unique CDR3 region and clones of interest were identified using the Ig-seq database (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>We generated a dual-expression vector to express both Ig heavy and kappa/lambda in a single-expression vector (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). These plasmids were individually transfected transiently to the floating human FreeStyle 293 cell line.

The advantage of this system is the rapid enrichment of clones of interest through bulk screening. In the current single-cell-based cloning/screening, plasmid DNA extracted from the collected antigen-binding bulk transformants was sequenced for the heavy chain CDR3 region. The CDR3 region is unique and can be used for the identification of a clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). This membrane-bound Ig expression system links antigen-binding features and genetic information of the Ig repertoire.</p>

<title>Building the Ig-seq database and analysis</title>
<p>As a model experiment, we obtained broadly reactive antibodies against influenza viruses using multiple HA probes. We prepared two HA proteins as probes: A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1), designated as PR8, and A/Okuda/1957 (H2N2), designated as H2. A total of 380 IgG1<sup>+</sup> germinal center B cells of either PR8<sup>+</sup> (204 cells), H2<sup>+</sup> (99 cells), or PR8<sup>+</sup>H2<sup>+</sup> (77 cells) were collected in a single-cell fashion. We obtained sequences of 284 independent clones. The success rate of cloning the paired Ig fragments was 75.9%. An overview of heavy chain V-D-J and light chain V-J usage and repertoire clonality is shown in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>. Mutation rates and CDR3 lengths of the heavy chains of the three cell populations (PR8<sup>+</sup>, H2<sup>+</sup>, and PR8<sup>+</sup>H2<sup>+</sup>) were comparable (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). These results indicate that broadly reactive antibodies do not require unique genetic traces to obtain breadth in our experimental setup.</p>

<title>Isolation of H2- and H1-reactive B cells</title>
<p>On day 2 after transfection, 287 transformants (Ig-expressing transformant libraries) were stained with HA probes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, we selected three prominent populations, H1<sup>+</sup>H2<sup>+</sup> (cross), H2<sup>+</sup> (H2), and H1<sup>+</sup> (H1), and collected them in bulk. In contrast to bacterial transfection, mammalian cell lines, such as FreeStyle 293 cells, can contain multiple plasmids in a cell and ectopically express multiple proteins. Therefore, we decided to mix the transformants instead of plasmids. We sorted 2,981 cells from these three populations and performed sequencing. Bulk Ig-seq data are referred to as Ig-seq data, as described above. All the transformants were examined individually. A total of 90 clones from the three populations were verified for their sequences and HA binding by flow cytometry analysis, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Among these, 110 “H1<sup>+</sup>,” 67 “H2<sup>+</sup>,” and 13 “cross” clones were successfully isolated. Then, 138 transformants were verified for their binding to HAs by flow cytometry. Of these, 81 “H1<sup>+</sup>,” 48 “H2<sup>+</sup>,” and nine “cross” clones were successfully isolated. Finally, 8 of the 13 “cross” clones obtained in bulk were included in this group; the binding of one clone (D11p4) was so weak that it was not included in the gates sorted in bulk. Thus, we established a high-throughput method for sorting “cross” clones.</p>

<title>Characterization of “cross” clones for broad reactivity against the influenza virus</title>
<p>By generating a secretory form of mAbs for these nine cross clones, including C10p2, we characterized their affinity and broadness using six different HA antigens from strains A/Okuda/1957 (H2N2) named for H2, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) for PR8, A/California/2009 (X-179A) [H1N1] Pdm09 for Cal, A/Texas/50/2012 (X-223) [H3N2] for H3, A/Egypt/N03072/2010(H5N1) for H5, and A/Brisbane/59/2007 [H1N1] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) for Stem. We determined the affinities (K<sub>d</sub>) of the antibodies for the six HA antigens using surface plasmon resonance analysis (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), which ranged from 500 to 100 nM. With the highest affinity among them, the C10p2 antibody bound to Cal at K<sub>d</sub> ≃ 5.66 × 10<sup>­10</sup> (M). Surprisingly, the antibodies showed a broader spectrum of HA binding among the influenza strains. Seven of the nine mAbs bound to HA from the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1. Furthermore, the six antibodies that bound to H3 were categorized into group 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). In addition, we observed that two of the broadly reactive antibodies recognized the stem region of the HA of A/Brisbane/59/2007. A possible scenario for other stem cell-negative antibodies is that they may either bind to the stem region of other strains or to the head region of HA. We tested whether some of these antibodies shared features with classic broadly neutralizing antibodies. C179, the first broadly neutralizing mouse antibody isolated in 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), reacts with the stem region of HAs from group 1 influenza virus strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). C179 binds to HAs from group 1 influenza viruses, including H1N1, H2N2, and H5N1. A competition assay for the binding of H2 and PR8 revealed that A6p4 competes with C179 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In addition, our two-dimensional phylogeny map indicated that A6p4 was unique to all clones (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Note that we used NSP2 as a negative control antibody, which binds specifically to the HA from A/California/2009 (X-179A) [H1N1] Pdm09 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). These results demonstrate that we were able to isolate a broadly reactive mAb with an affinity comparable to that of a classic broadly reactive mAb (C179) using our technology.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The discovery of therapeutic antibodies is accumulating, and their demand is increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Efficiently isolating one biologically significant antibody from the 10<sup>13</sup> antibody repertoire is challenging. The hybridoma method has long been used for this purpose and remains reliable. However, the fusion rate of B and myeloma cells is &lt; 0.001% in this method; therefore, the number of hybridomas obtained from one individual B cell is limited to several hundred clones, limiting its use in the production of mAbs. As an alternative choice, cloning-based antibody screening has gained popularity, especially for human antibody discovery, because of the lack of a human myeloma cell line similar to that used for murine cell fusion partners. The SPYMEG cell line can generate antigen-specific antibody-producing cells by fusing the murine SP2/0 myeloma cell line and human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line MEG-01 with human PBMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). In addition to gene expression profiling, NGS facilitates antibody repertoire analysis. However, despite breakthroughs in sequencing technology, the process of linking antibody function and its genes is still long and labor intensive. To overcome this issue, we developed a new antibody screening system to directly link antigen–antibody binding (as a function) with a gene encoding the antibody by expressing its membrane-bound form. Among conventional cloning-based mAb isolation methods, this system demonstrates several advantages. 1) Membrane Ig expression can link the antigen-binding feature of membrane-expressed Ig, which can be linked to Ig DNA sequence information using our plasmid construct. Similar to the panning procedure used in phage display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), antigen-binding cells carry the plasmid encoding the Ig genes through surface Ig so that the selection process in bulk format enriches the relevant plasmids for use in further experiments. 2) The dual Ig expression vector links heavy- and light-chain genes, which reduces the plasmid preparation time and stock by half. 3) Highly reliable Golden Gate Cloning technology using type IIs restriction enzymes can readily generate plasmid clones. This reduced the time required to generate an Ig plasmid library. 4) The population profile, defined by the fluorescence intensity during flow cytometry, directly reflected the affinity of a clone (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Collectively, our technology has streamlined the isolation of mAbs for therapy and diagnosis.</p>

<p>Our findings indicate that the developed antibody presentation system facilitates antibody functional analysis and is well suited for the discovery of antibodies important for infectious diseases when combined with conventional NGS-based antibody repertoire analysis. Compared with droplet-based experimental systems, well-based systems are limited in the number of cells they can process. Furthermore, experiments involving infectious bacteria and viruses have imposed limitations on human experimentation. To solve these problems, the automation of experiments will become important in the future. By combining our screening system with robotic automation of experiments, it will be possible to obtain useful mAbs for various diseases quickly and in large quantities, which has broad implications for the development of vaccines against various diseases.</p>

<title>Protein purification of influenza HAs (H1 and H2) as antigens</title>
<p>A mixture of 25.7 µg of HA, comprising H1 strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8), H1 strain A/California/7/2009 (X-179A), H2 strain A/Okuda/1957 (H2), H3 strain A/Texas/50/2012 (X-223), or H5 strain A/Egypt/N03072/2010], 1.3 µg of NA (Strain-matched), and 3 µg of BirA-expressing plasmids were transfected into Expi293 cells using the Expifectamine 293 transfection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were then cultured in Expi293 Expression Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with D-biotin at a final concentration of 100 µM for <italic>in vivo</italic> BirA biotinylation in a humidified incubator containing 8% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C and 125 rpm. If biotinylation was not necessary, transfection was performed without BirA, and cell culture was carried out without D-biotin. Culture supernatants were harvested at 3 days post-transfection and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). All proteins were purified with a Talon metal affinity resin (Takara Bio USA, Mountain View, CA, USA) and dialyzed against pyrogen-free PBS. The oligomeric state and purity were determined at 25°C by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare Technologies, Chicago, IL).</p>

Cell lysates were incubated at 70°C for 90 s, followed by 35°C for 15 s, and then placed on ice for 2 min. For first-strand cDNA synthesis, 5 µL of RT mix (2× PCR buffer, 5 mM DTT, 2 mM dNTP Mix, 10 U RNase inhibitor, 100 U SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase) was added to the cell lysate and incubated consecutively at 35°C for 5 min, 45°C for 20 min, 70°C for 10 min, and 4°C for chilling. For primer digestion, 5 µL of the primer digestion mix (1× ExoI Buffer, 7.5 U Exonuclease I) was prepared and incubated at 37°C for 30 min, 80°C for 20 min, and 4°C for chilling. For the poly-A tailing reaction, 5 µL of the poly-A tailing reaction mix (4× PCR buffer, 5 mM dATP, 0.1 U RNase H, 60 U Terminal transferase) was prepared and incubated at 37°C for 50 s, 65°C for 10 min, and 4°C for chilling.

<title>Paired-end Illumina sequencing strategy and analysis</title>
<p>The libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. As the sequencing length was limited to 2 × 300 bp, we used the following strategy. Amplicons in both orientations were generated using an Illumina adapter sequence. Then, asymmetric 400+100 nt paired-end sequencing was performed to obtain high-quality 400 + 400 nt paired-end sequences of the original cDNA molecule. This approach provided a sufficient sequencing length to capture extra-long Ig variants. We followed Turchaninova’s method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Only reads that met the following four conditions were used as the resulting Ig sequences: 1) reads with a length of 260 nt or more; 2) cumulative clustered reads representing the top 5% of the entire reads; 3) 5’- and 3’-reads overlapping a length of 20 bases or more; and 4) a total length of 460 ± 50 bp for heavy chain or 390 ± 40 bp for light chain. All resulting sequence data were analyzed using IMGT/High V-QUEST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imgt.org/IMGT_vquest/vquest">http://www.imgt.org/IMGT_vquest/vquest</ext-link>) for annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Using the sequences and annotations, Ig database construction and visualization of the Ig repertoire were performed using the in-house BONSCI software.</p>

<title>Construction of a mouse IgG/IgK expression plasmid</title>
<p>The BsaI restriction sites were inserted into the paired B cell repertoire amplicon from a single cell using PCR. The destination vector contained the IL6 signal peptide, EF1a promoter, ccdB gene, and mouse IgK Fc region. The donor vector contained the mouse IgG1 Fc region, the <italic>Venus</italic> gene, and the EF1a promoter. The paired B cell repertoire amplicons, destination vector, and donor vector containing BsaI restriction sites were assembled using our assembly method. For this step, 10 μL of the assembly mix (1× T4 DNA ligase buffer, 1× BSA, 1 U BsaI restriction enzyme, 40 U T4 DNA ligase, 100 ng heavy chain amplicon, 100 ng light chain amplicon, 100 ng destination vector, and 100 ng donor vector) was prepared and incubated for 25 cycles at 37°C for 3 min, 16°C for 4 min, 50°C for 5 min, and 80°C for 5 min, and then chilled. The antibody sequence that entered the construct was fused to the <italic>Venus</italic> sequence and expressed in membrane form.</p>

<p>The studies described here are <bold>useful</bold>; they are broadly applicable to all antibody discovery subfields but do not add significant improvement to techniques already published. The findings are <bold>incomplete</bold> with respect to the methodology since details that are crucial in order to repeat the experiment are lacking (such as a timestamp) and they do not take into account multiple recent papers that have tested similar strategies. These studies will be of interest to a specialized audience working on making antibodies to infectious agents.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper by Watanabe et al described an expression system that can express the paired heavy and light chains of IgG antibodies from single cell B cells. In addition, they used FACS sorting for specific antigens to screen/select the specific populations for more targeted cloning of mAb genes. By staining with multiple antigens, they were able to zoom in to cross-reactive antibodies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A highly efficient process that combines selection/screening with dua expression of both antibody chains. It is particularly suitable for the isolation of cross-reactive antibodies against conserved epitopes of different antigens, such as surface proteins of related viruses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The overall writing is very difficult to follow and the authors need to work on significant re-writing.</p>
<p>(2) The paper in its current form really lacks detail and it is NOT possible for readers to repeat or follow their methods. For example: a) It is not clear whether the authors checked the serum to see if the mice were producing antibodies before they sacrificed them to harvest spleen/blood i.e. using ELISA? b) How long after administration of the second dose were the mice sacrificed? c) What cell types are taken for single B cell sorting? Splenocytes or PBMC? These are just some of the questions which need to be addressed.</p>
<p>(3) According to the authors, 77 clones were sorted from the PR8+ and H2+ double positive quadrant. It is surprising that after transfection and re-analysing of bulk antibody presenting EXPI cells on FACS, only 13 clones (or 8 clones? - unclear) seemed to be truly cross-reactive. If that is the case, the approach is not as efficient as the authors claimed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Watanabe, Takashi, et al. investigated the use of the Golden Gate dual-expression vector system to enhance the modern standard for rapid screening of recombinant monoclonal antibodies. The presented data builds upon modern techniques that currently use multiple expression vectors to express heavy and light chain pairs. In a single vector, they express the linked heavy and light chain variable genes with a membrane-bound Ig which allows for rapid and more affordable cell-based screening. The final validation of H1 and H2 strain influenza screening resulted in 81 &quot;H1+&quot;, 48 &quot;H2+&quot;, and 9 &quot;cross&quot; reactive clones. The kinetics of some of the soluble antibodies were tested via SPR and validated with a competitive inhibition with classical well-characterized neutralizing clones.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In this study, Watanabe, Takashi, et al. further develop and refine the methodologies for the discovery of monoclonal antibodies. They elegantly merge newer technologies to speed up turnaround time and reduce the cost of antibody discovery. Their data supports the feasibility of their technique.</p>
<p>This study will have an impact on pandemic preparedness and antibody-based therapies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A His tagged antigen was used for immunization and H1-his was used in all assays. Either the removal of His specific clones needs to be done before selection, or a different tag needs to be used in the subsequent assays.</p>
<p>This assay doesn't directly test the neutralization of influenza but rather equates viral clearance to competitive inhibition. The results would be strengthened with the demonstration of a functional antibody in vivo with viral clearance.</p>
<p>Limitations of this new technique are as follows: there is a significant loss of cells during FACs, transfection and cloning efficiency are critical to success, and well-based systems limit the number of possible clones (as the author discussed in the conclusions). Early enrichment of the B cells could improve efficiency, such as selection for memory B cells.</p>
