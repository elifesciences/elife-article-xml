<title>Abstract</title><p>Selector transcription factors control choices of alternative cellular fates during development. The ventral rhombomere 1 of the embryonic brainstem produces neuronal precursors that can differentiate into either inhibitory GABAergic or excitatory glutamatergic neurons important for the control of behaviour. Transcription factors (TFs) <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> are required for adopting the GABAergic neuronal identity and inhibiting the glutamatergic identity. Here, we asked how these selector TFs are activated and how they control the identity of the developing brainstem neurons. We addressed these questions by analysing chromatin accessibility at putative gene regulatory elements active during GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron lineage bifurcation, combined with studies of transcription factor expression and DNA-binding. Our results show that the <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> genes are activated by highly similar mechanisms, with connections to regional patterning, neurogenic cell cycle exit and general course of neuronal differentiation. After activation, <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> are linked by auto- and cross-regulation as well as regulatory interactions with transcription factors of the glutamatergic branch. Predicted targets of these selector TFs include genes expressed in GABAergic neurons, glutamatergic neurons, or both. Unlike genes specific to the glutamatergic branch, the genes expressed in GABAergic neurons appear to be under combinatorial control of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic>. Understanding gene regulatory interactions affecting the anterior brainstem GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron differentiation may give genetic and mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental traits and disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The anterior brainstem is a complex neuronal mosaic controlling mood, motivation and movement. These neurons include diverse inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic neurons, some of which are associated with the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems.</p>
<p>An important source of these neurons is the ventrolateral rhombomere 1 (r1), where GABA- and glutamatergic neuron precursors are generated from a neuroepithelial region expressing a homeodomain TF <italic>Nkx6-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lahti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Waite et al., 2012</xref>). We here refer to these precursors as rhombencephalic V2 domain (rV2), reflecting its molecular similarity to the V2 domain in the developing spinal cord. The rV2 precursors give rise to GABAergic neurons in the posterior Substantia Nigra pars reticulata, Ventral Tegmental Area, Rostromedial Tegmental Nucleus and Ventral Tegmental Nucleus, all important for various aspects of behavioural control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lahti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Morello et al., 2020a</xref>). A failure in the differentiation of the rV2 GABAergic neurons in the embryonic mouse brain, caused by mutation of the <italic>Tal1</italic> gene, results in robust behavioral changes in postnatal mice, including hyperactivity, impulsivity, hypersensitivity to reward, and learning deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Morello et al., 2020a</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Nkx6-1</italic> positive proliferative progenitors of rV2 give rise to postmitotic V2b-like GABAergic precursors expressing selector genes <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic>, and V2a-like glutamatergic precursors expressing <italic>Vsx1</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Achim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Muroyama et al., 2005</xref>). In the absence of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> function, differentiation of all the rV2 precursors is directed to glutamatergic neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Achim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lahti et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> also retain their expression in the mature GABAergic neurons. Thus, Tal1, Gata2 and Gata3 TFs operate as fate-selectors, possibly responsible for both the induction and maintenance of the GABAergic identity in the anterior ventrolateral brainstem.It has remained unclear how the selector TFs are activated during development and how they guide neuronal differentiation in the anterior brainstem. To address these questions, we have characterized the accessibility and TF binding in putative gene regulatory elements and correlated these events with changes in gene expression during differentiation of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the anterior brainstem. Our results suggest that the GABAergic selector TF genes are activated by interconnected mechanisms reflecting developmental regionalization and timing, and that their functions converge to promote GABAergic and suppress glutamatergic neuron differentiation.</p>

<title>Transcriptomic dynamics and chromatin accessibility in differentiating rV2 GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons</title>
<p>To understand the sequence of gene expression changes that correlate with the bifurcation of the rV2 GABAergic and glutamatergic cell lineages, we first studied the transcriptome and the genome accessibility in developing rV2 precursors. We used data from the scRNA-seq of the ventral r1 region of E12.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Morello et al., 2020a</xref>), where the rV2 lineages were identified based on the expression of markers of common proliferative progenitors (<italic>Ccnb1</italic>, <italic>Nkx6-1</italic>) and markers of the post-mitotic GABAergic (<italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gad1</italic>) and glutamatergic precursors (<italic>Nkx6-1</italic>, <italic>Vsx2</italic>, <italic>Slc17a6</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, C</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). Click or tap here to enter text. We found that the rV2 cells were arranged on pseudotemporal axes representing differentiating GABAergic or glutamatergic lineages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>). The GABAergic and glutamatergic selector TF genes (<italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Gata3</italic>, <italic>Vsx1</italic>, <italic>Vsx2</italic>, <italic>Lhx4</italic>) were strongly expressed in the post-mitotic precursors at lineage bifurcation point and at the start of the lineage branches (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>To find gene regulatory elements in the rV2 cell types, we applied scATAC-seq in E12.5 ventral r1 cells. We clustered the r1 scATAC-seq cells based on their open chromatin regions (called features below), followed by integration with the E12.5 scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) that provides an estimate of the transcript levels for scATAC-seq measured cells. From the scATAC-seq data, we readily identified the cell groups of the rV2 lineage, expressing TFs specific for GABAergic and glutamatergic cell types (Supplementary Figure 2). We identified two progenitor cell groups (PRO1, PRO2), rV2 common precursors (CO), GABAergic neuron branch consisting of 4 cell groups and glutamatergic branch of 2 cell groups (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Further clustering of the isolated rV2 cell groups yielded two groups of common precursors (CO1, CO2), six cell groups in the GABAergic branch (GA1-GA6), and five cell groups in the glutamatergic branch (GL1-GL5) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, F</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). The placement of the scATAC-seq rV2 cells in the pseudotemporal axis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) assigned the early state in pseudotime to cells expressing markers of proliferative progenitors and early post-mitotic common precursors, while late pseudotime state cells express markers of differentiating GABAergic and glutamatergic precursors. The cell groups had consistently increasing average pseudotime from PRO1 to the end of both GABAergic and glutamatergic branches. We next compared the scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq cell group markers across the rV2 lineages (top 25 marker genes per group, similarity testing using hypergeometric distribution) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Table 2). The similarity scores indicate discrete matches between the scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq groups, with the exception of PRO1 and PRO2 as the rV2 scATAC-seq groups expressing progenitor markers (<italic>Nes</italic> and <italic>Phdgh</italic>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>) did not have clear counterparts among the scRNA-seq groups (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>) and the progenitors were therefore excluded from the scRNA-seq based lineage analysis. In conclusion, open chromatin features largely reflected the gene expression in the ventral r1 and allowed placing the developing rV2 neurons in cell groups and in a pseudotemporal order.</p>

<title>Chromatin accessibility profiles in genomic features linked to selector genes in the rV2 cell groups</title>
<p><italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> are required for GABAergic fate selection in rV2 and their expression is activated in the GABAergic post-mitotic precursors, whereas <italic>Vsx2</italic> is expressed in the glutamatergic precursors soon after rV2 lineage bifurcation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Achim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lahti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Morello et al., 2020a</xref>). To understand the mechanisms behind activation of the expression of these lineage-specific TFs, we analysed the accessibility of chromatin features in <italic>Tal1, Gata2, Gata3</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> loci in the rV2 cell groups. To find selector gene -associated chromatin features, we tested all features within the topologically associating domain (TAD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Singh and Berger, 2021</xref>) containing the selector gene transcription start site (TSS) for correlation between the feature accessibility and the selector gene expression. We defined the features linked to the selector gene with LinkPeaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stuart et al., 2021</xref>) z-score below -2 or above 2 and p-value &lt;0.05 as candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCRE) of the gene (Supplementary Table 3).</p>
<p>The <italic>Tal1</italic> locus, +/-50 kb of the TSS, contains genes <italic>Stil, Tal1, Pdzk1ip1</italic> and <italic>Cyp4x1</italic> and 20 scATAC-seq features (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In total, the <italic>Tal1</italic> TAD contains 107 features. Accessibility of 15 out of the 107 features in the TAD containing the <italic>Tal1</italic> gene was linked to the <italic>Tal1</italic> expression (p-value &lt; 0.05) (Supplementary Table 3, <italic>Tal1</italic> cCREs). For example, the gain in the accessibility of <italic>Tal1</italic> cCREs at +0.7 and +40 kb correlated temporally with the up- regulation of <italic>Tal1 mRNA</italic> levels, strongly increasing in the earliest GABAergic precursors (GA1) and maintained at a lower level in the more mature GABAergic precursor groups (GA2-GA6), as well as <italic>Pdzk1ip1</italic> mRNA expression, increasing transiently in the earliest GABAergic precursors (GA1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Other features within the <italic>Tal1</italic> gene (+7 kb) as well as in more distal intergenic area (+15.1, +16, +16.4 and +23 kb cCREs) were also found to correlate with the <italic>Tal1</italic> mRNA expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>, Supplementary Table 3).</p>

<p>Notably, the identified <italic>Tal1</italic> promoter feature (<italic>Tal1</italic> +0.7kb cCRE) contains <italic>Tal1</italic> midbrain and hindbrain-spinal cord enhancers characterized earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bockamp et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sinclair et al., 1999</xref>). The <italic>Tal1</italic> +40 kb cCRE corresponds to the previously characterized enhancer region driving expression in the midbrain and hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ogilvy et al., 2007</xref>). Enhancers at - 3.8 kb and +15.1/16/16.4 kb of <italic>Tal1</italic> have been shown to drive <italic>Tal1</italic> expression in hematopoietic stem cells and erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Göttgens et al., 2004</xref>) (Supplementary Table 4, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly to <italic>Tal1</italic> locus, the TADs of <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> genes contained features where accessibility increased specifically in the GABAergic precursors, correlating with the activation of <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> mRNA expression (Supplementary Figure 4, Supplementary Table 3). Of these, two <italic>Gata2</italic> cCREs, at -3.7 kb and +0 kb, are located in the proximal regulatory and promoter regions, which have been earlier shown to function as <italic>Gata2</italic> mid- and hindbrain expression enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nozawa et al., 2009</xref>), as well as critical <italic>Gata2</italic> autoregulation elements in hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kobayashi-Osaki et al., 2005</xref>) (Supplementary Table 4, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). We also identified an intronic <italic>Gata2</italic> cCRE at +11.6 kb that may mediate the regulation of <italic>Gata2</italic> expression in the spinal cord V2 interneurons by Gata2-Tal1 co-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>). Four additional previously uncharacterized <italic>Gata2</italic> cCREs were identified downstream of the <italic>Gata2</italic> gene (+22, +25.3, +32.8 and 47.5 kb cCREs, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>) and five more further downstream within the TAD (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). The <italic>Gata2</italic> +22 kb, +25.3 kb and +32.8 kb cCREs were accessible in the early precursors, before the opening of the <italic>Gata2</italic> -3.7 kb cCRE in GA1 and <italic>Gata2</italic> +0 kb cCRE in GA3-GA6 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>, Supplementary Table 3).</p>
<p>At the <italic>Gata3</italic> locus, the GABAergic precursor –specific features included several intragenic features (<italic>Gata3</italic> +11.1 kb, +17.2 kb, +18.8 kb cCREs), and five features upstream the gene at -2.7 kb to -7.7 kb of <italic>Gata3</italic> TSS (Supplementary Table 3, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>, D). The Gata3 +0.6 kb, +2.2 kb and the five upstream cCREs locate within the previously identified Gata3 CNS enhancer region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lakshmanan et al., 1999</xref>), and two of those also match <italic>Gata3</italic> lens expression enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Martynova et al., 2018</xref>) (Supplementary Table 4, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>). The <italic>Gata3</italic> +11.1 kb cCRE corresponds to the <italic>Gata3</italic> proximal enhancer driving expression in PNS regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lieuw et al., 1997</xref>). The <italic>Gata3</italic> +17.2 kb cCRE is located in the intron 3-4 of the <italic>Gata3</italic> gene and may have enhancer activity in spinal cord V2b interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>) (Supplementary Table 4, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, accessibility of the cCREs of the GABAergic selector TF genes changed with different kinetics during neuronal differentiation. For example, the accessibility of <italic>Tal1</italic> +15.1 kb, +16 kb, +23 kb and <italic>Tal1</italic> +40 kb cCREs was robustly detected before and at the onset of GABAergic differentiation and declined thereafter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The <italic>Tal1</italic> +23 kb cCRE contained two scATAC-seq peaks, having temporally different patterns of accessibility. The feature is accessible at 3’ position early, and gains accessibility at 5’ positions concomitant with GABAergic differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Detailed feature analysis indicated that the 3’ end of this feature contains binding sites of <italic>Nkx6-1</italic> and <italic>Ascl1</italic> that are expressed in the rV2 neuronal progenitors, while the 5’ end contains TF binding sites of Insm1 and Tal1 TFs that are activated in early precursors (described below, see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The accessibility of the Tal1 +0.7 kb cCRE largely reflected the <italic>Tal1</italic> mRNA expression and, unlike the early- peaking cCREs, such as <italic>Tal1</italic> +40 kb, it was accessible also in the late GABAergic neuron precursors GA3-GA6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, distinct regulatory elements of the selector TFs may be responsible for the activation and for the maintenance of the lineage-specific expression of selector TF gene.</p>

<p><italic>Vsx2</italic> gene expression was detected in the common precursors CO1 and increased in CO2 and the glutamatergic precursors (GL1-GL5) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, RNA expression). At the <italic>Vsx2</italic> locus, an intronic feature (<italic>Vsx2</italic> +20.5 kb) and the distal features at -61 kb and -21.3 kb of <italic>Vsx2</italic> TSS were opened concomitant with its expression activation, whereas accessibility of the <italic>Vsx2</italic> promoter region (<italic>Vsx2</italic> +1.1 kb cCRE) and +27 kb cCRE increased later in the glutamatergic precursors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>The information about the enhancers of <italic>Vsx2</italic> brain expression is scarce, but our <italic>Vsx2</italic> r1 cCREs at -18.7 kb, -21.3 kb, +1.1 kb and +20.5 kb match previously characterized enhancers of <italic>Vsx2</italic> expression in photoreceptor cells and retinal bipolar neurons and also contain putative autoregulatory <italic>Vsx2</italic> binding sites occupied in developing spinal cord motor neuron and interneuron lineages (Supplementary Table 4, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Developmentally important gene regulatory elements are often conserved. We therefore asked if features detected by scATAC-seq could present more evolutionary conserved sequences than random sequences of mouse genome. To that aim, we used nucleotide conservation scores from UCSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>). We overlaid conservation information and scATAC-seq features to both validate feature definition as well as to provide corroborating evidence to recognize cCRE elements. We calculated statistical enrichment of conserved nucleotides within exons, introns and our scATAC-seq features (Supplementary Table 5, sheet per chromosome). Systematically, odds ratios per chromosome were highest for exons and lowest for introns, odds ratios for features were between these two. All of the odds ratios showed a significant difference from what is expected if there was no relationship between the nucleotides within features and conservation (p=&lt; 2.20e-16, Fisher’s Exact test, Supplementary Table 5, sheet per chromosome). The conservation of chromatin features is consistent with a putative role as regulatory sites.</p>
<p>In summary, we identified the genomic features that are linked to GABAergic and glutamatergic fate selector genes, and where chromatin accessibility changes specifically during rV2 neuron differentiation. Those features may represent regulatory elements of the selector genes. Furthermore, literature research revealed that the previously characterized enhancers, and especially the nervous system expression enhancers of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> mostly are found within the ATAC-features identified here (63.6 - 100% of gene enhancers overlapping with scATAC-seq features, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Transcription factor activity at cCREs of the rV2 cell fate selector genes</title>
<p>Next, we wanted to identify the TFs associated with the putative regulatory elements of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> genes. TF binding to chromatin affects its accessibility, leaving a footprint which can be detected in scATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bentsen et al., 2020</xref>). We applied the footprint analysis across the rV2 cell groups using the known TF binding sites (TFBS) from the HOCOMOCO collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vorontsov et al., 2023</xref>). The TF footprinting analysis identified global TF activity patterns correlating with GABA- and glutamatergic neuron differentiation (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). To find the TFs that may regulate the expression of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic>, we identified the TFBSs at the conserved genomic locations (weighted average conservation at TFBS &gt; 0.5) within each selector gene cCRE. The results of the footprint analysis are shown for selected features of <italic>Tal1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>) and <italic>Vsx2</italic> (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7A,C-E</xref>), showing only the TFs expressed (average RNA expression &gt; 1.2 (log1p)) in any of the four cell groups from PRO1-2, CO1-2, GA1-2 and GL1-2. We observed both common and distinct patterns of TF binding in the cCREs of <italic>Tal1</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> in the rV2 common precursors and early GABA- and glutamatergic cells. Both <italic>Tal1</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> cCREs contain conserved binding sites of Kr-like TFs, bHLH TFs, E2A, Ebf, E2F, NF-1, Pbx and Sox TF families, and various homeodomain (HD) TF-s (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7C-E</xref>). The analysis of TFBSs at the footprint regions suggested that each region may have affinity to several different TFs belonging to a TF class. For example, four Sox TFs are expressed in early rV2 lineage cells (<italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Sox3</italic>, <italic>Sox4</italic> and <italic>Sox11</italic>), which all may compete for the same binding sites in <italic>Tal1</italic> +0.7 kb cCRE or <italic>Vsx2</italic> -61 kb cCRE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>To further understand the mechanisms of the activation of lineage-specific selector expression, we asked which TFs commonly and specifically regulate the GABAergic selector TF genes <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, and <italic>Gata3</italic>. Identification of the common regulators of GABAergic fate selectors revealed 21 TFs in CO1-2 and 22 TFs in the GA1-2 cell groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the common regulators between the stages are overlapping partially, with the TFs associated with the neurogenic cell cycle exit predominant in the common precursors (CO) and the postmitotic differentiation and the autoregulation network TFs showing activity later in the GABAergic precursors.</p>
<p>We next asked which upstream regulators are common to both rV2 GABAergic (<italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2, Gata3</italic>) and glutamatergic (<italic>Vsx1</italic> and <italic>Vsx2)</italic> fate selector genes. We identified 12 TFs, including Ascl1, E2f1, Nkx6-1 and Vsx1 that may regulate both GABA- and glutamatergic selectors in the CO1-2 cell group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7F</xref>, genes indicated in bold). The distinct regulators of GABA-and glutamatergic fate selectors, aside the lineage- specific autoregulatory functions of the selectors themselves, include Lhx1 and En2 in the GABAergic sublineage (Lhx1 binding <italic>Tal1</italic> +0.7 kb feature, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), and Lhx4, Shox2 and Nhlh2 regulating <italic>Vsx2</italic> expression in the glutamatergic lineage (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7C-E</xref>). Footprints at Nkx6-1 TFBS were detected in the cCREs of all selectors in common precursors, but after onset of differentiation become restricted to the cCREs of <italic>Vsx2</italic> and <italic>Vsx1</italic> in the glutamatergic cells. Interestingly, the <italic>Vsx2</italic> -68.8 kb cCRE contains conserved GATA TF binding sites (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7E</xref>). Conversely, Vsx1 and Vsx2 binding sites were found in the cCREs of <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic>, suggesting a mutual cross-regulation between the GABA-and glutamatergic selector genes. Putative Vsx1 binding sites were detected in all three GABAergic fate selector genes, <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic>, in the rV2 common precursors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, CO, CO1-2).</p>
<p>The proneural bHLH TFs appeared to contribute to the activation of the selector genes. Ascl1 and Neurog2 TFBS are found at the cCREs of both <italic>Tal1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, D</xref>) and <italic>Vsx2</italic> (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7C, D</xref>). In addition, Neurog1 TFBS was bound at <italic>Vsx2</italic> +20.5 kb and –61 kb cCREs in the rV2 common precursors (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7C, D</xref>). Interestingly, several cell cycle-associated TFs may also contribute to the regulation of selector gene expression. Those include Sox2, Sox21, Insm1, Ebf1, Ebf3, and E2f1. E2f1 and Ebf1-3 binding sites are located within the GC-rich areas (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7C-E</xref>). E2f1 binds Tal1 cCREs +0.7 kb and +7 kb and is strongly expressed in the CO1-2, the common precursors of rV2 GABA- and glutamatergic cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The expression of <italic>E2f1</italic> declines after differentiation, while <italic>Ebf1-3</italic> are expressed in common precursors (CO1- 2) and maintained in differentiating neurons of both GABA- and glutamatergic sublineages (GA1-1, GL1-2) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7C-E</xref>). Interestingly, the scATAC-seq feature analysis suggested that Ebf1-3 TFs interact with Tal1 cCREs as well as Gata2 cCREs in both GABA- and glutamatergic cells (Supplementary Table 3).</p>
<p>In addition to the footprint analysis, we analyzed chromatin interactions of Tal1, Gata2, Gata3, Vsx2, Ebf1 and Insm1 in the E12.5 r1 by CUT&amp;Tag (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). The binding of Tal1, Gata2, and Gata3 at the <italic>Tal1</italic> cCREs was supported by CUT&amp;Tag (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>), consistent with the autoregulatory activity of the GABAergic fate selector genes. In addition to the <italic>Tal1</italic> +0.7 kb and +40 kb cCREs, we detected Tal1, Gata2 and Gata3 binding at the <italic>Tal1</italic> +23 kb cCRE, where scATAC-footprinting did not indicate binding at conserved sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, C</xref>). The DNA binding of Insm1 and Ebf1 was also partially confirmed by CUT&amp;Tag. Insm1 footprints were found in Tal1 cCREs -3.8 kb and +23 kb, while Insm1 CUT&amp;Tag peaks were found at Tal1 +7kb, and +23kb cCREs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, CUT&amp;Tag Insm1). scATAC-footprint was found at the conserved Ebf1 TFBS in <italic>Tal1</italic> +77.4 kb cCRE and, by CUT&amp;Tag, Ebf1 was found to interact with <italic>Tal1</italic> +23kb and <italic>Tal1</italic> +40kb cCREs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). However, scATAC-seq footprints for Ebf1 are found also in the <italic>Tal1</italic>+23kb and <italic>Tal1</italic> +40kb cCREs, whereas those TFBS are weakly conserved across mammals (cons&lt;0.5). Overall comparison of TF binding detected by scATAC-seq footprinting and by CUT&amp;Tag indicates strong bias towards the same features (Supplementary Table 6). Earlier reports of corroborations between Cut&amp;Run and footprinting have shown 9% (<italic>Lmx1b</italic>) and 30.5% (<italic>Pet1</italic>) of footprints having overlapping Cut&amp;Run peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Eastman et al., 2025</xref>). In our analysis equivalent percentages range from 5.3% to 25.9%, depending on the TF. Additionally, an analysis of footprint positions in relation to CUT&amp;Tag peaks indicate clear tendency of having most footprints towards the center of the peaks (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>), further validating eligibility of CUT&amp;Tag and footprinting as corroborating methods.</p>
<p>In summary, the regulatory feature analysis revealed several mechanisms that may contribute to the timing of activation and the maintenance of selector TF expression. Firstly, we found the binding sites of cell cycle progression or progenitor identity-associated TFs E2f1 and Insm1, proneural TFs Ascl1, Neurog1, Neurog2, Neurod1 and Neurod2, as well as TFs expressed after cell cycle exit, such as Sox4 and Ebf3 at the putative distal regulatory elements. Conserved binding sites for other Ebf TFs, Ebf1 and Ebf2 are also found in the cCREs of <italic>Tal1</italic> and <italic>Gata2</italic>, but not <italic>Gata3</italic>. In addition, the proximal elements and the promoter regions of <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Tal1</italic> genes contained footprints at conserved GATA-TAL motif in the GABAergic neurons, indicating autoregulation of the selector TFs. Similarly, conserved Vsx1 and Vsx2 motifs in <italic>Vsx2</italic> cCREs were associated with scATAC-seq footprints in the glutamatergic neurons.</p>

<title>Pattern of expression of the putative regulators of Tal1 in the r1</title>
<p>Our analysis of TFBSs in the selector gene cCREs indicated that GABAergic selector TF expression may be regulated by tens of transcription factors. From these factors we chose a subset of TFs (<italic>Insm1, Sox4, E2f1, Ebf1</italic>) for expression studies based on earlier knowledge of their functions. Among those, E2f1 and Ebf TFs are involved in cell cycle progression and neuronal differentiation. Previous <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization data (Allen Brain Atlas, developing mouse brain) indicates that of <italic>Ebf1-3</italic>, <italic>Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Ebf3</italic> are expressed in the developing r1 at E11.5 and E13.5. Here, we chose to investigate the expression pattern of <italic>Ebf1</italic> and its overlap with <italic>Tal1</italic> more closely. Our analysis also indicated several Sox TF family proteins of Sox B and C class. The roles of SoxB1 and SoxB2 proteins Sox2 and Sox21 have been well studied in early neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Makrides et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sandberg et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, we found that SoxC class TFs Sox4 and Sox11 may be regulating <italic>Tal1</italic> expression in the early rV2 GABAergic neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> Tal1 +23kb cCRE, Sox4).</p>
<p>In addition, we found mediator of Hippo signalling pathway, Tead2, among the possible regulators of <italic>Tal1</italic>. The regulation of a selector gene by Tead2 is of interest because of its role as a mediator of mechanical signals from cells that could serve as cues to the apical-basal migration, a process concomitant to the cell cycle exit and fate commitment in neuronal precursors. An scATAC-seq footprint at Tead2 TFBS was found in <italic>Tal1</italic> +0.7 kb cCRE in CO1-2, and interestingly, in a distal <italic>Tal1</italic> cCRE at -662.9 kb; although the conservation scores at those sites were below 0.5.</p>
<p>To test whether the <italic>Insm1, Sox4, E2f1, Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Tead2</italic> genes are expressed in the <italic>Tal1</italic>+ lineage precursors, we analysed the pattern of their mRNA expression in the E12.5 mouse r1 by mRNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation with RNAscope probes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In the embryonic brain, the progression of neuronal differentiation follows the apical-basal axis, as the newly born precursors exit the ventricular zone and migrate to the mantle zone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, arrow). <italic>Tal1</italic> is expressed shortly after the cell cycle exit. The expression of <italic>Insm1, Sox4, E2f1, Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Tead2</italic> mRNA was detected in the ventricular zone of the ventrolateral r1 at E12.5 and overlapped with <italic>Tal1</italic> mRNA expression in the cells located close to the ventricular zone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>, arrowheads in a4, a7, b4, b7, c4). We quantified the intensity of the fluorescence signal of each RNAscope probe along the apical-to-basal axis of the neuroepithelium (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-F</xref>, arrow), and found that the maximum intensity of <italic>Insm1, E2f1</italic> and <italic>Tead2</italic> probe signal is detected slightly closer to the ventricular surface than that of <italic>Tal1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref>). The expression of <italic>Ebf1</italic> followed the pattern of expression of <italic>Tal1</italic> closely, but was expressed at slightly higher levels earlier (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). The maximum intensity of <italic>Sox4</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, a5-a7, and D) was detected in the cells at more basal position in the neuroepithelium, where the differentiated neurons reside. The expression patterns observed along the apical-basal axis in the E12.5 r1 neuroepithelium (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-F</xref>) matched with the expression patterns detected by scRNA-seq in the respective cell groups along the pseudotemporal axis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G-I</xref>).</p>

<title>Regulatory signature of developing rV2 GABAergic neurons</title>
<p>In addition to the regulatory elements of GABAergic fate selectors, we wanted to understand the genome-wide TF activity during rV2 neuron differentiation. To this aim we applied ChromVAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schep et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the footprint analysis in cCREs, ChromVAR analysis indicated that accessible genomic regions in rV2 progenitor and precursor cells are enriched in Sox, NeuroD1 and Nfia/b/x TF binding motifs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>Those TFs have been suggested to regulate temporal dynamic of gene expression in mouse neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sagner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>) and the cell cycle exit of early dopaminergic neuron progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lahti et al., 2025</xref>). In addition, we found Nhlh1/2, NeuroD2, Bhlhe22, Ebf1-3, Pou3f4 and Lhx5 motifs are accessible in common precursors, shortly preceding the gain of accessibility in Gata2/3 and Tal1 motifs in GABAergic neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, square). In conclusion, many of the TFs with footprints in selector gene cCREs had a genome-wide activity pattern consistent with a regulatory function.</p>
<p>We also analyzed the activity of Tal1, Gata2 and Gata3 in the rV2 neurons more closely. For those TFs, the accessibility at most of their TFBSs closely follows the TF RNA expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-C</xref>). Interestingly, there are three TFBS motifs of <italic>Tal1</italic> in the HOCOMOCO v12 resource. Of these Tal1 TFBSs, the activity pattern of the TAL1.H12CORE.0.P.B motif (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, TAL1.H12CORE.0.P.B) was most specific to the GABAergic lineage, similar to the Gata2 and Gata3 TFBSs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The TAL1.H12CORE.0.P.B is a 19-bp motif that consists of an E-box and GATA sequence, and is likely bound by heteromeric Gata2-Tal1 TF complex, but may also be bound by Gata2, Gata3 or Tal1 TFs separately. The other TFBSs of Tal1 contain a strong E-box motif and showed either a lower activity (TAL1.H12CORE.1.P.B) or an earlier peak of activity in common precursors with a decline after differentiation (TAL1.H12CORE.2.P.B) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Targets of the GABAergic fate selectors in the developing rhombomere 1</title>
<p>We next focused on the roles of GABAergic fate selector genes in determining the GABA- vs glutamatergic phenotype in rV2 cell lineages. Using the combined evidence of TF footprints, TFBS conservation and <italic>in vivo</italic> CUT&amp;Tag experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>), we identified 3948 target genes of Tal1, 780 target genes of Gata2, and 721 target genes of Gata3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, Supplementary Table 7). About half of the identified target genes are differentially expressed in GABA- or glutamatergic neurons (differential expression between in GA1-2 and GL1-2 groups with p-value &lt;0.01 in Wilcoxon’s test). However, most of the identified target genes of Tal1, Gata2, and Gata3 are lowly expressed in the GABA- and glutamatergic neurons, with only 30% of the genes being expressed above RNA avg(exp)&gt;0.5 (log1p) in GA1-2 or GL1-2 cell groups (Supplementary Table 7). GSEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) showed that Tal1 target genes are expressed in both GABA- and glutamatergic neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), while Gata2 and Gata3 target genes are overexpressed in GABAergic over glutamatergic precursors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H, M</xref>). To further characterize the identified targets, we compared the numbers of target features associated with the target gene by a positive or negative feature-to-gene expression link (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D, I, N</xref>). The positive links outnumbered negative links by roughly factor of 2, which may reflect transcriptional activator function of the studied TFs, but also the complexity of gene regulation as there could be multiple positive and negative links to each gene. We also calculated the amount of target genes considering their closest linked feature with distance bins of 0-5kb, 5-50kb and &gt;50kb (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E, J, O</xref>). The results showed largely expected distribution where category of longest links contained most target genes. This is likely due to the category being limited by TAD which are often large, yielding considerable amounts of distal regulatory elements for many genes. The calculation of expression variability of the target genes, stratified by the distance to closest selector-bound linked feature, showed that the expression variability in rV2 cell groups was higher for proximal feature-linked Tal1 target genes than for distal feature-linked genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F, K, P</xref>). Thus, regardless of the large amounts of potential distal regulatory elements for many targets, the target genes with proximal selector TF-bound features (0-5 kb) show the most cell type-specific patterns. However, a few cell type-specific genes also appeared to be regulated by distal features, for example at &gt;50 kb from the TSS (<italic>St18</italic>, <italic>Nkx6-1</italic>, <italic>Nhlh1</italic>) or 5-50 kb from TSS (<italic>Zfpm1</italic>, <italic>Lmo1</italic>) in the case of Tal1 targets (Supplementary Table 7, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>). Finally, we also investigated cell type associations of the highly expressed target genes (exp&gt;0.5 (log1p) in GA1-2 or GL1-2 cell groups) by calculating scores against CellMarker 2024 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hu et al., 2023</xref>), revealing clear enrichment of inhibitory interneuron markers among the Tal1, Gata2 and Gata3 target genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G, L, Q</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, we analyzed the overlap of the cell type-specific target gene lists, aiming to find genes regulated by all the GABAergic fate selectors (common target genes) or by any selector TF specifically. No common target genes were found among the glutamatergic neuron specific genes (Supplementary Table 8). The genes commonly regulated by Tal1, Gata2 and Gata3 are exclusively overexpressed in the GABAergic lineage and contain genes comprising the autoregulatory and GATA co-factor networks (<italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Zfpm1</italic>, <italic>Lmo1</italic>). The GABAergic phenotype (<italic>Gad1</italic>, <italic>Gad2</italic>, <italic>Slc32a1</italic>) is regulated by Gata2 and Gata3 (Supplementary Table 8, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Tal1 seems to be involved in the activation or modulation of Notch signaling pathway genes (<italic>Pdzk1ip1</italic>, <italic>Hes5</italic>). Interestingly, Tal1 also interacts with genes specific to rV2 glutamatergic cells (<italic>Lhx4</italic>, <italic>Nkx6-1</italic>), possibly repressing their expression in the developing GABAergic precursors. However, as <italic>Tal1</italic> is expressed already in the common precursors of rV2 lineage, the possibility of the activation of <italic>Lhx4</italic> by Tal1 is not excluded. We also suggest the cross-regulation of GABA-and glutamatergic selector genes in the developing rV2 neuronal precursors: Gata3 may repress the <italic>Vsx2</italic> expression in the GABAergic cells, while Vsx2 may repress <italic>Lmo1</italic> in glutamatergic cells, establishing the initiated cell type-specific gene expression programs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Extensive studies during the past decades have identified several TFs instrumental for neuronal fate decisions in the embryonic brain. How these TFs are regulated and how they guide neuronal differentiation remains less understood. Differentiation of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the ventrolateral r1 is a good model system for TF guided cell differentiation, as in this region the activation of Tal and Gata TFs is both spatially and temporally controlled, and these TFs guide a binary selection between the two alternative cell fates. In this work, we integrated analyses of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and TF occupancy during bifurcation of GABAergic and glutamatergic lineages in the ventrolateral r1. Our results suggest shared mechanisms connecting selector TF activation to developmental processes and demonstrate combinatory functions of Tal1, Gata2 and Gata3 TFs in the GABAergic fate selection.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Mechanisms behind selector TF activation</title>
<p>The homeodomain TF code, established by intercellular communication in the neuronal progenitors, defines the competence of differentiation into specific lineages. In a study of the regulation of cortical neuron development, the binding activities of known cortical patterning genes (<italic>Pax6</italic>, <italic>Emx2</italic>, <italic>Nr2f1</italic>) suggested that these patterning TFs function in a combinatorial and synergistic manner and indeed interact with enhancers of many target genes, including the cortical glutamatergic neuron fate selector gene <italic>Fezf2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ypsilanti et al., 2021</xref>). In ventrolateral r1, the Tal1, Gata2, Gata3 and Vsx2 TFs are activated in the region where the proliferative progenitor cells express the homeodomain TF Nkx6-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Achim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lahti et al., 2016</xref>). Our result suggests that Nkx6-1 directly regulates the spatial expression pattern of the selector TFs important for acquisition of GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron phenotypes. Nkx6-1 is not sufficient for selector TF expression, which is activated only when the proliferative progenitor cells exit the cell cycle and give rise to postmitotic precursors. Our results suggest that TFs E2f1, Ebf1 and Insm1 temporally control the selector TFs and connect their expression to cell-cycle exit. The expression of <italic>E2f1</italic>, <italic>Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Insm1</italic> mRNA is not spatially restricted, but is upregulated in early postmitotic precursors across the whole r1 neuroepithelium. Our results show that the expression of these TFs precedes activation of <italic>Tal1</italic>. E2f1 is best known for its function as a positive regulator of cell cycle progression.</p>
<p>However, there also is evidence for a more complex role for E2f1 in cell cycle regulation. It has been suggested that the effect of E2f1 is dependent on its level of expression, low levels promoting cell cycle progression but elevated levels cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Radhakrishnan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Shats et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Our results are consistent with this observation. <italic>E2f1</italic> is expressed at a low level in the proliferative progenitors, and its expression peaks concomitant to cell cycle exit. Also, Ebf1 and Insm1 have earlier been associated with cell cycle exit and delamination of neuronal progenitors, as well as differentiation and migration of post-mitotic precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Faedo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Garcia-Dominguez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Monaghan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tavano et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the mechanisms that guide cell cycle exit and other cell biological events of neurogenesis may also contribute to activation of neuronal selector TF expression and adoption of the neuronal phenotype.</p>

<title>Selector TFs directly autoregulate themselves and cross-regulate each other</title>
<p>Positive feedback loops are commonly found in the gene regulatory networks involving developmental selector TFs. The positive feedback loops can ensure stable cell fate decisions. Tal and Gata TFs have been shown to autoregulate their own gene expression in hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>). Our results suggest that autoregulation also is a prominent feature of the control of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> expression in the developing brain. This is also supported by loss-of-function studies in the mice, where Gata2 and Gata3 were shown to be dispensable for the initial induction of the <italic>Tal1</italic> expression, but required for its maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lahti et al., 2016</xref>). Reciprocally, Tal1 is required for the maintenance of <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> expression in the embryonic r1. At maintaining their expression by positive feedback, these TFs appear to work together, potentially as a physical complex involving <italic>Lmo1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ono et al., 1998</xref>). In addition to the positive cross-regulation of Tal1, Gata2 and Gata3, these TFs also interact with the genes of glutamatergic lineage-specific TFs, such as <italic>Vsx2</italic> and <italic>Lhx4</italic>, expressed in the glutamatergic precursors. We envision negative feedback allows cross-repression between the Tal1, Gata2, Gata3, Lmo1 network and Vsx2 in the cells where both alternative fate selectors are expressed. Auto- and cross-regulation would ensure robust patterns of selector TF expression, also after the initial inputs for their activation have ceased.</p>
<p>TFs often have context-dependent activating or repressive effects on their targets, and our data on chromatin occupancy cannot distinguish between the two possible outcomes.</p>
<p>However, according to our scRNA-seq and earlier studies in the developing spinal cord V2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Francius et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Karunaratne et al., 2002</xref>), the time of co-expression of <italic>Gata2</italic>/<italic>3</italic> and <italic>Vsx1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> is short. In the rV2, <italic>Vsx1</italic> is expressed in the rV2 common precursors, where <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> expression is still low. Parsimonious explanations would be the negative cross-regulation and differential regulation of Lmo1. Furthermore, Vsx1 has been shown to repress the expression of <italic>Tal1</italic> in the zebrafish spinal cord V2a interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Tal1</italic> overexpression results in reduction of <italic>Vsx2</italic> expression in mouse ventral spinal cord V2a/V2b interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Muroyama et al., 2005</xref>) and the overexpression of <italic>Gata3</italic> also results in the reduction of the number of <italic>Vsx2</italic> expressing cells in the chicken ventral spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Karunaratne et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Targets of the selector TFs</title>
<p>In addition to establishing cell type-specific patterns of selector TF expression, the selector TFs are thought to be responsible for realization of neuronal identities. Our results show that a combinatory function of the selector TFs is important for adopting a GABAergic identity. This is supported by similar fate transformations observed in <italic>Tal1</italic> and <italic>Gata2</italic>/<italic>Gata3</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lahti et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, our results here also highlight differences between Tal1, Gata2 and Gata3 target genes. Most prominently, the activity of Tal1 is not as clearly biased towards genes expressed in the GABAergic branch as are the genes regulated by Gata2 and Gata3. In general, the Tal1, Gata2 and Gata3 selector TFs appear to regulate not only GABAergic subtype–specific genes, but also genes expressed more broadly. This suggests that the function of the fate selectors is not restricted to regulation of the neuronal subtype properties such as the neurotransmitter phenotype, but they also participate in enabling the overall cellular function.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Our work provides insights into the complex gene regulatory networks regulating spatially and temporally controlled cell fate choices in the developing mouse brainstem. In addition to addressing principles of cell differentiation, our work may also contribute to understanding of neuropsychiatric traits and disorders. The anterior brainstem is an important center for behavioral control, and many of the behavioral disorders have a developmental basis. We have shown that, in mice, a failure in development of Tal1- dependent neurons results in severe ADHD-like behavioral changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Morello et al., 2020b</xref>). It is therefore possible that variants in the genomic regions important for gene regulation during brainstem neuron differentiation can lead to altered brain development and predisposition to neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>Caveats of the study</title>
<p>Partly due to technical limitations, some of the TF – chromatin interactions are inferred only based on scATAC-seq footprint. Some of the footprints may signify the binding sites of several different TFs, although mostly of the same TF family, and the exact interacting TF may not be identified. In addition, chromatin interaction is only suggestive of a regulatory function. Our interpretations on the biological processes related to the selector TF expression are based on the known functions of the regulatory TFs. However, many of these functions are unknown.</p>

Subsetting was based on the expression levels of known marker genes (<italic>Ccnb1</italic>, <italic>Nkx6-1</italic>, <italic>Vsx2</italic>, <italic>Slc17a6</italic>, <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gad1</italic>). scATAC-seq clusters 1, 6, 8, 12, 13, 19, 20, 24 and 26 were considered to consist of rV2 lineage. Clusters 13 and 19 were considered to be progenitors and were named PRO1 and PRO2, respectively. Cluster 26 was considered to consist of common precursors and was named CO. Clusters tentatively belonging to common precursors, the GABAergic (1, 6, 20 and 24), and the glutamatergic branches (8 and 12) were further subjected to Seurat <italic>FindSubClusters</italic> to reveal higher resolution cell types. This resulted in the splitting of CO into clusters CO1 and CO2, the GABAergic branch into six clusters named GA1 – GA6, and the glutamatergic branch into five clusters GL1 – GL5.</p>

<title>rV2 cluster correspondence between scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq</title>
<p>To evaluate the overlap of marker genes between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq clusters (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Table 2), we performed a hypergeometric test and visualised the results using a heatmap. The scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq cluster markers were filtered with adj. p-value &lt; 0.05 and top 25 based on log2FC. An intersection of unique gene names was identified between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq objects and its size, N, was used as the total gene pool for the hypergeometric test.</p>

<title>VIA pseudotime analysis</title>
<p>For VIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stassen et al., 2021</xref>) based pseudotime analysis rV2-lineage embeddings coordinates from dimensions 2:30, as well as cluster identities as colors, were passed from Seurat object to Python based VIA. Gene expression levels were used to calculate the pseudotime value in both scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. In the case of scATAC-seq, these were the interpolated values from integration with the scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of scATAC-seq PRO1 was chosen as the root cell population, and for scRNA-seq cluster 22 was chosen as root cell population.</p>

<title>Sequence conservation</title>
<p>Genome conservation data was derived from UCSC database at (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/phastCons60way/">https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/phastCons60way/</ext-link>), which contains compressed phastCons scores for multiple alignments of 59 vertebrate genomes to the mouse mm10 genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>). Nucleotide was considered conserved if phast-score was at least 0.5 (range 0-1). The scATAC-seq features and other selected regions of study were examined for conservation level in comparison to the whole genome, using Fisher’s exact test. Conservation was also calculated for exon and intron regions within all chromosomes to demonstrate the accuracy of this method. For sequence conservation at the TFBS-motif locations, positional weight matrix (PWM) of the motif was used to define weight of each nucleotide based on max probability at that nucleotide location in PWM and that weight was used in calculation of the weighted mean of conservation score over the nucleotides at TFBS locations.</p>

<title>TF-footprinting from scATAC-seq reads</title>
<p>TF-footprinting of scATAC-seq data was performed by using TOBIAS-framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bentsen et al., 2020</xref>) with Snakemake pipeline. As motif collection we used Hocomoco version 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vorontsov et al., 2023</xref>). The motif for INSM1 was added to the Hocomoco v12 collection from Hocomoco v11 collection as it was seen relevant in earlier research. Suitability of mixing motifs from the two versions of the Hocomoco was checked in correspondence with Hocomoco team.</p>
<p>For the purpose of TF-footprinting we combined cell groups as follows to increase signal to noise ratio: PRO1 and PRO2 (PRO1-2), CO1 and CO2 (CO1-2), GA1 and GA2 (GA1-2), GA3 and GA4 (GA3-4), GA5 and GA6 (GA5-6), GL1 and GL2 (GL1-2), GL3 and GL4 (GL3-4). GL5 was kept as is. E12R1 BAM files were merged, and PCR duplicates removed with Picard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>).

<title>RNAscope® mRNA in situ hybridization</title>
<p>E12.5 wildtype (NMRI) mouse embryos were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#P6148) in 1× PBS for 36 hours at room temperature. The fixed brains were embedded in paraffin (Histosec™ Pastilles (without DMSO, Cat#115161)), and sectioned on Leica microtome (Leica RM2255) at 5 µm. RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 (ACD, Cat#323270) was used to detect RNA transcripts. The paraffin sections were deparaffinized in xylene and ethanol series, treated with RNAscope Hydrogen Peroxide (ACD, Cat#322381) for 10 minutes, and subjected to antigen retrieval in 1× Target Retrieval Solution (ACD, Cat#322000) for 15 minutes at 99–102°C. After rinsing and dehydration, hydrophobic barriers were drawn using an ImmEdge Pen (ACD, Cat#310018), and slides were dried for 30 minutes or overnight. Protease Plus (ACD, Cat#322381) was applied for 30 minutes at 40°C, followed by hybridization of probes at 40°C for 2 hours.</p>

Positive (ACD, Cat#320881) and negative (ACD, Cat#320871) control probes were included. C1 probes were used undiluted; C2, C3, and C4 probes were diluted 1:50 in C1 probe or Probe Diluent (ACD, Cat#300041). Slides were washed in Wash Buffer (ACD, Cat#310091) and stored in 5× saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer overnight. Amplification was conducted using AMP1, AMP2, and AMP3 reagents (30 min, 30 min, 15 min) at 40°C. Signal detection was performed with HRP channels (C1, C2, C3) and TSA Vivid Fluorophores: TSA 520 (ACD, Cat#323271),TSA 570 (ACD, Cat#323272), and TSA 650 (ACD, Cat#323273), diluted 1:1500 in RNAscope Multiplex TSA Buffer (ACD, Cat#322809). Each HRP step included blocking and washing. Slides were counterstained with DAPI (30 seconds), mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Thermo Fisher, Cat#P36934), and imaged using a Zeiss AxioImager 2 microscope with Apotome 2 structured illumination.

The trained model was then used to segment the analysis images and to return ROIs as ImageJ ROI coordinates. Regions of interest (ROIs) were imported into R for analysis. Fluorescence signals of the three channels in each image were quantified separately. The ventricular surface (VS) was defined manually using three points and calculating circle boundary passing these points, and the distances of individual cells from the VS were calculated in units of average cell diameter (avg. across all images). Fluorescence signals were filtered to remove background noise using a quantile threshold of 0.25. Raw fluorescence intensity was measured as the number of fluorescence dots per cell. To analyze patterns across biological replicates, fluorescence data from three independent experiments were included in the same aggregate analysis. Fluorescence intensities were normalized across biological replicates for each channel to account for variations in signal strength and aligned to ensure uniform spatial scaling. Aggregated data were visualized by calculating a smoothed sliding mean (window size=12) fluorescence trend for each channel.</p>

Embryos from different E12.5 mouse litters were used as biological replicates in CUT&amp;Tag. The samples were processed following the CUT&amp;Tag-It Assay Kit protocol (Active Motif, cat # 53170). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Gata2 (Abcam, ab109241), rabbit anti-Gata3 (Boster, M00593), rabbit anti-Tal1 (Abcam, ab75739), rabbit anti-Vsx2 (Proteintech, 25825-1-AP-20), rabbit anti-Ebf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boller et al., 2016</xref>), rabbit anti-Insm1 (Nordic BioSite, ASJ-IO4DE3-50), rabbit anti-Tead2 (Biorbyt, orb382464), rabbit anti-IgG (Cell Signalling, 66362), and rabbit anti-H3K4me3 (Cell Signalling, 9751).

<title>Comparison of TF binding detected by CUT&amp;Tag and Footprinting</title>
<p>To quantify how CUT&amp;Tag and footprinting corroborate TF binding we performed an analysis similar to established one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Eastman et al., 2025</xref>). Per each TF with CUT&amp;Tag data we calculated a) Total number of CUT&amp;Tag consensus peaks; b) Total number of bound TFBS; c) Percentage of CUT&amp;Tag consensus peaks overlapping bound TFBS; d) Percentage of bound TFBS overlapping CUT&amp;Tag consensus peak (Supplementary Table 6). TFBS in question was considered &quot;bound&quot; if it had a positive footprint in at least one of the studied cell groups (PRO1_2, CO1_2, GA1_2, GA3_4, GA5_6, GL1_2, GL3_4, GL5).

<title>Analysis of the TFs interacting with the selector gene cCREs</title>
<p>To search for regulators of selector genes, we first searched for TFs per each selector gene per cell group with conditions as follows:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The TF has a footprint in any of the cCREs linked to the selector gene with LinkPeaks abs(z-score)&gt;2 and p-value&lt;0.05, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The weighted mean of the conservation of the motif location is &gt;0.5, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The TF is expressed &gt; 1.2 (log1p) on average in the cell group in question.</p></list-item>
</list>
Defining the common regulators between the selector genes was done by comparison of the regulators found for individual selectors based on their intersects. Statistical significance levels reported for individual regulators are defined as minimum p-value for cCRE to gene linkage for each regulator per each selector gene and maximum p-value over all selectors in the intersect. To assess whether the observed overlap in regulators among the three selector genes was greater than expected by chance, we performed a permutation-based test. First, we determined the actual set of regulators for each of the three selector genes and calculated the size of their intersection. Next, to construct a null model, we repeatedly and randomly selected three sets of regulators (of the same sizes as the original sets) from the complete universe of candidate regulators, recalculating the intersection size each time. With 1 000 000 iterations we obtained a distribution of intersection sizes expected under random selection.</p>
<p>The empirical p-value was then estimated as the proportion of these randomized trials in which the intersection size was equal to or larger than the observed intersection. If no randomized trial matched or exceeded the observed intersection size, we reported the p-value as less than an upper bound (e.g., &lt;1/(N+1)), reflecting the rarity of the observed overlap under the assumed null hypothesis.</p>

<p>To uncover general functional roles of the selector genes at the bifurcation point we conducted a gene set enrichment (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mootha et al., 2003</xref>) analysis of the putative target genes of Tal1, Gata2, Gata3 and Vsx2 over the axis of avg_log2FC of mouse genes in between GA1-2 and GL1-2. For the GSEA axis only genes having an adjusted p-value &lt;0.01 in the DEG test (Seurat FindMarkers with Wilcoxon) and an expression proportion of at least 0.1 in either group were taken into account.</p>
<p>Selector TF target genes were defined according to following conditions:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The selector gene (TF) motif is associated with a footprint in either GA1-2 or GL1-2, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the motif situates in a scATAC-seq feature which is linked to the target gene with LinkPeaks abs(z-score)&gt;2 and p-value&lt;0.01, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the weighted mean of the conservation of the motif location is &gt;0.5, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>there is a CUT&amp;Tag peak of the selector gene overlapping the feature.</p></list-item>
</list>
As our GSEA axis should be considered relevant from both ends, one end signifying targets overexpressed in GA1-2 and another in GL1-2, we additionally looked for the leading edge genes from both ends (traditionally called leading and trailing edges in GSEA analysis). We defined GA1-2 leading edge genes to be the ones before the GSEA enrichment score gains its maximum, and GL1-2 leading edge genes to be ones after the GSEA enrichment score gains its minimum.</p>

<p>The objectives of this research are to understand how key selector transcription factors, Tal1, Gata2, Gata3, determine GABAergic vs glutamatergic neuron fate from the rhombencephalic V2 precursor domain and how their spatiotemporal expression is controlled by upstream regulators. Toward these goals, the authors have generated an impressive array of scRNA, scATAC-seq, and CUT&amp;Tag datasets obtained from dissociated E12.5 ventral R1 dissections. The rV2 was subsetted with well-known markers. The authors use an extensive set of computational approaches to identify temporal patterns of chromatin accessibility, TF motif binding activities (footprints), gene expression and regulatory motifs at the different selector gene loci. These analyses are used to predict upstream regulators, candidate accessible CREs, and DNA binding motifs through which the selectors may be controlled in rV2 by upstream regulators. Further analyses predict auto- and cross-regulatory interactions for maintenance of selector expression and the downstream effectors of alternative transmitter identities controlled by the selectors. The authors have achieved their aim of making predictions about upstream and downstream selector TF regulatory networks; their conclusions and predictions are largely well supported. The work clearly illustrates the daunting gene regulatory complexity likely at play in controlling rV2 transmitter fate.</p>
<p>This is data-rich study and a valuable resource for future hypothesis testing, through perturbation approaches, of the many putative regulators and motifs identified in the study. The strengths of this work are the overall high quality of the datasets and in depth analyses. Through its comprehensive data and predictions, it is likely to have impact in advancing the understanding of GABAergic vs glutamatergic neuron fate decisions. The authors present a &quot;simplified&quot; gene regulatory model. However, the model does not illustrate the complexity of potential stage-specific upstream TF interactions with Tal1 and Vsx2 selector genes uncovered in TF footprinting analyses. While this seems nearly impossible to achieve given the plethora of potential functional TF inputs, the authors should consider assembling a focussed model by selectively illustrating the most robust, evidence-backed upstream TF input predictions, which are considered the strongest candidates for future hypothesis-driven perturbation experiments. It seems Insm1, Sox4, E2f1, Ebf1 and Tead2 TFs might be the strongest upstream candidates for future testing of Tal1 activation given the extensive analyses of their spatiotemporal expression patterns relative to Tal1, presented in Fig 4.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors seek to discover putative gene regulatory interactions underlying the lineage bifurcation process of neural progenitor cells in the embryonic mouse anterior brainstem into GABAergic and glutamatergic neuronal subtypes. The authors analyze single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq datasets derived from the ventral rhombomere 1 of embryonic mouse brainstems to annotate cell types and make predictions or where TFs bind upstream and downstream of the effector TFs using computational methods. They add data on the genomic distributions of some of the key transcription factors, and layer these onto the single cell data to develop a model of the transcription factors interactions that define this fate choice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a well-defined fate decision point from brainstem progenitors that can make two very different kinds of neurons. They already know the key TFs for selecting the neuronal type from genetic studies, so they focus their gene regulatory analysis on the mechanisms that are immediately upstream and downstream of these key factors. The authors use a combination of single-cell and bulk sequencing data, prediction and validation, and computation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study does not go as far as to experimentally test the transcription factor network from their model.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The objective of this research is to understand how the expression of key selector transcription factors, Tal1, Gata2, Gata3, involved in GABAergic vs glutamatergic neuron fate from a single anterior hindbrain progenitor domain is transcriptionally controlled. With suitable scRNAseq, scATAC-seq, CUT&amp;TAG, and footprinting datasets, the authors use an extensive set of computational approaches to identify putative regulatory elements and upstream transcription factors that may control selector TF expression. This data-rich study will be a valuable resource for future hypothesis testing, through perturbation approaches, of the many putative regulators identified in the study. The data are displayed in some of the main and supplemental figures in a way that makes it difficult to appreciate and understand the authors' presentation and interpretation of the data in the Results narrative. Primary images used for studying the timing and coexpression of putative upstream regulators, Insm1, E2f1, Ebf1, and Tead2 with Tal1 are difficult to interpret and do not convincingly support the authors' conclusions. There appears to be little overlap in the fluorescent labeling, and it is not clear whether the signals are located in the cell soma nucleus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength is that it is a data-rich compilation of putative upstream regulators of selector TFs that control GABAergic vs glutamatergic neuron fates in the brainstem. This resource now enables future perturbation-based hypothesis testing of the gene regulatory networks that help to build brain circuitry.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #1 for the thoughtful assessment and recognition of the extensive datasets and computational approaches employed in our study. We appreciate the acknowledgment that our efforts in compiling data-rich resources for identifying putative regulators of key selector transcription factors (TFs)—<italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, and <italic>Gata3</italic>—are valuable for future hypothesis-driven research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the findings could be better displayed and discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the concerns raised regarding the clarity and interpretability of certain figures, particularly those related to expression analyses of candidate upstream regulators such as Insm1, E2f1, Ebf1, and Tead2 in relation to <italic>Tal1</italic>. We agree that clearer visualization and improved annotation of fluorescence signals are crucial to accurately support our conclusions. In our revised manuscript, we will enhance image clarity and clearly indicate sites of co-expression for Tal1 and its putative regulators, ensuring the results are more readily interpretable. Additionally, we will expand explanatory narratives within the figure legends to better align the figures with the results section.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript, the authors seek to discover putative gene regulatory interactions underlying the lineage bifurcation process of neural progenitor cells in the embryonic mouse anterior brainstem into GABAergic and glutamatergic neuronal subtypes. The authors analyze single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq datasets derived from the ventral rhombomere 1 of embryonic mouse brainstems to annotate cell types and make predictions or where TFs bind upstream and downstream of the effector TFs using computational methods. They add data on the genomic distributions of some of the key transcription factors and layer these onto the single-cell data to get a sense of the transcriptional dynamics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a well-defined fate decision point from brainstem progenitors that can make two very different kinds of neurons. They already know the key TFs for selecting the neuronal type from genetic studies, so they focus their gene regulatory analysis squarely on the mechanisms that are immediately upstream and downstream of these key factors. The authors use a combination of single-cell and bulk sequencing data, prediction and validation, and computation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We also appreciate the thoughtful comments from Reviewer #2, highlighting the strengths of our approach in elucidating gene regulatory interactions that govern neuronal fate decisions in the embryonic mouse brainstem. We are pleased that our focus on a critical cell-fate decision point and the integration of diverse data modalities, combined with computational analyses, has been recognized as a key strength.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study generates a lot of data about transcription factor binding sites, both predicted and validated, but the data are substantially descriptive. It remains challenging to understand how the integration of all these different TFs works together to switch terminal programs on and off.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer #2 correctly points out that while our study provides extensive data on predicted and validated transcription factor binding sites, clearly illustrating how these factors collectively interact to regulate terminal neuronal differentiation programs remains challenging. We acknowledge the inherently descriptive nature of the current interpretation of our combined datasets.</p>
<p>In our revision, we will clarify how the different data types support and corroborate one another, highlighting what we consider the most reliable observations of TF activity. Additionally, we will revise the discussion to address the challenges associated with interpreting the highly complex networks of interactions within the gene regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>We sincerely thank both reviewers for their constructive feedback, which we believe will significantly enhance the quality and accessibility of our manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The results in Figure 3 and several associated supplements are mainly a description/inventory of putative CREs some of which are backed to some extent by previous transgenic studies. But given the way the authors chose to display the transgenic data in the Supplements, it is difficult to fully appreciate how well the transgenic data provide functional support. Take, for example, the Tal +40kb feature that maps to a midbrain enhancer: where exactly does +40kb map to the enhancer region? Is Tal +40kb really about 1kb long? The legend in Supplemental Figure 6 makes it difficult to interpret the bar charts; what is the meaning of: features not linked to gene -Enh? Some of the authors' claims are not readily evident or are inscrutable. For example, Tal locus features accessible in all cell groups are not evident (Fig 2A,B). Other cCREs are said to closely correlate with selector expression for example, Tal +.7kb and +40kb. However, inspection of the data seems to indicate that the two cCREs have very different dynamics and only +40kb seems to correlate with the expression track above it. Some features are described redundantly such as the Gata2 +22 kb, +25.3 kb, and +32.8 kb cCREs above and below the Gata3 cCRE. What is meant by: The feature is accessible at 3' position early, and gains accessibility at 5' positions ... Detailed feature analysis later indicated the binding of Nkx6-1 and Ascl1 that are expressed in the rV2 neuronal progenitors, at 3' positions, and binding of Insm1 and Tal1 TFs that are activated in early precursors, at 5' positions (Figure 3C).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To allow easier assessment of the overlap of the features described in this study in reference to the transgenic studies, we have added further information about the scATAC features, cCREs and previously published enhancers, as well as visual schematics of the feature-enhancer overlaps in the Supplementary table 4. The Supplementary Table 4 column contents are also now explained in detail in the table legend (under the table). We hope those changes make the feature descriptions clearer. To answer the reviewer's question about the Tal1+40kb enhancer, the length of the published enhancer element is 685 bp and the overlapping scATAC feature length is 2067 bp (Supplementary Table 3, sheet <italic>Tal1</italic>, row 103).</p>
<p>The legend and the chart labelling in the Supplementary Figure 5 (formerly Supplementary figure 6) have been elaborated, and the shown categories explained more clearly.</p>
<p>Regarding the features at the Tal1 locus, the text has been revised and the references to the features accessible in all cell groups were removed. These features showed differences in the intensity of signal but were accessible in all cell groups. As the accessibility of these features does not correlate with <italic>Tal1</italic> expression, they are of less interest in the context of this paper.</p>
<p>The gain in accessibility of the +0.7kb and +40 kb features correlates with the onset of Tal1 RNA expression. This is now more clearly stated in the text, as &quot; For example, the gain in the accessibility of Tal1 cCREs at +0.7 and +40 kb correlated temporally with the expression of Tal1 mRNA (Figure 2B), strongly increasing in the earliest GABAergic precursors (GA1) and maintained at a lower level in the more mature GABAergic precursor groups (GA2-GA6), &quot; (Results, page 4). The reviewer is right that the later dynamics of the +0.7 and +40 cCREs differ and this is now stated more clearly in the text (Results, page 5, last chapter).</p>
<p>The repetition in the description of the <italic>Gata2</italic> +22 kb, +25.3 kb, and +32.8 kb cCREs has been removed.</p>
<p>The Tal1 +23 kb cCRE showed within-feature differences in accessibility signal. This is explained in the text on page 5, referring to the relevant figure 2A, showing the accessibility or scATAC signal in cell groups and the features labelled below, and 3C, showing the location of the Nkx6-1 and Ascl1 binding sites in this feature: &quot;The Tal1 +23 kb cCRE contained two scATAC-seq peaks, having temporally different patterns of accessibility. The feature is accessible at 3' position early, and gains accessibility at 5' positions concomitant with GABAergic differentiation (Figure 2A, accessibility). Detailed feature analysis later indicated that the 3' end of this feature contains binding sites of Nkx6-1 and Ascl1 that are expressed in the rV2 neuronal progenitors, while the 5' end contains TF binding sites of Insm1 and Tal1 TFs that are activated in early precursors (described below, see Figure 3C).&quot;</p>

<p>(2) Supplementary Figure 3 is not presented in the Results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Essential parts of previous Supplementary Figure 3 have been incorporated into the Figure 4 and the previous Supplementary Figure omitted.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The significance of Figure 3 and the many related supplements is difficult to understand. A large number of footprints with wide-ranging scores, many very weak or unbound, are displayed in the various temporal cell groups in different epigenomic regions of Tal1 and Vsx2. The footprints for GA1 and Ga2 are combined despite Tal1 showing stronger expression in GA1 and stronger accessibility (Figure 2). Many possibilities are outlined in the Results for how the many different kinds of motifs in the cCREs might bind particular TFs to control downstream TF expression, but no experiments are performed to test any of the possibilities. How well do the TOBIAS footprints align with C&amp;T peaks? How was C&amp;T used to validate footprints? Are Gata2, 3, and Vsx2 known to control Tal1 expression from perturbation experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 3 and related supplements present examples of the primary data and summarise the results of comprehensive analysis. The methods of identifying the selector TF regulatory features and the regulators are described in the Methods (Materials and Methods page 16). Briefly, the correlation between feature accessibility and selector TF RNA expression (assessed by the LinkPeaks score and p-value) were used to select features shown in the Figure 3.</p>
<p>We are aware of differences in <italic>Tal1</italic> expression and accessibility between GA1 and GA2. However, number of cells in GA2 was not high enough for reliable footprint calculations and therefore we opted for combining related groups throughout the rV2 lineage for footprinting.</p>
<p>As suggested, CUT&amp;Tag could be used to validate the footprinting results with some restrictions. In the revised manuscript, we included analysis of CUT&amp;Tag peak location and footprints similarly to an earlier study (Eastman et al. 2025). In summary, we analysed whether CUT&amp;Tag peaks overlap locations in which footprinting was also recognized and vice versa. Per each TF with CUT&amp;Tag data we calculated a) Total number of CUT&amp;Tag consensus peaks b) Total number of bound TFBS (footprints) c) Percentage of CUT&amp;Tag overlapping bound TFBS d) Percentage of bound TFBS overlapping CUT&amp;Tag. These results are shown in Supplementary Table 6 and in Supplementary figure 11 with analysis described in Methods (Materials and Methods, page 19). There is considerable overlap between CUT&amp;Tag peaks and bound footprints, comparable to one shown in Eastman et al. 2025. However, these two methods are not assumed to be completely matching for several reasons: binding by related/redundant TFs, antigen masking in the TF complex, chromatin association without DNA binding, etc. In addition, some CUT&amp;Tag peaks with unbound footprints could arise from non-rV2 cells that were part of the bulk CUT&amp;Tag analysis but not of the scATAC footprint analysis.</p>
<p>The evidence for cross-regulation of selector genes and the regulation of <italic>Tal1</italic> by <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> is now discussed (Discussion, chapter Selector TFs directly autoregulate themselves and cross-regulate each other, page 12-13). The regulation of <italic>Tal1</italic> expression by Vsx2 has, to our knowledge, not been earlier studied.</p>

<p>(4) Figure 4 findings are problematic as the primary images seem uninterpretable and unconvincing in supporting the authors' claims. There is a lack of clear evidence in support of TF coexpression and that their expression precedes Tal1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 4 has been entirely redrawn with higher resolution images and a more logical layout. In the revised Figure 4, only the most relevant ISH images are shown and arrowheads are added showing the colocalization of the mRNA in the cell cytoplasm. Next to the plots of RNA expression along the apical-basal axis of r1, an explanatory image of the quantification process is added (Figure 4D).</p>

<p>(5) What was gained from also performing ChromVAR other than finding more potential regulators and do the results of the two kinds of analyses corroborate one another? What is a dual GATA:TAL BS?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our motivation for ChromVAR analysis is now more clearly stated in the text (Results, page 9): “In addition to the regulatory elements of GABAergic fate selectors, we wanted to understand the genome-wide TF activity during rV2 neuron differentiation. To this aim we applied ChromVAR (Schep et al., 2017)&quot; Also, further explanation about the Tal1and Gata binding sites has been added in this chapter (Results, page 9).</p>
<p>The dual GATA:Tal BS (TAL1.H12CORE.0.P.B) is a 19-bp motif that consists of an E-box and GATA sequence, and is likely bound by heteromeric Gata2-Tal1 TF complex, but may also be bound by Gata2, Gata3 or Tal1 TFs separately. The other TFBSs of Tal1 contain a strong E-box motif and showed either a lower activity (TAL1.H12CORE.1.P.B) or an earlier peak of activity in common precursors with a decline after differentiation (TAL1.H12CORE.2.P.B) (Results, page 9).</p>

<p>(6) The way the data are displayed it is difficult to see how the C&amp;T confirmed the binding of Ebf1 and Insm1, Tal1, Gata2, and Gata3 (Supplementary Figures 9-11). Are there strong footprints (scores) centered at these peaks? One can't assess this with the way the displays are organized in Figure 3. What is the importance of the H3K4me3 C&amp;T? Replicate consistency, while very strong for some TFs, seems low for other TFs, e.g. Vsx2 C&amp;T on Tal1 and Gata2. The overlaps do not appear very strong in Supplementary Figure 10. Panels are not letter labeled.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added an analysis of footprint locations within the CUT&amp;Tag peaks (Supplementary Figure 11). The Figure shows that the footprints are enriched at the middle regions of the CUT&amp;Tag peaks, which is expected if TF binding at the footprinted TFBS site was causative for the CUT&amp;Tag peaks.</p>
<p>The aim of the Supplementary Figures 9-11 (Supplementary Figures 8-10 in the revised manuscript) was to show the quality and replicability of the CUT&amp;Tag.</p>
<p>The anti-H3K4me3 antibody, as well as the anti-IgG antibody, was used in CUT&amp;Tag as part of experiment technical controls. A strong CUT&amp;Tag signal was detected in all our CUT&amp;Tag experiments with H3K4me3. The H3K4me3 signal was not used in downstream analyses.</p>
<p>We have now labelled the H3K4me3 data more clearly as &quot;positive controls&quot; in the Supplementary Figure 8. The control samples are shown only on Supplementary Figure 8 and not in the revised Supplementary Figure 10, to avoid repetition. The corresponding figure legends have been modified accordingly.</p>
<p>To show replicate consistency, the genome view showing the Vsx2 CUT&amp;Tag signal at <italic>Gata2</italic> gene has been replaced by a more representative region (Supplementary Figure 8, Vsx2). The Vsx2 CUT&amp;Tag signal at the <italic>Gata2</italic> locus is weak, explaining why the replicability may have seemed low based on that example.</p>
<p>Panel labelling is added on Supplementary Figures S8, S9, S10.</p>

<p>(7) It would be illuminating to present 1-2 detailed examples of specific target genes fulfilling the multiple criteria outlined in Methods and Figure 6A.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors perform CUT&amp;Tag to ask whether Tal1 and other TFs indeed bind putative CREs computed. However, it is unclear whether some of the antibodies (such as Gata3, Vsx2, Insm1, Tead2, Ebf1) used are knock-out validated for CUT&amp;Tag or a similar type of assay such as ChIP-seq and therefore whether the peaks called are specific. The authors should either provide specificity data for these or a reference that has these data. The Vsx2 signal in Figure S9 looks particularly unconvincing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Information about the target specificity of the antibodies can be found in previous studies or in the product information. The references to the studies have been now added in the Methods (Materials and Methods, CUT&amp;Tag, pages 18-19). Some of the antibodies are indeed not yet validated for ChIP-seq, Cut-and-run or CUT&amp;Tag. This is now clearly stated in the Materials and Methods (page 19): &quot;The anti-Ebf1, anti-Tal1, anti-IgG and anti-H3K4me3 antibodies were tested on Cut-and-Run or ChIP-seq previously (Boller et al., 2016b; Courtial et al., 2012) and Cell Signalling product information). The anti-Gata2 and anti-Gata3 antibodies are ChIP-validated ((Ahluwalia et al., 2020a) and Abcam product information). There are no previous results on ChIP, ChIP-seq or CUT&amp;Tag with the anti-Insm1, anti-Tead2 and anti-Vsx2 antibodies used here. The specificity and nuclear localization have been demonstrated in immunohistochemistry with anti-Vsx2 (Ahluwalia et al., 2020b) and anti-Tead2 (Biorbyt product information). We observed good correlation between replicates with anti-Insm1, similar to all antibodies used here, but its specificity to target was not specifically tested&quot;. We admit that specificity testing with knockout samples would increase confidence in our data. However, we have observed robust signals and good replicability in the CUT&amp;Tag for the antibodies shown here.</p>
<p>Vsx2 CUT&amp;Tag signal at the loci previously shown in Supplementary Figure S9 (now Supplementary Figure 8) is weak, explaining why the replicability may seem low based on those examples. The genome view showing the Vsx2 CUT&amp;Tag signal at Gata2 gene locus in Supplementary Figure 8 (previously Supplementary figure 9) has now been replaced by a view of Vsx2 locus that is more representative of the signal.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It is unclear why the authors chose to focus on the transcription factor genes described in line 626 as opposed to the many other putative TFs described in Figure 3/Supplementary Figure 8. This is the major challenge of the paper - the authors are trying to tell a very targeted story but they show a lot of different names of TFs and it is hard to follow which are most important.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the process of selection of the genes of interest is not always transparent. We are aware that interpretations of a paper are based on the known functions of the putative regulatory TFs, however additional aspects of regulation could be revealed even if the biological functions of all the TFs were known. This is now stated in the Discussion “Caveats of the study” chapter. It would be relevant to study all identified candidate genes, but as often is the case, our possibilities were limited by the availability of materials (probes, antibodies), time, and financial resources. In the revised manuscript, we now briefly describe the biological processes related to the selected candidate regulatory TFs of the <italic>Tal1</italic> gene (Results, page 8, &quot;Pattern of expression of the putative regulators of <italic>Tal1</italic> in the r1&quot;). We hope this justifies the focus on them in our RNA co-expression analysis. The TFs analysed by RNAscope ISH are examples, which demonstrate alignment of the tissue expression patterns with the scRNA-seq data, suggesting that the dynamics of gene expression detected by scRNA-seq generally reflects the pattern of expression in the developing brainstem.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) How is the RNA expression level in Figure 5B and 4D-L computed? These are the clusters defined by scATAC-seq. Is this an inferred RNA expression? This should be made more clear in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The charts in Figures 5B and 4G,H,I show inferred RNA expression. The Y-axis labels have now been corrected and include the term inferred’. RNA expression in the scATAC-seq cell clusters is inferred from the scRNA-seq cells after the integration of the datasets.</p>

<p>(4) The convergence of the GABA TFs on a common set of target genes reminds me of a nice study from the Rubenstein lab PMID: 34921112 that looked at a set of TFs in cortical progenitors. This might be a good comparison study for the authors to use as a model to discuss the convergence data.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this article to our attention. The article is now discussed in the manuscript (Discussion, page 11).</p>

<p>(5) The data in Figure 4, the in-situ figure, needs significant work. First, the images especially B, F, and J appear to be of quite low resolution, so they are hard to see. It is unclear exactly what is being graphed in C, G, and K and it does not seem to match the text of the results section. Perhaps better labeling of the figure and a more thorough description will make it clear. It is not clear how D, H, and L were supposed to relate to the images - presumably, this is a case where cell type is spatially organized, but this was unclear in the text if this is known and it needs to be more clearly described. Overall, as currently presented this figure does not support the descriptions and conclusions in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 4 has been entirely redrawn with higher resolution images and more logical layout. In the revised Figure 4, the ISH data and the quantification plots are better presented; arrows showing the colocalization of the mRNA in the cell cytoplasm were added; and an explanatory image of the quantification process is added on (D).</p>

<p>Minor points</p>
<p>(1) Helpful if the authors include scATAC-seq coverage plots for neuronal subtype markers in Figure 1/S1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are unfortunately uncertain what is meant with this request. Subtype markers in Figure 1/S1 scATAC-seq based clusters are shown from inferred RNA expression, and therefore these marker expression plots do not have any coverage information available.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors in line 429 mention the testing of features within TADs. They should make it clear in the main text (although tadmap is mentioned in the methods) that this is a prediction made by aggregating HiC datasets.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Good point and that this detail has been added to both page 3 and 16.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors should include a table with the phastcons output described between lines 511 and 521 in the main or supplementary figures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now clarified int the text that we did not recalculate any phastcons results, we merely used already published and available conservation score per nucleotide as provided by the original authors (Siepel et al. 2005). (Results, page 5: revised text is &quot; To that aim, we used nucleotide conservation scores from UCSC (Siepel et al., 2005). We overlaid conservation information and scATAC-seq features to both validate feature definition as well as to provide corroborating evidence to recognize cCRE elements.&quot;)</p>

<p>Additional corrections in figures</p>
<p>Figure 6 D,I,N had wrong y-axis scale. It has been corrected, though it does not have an effect on the interpretation of the data as Pos.link and Neg.link counts were compared to each other’s (ratio).</p>
<p>On Figure 2B, the heatmap labels were shifted making it difficult to identify the feature name per row. This is now corrected.</p>
