<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Skeletal muscle is a unique tissue composed of elongated multinucleated cells known as myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Grefte et al. 2007</xref>). In response to injury, skeletal muscle has the capacity to repair the injured myofiber in a process called muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen and Shan 2019</xref>). Muscle regeneration is dependent on the resident muscle stem cells, known as satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Relaix and Zammit 2012</xref>). Satellite cells are located between the myofiber plasma membrane and the basement membrane (BM), the latter of which is a layer of extracellular matrix material composed of collagen, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Seale et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Webster et al. 2016</xref>). Satellite cells express high levels of Pax7, which is a paired domain-containing transcription factor, and remain quiescent under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Le Grand and Rudnicki 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheung and Rando 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Yin et al. 2013</xref>). Upon injury, satellite cells are activated and then proliferate and differentiate into fusion-competent muscle cells. Once the satellite cell-derived muscle cells, which will be referred to as SCMs, fill the space within the BM remnants, known as ghost fibers, they would fuse with each other and/or with injured myofibers to regenerate the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Le Grand and Rudnicki 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lepper et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheung and Rando 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Yin et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Webster et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Collins et al. 2024</xref>). SCM fusion occurs rapidly between day 3.5 to 5 post injury (dpi) and persists till ∼dpi 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Collins et al. 2024</xref>). Despite the importance of SCM fusion in skeletal muscle regeneration, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying SCM fusion during muscle regeneration remain poorly understood. To date, only two proteins, the bi-partite myoblast fusogens myomaker (MymK) and myomixer (MymX)/myomerger/minion, have been shown to be required for SCM fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Millay et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bi et al. 2018</xref>). Identifying additional components of the SCM fusion machinery will not only facilitate our understanding of muscle regeneration but also provide more options to enhance muscle regeneration upon injury.</p>
<p>The Arp2/3 complex and its actin nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs), Neural Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (N-WASP) and WASP-family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE), are known to generate branched actin filaments and have been shown to play a role in myoblast fusion during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Richardson et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gruenbaum-Cohen et al. 2012</xref>). These actin regulators are required for generating invasive protrusions to promote plasma membrane juxtaposition and fusion at the fusogenic synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sens et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Luo et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lu et al. 2023</xref>). However, their potential function in muscle regeneration is completely unknown. Here, using satellite cell- specific knockout (KO) mice of Arp2/3 and NPFs, we show that branched actin polymerization is indispensable for muscle regeneration. In particular, Arp2/3 and NPFs are required for the formation of invasive protrusions during SCM fusion, but not satellite cell proliferation, differentiation or migration. Thus, we have identified new components of the SCM fusion machinery and demonstrated a critical function of branched actin- propelled invasive protrusions in skeletal muscle regeneration.</p>

<title>The redistribution of muscle cells and macrophages at the early stage of skeletal muscle regeneration</title>
<p>To examine the behavior of muscle cells during fusion after injury, we injured the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles by BaCl<sub>2</sub> injection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and labeled the differentiating SCMs using anti-NCAM, a cell adhesion molecule highly expressed in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Capkovic et al. 2008</xref>), and ghost fibers using anti-Laminin, a major component of the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Webster et al. 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Since a previous study showed that macrophages are present in the ghost fiber to clear the necrotic debris of the damaged myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Collins et al. 2024</xref>), we also labeled macrophages with anti-MAC-2, a member of lectin family expressed on macrophage cell-surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hohsfield et al. 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>At dpi 2.5, the differentiating SCMs and macrophages were two major cell populations residing within the ghost fibers, occupying 47.8% and 39.9% of the total volume, respectively. By dpi 3.5, SCMs occupied 98.2% of the ghost fiber volume, whereas macrophages only accounted for 1.8% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), with most of the macrophages residing in the interstitial space outside of the ghost fibers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). This would account for the high overall number of macrophages in the regenerating muscle tissues in this time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Collins et al. 2024</xref>). How macrophages extravasated from the ghost fibers to the interstitial space remained an interesting question. Strikingly, our confocal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and Supplementary Video 1 &amp; 2) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) analyses of regenerating TA muscles at dpi 3 revealed narrow openings (∼1 μm diameter) on the BM of ghost fibers through which macrophages (MAC-2<sup>+</sup>) with a ∼20 μm diameter (as a round cell) were traversing, suggesting that the large macrophages squeeze through tiny openings on the BM to enter and/or escape the ghost fibers. The ability of macrophages to traverse the ghost fibers in and out makes it possible to spatiotemporally coordinate the ghost fiber occupancy by macrophages and SCMs during muscle regeneration.</p>

<title>Branched actin polymerization is required for mammalian skeletal muscle regeneration</title>
<p>Given that the Arp2/3 complex-mediated branched actin polymerization is required for myoblast fusion during mouse embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lu et al. 2023</xref>), we asked whether the Arp2/3 complex is required for skeletal muscle regeneration in adults. Toward this end, we generated satellite cell-specific, tamoxifen-inducible knockout mice for ArpC2, a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Goley and Welch 2006</xref>), by breeding <italic>Pax7</italic><sup>CreERT2</sup> with <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lepper et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wang et al. 2016</xref>).

The littermates of the <italic>Pax7</italic><sup>CreERT2</sup> male mice without the floxed <italic>ArpC2</italic> allele were used as wild-type controls. To induce genetic deletion of <italic>ArpC2</italic> in satellites, we performed intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen to the control and mutant mice every two days over a period of ten days. satellite cell-specific <italic>ArpC2</italic> KO did not affect TA muscle weight and size in uninjured muscle (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A-S1C</xref>). However, muscle injury by BaCl<sub>2</sub> resulted in a significant decrease (87.7 ± 2.0%) in the cross-section area (CSA) of regenerated myofibers in <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice compared to their littermate controls at dpi 14 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-3C</xref>) and dpi 28 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref> and S3B). Consistent with this, the frequency distribution of CSA displayed a significant shift toward the small size in the mutant mice (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the Arp2/3-mediated branched actin polymerization is essential for skeletal muscle regeneration.</p>

<title>Branched actin polymerization is required for SCM fusion</title>
<p>To pinpoint the specific step of skeletal muscle regeneration – satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and SCM fusion – in which branched actin polymerization is required, we performed immunostaining using antibodies that mark different steps.</p>
<p>These experiments revealed that the percentages of muscle cells positive for the proliferation marker (Ki67) and the muscle differentiation marker (MyoG) in the injured TA muscles were similar between control and <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A-S4E</xref>). In addition, live imaging analysis showed that the cultured <italic>ArpC2</italic> KO SCMs exhibited similar migration and cell-cell contact (Supplementary Video 3). Thus, branched actin polymerization is dispensable for the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of SCs during skeletal muscle regeneration. The reduced muscle size in the <italic>ArpC2</italic> mutant mice is therefore likely due to defects in SCM fusion.</p>
<p>Since SCM fusion is mostly completed at dpi 4.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Collins et al. 2024</xref>), we examined the regenerating TA muscles of the control and <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice at this time point (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). While most of the SCMs within the ghost fibers had fused in the control animals, the ghost fibers in the <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice contained differentiated (NCAM<sup>+</sup>) but mostly unfused SCMs that could be readily observed in cross sections, similar to those in the <italic>Mymx</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, 3F and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). Consistent with this, the frequency distribution of SCM number per ghost fiber displayed a dramatic shift toward higher numbers in the <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>). These results indicate that the actin cytoskeleton plays an essential role in SCM fusion as the fusogenic proteins.</p>
<p>Interestingly, expression of the fusogenic proteins, MymK and MymX, was up-regulated in the TA muscle of these mice (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4F</xref>), suggesting that fusogen overexpression is not able to rescue the SCM fusion defect resulted from defective branched actin polymerization. Furthermore, cultured <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>KO</sup> satellite cells exhibited a severe myoblast fusion defect despite normal differentiation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G-3I</xref>), and pharmacologically inhibiting Arp2/3 with CK666 had the same effects (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D-3G</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that branched actin polymerization is specifically required for SCM fusion during skeletal muscle regeneration.</p>

<title>Branched actin polymerization promotes invasive protrusion formation during SCM fusion</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism by which branched actin polymerization regulates SCM fusion during muscle regeneration, we first examined the cellular structure at the fusogenic synapse of cultured SCMs. Live cell imaging of cultured SCMs expressing LifeAct-mScarleti (mScar) and Arp2-mNeongreen (mNG) at day two in differentiation medium (DM) revealed Arp2- and F-actin-enriched finger-like protrusions projecting from the invading cells into their fusion partners (receiving cells), prior to cell membrane fusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and Supplementary Video 4). Consistent with this, TEM analysis of TA muscle at dpi 3.5 in wild-type mice revealed invasive finger-like protrusions at muscle cell contact sites (28.7 ± 3.9% of SCMs exhibited invasive protrusions, n = 83 SCMs from 20 ghost fibers examined) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). The average length and width of the finger-like protrusions were 422 ± 200 nm (n = 32 invasive protrusions) and 121 ± 73 nm (n = 32 invasive protrusions), respectively (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref> and S6B). In contrast, the muscle cells in <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice seldom formed invasive protrusions (1.4 ± 0.7% of the muscle cells exhibited invasive protrusions, n = 147 SCMs from 20 ghost fibers examined) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), whereas protrusions in SCMs of <italic>MymX</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice appeared normal (n = 29 invasive protrusions) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref> and S6B).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we show that the Arp2/3 complex-mediated branched actin polymerization is indispensable for SCM fusion, but not for satellite cell proliferation, migration, or differentiation during muscle regeneration. The Arp2/3 NPFs, N-WASP and WAVE, exhibit partially redundant functions in regulating SCM fusion. Our live cell imaging and electron microcopy analysis revealed actin-propelled invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapses of SCMs and a requirement for branched actin polymerization in generating these protrusions. Taken together, we propose that branched actin polymerization promotes mammalian muscle regeneration by generating invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies in multiple organisms, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish, and mouse, have demonstrated that myoblast fusion during embryogenesis is mediated by actin-propelled invasive membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sens et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kim et al. 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kim and Chen 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lee and Chen 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Luo et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lu et al. 2023</xref>). These protrusions serve several functions, including enhancing the plasma membrane contact areas between the fusion partners, increasing the mechanical tension of the fusogenic synapse, and bringing the two opposing cell membranes into close proximity to engage the fusogenic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sens et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Shilagardi et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kim et al. 2015b</xref>). The current study is the first revealing invasive protrusions as an integral part of the fusion machinery in adult skeletal muscle regeneration. In addition, we have identified molecular determinants of the invasive protrusions – the Arp2/3 complex and its NPFs, N-WASP and WAVE. It is striking that depleting the branched actin polymerization machinery results in a similarly severe SCM fusion defect as does depleting the fusogenic protein MymX, highlighting the crucial role for actin cytoskeletal rearrangements in SCM fusion. Indeed, our previous work using a reconstituted cell- fusion culture system in <italic>Drosophila</italic> revealed that fusogens and branched actin regulators are two minimal components of the cell-cell fusion machinery, and that actin- propelled invasive protrusions are required for fusogen engagement across the two apposing cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Shilagardi et al. 2013</xref>). It will be interesting to determine whether invasive protrusions promote the trans-interactions of fusogens at the mammalian fusogenic synapse.</p>
<p>We show in this study, for the first time, that macrophages can squeeze through tiny openings on the basement membrane to infiltrate and/or evacuate the ghost fibers during muscle regeneration. It is unclear whether these openings are small tears due to muscle injury or generated by macrophages through their interactions with the basement membrane. Carman et al. reported that lymphocytes use invasive podosomal protrusions to palpate the surface of, and ultimately generate transcellular pores through, the endothelium in a process called diapedesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Carman et al. 2007</xref>). Given that macrophages can also generate invasive protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Faust et al. 2019</xref>), it is conceivable that macrophages may use these invasive structures to push apart the protein meshwork on the basement membrane and thus opening small holes to get in and out of the ghost fibers. This feature would allow macrophages to infiltrate relatively intact basement membranes during micro muscle injuries to clear the debris and allow satellite cell proliferation and SCM fusion. Future studies are required to identify the mechanisms by which macrophages traverse the basement membrane during muscle regeneration.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> finding regarding the role of Arp2/3 and the actin nucleators N-WASP and WAVE complexes in myoblast fusion. The data presented is <bold>convincing</bold>, but it is suggested to perform validation of the knock-down efficiency of the mouse model and making adjustments to some of the data interpretation. The work will be of interest to biologists studying skeletal muscle stem cell biology in the context of skeletal muscle regeneration.</p>

<p>Overall, the manuscript reveals the role of actin polymerization to drive the fusion of myoblasts during adult muscle regeneration. This pathway regulates fusion in many contexts, but whether it was conserved in adult muscle regeneration remained unknown. Robust genetic tools and histological analyses were used to support the claims convincingly.</p>
<p>There are a few interpretations that could be adjusted.</p>
<p>The beginning of the results about macrophages traversing ghost fibers after regeneration was a surprise given the context in the abstract and introduction. These results also lead to new questions about this biology that would need to be answered to substantiate the claims in this section. Also, it is unclear the precise new information learned here because it seems obvious that macrophages would need to extravasate the basement membrane to enter ghost fibers and macrophages are known to have this ability. Moreover, the model in Figure 4D has macrophages and BM but there is not even mention of this in the legend. The authors may wish to consider removing this topic from the manuscript.</p>
<p>Which Pax7CreER line was used? In the methods, the Jax number provided is the Gaka line but in the results, Lepper et al 2009 are cited, which is not the citation for the Gaka line.</p>
<p>Did the authors assess regeneration in the floxed mice that do not contain Cre as a control? Or is it known these alleles do not perturb the function of the targeted gene?</p>
<p>The authors comment: 'Interestingly, expression of the fusogenic proteins, MymK and MymX, was up-regulated in the TA muscle of these mice (Fig. S4F), suggesting that fusogen overexpression is not able to rescue the SCM fusion defect resulted from defective branched actin polymerization.' It is unclear if fusogens are truly overexpressed because the analysis is performed at dpi 4 when the expression of fusogens may be decreased in control mice because they have already fused. Also, only two animals were analyzed and it is unclear if MymX is definitively increased. The authors should consider adjusting the interpretation to SCM fusion defect resulting from defective branched actin polymerization is unlikely to be caused by a lack of fusogen expression.</p>

<p>To fuse, differentiated muscle cells must rearrange their cytoskeletaon and assemble actin-enriched cytoskeletal structures. These actin foci are proposed to generate mechanical forces necessary to drive close membrane apposition and fusion pore formation.</p>
<p>While the study of these actin-rich structures has been conducted mainly in drosophila, the present manuscript presents clear evidence this mechanism is necessary for the fusion of adult muscle stem cells in vivo, in mice.</p>
<p>However, the authors need to tone down their interpretation of their findings and remember that genetic proof for cytoskeletal actin remodeling to allow muscle fusion in mice has already been provided by different labs (Vasyutina E, et al. 2009 PMID: 19443691; Gruenbaum-Cohen Y, et al., 2012 PMID: 22736793; Hamoud et al., 2014 PMID: 24567399). In the same line of thought, the authors write they &quot;demonstrated a critical function of branched actin-propelled invasive protrusions in skeletal muscle regeneration&quot;. I believe this is not a premiere, since Randrianarison-Huetz V, et al., previously reported the existence of finger-like actin-based protrusions at fusion sites in mice myoblasts (PMID: 2926942) and Eigler T, et al., live-recorded said &quot;fusogenic synapse&quot; in mice myoblasts (PMID: 34932950).</p>
<p>Hence, while the data presented here clearly demonstrate that ARP2/3 and SCAR/WAVE complexes are required for differentiating satellite cell fusion into multinucleated myotubes, this is an incremental story, and the authors should put their results in the context of previous literature.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Lu et al. explores the role of the Arp2/3 complex and the actin nucleators N-WASP and WAVE in myoblast fusion during muscle regeneration. The results are clear and compelling, effectively supporting the main claims of the study. However, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed molecular and cellular analysis of the fusion synapse. Additionally, while the description of macrophage extravasation from ghost fibers is intriguing, it seems somewhat disconnected from the primary focus of the work.</p>
<p>Despite this, the data are robust, and the major conclusions are well supported. Understanding muscle fusion mechanism is still a widely unexplored topic in the field and the authors make important progress in this domain.</p>
<p>I have a few suggestions that might strengthen the manuscript as outlined below.</p>
<p>(1) Could the authors provide more detail on how they defined cells with &quot;invasive protrusions&quot; in Figure 4C? Membrane blebs are commonly observed in contacting cells, so it would be important to clarify the criteria used for counting this specific event.</p>
<p>(2) Along the same line, please clarify what each individual dot represents in Figure 4C. The authors mention quantifying approximately 83 SCMs from 20 fibers. I assume each dot corresponds to data from individual fibers, but if that's the case, does this imply that only around four SCMs were quantified per fiber? A more detailed explanation would be helpful.</p>
<p>(3) Localizing ArpC2 at the invasive protrusions would be a strong addition to this study. Furthermore, have the authors examined the localization of Myomaker and Myomixer in ArpC2 mutant cells? This could provide insights into potential disruptions in the fusion machinery.</p>
<p>(4) As a minor curiosity, can ArpC2 WT and mutant cells fuse with each other?</p>
<p>(5) The authors report a strong reduction in CSA at 14 dpi and 28 dpi, attributing this defect primarily to failed myoblast fusion. Although this claim is supported by observations at early time points, I wonder whether the Arp2/3 complex might also play roles in myofibers after fusion. For instance, Arp2/3 could be required for the growth or maintenance of healthy myofibers, which could also contribute to the reduced CSA observed, since regenerated myofibers inherit the ArpC2 knockout from the stem cells. Could the authors address or exclude this possibility? This is rather a broader criticism of how things are being interpreted in general beyond this paper.</p>
