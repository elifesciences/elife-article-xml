<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Evolutionary transitions from oviparity to viviparity are frequent across diverse taxa. Some species also display intraspecific variation in parity mode, or they exhibit an intermediate mode by laying eggs containing embryos at variable, often advanced stages of development. How such natural quantitative variation in egg retention arises through differences in genetics, behaviour, and physiology – and how this variation ultimately connects to variation in specific fitness components – is not well-understood. Here, we study this problem by characterizing intraspecific variation in constitutive retention of fertilized eggs of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Analysing a panel of ∼300 wild strains, we find highly variable intra-uterine retention of fertilized eggs, with a fraction of strains showing either strongly reduced or increased egg retention with partial viviparity. We provide evidence for multiple evolutionary origins of such phenotypic extremes and we identify candidate loci explaining this natural variation. Characterizing a subset of wild strains, we confirm that natural variation in egg-laying behaviour contributes to observed differences in egg retention. Using multiple neuromodulatory agents and controlled CRISPR-<italic>Cas9-</italic>mediated genetic manipulation of endogenous serotonin levels in 10 wild strains, we then show that this behavioural variation arises through an evolutionarily divergent neuromodulatory architecture of the egg-laying circuitry. Intraspecific variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neural circuit activity therefore connects with variation in reproductive strategy, including transitions from oviparity to partial viviparity. In a second objective, we asked why natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention might be maintained. Examining potential fitness costs and benefits of this natural variation, we show that strong egg retention reduces maternal fertility and survival, mostly due to detrimental larval hatching <italic>in utero</italic>. On the other hand, such genotypes with strong egg retention can benefit from improved offspring protection against environmental insults and by gaining a competitive advantage as offspring exhibit a shortened extra-uterine developmental time to reproductive maturity. Observed natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying behaviour may therefore reflect modifications of a trade-off between alternative fitness components expressed across generations. Our study uncovers underappreciated natural diversity in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying circuit and provides insights into the fitness consequences of this behavioural variation. We propose that intraspecific variation in nematode egg-laying behaviour can serve as an ideal system to pinpoint the molecular changes underlying evolutionary transitions between invertebrate ovi- and viviparity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reproductive strategies reflect higher-order phenotypes that emerge through integration of developmental, morphological, physiological, and behavioural phenotypes. Understanding how these different phenotypes integrate and co-evolve to explain the diversification in reproductive strategies is a central goal of life history research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Flatt and Heyland, 2011</xref>). One such fundamental aspect of reproduction in internally fertilizing animals is the duration of intra-uterine embryonic development, which can be highly variable and is influenced by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. While oviparity and viviparity reflect opposite extremes, many taxa display intermediate types of parity by laying eggs containing embryos at variably advanced stages of development (sometimes termed ovoviviparity). The degree of such maternal retention of fertilized eggs may vary significantly between closely related species or even between genotypes of the same species, e.g. in insects, snails or reptiles, and is further influenced by diverse environmental factors, such as mating status or food availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bleu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kalinka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Markow et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Meier et al., 1999</xref>). Viviparity – and prolonged egg retention in general – are thought to promote maternal control over the offspring environment, providing an extended opportunity for offspring resource provisioning as well as improved offspring protection against fluctuating environmental fluctuations, stressors, pathogens or predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avise, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Blackburn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kalinka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ostrovsky et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, laying of advanced-stage embryos or larvae may generate an advantage during intra- and interspecific competition by reducing external egg-to-adult developmental time, e.g. in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bakker, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kalinka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Mueller and Bitner, 2015</xref>). Despite these apparent benefits, prolonged egg retention and viviparity are generally presumed to incur fitness costs, expressed as reduced maternal survival and fecundity, for example, due to higher metabolic costs as a result of prolonged gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kalinka, 2015</xref>). How variation in ecological niche drives the evolution of different parity modes given these apparent trade-offs has been a major focus of evolutionary ecological research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avise, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Blackburn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kalinka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ostrovsky et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The study of evolutionary transitions between ovi- and viviparity has concentrated on comparisons between species with distinct parity modes, so that evidence is mainly correlative and the genetic changes underlying such transitions can only rarely be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Horváth and Kalinka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Recknagel et al., 2021</xref>). Relatively few studies have examined quantitative intraspecific variation in egg retention although this approach may facilitate disentangling its relative costs and benefits. Intraspecific analysis may further allow for identification of genomic loci contributing to this variation and potentially provide insights into the molecular changes during incipient stages of evolutionary transitions towards obligate viviparity. One such study was performed for natural quantitative variation in egg retention of fertilized <italic>Drosophila</italic> females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Horváth and Kalinka, 2018</xref>): Genome-wide association (GWA) mapping yielded 15 potential candidate genes harbouring natural polymorphisms contributing to variation in egg retention. These variants have not yet been validated and it remains unclear which particular traits, such as fecundity or egg-laying behaviour, contribute to observed variation in egg retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Horváth and Kalinka, 2018</xref>). In this study, prolonged <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg retention was correlated with a reduction in fecundity, in line with the prediction that evolutionary transitions towards viviparity involve a loss of fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avise, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Blackburn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Clutton-Brock, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kalinka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ostrovsky et al., 2015</xref>). Analysis of intraspecific variation may thus be valuable to determine genetic causes and fitness consequences of divergent egg retention, providing an entry point into understanding evolutionary transitions between ovi- and viviparity.</p>
<p>Here, to characterize intraspecific differences in egg retention, we focused on natural variation in egg laying of the male-hermaphrodite (androdioecious) <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. In optimal conditions, this primarily self-fertilizing nematode completes its life cycle within 3-4 days, and hermaphrodites generate around 150-300 offspring over a period of two to three days. During the reproductive phase, animals of the reference strain (N2) accumulate up to ∼15 fertilized eggs in the uterus caused by a delay between ovulation and egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Schafer, 2006</xref>). Embryonic development takes around 15 hours and occurs independently of whether eggs are laid or retained in the uterus. On average, embryos spend two to three hours <italic>in utero</italic>, reaching the early gastrula (∼30-cell) stage when they are being laid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>). At any given time, the number of eggs retained <italic>in utero</italic> will therefore depend on rates of both egg production and egg laying. Reduced egg-laying rates leads to the accumulation of advanced stage embryos <italic>in utero</italic>. Egg laying is a rhythmic behaviour that alternates between inactive (∼20 min) and active (∼2 min) phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>), regulated by a structurally simple neural circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">White et al., 1986</xref>). During active egg-laying phases, the neurotransmitter serotonin and neuropeptides signal via the hermaphrodite specific neurons (HSNs) to increase excitability of vulva muscles cells, causing the rapid sequential release of 4 to 6 eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Brewer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Shyn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Additional neuromodulatory signals and mechanosensory feedback regulate temporal patterns of egg-laying activity, which are further modulated by physiological and environmental inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aprison et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Fernandez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Koelle, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Medrano and Collins, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Ravi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Schafer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Trent et al., 1983</xref>). Food signals are required for sustained egg-laying activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Daniels et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Dong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Horvitz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Trent, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>) whereas diverse stressors (e.g. starvation, hypoxia, thermal stress, osmotic stress, pathogens) inhibit egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aballay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Chen and Caswell-Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Fenk and Bono, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Mcmullen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Schafer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Trent, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Waggoner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Prolonged stress exposure will lead to intra-uterine egg retention and internal (matricidal) hatching, so that larvae develop inside their mother, often leading to premature maternal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chen and Caswell-Chen, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Maupas, 1900</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Trent, 1982</xref>). Environmentally-induced egg retention and internal hatching in <italic>C. elegans</italic> can be considered a plastic switch from oviparity to viviparity, also termed facultative viviparity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chen and Caswell-Chen, 2004</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, while eggs can no longer be provisioned after fertilization, larvae <italic>in utero</italic> may feed on decaying maternal tissues allowing them to develop into advanced larval stages, even in nutrient-scarce environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chen and Caswell-Chen, 2004</xref>). Stress-induced internal hatching in <italic>C. elegans</italic> may thus reflect adaptive phenotypic plasticity allowing for offspring provisioning, in particular, by enabling larvae to develop into the diapausing, starvation-resistant dauer larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chen and Caswell-Chen, 2004</xref>), which also represents the key dispersal developmental stage, able to colonize novel favourable environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Félix and Braendle, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The detailed genetic understanding of <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying activity has been obtained through the study of a single wild-type genotype, the laboratory strain N2, and its mutant derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Schafer, 2006</xref>). It therefore remains unclear to what extent the egg-laying circuit harbours intraspecific variation. Although wild strains are highly isogenic due to a predominant self-fertilization (selfing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Barrière and Félix, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lee et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>C. elegans</italic> retains considerable genetic (and phenotypic) diversity across the globe, with strains differing genetically, often in localized, highly divergent genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Crombie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gilbert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). While egg-laying responses to diverse stimuli seem to be largely invariant across many <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chen and Caswell-Chen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>), wild strains may exhibit strongly divergent egg-laying behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>). These rare strains display constitutively strong egg retention (up to ∼50 eggs <italic>in</italic> utero) and internal hatching irrespective of the environment (partial viviparity). A single, major-effect variant explains this derived phenotype: a single amino acid substitution (V530L) in KCNL-1, a small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel subunit. This gain-of-function mutation causes vulval muscle hyperpolarization to reduce egg-laying activity, leading to constitutively strong egg retention and internal hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>). The apparent evolutionary maintenance of the KCNL-1 V530L variant in natural <italic>C. elegans</italic> population seems puzzling given its highly deleterious fitness effects (due to matricidal hatching) in laboratory settings. Competition experiments indicate, however, that this variant allele can be maintained in more natural conditions mimicking fluctuations in resource availability and/or if reproduction preferentially occurs during early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, it remains unknown how constitutively strong egg retention may be beneficial in such conditions, and more generally, how different degrees of <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention affect alternative fitness components.</p>
<p>Here, extending our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>), we quantified the full spectrum of natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention using a world-wide panel of strains covering much of the species’ genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). Our first aim was to characterize variation in egg laying, and to identify phylogenetic patterns and genomic regions (QTL) associated with observed phenotypic variation. We show that, while most strains differed only subtly in egg retention, a subset of strains exhibit deviant, strongly increased or reduced, egg retention. We provide evidence for repeated evolution of such extreme egg retention phenotypes through distinct genetic changes. We then carefully characterized a subset of wild strains with divergent egg retention to determine how they differ in egg-laying behaviour and underlying neuromodulatory architecture. These results show that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying system harbours surprisingly high natural diversity in the sensitivity to neuromodulators, such as serotonin, suggesting rapid evolution of the involved neural circuitry. In a second objective, we explored why variation in egg retention might be maintained in natural <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations. To address this question, we tested for the presence of fitness costs and benefits associated with variable egg retention of wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains. We experimentally demonstrate that strong egg retention usually strongly reduces maternal fertility and survival, mostly due to frequent internal (matricidal) hatching. On the other hand, these genotypes with strong egg retention may be able to benefit from improved offspring protection against environmental insults and from a competitive advantage caused by a significantly reduced extra-uterine egg-to-adult developmental time. Observed natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying behaviour may therefore modify a trade-off between fitness components expressed in mothers versus offspring. Altogether, we present an integrative analysis of natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg laying providing first insights into the genetic basis, fitness consequences and possible evolutionary ecological significance of this central reproductive behaviour. Intraspecific variation in nematode egg-laying behaviour therefore provides a system to identify molecular changes underlying evolutionary transitions in parity mode.</p>

All examined wild strains showed, however, some egg-laying activity and none of the Class III strains exhibited any obvious, penetrant defects in vulval development or morphogenesis.</p>
<p>To examine if natural variation in egg retention may be linked to strain differences in ecological niche, we tested for effects of geographical and climatic parameters (e.g., latitude/longitude, elevation) (Spearman rank correlations, all P &gt; 0.05; data not shown) (Fig. S1A to S1C) and substrate type (Fig. S1D) on mean egg retention but found no obvious evidence for such relationships. Strains of all three phenotypic Classes were found across the globe and may co-occur in the same locality (Fig. S1A to S1C), or even in the same microhabitat or substrate, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>). A majority (11 out of 14) of Class III strains were isolated in Europe (Fig. S1C), but this may be simply due to increased sampling efforts of this region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Both common and rare genetic variants underlie natural differences in egg retention</title>
<p>The presence of significant variation in egg retention allows for mapping of genomic regions that contribute to this variation using genome-wide association (GWA) mapping. This GWA approach is limited to the detection of common variants as variants below 5% minor allele frequency are excluded from analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cook et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Widmayer et al., 2022</xref>). Performing GWA mapping using data for 316 unique strains (isotypes), mapping of mean egg retention yielded a single QTL located on chromosome III spanning 1.48 Mb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). This QTL is located in a non-divergent region of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lee et al., 2021</xref>) and explained 24% of the observed phenotypic variance (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among the 257 genes found in this QTL region, five have known roles in the egg-laying system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org">www.wormbase.org</ext-link>) and display various natural polymorphisms (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, we did not detect any obvious candidate polymorphisms in these genes that could explain variable levels of egg retention. Two additional QTL on chromosomes II and IV were detected for variance in egg retention (<italic>CV</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The phenotypic distributions and detection of several QTL by GWA indicates that natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention is likely polygenic, influenced by multiple common variants.</p>

<p>Examining the phylogenetic distribution of extreme egg retention phenotypes based on whole-genome sequence data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cook et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lee et al., 2021</xref>) indicates that Class I and III phenotypes have been derived multiple times. On average, egg retention did not differ between genetically divergent, likely ancestral, strains (mostly from Hawaii) (N = 41) and strains with swept haplotypes (N=275) found across the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Crombie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gilbert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lee et al., 2021</xref>); however, most Class III strains (13 out of 14) exhibited swept haplotypes (Fig. S2). Among the Class III strains with very strong egg retention, four strains (including the newly isolated strain NIC1832) are known to carry a single amino acid substitution (V530L) in KCNL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>). This variant has been shown to strongly reduce egg-laying activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>), thus explaining strong egg retention in these four French strains. As previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>), we confirmed that the KCNL-1 V530L is likely derived from a single mutational event, as inferred by local haplotype analysis of the genomic region surrounding <italic>kcnl-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). In additional Class III strains, which do not carry this variant (N = 10), the derived state of constitutively high egg retention must thus be explained by alternative genetic variants. Therefore, natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention is shaped by both common variants and multiple rare variants, including KNCL-1 V530L, explaining extreme phenotypic divergence.</p>

<p>The temporal dynamics of egg number <italic>in utero</italic> varied strongly across the hermaphrodite reproductive span (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), in line with progeny production and presumptive ovulation rates, coupled to the number of remaining self-sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Kosinski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Large et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">McCarter et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Mcmullen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>).

Scoring the age distribution of progeny <italic>in utero</italic> of young (mid-L4 + 30h) adult hermaphrodites confirmed that increased egg number <italic>in utero</italic> was linked to prolonged intra-uterine embryonic development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). At this developmental stage, most Class III strains contained more advanced embryonic stages (or L1 larvae) compared to Class I and II strains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and S3A). Examining the temporal dynamics of internal hatching across the entire reproductive span, we found that internal hatching occurred consistently in the six strains with highest egg retention: all Class IIIB strains and in two Class IIIA strains (JU830, JU2829) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the 15 focal strains, we further tested if strain differences in egg retention correlate with differences in body or egg size, that is, morphological characteristics likely modulating the capacity to retain eggs. Both egg and body size (of early adults at beginning of fertilization, containing 1-2 eggs <italic>in utero</italic>) showed significant differences across strains (Fig. S3B and S3C); in addition, there was a trend for a correlation between body and egg size across strains (Fig. S3D). However, egg and body size did not correlate with measures of mean egg retention across strains (Fig. S3E and S3F), suggesting that the capacity to retain eggs is not simply a function of body or egg size.</p>

<title>Natural variation in egg-laying behaviour</title>
<p>Because egg number <italic>in utero</italic> is strongly modulated by rates of both ovulation and egg laying (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), we wanted to determine to what extent natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention can be attributed to differences in egg-laying behaviour. We first examined the temporal dynamics of egg-laying activity across the hermaphrodite reproductive span by measuring the number of eggs laid during a two-hour window at five distinct adult ages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In line with the temporal progression of egg retention (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), egg-laying activity was highly dynamic, peaking between mid-L4 + 24h and mid-L4 + 30h for most strains, followed by a decline until cessation of reproduction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Practically all Class III strains exhibited a lower peak when egg laying was maximal and the time window of egg-laying activity was shortened, with few eggs being laid from mid-L4 + 48h onwards (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>We next quantified natural variation in behavioural patterns of egg laying during peak activity using classical assay to study <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>). Based on observations of the reference strain N2, <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg laying (usually quantified between mid-L4 + 30h and mid-L4 + 48h) has been described as a rhythmic two-state behaviour with inactive (∼20 min) and active (∼2 min) phases, during which multiple eggs are expelled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>). To quantify possible differences in egg-laying behaviour between the 15 focal strains, we followed individuals across a 3-hour period (at mid-L4 + 30h) and determined the timing and frequency of active and inactive egg-laying phases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>). Largely consistent with their egg retention phenotype, Class I and Class IIIB displayed significantly accelerated and reduced egg laying activity, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>). In contrast, egg-laying behavioural patterns of strains in Class II versus IIIA did not consistently differ, and strains within each of these Classes exhibited marked differences in behavioural phenotypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>). In addition, the reference strain N2 (Class II) expelled many more eggs per egg-laying phase than any of the other strains, an atypical phenotype likely caused by the N2-specific <italic>npr-1</italic> allele (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). This behavioural quantification demonstrates the presence of genetic differences in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying behaviour, which broadly align with observed differences in egg retention.</p>
<p>Finally, we measured the timing and onset of the first egg-laying event in the 15 focal strains. Tracking individual hermaphrodites from late mid-L4 onwards, we determined the time interval between the time points of first fertilization (presence of 1-2 eggs <italic>in utero</italic>) and first egg-laying event (when we also measured egg number <italic>in utero</italic>). Hermaphrodites of Class II strains laid their first egg after accumulating ∼5-10 eggs <italic>in utero, i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. approximately one to two hours after first fertilization, similar to what has been reported previously for the reference strain N2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ravi et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3H</xref>). By comparison, the time points of the first egg-laying event for Class I and III strains were significantly advanced and delayed, respectively, with corresponding differences in the number of eggs accumulated <italic>in utero</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3H</xref>).</p>
<p>The above experiments show that natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention can be explained, to a significant extent, by variation in egg-laying behaviour. Initially, strong egg retention is established through a delay of the first egg-laying event (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Therefore, sensitivity to mechanosensory stimuli triggering the first egg-laying event – likely mechanical stretch depending on the number of accumulated eggs <italic>in utero</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Medrano and Collins, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Ravi et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">2018</xref>) – appears to be variable among strains. In addition, observed strain differences in egg retention are also consistent with more subtle differences in egg-laying behavioural patterns, such as the duration of inactive egg-laying phases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), measured in young adults at the peak of egg-laying activity. Natural variation in egg retention therefore emerges through variation in multiple phenotypes (some of which occurring at different time points of adulthood) that define the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying behavioural repertoire.</p>

<title>Natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying in response to neuromodulatory inputs</title>
<p>Observed strain differences in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying behaviour (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3H</xref>) potentially arise through genetic variation in the neuromodulatory architecture of the egg-laying circuit (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Multiple neurotransmitters, in particular, serotonin (5-HT), play a central role in synaptic and extrasynaptic neuromodulation of egg laying, with HSN-mediated serotonin bursts triggering egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Shyn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Trent et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Exogenous application of serotonin, and other diverse neurotransmitters and neuromodulatory drugs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), have been extensively used to study their roles in regulating <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Horvitz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Schafer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Trent et al., 1983</xref>). We therefore tested if the 15 focal strains differ in their response to exogenous serotonin known to stimulate <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Horvitz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Schafer, 2006</xref>). We used standard assays, in which animals are reared in liquid M9 buffer without bacterial food. This treatment inhibits egg laying, but adding serotonin overrides this inhibition and stimulates egg laying, as reported for the N2 reference strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Horvitz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Trent et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Weinshenker et al., 1995</xref>). We found exposure to a high dose of serotonin (25mM) to generate a consistent increase in egg-laying in both Class I and II strains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In contrast, responses were highly variable in Class III strains: among the five Class IIIA strains without the <italic>kcnl-1</italic> variant, serotonin stimulated egg laying in all strains except for JU2829, in which serotonin strongly inhibited egg laying as compared to basal egg laying in controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In addition, serotonin induced a much stronger egg-laying response in the Class IIIA strain ED3005 than in other strains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), indicative of serotonin hypersensitivity, similar to what has been observed for certain egg-laying mutants with perturbed synaptic transmission affecting serotonin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Schafer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Schafer and Kenyon, 1995</xref>). In Class IIIB strains carrying the KCNL-1 V530L variant allele, serotonin had no effect on, or a trend towards inhibiting, an already weak egg laying activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Strains within each of the three classes further showed subtle but significative quantitative differences in the egg-laying response triggered by serotonin despite showing grossly similar egg-laying behaviour in control conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Stimulation of egg-laying activity by exogenous serotonin was thus strongly genotype-dependent. We conclude that genetic differences in neuromodulatory architecture of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying circuit contribute to natural diversity in egg-laying behaviour.</p>

The structure of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying circuit is simple, containing two classes of motoneurons, the two serotonergic hermaphrodite-specific motoneurons (HSN) and the six ventral cord motoneurons (VC), which provide synaptic input to the egg-laying muscles (VM); in addition, mechanical excitation of uterine muscles (UM) in response to egg accumulation favours exit from the inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Collins et al., 2016</xref>). Serotonin from HSN act through vulval muscle receptors to increase muscle excitability, which together with rhythmic signals from motor neurons, causes contractions of VM during egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Kopchock et al., 2021</xref>).

The number of eggs laid were scored after two hours. Assays for each of the three treatments were carried out independently; the 15 strains were scored in parallel in both control and treatment conditions for each of the three assays.

<p>The action of diverse drugs in clinical use, such as serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and tricyclic antidepressants, have been characterized through genetic analysis of their action on neurotransmitters regulating <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Branicky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dempsey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Kullyev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Ranganathan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Trent et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Weinshenker et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">1995</xref>). As reported for the reference strain N2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dempsey et al., 2005</xref>), we find that the SSRI fluoxetine (Prozac) and the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine strongly stimulated egg-laying activity in all 15 focal strains, which only showed slight (although significant) quantitative differences in drug sensitivity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>). Both drugs stimulated egg laying in Class III strains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) where exogenous serotonin inhibited – or had no effect on – egg laying (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Given that fluoxetine- and imipramine-stimulated (but not serotonin-stimulated) egg laying requires intact HSN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Branicky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dempsey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Desai and Horvitz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Trent et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Weinshenker et al., 1995</xref>), we conclude that HSN function and signalling via HSN are unlikely to be strongly disrupted in any of the examined strains. Although the mode of action of these drugs has not been fully resolved, these results are consistent with previous models proposing that these drugs do not simply block serotonin reuptake but can stimulate egg laying partly independently of serotonergic signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dempsey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Kullyev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Weinshenker et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Yue et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>As shown above, serotonin may also inhibit, rather than stimulate, egg laying, specifically in the Class IIIA strain JU2829, and a similar tendency was observed for Class IIIB strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This result is in line with past research reporting a dual role of serotonin signalling in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg laying by generating both excitatory and inhibitory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Carnell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dempsey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Hapiak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Hobson, 2005</xref>). In the reference wild type strain (N2), serotonin-mediated inhibitory inputs are masked by its stronger excitatory inputs and are only revealed when function of certain serotonin receptors has been mutationally disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Carnell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Hapiak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Hobson, 2005</xref>). In analogous fashion, our observations suggest that serotonin-mediated inhibitory effects become only visible in wild strains whose egg-laying response cannot be stimulated by serotonin. In the case of Class IIIB strains, the KCNL-1 V530L variant likely hyperpolarizes vulval muscles to such an extent that exogenous serotonin (acting via HSN and/or directly upon vulval muscles) is insufficient to induce successful egg laying while the negative serotonin-mediated inputs are able to exert their effects, likely through HSN, as previously shown for N2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Carnell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Hapiak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Hobson, 2005</xref>). To test if KCNL1-V530L is indeed sufficient to unmask inhibitory inputs of serotonin, we examined the effects of this variant introduced into a Class II genetic background (strain JU1200); the resulting CRISPR-<italic>Cas9-</italic>engineered strain (JU1200<sub>KCNL-1 V530L</sub>) recapitulates reduced egg laying and strong egg retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>). Very similar to what we found for JU751 (Class IIIB), serotonin had a negative effect on egg laying in JU1200<sup>KCNL-1 V530L</sup>, suggesting that altering vulval muscle excitability by means of KCNL-1 V530L was indeed sufficient to abrogate positive but not negative serotonin inputs acting in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). In addition, both fluoxetine and imipramine stimulated egg laying in JU1200<sup>KCNL-1 V530L</sup> (Fig. S5A), very similar to what we observed in JU751 and other Class IIIB strains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In addition, introducing the canonical KCNL-1 sequence into JU751 (strain JU751<sup>KCNL-1 L530V</sup>) fully restores egg-laying responses as for the ones observed in JU1200 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and S5A). These results thus further confirm that variation in a single amino acid residue of KCNL-1 is sufficient to explain drastic differences in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying system and its response to various neuromodulatory inputs.</p>

<title>CRISPR-<italic>Cas9</italic>-mediated manipulation of endogenous serotonin levels uncovers natural variation in the neuromodulatory architecture of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying system</title>
<p>To consolidate the finding that <italic>C. elegans</italic> harbours natural variation in the neuromodulatory architecture of the egg-laying system, we examined how an identical genetic modification – which increases availability of endogenous serotonin levels – affects egg-laying activity in different genetic backgrounds. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes a single serotonin transporter (SERT), <italic>mod-5</italic>, which is involved in serotonin re-uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Ranganathan et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).

However, the size of this effect was genotype-dependent, and several strains did not show a significantly increased egg-laying response (Class I: JU3166, QG2873, Class IIIA: JU830, Class IIIB: JU751) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The effect of <italic>mod-5</italic> was also quantitatively different for certain strains within the same phenotypic Class (Class II and Class IIIA), indicating that serotonin sensitivity of the egg laying system varies genetically despite generating similar behavioural outputs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>Introducing the mutation <italic>mod-5(n822)</italic> did not further increase egg laying when wild strains were exposed to 25mM serotonin (except for the strain ED3005), likely because egg-laying activity was already at its maximum at such a high dose of serotonin (Fig. S5B).

<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> wild strains differ in their egg-laying activity in response to the same dose of exogenous serotonin and in response to the same genetic alteration that causes an increase in endogenous serotonin levels. Such significant differences between genotypes in effect sizes of a focal allele are evidence for epistasis (non-linear genetic interactions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Gibson and Dworkin, 2004</xref>). Hence, <italic>C. elegans</italic> harbours natural variation in its genetic architecture affecting sensitivity to neuromodulatory inputs of the egg-laying circuit.

<title>Evaluating potential costs and benefits of variation in egg retention</title>
<p>The existence of pronounced natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying phenotypes raises the questions of why this variation is maintained and how it might impact alternative fitness components. We therefore experimentally explored potential fitness costs and benefits associated with variable egg retention of <italic>C. elegans</italic> wild strains. We previously reported an apparent fitness cost of strong egg retention but only for a single strain (JU751, Class IIIB), in which mothers die prior to the end of the reproductive span due to internal (matricidal) hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>). Here, using comparisons between multiple focal strains with variable degrees of egg retention, we tested if increased egg retention consistently generates negative fitness effects. Consistent with this hypothesis, strains with stronger egg retention generally showed reduced lifetime self-fertility and reduced survival, with strongest reductions observed in Class IIIB strains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>). Class III strains showed frequent internal hatching, with mothers dying prematurely, sometimes before the end of the reproductive span (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">F</xref>). Internal hatching in Class I and II strains was absent or occurred only in rare instances at the end of the reproductive period (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), similar to what has been previously observed for the strain N2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Pickett and Kornfeld, 2013</xref>). To further test when and how strong egg retention and internal hatching may perturb self-fertilization, we screened DAPI-stained hermaphrodites at different adult stages to count remaining self-sperm and internally hatched larvae, and we scored animals for physical damage of the maternal germline and soma. First, a fraction of adults in multiple Class III (but not Class I or II) strains had self-sperm remaining at the time of internal hatching (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>), confirming that internal hatching can indeed occur during the reproductive span, potentially disrupting self-fertilization. Consistent with this latter scenario, in the Class IIIB strain JU2593, the total number of self-sperm greatly exceeded the number of lifetime progeny (Fig. S6A). Second, internally hatched larvae in live mothers with remaining self-sperm (limited to Class III strains) caused apparent physical damage to the maternal gonad and somatic tissues due to larval movement, sometimes disrupting the uterine wall (Fig. S6B). Third, larval movement also appeared to disperse sperm away from the uterine regions adjacent to spermathecae, which seems to reduce fertilization efficacy as certain Class III strains had large numbers of unfertilized oocytes in the uterus before self-sperm was depleted (Fig. S6C and S6D).</p>

<p>The above experiments show that strong egg retention (and internal hatching) correlates with reduced self-fertility (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) and reduced maternal survival (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Class IIIB strains exhibited the most drastic reduction in reproductive output, only using a fraction of available self-sperm. In contrast, in Class IIIA strains (ED3005, JU440, NIC1786) internal hatching occurred mainly after reproduction had ceased (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), suggesting that strong egg retention has limited detrimental fitness effects in these strains.</p>

<title>Strong egg retention may provide a competitive advantage in resource-limited environments</title>
<p>Given its frequent deleterious effects on survival and fecundity, we asked if there could be any counteracting beneficial effects associated with increased egg retention. Strong egg retention reflects prolonged intra-uterine embryonic development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and S3A), which results in laying of eggs holding advanced-stage embryos, as confirmed by scoring the age distribution of embryos contained in eggs laid by young adults of the 15 focal wild strains (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Within laid eggs of Class I and II strains, embryos rarely exceeded the 26-cell stage, whilst in Class III, many embryos had started to differentiate, containing hundreds of cells, including late-stage embryos, sometimes close to hatching (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). In the context of the rapid <italic>C. elegans</italic> life cycle (∼80h egg-to-adult developmental time), observed strain differences in embryonic age are considerable: it takes approximately 2-3 hours to reach the 26-cell stage but around 9-12 hours to develop into late-stage embryos (Hall et al., 2007). Prolonged egg retention should thus result in earlier hatching <italic>ex</italic> utero, so that intraspecific differences in the timing of hatching could potentially affect competitive fitness when different genotypes compete for the same resource. Specifically, rapid external hatching may provide an advantage when exploiting resource-limited environments as only a few hours of “head start” in larval development can be decisive for competitive outcomes, for example, as shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bakker, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Mueller and Bitner, 2015</xref>).</p>

<p>Here we tested to what extent strain differences in egg retention (of young adults) affect external egg-to-adult developmental time and competitive ability. First, comparing the average timing of larval hatching between the 15 focal strains with variable egg retention, we found that eggs of all Class IIIB strains and some Class IIIA strains hatched on average ∼2-5 hours earlier compared to Class I and II strains (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Second, to test if earlier larval hatching indeed translates into corresponding earlier onset of reproductive maturity in the 15 focal strains, we measured the time interval between egg laying and reproductive maturity, defined as the onset of fertilization, i.e., by the presence of 1-2 eggs <italic>in utero</italic>. Although many Class III strains with strong egg retention reached age at maturity (∼2-6 hours) earlier than Class I and II strains, some Class III strains (JU830, NIC1786) did not maintain their initial head start in larval development (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Overall, these measurements confirm that strains with prolonged egg retention benefit from a relatively shorter developmental time from laying to reproductive maturity, which might improve competitive ability. The above experiment only examined eggs laid by young adults (mid-L4 + 30h); in Class III strains, the observed head start in larval development should thus be further amplified in older hermaphrodites (from mid-L4 + 48h onwards), containing not only advanced-stage embryos but also larvae (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>To quantify the possible effects of egg retention on short-term competitive ability in the absence of confounding genetic variation, we compared the Class II strain JU1200 (wild type) to the engineered JU1200<sup>KCNL-1 V530L</sup> strain, i.e. two genetically identical strains with the exception of the engineered KCNL-1 V530L mutation in the latter strain, causing very strong egg retention and laying of advanced-stage embryos: JU1200<sup>WT</sup> (∼15 eggs <italic>in utero</italic>) versus JU1200<sup>KCNL-1 V530L</sup> (∼40 eggs <italic>in utero</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>). We competed each strain separately against a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tester strain by inoculating NGM plates with 20 freshly laid eggs from either genotype. Estimating adult population number and genotype frequencies relative to the GFP-tester strain five days after inoculation (around the time point of food exhaustion), the KCNL-1 V530L variant performed significantly better (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Given that the principal phenotypic effect of KCNL-1 V530L is reduced egg laying and consequently increased egg retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>), we conclude that strong egg retention can improve competitive ability in food-limited environments.</p>
<p>Finally, to mimic scenarios of ecologically relevant short-term competition between naturally co-occurring wild strains with divergent egg retention, we compared the competitive ability of the Class IIIB strain JU751 (strong egg retention caused by the variant KCNL-1 V530L; ∼40 eggs <italic>in utero</italic> at mid-L4 + 30h) against strains isolated around the same time from the same habitat (compost heap, Le Perreux-sur-Marne, France) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Barrière and Félix, 2007</xref>) but exhibiting canonical egg retention (Class II phenotype; hermaphrodites at mid-L4 + 30h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>). For each of five of these strains, 20 freshly laid eggs were mixed with 20 freshly laid eggs from JU751 and allowed to develop. We then estimated adult population size and genotype frequencies five days after inoculation (around the time point of food exhaustion). In all five cases, JU751 reached higher adult population sizes at this stage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). Although these experimental results provide only tentative evidence, laying of advanced-stage embryos may enhance intraspecific competitive ability, specifically where multiple genotypes compete for colonization and exploitation of limited, patchily distributed resources. Similar to our experiments, increased egg-to-adult developmental time has previously been shown to be disadvantageous for <italic>C. elegans</italic> population growth when analysing mutants with increased hermaphrodite sperm production, which incurs a cost as the onset of reproductive maturity will be delayed; thus, although these mutants have the potential to produce overall many more self-progeny, they will be rapidly outcompeted because of delayed maturity whenever resources are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Barker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Cutter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Hodgkin and Barnes, 1991</xref>). Together with theoretical and experimental evidence in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bakker, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Horváth and Kalinka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Mueller and Bitner, 2015</xref>), these observations indicate that maternal features accelerating offspring development after oviposition, can confer fitness benefits in ephemeral habitats with rapidly decaying resources.</p>

<title>Strong egg retention improves offspring protection when facing sudden environmental stress</title>
<p>Prolonged intra-uterine embryonic development, as observed in viviparous organisms, is thought to provide improved protection of developing embryos against deleterious environmental fluctuations and stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Blackburn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Horváth and Kalinka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kalinka, 2015</xref>). If prolonged egg retention in <italic>C. elegans</italic> can increase such protection is unclear, in particular, because embryos seem already well protected: they are encapsulated within a multi-layered egg shell that is highly resistant to diverse environmental insults, such as osmotic stress or pathogen infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Johnston and Dennis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sandhu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Schierenberg and Junkersdorf, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Stein and Golden, 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, eggs developing <italic>ex utero</italic> are still vulnerable to a variety of abiotic and biotic stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Burton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Fausett et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Garsin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Padilla et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Van Voorhies and Ward, 2000</xref>). If eggs <italic>in utero</italic> are indeed better insulated against environmental insults compared to eggs laid in the external environment, genotypes with strong egg retention may thus benefit from improved offspring protection. Here we tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of environmental perturbations on eggs developing <italic>in utero</italic> versus <italic>ex utero</italic> using a subset of wild strains with different levels of egg retention.</p>
<p>We first examined the effects of short-term, acute exposure to high concentrations of ethanol and acetic acid, chemicals that are present in decaying plant matter, i.e. the natural <italic>C. elegans</italic> habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Félix and Braendle, 2010</xref>). Across strains, most eggs removed from mothers and directly exposed to these chemical treatments were killed whereas eggs inside mothers exhibited significantly higher survival in most strains, particularly when exposed to acetic acid (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref>). Eggs <italic>in utero</italic> were thus partly protected by the body of the mothers, even though mothers instantly died upon treatment exposure. Consequently, increased egg retention resulted in overall higher numbers of surviving offspring per mother in both stress treatments (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref>)</p>

<p>To corroborate this result, we tested if the Class III strain JU751 displays better maternal protection relative to strains with a canonical egg retention phenotype (Class II) from same habitat, isolated around the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Barrière and Félix, 2007</xref>). Exposure to acetic acid confirmed that higher egg retention of JU751 increased the number of surviving offspring compared to strains with lower retention (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). In the same fashion, we found the number of surviving offspring in the Class II strain JU1200<sup>WT</sup> (∼15 eggs <italic>in utero</italic>) to be much reduced compared to JU1200<sup>KCNL-1 V530L</sup> (∼40 eggs <italic>in utero</italic>) when exposed to acetic acid (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). In addition, larvae <italic>in utero</italic> present at the time of treatment were also efficiently protected (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). Offspring <italic>in utero</italic> may therefore benefit from maternal protection, so that strains with constitutively higher egg retention will protect overall more progeny when confronting a sudden environmental insult.</p>
<p>To test how exposure to milder environmental perturbations affects the reproductive fitness of descendants from eggs exposed <italic>in utero versus ex utero</italic>, we focused on a single strain (JU751, Class IIIB) with constitutively strong egg retention. First, we selected an osmotic stress condition (15h exposure to 0.3M NaCl), which caused relatively low embryonic mortality when eggs were exposed to this treatment <italic>ex utero</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). We then followed surviving individuals to score their lifetime reproductive success under selfing. We found that fertility of individuals derived from stress-exposed eggs <italic>ex utero</italic> was reduced compared to the ones derived from eggs <italic>in utero</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref>). Second, we treated eggs <italic>in utero versus ex utero</italic> with a low concentration of acetic acid (1M) for 15 minutes. This treatment was lethal for mothers but did not cause any mortality of embryos laid <italic>ex utero</italic>. Yet, individuals derived from <italic>ex utero</italic> eggs developed more slowly and exhibited significantly delayed reproductive maturity (but not reduced fertility) compared to individuals that hatched from eggs <italic>in utero</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">I</xref>). In addition, larvae <italic>in utero</italic> at the time of stress exposure were also protected by their mother’s body and produced as many offspring as animals in control conditions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8I</xref>). In contrast, larvae were killed instantly if exposed to this stress <italic>ex utero</italic>. Together, our experimental results suggest that constitutively strong egg retention can enhance maternal protection of offspring by protecting a relatively larger number of eggs <italic>in utero</italic> when facing a sudden environmental perturbation. Prolonged egg retention will also reduce the total time of external exposure of the immobile embryonic stage, thus likely lowering risks associated with diverse environmental threats, including predators and pathogens.</p>

<title>Natural variation in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> egg laying modulates an intergenerational fitness trade-off</title>
<p>Taken together, our experimental results suggest that the degree of <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention alters the interplay of antagonistic effects on maternal versus offspring fitness. On the one hand, strong egg retention reduces maternal survival and reproduction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>); on the other, by prolonging intra-uterine embryonic development, offspring may benefit from improved competitive ability (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) and protection against environmental insults (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Therefore, variable egg retention, as observed in natural <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations, may reflect genetic differences in the adjustment of an intergenerational fitness trade-off. In extreme cases of strong constitutive egg retention, <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains exhibit partial viviparity, associated with significantly reduced maternal reproduction and survival. Overall, observed genetically variable duration of intra-uterine development in <italic>C. elegans</italic> thus seems to align well with past reports showing that transitions towards viviparity incur maternal fitness costs as observed for diverse invertebrate and vertebrate taxa with both inter- and intraspecific differences in parity modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avise, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Blackburn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Horváth and Kalinka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kalinka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ostrovsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Whittington et al., 2022</xref>). To what extent this apparent intergenerational fitness trade-off in <italic>C. elegans</italic> could involve shaped by parent-offspring conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Trivers, 1974</xref>) is uncertain. However, given the nearly exclusive selfing mode of reproduction in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Barrière and Félix, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lee et al., 2021</xref>), we expect none to very little genetic disparity between hermaphrodite mothers and offspring, indicating much reduced opportunities for intergenerational conflict. Observed natural differences in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention are therefore predicted to reflect properties of genetically distinct (effectively clonally propagating) genotypes, likely resulting from adaptation to distinct ecological niches differing in nature, fluctuations and predictability of resource availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Blackburn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Dey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Horváth and Kalinka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kalinka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Meier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Mueller and Bitner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Trexler and DeAngelis, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study has quantified and characterized natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention and egg-laying behaviour, resulting in the following main findings: (1) <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits quantitative variation in egg retention, with rare instances of extreme phenotypes at either end of the spectrum. (2) Both common and rare genetic variants underlie observed phenotypic variation. (3) Strain differences in egg retention can be largely explained by differences in egg-laying behaviour, such as the onset of egg laying activity and timing of the rhythm between active and inactive egg-laying phases. (4) These behavioural differences map, at least partly, to genetic differences in the sensitivity to various neuromodulators, indicative of natural variation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying circuitry. (5) Modified egg-laying behaviour causing strong egg retention – linked to frequent larval hatching <italic>in utero</italic> – negatively impacts maternal fitness, but (6) prolonged intra-uterine embryonic development may benefit offspring by improving their competitive ability and protection against environmental insults. (7) Hence, variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention may reflect variation in a trade-off between antagonistic effects acting on maternal versus offspring fitness.</p>
<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention is a quantitative (complex) trait: observed phenotypic distribution and GWA mapping indicate that this trait is likely influenced by multiple loci of small effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mackay et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, large-effect variants, such as KCNL-1 V530L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>), occur but they seem to be relatively rare. Although variation in reproductive processes, such as self-sperm production and ovulation rates, contributes to observed variation in egg number <italic>in utero</italic>, we also present clear evidence for natural variation in egg-laying behaviour and involved neuromodulatory processes. How such behavioural differences arise through modification of specific cellular and physiological processes and how these, in turn, are mediated by specific molecular alterations of genes in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying system remains to be elucidated. The genetics of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying circuit has been studied for decades, and dozens of genes have been identified by mutations, which either reduce or increase egg-laying activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Schafer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Trent et al., 1983</xref>). Some of the identified genes encode ion channels regulating cell and synaptic electrical excitability, others encode components of G-protein signalling pathways that act in specific cells of the circuit. Many more genes transmitting environmental and physiological signals via sensory processing are known to regulate <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Banerjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Fenk and Bono, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Schafer, 2006</xref>). Moreover, recent research has uncovered an important role of muscle-directed mechanisms regulating egg-laying through sensation of internal stretch mediated by egg accumulation <italic>in utero</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Medrano and Collins, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Ravi et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">2018</xref>). This stretch-dependent homeostat directly targets vulval muscles and is sufficient to trigger egg laying when synaptic transmission is reduced or defective, for example, in the absence of HSN command neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Medrano and Collins, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Ravi et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">2018</xref>). The observation of extensive natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention indicates that egg-laying behaviour is likely driven by evolutionary changes of muscle-directed signalling components, for example, by altering the degree of vulva muscle sensitivity in response internal stretch signals. The overall challenge will therefore be to understand how such modifications in mechanosensory feedback interact with other apparent changes in synaptic transmission to explain the natural diversity in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying neural circuit. In addition, we cannot exclude that natural variation in egg-laying behaviour may arise through differential activity of developmental genes generating variation in the neuroanatomy of the egg-laying circuit itself, e.g. as observed between different <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Loer and Rivard, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, the only known natural variant modulating <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg laying is the major-effect variant KCNL-1 V530L, which reduces egg laying through likely hyperpolarization of vulval muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>), so that stimuli, such as mechanosensory inputs, are insufficient to trigger regular and successful egg-laying events. Our new results show that other unknown variants must cause the strong reduction of egg-laying activity in Class IIIA strains. Although our experimental results do not hint at any variants in specific candidate genes or processes, we detected strong differences in the serotonin response between Class IIIA strains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Exogenous serotonin stimulated egg laying in all Class IIIA strains except in JU2829, where it inhibited egg laying as observed for Class IIIB strains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). This suggests that JU2829 might carry a variant with effects like KCNL-1 V530L, whereas variants with distinct functional effects would explain reduced egg-laying activity in other Class IIIA strains. The detection of both strong and subtle strain variation in egg-laying activity (also between strains within the same Class), as revealed by our pharmacological assays and when analysing the effects of <italic>mod-5(lf)</italic> in different strains, indicates the presence of many different natural variants that modulate egg-laying circuitry in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. It seems unlikely, however, that any of these variants strongly alter central function of HSN and HSN-mediated signalling because fluoxetine and imipramine, known to act via HSN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dempsey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Trent et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Weinshenker et al., 1995</xref>), triggered a robust stimulatory effect on egg laying in all examined strains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Future experiments aimed at the molecular identification of specific variants will thus be essential to explore how the nematode egg-laying circuit evolves at the intraspecific level.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous reports on the apparent costs of transitioning from oviparity to obligate and facultative viviparity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avise, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Horváth and Kalinka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kalinka, 2015</xref>), we found that increased <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention lowers maternal survival and fecundity. We then show that fitness costs associated with strong egg retention are potentially offset by improved offspring competitive ability and protection against environmental perturbations. To what extent our highly simplified, artificial experimental conditions recapitulate relevant ecological scenarios encountered by natural <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations remains to be explored. The likely ecological factors shaping natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention are thus unknown and we have not found any obvious links between the degree of egg retention and habitat parameters, such as substrate type or climate. However, the likely ancestral (divergent) strains only very rarely exhibited a Class III phenotype, which could indicate that derived state of strong egg retention may have been favoured by the exploitation of novel microhabitats during the historically recent expansion of <italic>C. elegans</italic> reflected by globally distributed, swept haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lee et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The typical <italic>C. elegans</italic> habitat is highly ephemeral in nature, exhibiting extreme fluctuations in nutrient availability and occurrence of diverse abiotic and biotic variables, including stressors and pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Frezal and Félix, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schulenburg and Félix, 2017</xref>). A critical omission in our study is therefore the analysis of plasticity in egg retention and egg-laying behaviour in different or fluctuating environments. <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg laying is known to be highly plastic, strongly modulated by subtle and very diverse environmental factors, so that our analyses in standard laboratory conditions can only capture fractions of the complexity. Most prominently, diverse environmental stimuli (food quantity and quality, osmotic or hypoxic stress, pathogens, etc.) have inhibitory effects on egg laying and long-term exposure to these stimuli will lead to strong egg retention and matricidal hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aballay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Chen and Caswell-Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Fenk and Bono, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Mcmullen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Schafer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Trent, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vigne et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Waggoner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Future research will therefore require to carefully examine how such environmental effects modulate egg laying and fitness consequences in strains with the here reported differences in constitutive egg retention. In particular, plastically induced egg retention and matricidal hatching by prolonged starvation may allow for nutrient provisioning of internally hatched larvae as they can consume debris stemming from the decaying mother, hence allowing for developmental growth in the absence of external food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chen and Caswell-Chen, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2003</xref>). Future experiments should therefore specifically test if internally hatched larvae in Class III strains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) may gain a further advantage through maternal provisioning while developing <italic>in utero</italic>, specifically when exposed to long-term conditions inhibiting egg laying, such as starvation.</p>
<p>The existence of pronounced natural variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention and egg-laying behaviour generates novel opportunities to dissect the molecular genetic basis of intraspecific variation in egg retention, providing an entry point to understand the proximate mechanisms underlying evolutionary transitions between invertebrate ovi- and viviparity. In contrast to vertebrate taxa with intraspecific variation in parity mode, such as certain lizards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Recknagel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Whittington et al., 2022</xref>), the <italic>C. elegans</italic> model allows for rapid and powerful genetic analysis, e.g. through linkage mapping of natural variants and subsequent functional validation of variants by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in multiple strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Evans et al., 2021</xref>). Identifying the precise changes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying circuitry that have led to variation in egg retention may also generate insights into the genetic basis of evolutionary diversification of parity mode across species and genera. Nematodes display extensive variation in parity mode, with frequent transitions to obligate viviparity in many distinct genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ostrovsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sudhaus, 1976</xref>), including in the genus <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>, with at least one fully viviparous species, <italic>C. vivipara</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Stevens et al., 2019</xref>). Resolving the genetic basis of intraspecific variation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg retention, including partial or facultative viviparity, may thus shed light on the molecular changes underlying the initial steps of evolutionary transitions from oviparity to obligate viviparity in invertebrates.</p>

<title>Effect of strong egg retention on progeny development and reproduction in response to mild environmental stressors (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">I</xref>)</title>
<p>Eggs from adult JU751 hermaphrodites (mid-L4 + 36h) or L1 larvae from mid-L4 + 48h mothers were exposed either directly (ex utero) or indirectly (in utero) to mild environmental stressors: hyperosmotic stress (0.3M to 1M NaCl; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">G</xref>) and 1M acetic acid (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">I</xref>). Eggs were then allowed to hatch and develop for 45 hours, at which time we determined their developmental stages. To calculate differences in developmental maturation, we used a semi-quantitative scoring system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Poullet et al., 2016</xref>) to assign each developmental stage a specific index as follows: L3 = 1; early mid-L4 = 2; midL4 = 3; lateL4 = 4; Adult = 5. Lifetime offspring production of individuals descending from eggs and L1 larvae that had survived environmental insult and reached maturity was assayed as described for <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study provides a panoramic view of the spectrum of natural variation in C. elegans egglaying behavior, begins to illuminate molecular and genetic influences underlying this variation, and reveals how distinct egglaying behaviors might impact maternal and offspring fitness in diverse environmental conditions. The evidence supporting the authors' conclusions is <bold>convincing</bold>. This work establishes intraspecific variation in C. elegans egglaying behavior as a model for elucidating the genetic basis for evolutionary transitions between oviparity and viviparity. As such, it will be of interest to evolutionary biologists studying molecular mechanisms underlying fitness tradeoffs between parent and offspring that influence adaptation to changing environments.</p>

<p>Mignerot et al. performed a Herculean effort to measure and describe natural variation in C. elegans egg-laying behavior and egg retention. The paper is well written and organized, but almost seems like two papers in one. However, I understand the desire to put these stories together. The authors show wild strains vary in egg retention with some extremes that appear phenotypically similar to species with viviparity (or live birth / internal hatching of offspring). They previously published a rare variant in the gene kcnl-1 that plays a role in egg retention but identify common variants in this study. They classify wild strains based on egg-retention to separate out the extremely different isolates. Egg laying has been extensively studied in the laboratory strain N2, but rarely addressed in natural strains. The authors investigate egg-laying behaviors using standard assays and find that their classified egg-laying groups have differences in sub-behaviors suggesting diverse roles in the ultimate egg-laying output. Then, they turn to the egg-laying circuit using both exogenous serotonin (5-HT), 5-HT modulatory drugs (e.g. SSRIs), and even genome editing to test epistasis with the mod-5 5-HT reuptake. The effects of 5-HT modulation and mutants are not predictive based on the basal behaviors and egg-retention phenotypes with the most extreme egg-retention strains differing in their responses. Interestingly, strains with more egg retention have decreased fitness (in their laboratory) measures but also provide a protective environment for offspring when exposed to common &quot;natural&quot; stressors. Their final conclusion that egg retention could be a trade-off between antagonistic effects of maternal vs. offspring fitness is supported well and sets the stage for future mechanistic studies across Caenorhabditis.</p>

<p>Mignerot et al. study variations in egg retention in a large set of wild C. elegans strains using detailed analysis of a subset of these strains to those that these variations in egg retention appear to arise from variations in egg-laying behavior. The authors then take advantage of the advanced genetic technology available in C. elegans, and the fact that the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive egg-laying behavior in the N2 laboratory strain of C. elegans have been studied intensely for decades. Thus, they demonstrate that variations in multiple genetic loci appear to drive variations in egg laying across species, although they are unable to identify the specific genes that vary other than a potassium channel already identified in a previous study from some of these same authors (Vigne et al., 2021). Mignerot et al. also present evidence that variations in the response of the egg-laying system to the neuromodulator serotonin appear to underlie variations in egg-laying behavior across species. Finally, the authors present a series of studies examining how the retention of eggs in utero affects the fertility and survival of mothers versus the survival of their progeny in a variety of adverse conditions, including limiting food, and the presence of acute environmental insults such as alcohol or acid. The results suggest that variations in egg-laying behavior evolved as a response to adverse environmental conditions that impose a trade-off between survival of the mothers versus their progeny.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The analysis of variations in egg laying by a large set of wild species significantly extends the previous work of Vigne et al. (2021), who focused on just one wild variant strain. Mignerot finds that variations in egg laying are widespread across C. elegans strains and result from changes in multiple genetic loci.</p>
<p>To determine why various strains vary in their egg-laying behavior, the authors take advantage of the genetic tractability of C. elegans and the huge body of previous studies on the cellular and molecular basis of egg-laying behavior in the laboratory N2 strain. Since serotonin is one signal that induces egg laying, the authors subject various strains to serotonin and to drugs thought to alter serotonin signaling, and they also use CRISPR induced gene editing to mutate a serotonin reuptake transporter in some strains. The results are largely consistent with the idea that variations across strains alter how the egg-laying system responds to serotonin.</p>
<p>The final figures in the paper present a far more detailed analysis than Vigne et al. (2021) of how variations in egg retention across species can affect fitness under various environmental stresses. Thus, Mignerot et al. look at competition under conditions of limiting food, and response to acute environmental insults, and compare the ability of adults, in utero eggs, and ex vivo eggs to survive. The results lead to an interesting discussion of how variations in behavior result in a trade-off in survival of mothers versus their progeny. The authors in their Discussion do a good job describing the challenges in interpreting the relevance of these laboratory results to the poorly-understood environmental conditions that C. elegans may experience in the wild. The Discussion also had an excellent section about how the ability of a single species to strongly regulate egg-laying behavior in response to its environment, and how this ability could be adaptive. Overall, these were the strongest and most interesting aspects of Mignerot et al.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>
The specific potassium channel variation studied by Vigne et al. (2021) has by far the strongest effect on egg laying seen in the Mignerot et al. study and remains the only genetic variation that has been molecularly identified. So, Mignerot et al. were not able to identify any additional specific genes that vary across species to cause changes in egg laying, and this limited their ability to generate new insights into the specific cellular and molecular mechanisms that have changed across species to result in changes in egg laying behavior.</p>
<p>The authors' use of drug treatments and CRISPR to alter serotonin signaling yielded some insights into mechanistic variations in how the egg-laying system functions across strains, but these experiments only allow very indirect inferences into what is going on. The analysis in Figures 4 and 5 generates a complex set of results that are not easy to interpret. The clearest result seems to be that strains carrying the KCNL-1 point mutation lay eggs poorly and exogenous serotonin inhibits rather than stimulates egg laying in these strains. This basic result was to a large extent reported previously in Vigne et al. 2021.</p>
<p>The analysis of egg-laying behavior in Figure 3 is relatively weak. Whereas the state of the art in analyzing this behavior is to take videos of animals and track exactly when they lay eggs, the authors used a lower-tech method of just examining how many eggs were laid within 5 minute intervals. It is not clear that this allows adequate resolution to determine if the strains examined actually have clusters of egg-laying events (i.e. active phases) or not, so the entire analysis of active and inactive phase intervals seemed dubious. It was unclear that this analysis demonstrated differences in the patterns of egg-laying behavior between strains that could be sufficient to explain the differences in accumulation of unlaid eggs between these strains. In contrast, the variations in Fig 3G and 3H between strains were very strong. It is not clear why the authors did not focus more on these differences as being possibly largely responsible for the differences in egg retention between strains. In the discussion, the authors extensively write about the work of the Collins lab showing that retained eggs stretch the uterus to produce a signal that activates egg-laying muscles. Could it be that really this mechanism is the main one that varies between strains, leading to the observed variations in time to laying the first egg as well as variations in the number of retained eggs throughout adulthood?</p>
