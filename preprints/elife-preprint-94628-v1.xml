<title>Abstract</title><p>The Target of Rapamycin kinase Complex I (TORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism in eukaryotes. Previous studies have shown that, in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, nitrogen and amino acid signals activate TORC1 via the highly conserved small GTPases, Gtr1/2, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding protein, Pib2. However, it was unclear if/how Gtr1/2 and Pib2 cooperate to control TORC1. Here we report that this dual regulator system pushes TORC1 into three distinct signaling states: (i) a Gtr1/2 on, Pib2 on, rapid growth state in nutrient replete conditions; (ii) a Gtr1/2 off, Pib2 on, adaptive/slow growth state in poor-quality growth medium; and (iii) a Gtr1/2 off, Pib2 off, quiescent state in starvation conditions. We suggest that other signaling pathways work in a similar way, to drive a multi-level response via a single kinase, but the behavior has been overlooked since most studies follow signaling to a single reporter protein.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Target of Rapamycin kinase Complex 1 (TORC1) is the master regulator of cell growth and metabolism in eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In the presence of pro-growth hormones and abundant nutrients, TORC1 is active and drives growth by stimulating protein, ribosome, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In contrast, when hormone or nutrient levels drop, TORC1 is inhibited, causing the cell to switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism and eventually enter a quiescent state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Numerous proteins and pathways have been shown to regulate TORC1, including: (i) the small GTPases Rag A/B and C/D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and the associated GTPase Activation Protein (GAP), GATOR1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>; (ii) the small GTPase Rheb and its associated GAP, the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>; (iii) the AMP activated protein kinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>; (iv) the Nemo-like kinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>; (v) the cAMP-dependent protein kinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>; and (vi) the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, it remains unclear how the proteins/pathways listed above (and others) cooperate to control TORC1.</p>
<p>Here, to address this question, we examine signal integration at TORC1 in the simple model organism, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.</p>
<p>Previous work in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has shown that:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Amino acid and nitrogen signals are transmitted to TORC1 via a heterodimeric pair of small GTPases that are homologous to RagA/B and RagC/D, called Gtr1 and Gtr2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Specifically, when cells are grown in medium containing a high concentration of amino acids (or a high-quality nitrogen source), Gtr1/2 are in their GTP and GDP bound forms, respectively, and bind to/activate TORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, once amino acid/nitrogen levels fall, SEAC (a homolog of GATOR1/2) triggers GTP hydrolysis at Gtr1 to drive the complex into the Gtr1-GDP, Gtr2-GTP bound state, and inhibit TORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>TORC1 is also regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding protein, Pib2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Much less is known about Pib2 than Gtr1/2, but several facts are clear: First, Pib2 binds directly to TORC1 and activates the complex via its highly conserved C-terminal domain (CAD) domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Second, Pib2 can repress TORC1 via its N-terminal inhibitory domain (NID)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Third, Pib2 activates TORC1 in response to glutamine—at least <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>But how and why do Gtr1/2 and Pib2 work together to regulate TORC1?</p>
<p>Most data suggest that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 act in parallel (redundantly) to activate TORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. For example, yeast missing either Gtr1/2 or Pib2 grow well in nutrient rich media, while <italic>gtr1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>τι<italic>pib2</italic>τι cells are sick/dead (a phenotype that can be rescued by a hyperactive TOR allele)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Furthermore, <italic>gtr1/2</italic>τι and <italic>pib2</italic>τι cells have full TORC1 activity as measured by the downstream reporters phospho-Rps6 and Sch9, while transient repression of Pib2 in a <italic>gtr1/2</italic>τι cell line blocks TORC1 signaling to these same proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>However, other data suggest that the impact that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 have on TORC1 signaling is more complex: First, <italic>gtr1</italic>τι, <italic>gtr2</italic>τι, <italic>gtr1/2</italic>τι and <italic>pib2</italic>τι cells are all hypersensitive to the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Second, both <italic>gtr1/2</italic>τι and <italic>pib2</italic>τι cells fail to activate TORC1 when leucine or glutamine are added back to cells treated with rapamycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Third, phosphorylation of the TORC1 target Npr1, and its substrate Par32, are sensitive to deletion of either Pib2 or Gtr1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this report, we build on the previous studies by examining the impact that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 have on TORC1 signaling across the proteome, using a combination of phosphoproteomics and standard reporter assays. The resulting data show that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 are both required for full TORC1 activation. Importantly, however, deletion of Gtr1/2 or Pib2 only blocks signaling to a subset of the TORC1 substrates—primarily those involved in amino acid metabolism and nutrient transport. These observations lead us to propose a new model where partial starvation triggers metabolic reprograming via TORC1 (by inactivating Gtr1/2 or Pib2) but does not block cell growth. And in follow up experiments, we confirm that this is, indeed, the case. Specifically, we show that when yeast are first transferred from medium containing a high quality nitrogen source, to medium containing a low quality nitrogen source, TORC1 is completely inhibited to block growth and activate metabolic reprogramming. Then, as the cells adapt to the low-quality nitrogen source, Pib2 is turned on again to re-initiate growth, while Gtr1/2 remains mostly off to ensure that the cells continue to activate the metabolic pathways and transporters necessary for adaptation/survival.</p>
<p>Thus, the TORC1 circuit in yeast uses two different amino acid/nitrogen signaling proteins to drive the cell into a rapid growth state, an adaptive growth state, or a quiescent state, depending on the environmental conditions. We argue that other signaling pathways probably work in a similar way, but multi-level responses are overlooked since most studies follow signaling to a single reporter.</p>

<title>Reporter (pRps6) based analysis of Gtr1/2 and Pib2 dependent signaling</title>
<p>Gtr1/2 and Pib2 are thought to transmit leucine, glutamine, and other amino acid signals to TORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. To test this model and learn more about the cooperation between Gtr1/2 and Pib2, we followed the phosphorylation of a downstream reporter of TORC1 activity (Rps6) in wild-type, <italic>gtr1</italic>τ&lt;, and <italic>pib2</italic>τ&lt; cells during amino acid starvation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. These experiments showed that all three strains have the same TORC1 activity in nutrient replete medium (time 0, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), consistent with the idea that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 work in parallel (redundantly) to activate TORC1. These experiments also showed that TORC1 turns off efficiently in the absence of Gtr1 or Pib2 during leucine and complete amino acid starvation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). However, the results in glutamine starvation stood out; TORC1 remained active in the wild-type strain, and partially active in the <italic>pib2</italic>τ&lt; strain, but was rapidly inhibited in the <italic>gtr1</italic>τ&lt; strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To learn more about the interaction between Gtr1/2 and Pib2 during glutamine starvation, we followed Rps6 phosphorylation in cells missing the N-terminal inhibitory domain of Pib2 (<italic>pib2NID</italic>τ&lt;). The <italic>pib2NID</italic>τ&lt; mutation completely blocked TORC1 inhibition in the <italic>gtr1</italic>τ&lt; background but had no impact on TORC1 signaling in a wild-type background (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>), demonstrating that Pib2 helps drive TORC1 inactivation during glutamine starvation (at least in the absence of Gtr1).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="570342v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We then measured Rps6 phosphorylation in a strain missing both Gtr1 and Gtr2 (<italic>gtr1</italic>1&lt;<italic>gtr2</italic>1&lt;), and a strain carrying mutations that lock Gtr1 and 2 into their inactive Gtr1-GDP and Gtr2-GTP bound forms (Gtr1<sup>S20L</sup> and Gtr2<sup>Q66L</sup>; Gtr1/2<sup>off</sup> for short<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>). To our surprise, TORC1 remained active in both strains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>), demonstrating that Pib2 can only inhibit TORC1 during glutamine starvation in strains where the Gtr1/2 complex is partially disrupted (<italic>gtr1</italic>1&lt; and <italic>gtr2</italic>1&lt; strains) but not completely absent or inactive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>).</p>
<p>We also saw the same pattern when we examined cell survival in glutamine starvation. Wild-type, <italic>pib2</italic>1&lt;, <italic>pib2NID</italic>1&lt;, <italic>pib2NID</italic>1&lt;<italic>gtr1</italic>1&lt;, Gtr1/2<sup>off</sup>, and the other cell lines that failed to inactivate TORC1, all die at a higher rate during glutamine starvation than the <italic>gtr1</italic>1&lt; and <italic>gtr2</italic>1&lt; cells--presumably because they do not arrest cell growth in a timely manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, then, most of our measurements of Rps6 signaling and cell death fit with the prevailing model of TORC1 regulation, where Gtr1/2 and Pib2 (i) act in parallel (redundantly) to activate TORC1 in nutrient replete conditions, and (ii) are switched off during amino acid starvation to inhibit TORC1. However, we were left with a puzzle. Our data also revealed that Pib2 can transmit glutamine starvation signals to TORC1, but those signals have little to no impact on TORC1 activity in the presence of an intact Gtr1/2 complex. Why would this be? We hypothesized that signals transmitted through Pib2 alone, or Gtr1/2 alone, do impact TORC1 signaling in a wild-type background, but the response is just not apparent at the level of Rps6 phosphorylation.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Proteome wide analysis of Gtr1/2 and Pib2 dependent signaling</title>
<p>To learn more about Gtr1/2 and Pib2 signaling, we used mass spectrometry to quantify the global protein phosphorylation levels in wild-type, <italic>gtr1</italic>1&lt;<italic>gtr2</italic>1&lt;, and <italic>pib2</italic>1&lt; cells grown in nutrient replete medium (SC), and in wild-type cells treated with the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin (all in quadruplicate). In the end, we were able to quantify the level of 7807 phosphopeptides (covering 5325 phosphosites on 1686 proteins) across the 16 samples (Table S1). 445 of these phosphopeptides (covering 362 phosphosites on 301 proteins) were up-or down-regulated in response to rapamycin treatment, deletion of Gtr1/2, and/or the deletion of Pib2 (&gt;2-fold change and p&lt;0.01 in one or more strain/condition). More specifically, 175 phosphopeptides were down-regulated in rapamycin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), 187 phosphopeptides were up-regulated in rapamycin (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4S1</xref>), and 83 phosphopeptides were up or down regulated in the <italic>gtr1</italic>1&lt;<italic>gtr2</italic>1&lt; or <italic>pib2</italic>1&lt; cells, but not in the rapamycin treated cells (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4S2</xref>).</p>

<p>We focused our analysis on the 175 phosphopeptides that are downregulated in rapamycin since they cover most of the well-known targets of TORC1 and its downstream effectors, including Sch9, Tod6, Maf1, Stb3, Ypk3, Atg13, Mks1, Nnk1, Npr1, Par32, Avt1, Avt4, Sky1, Gat1, Gln3, Ume6, Rtg3, Lst4, Gcn2, Tco89, Ssd1, and Stp1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. This dataset revealed two novel aspects of Gtr1/2 and Pib2 signaling. First, TORC1 drives the phosphorylation of several residues near the N-termini of Ser3 and Ser33 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>, 4), homologous 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases that catalyze the first step in serine and glycine synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Remarkably, these phosphorylation reactions are completely dependent on Pib2, but are not altered in the <italic>gtr1</italic>1&lt;<italic>gtr2</italic>1&lt; strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>, 4). Second, many TORC1 dependent phosphorylation events (outside of Ser3/33) depend heavily on <italic>both</italic> Pib2 and Gtr1/2 (green labels, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, and left columns, Figs. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">4S1</xref>). However, other phosphorylation events are unperturbed by the deletion of Gtr1/2 or Pib2 (blue labels, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and right columns, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">4S1</xref>). In fact, there is a strong correlation between the impact that Pib2 and Gtr1/2 have on the TORC1 dependent phosphorylation (R=0.70 excluding Ser3/33; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), but that impact runs the gamut from matching the impact of rapamycin, to zero (top left, to bottom right, continuum; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">4S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Examining the list of proteins that are heavily dependent on Pib2 and Gtr1/2, we noticed an obvious trend; 8/11 of the proteins with the strongest reliance on Pib2 and Gtr1/2 are involved in nutrient transport and utilization (top left column, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). These proteins include the amino acid transporters Bap2, Agp1, Gnp1 and Hip1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>; the zinc transporter Zrt3 and the Zinc-regulated transcription factor, Zap1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>; the hexose transporter Hxt1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>; and the TORC1 dependent regulator of amino acid transporter activity, Par32<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. This trend was also clear when we carried out GO analysis on the full list of Gtr1/2 and Pib2 dependent proteins (left column, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), which includes the key TORC1 dependent regulator of amino acid metabolism, Npr1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, and the amino acid transporter Tat1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> (amino acid and aromatic amino acid transporter activity were the top hits; p=1e-4).</p>
<p>In contrast, the proteins that are dependent on TORC1, but not Gtr1/2 or Pib2 (right column, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), tend to be involved in cell signaling (p=1e-4) and the regulation of cell growth (biosynthetic processes, p=9e-3). This group of proteins includes many of the key regulators of ribosome and protein synthesis, including Sch9, Maf1, Stb3, Gcn2, and Kcs1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, as well as the stress response factor Hsf1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> and the autophagy regulator Ksp1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and right column, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the view of Gtr1/2 and Pib2 signaling that we and others built up by following Rps6 phosphorylation is misleading (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Gtr1/2 and Pib2 do not act redundantly during steady state growth, but instead, are both required for full TORC1 activation. It is just that some TORC1 pathway targets (like Rps6) are efficiently phosphorylated even when TORC1 is partially active.</p>

<title>TORC1 and Pib2 dependent regulation of Ser33</title>
<p>To gain insight into the function of, and mechanism underlying, TORC1 and Pib2 dependent signaling to Ser33 (the dominant enzyme in the Ser3/33 pair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>) we first set out map the TORC1 dependent phosphorylation sites on Ser33. Our global phosphoproteomics experiments had already identified serine 20, 22, 28, and 29 as TORC1 and Pib2 dependent sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, to see if we missed any sites due to under-sampling, we also immunopurified Ser33-FLAG from cells grown in SD medium +/-rapamycin and mapped the phosphorylation sites using mass spectrometry. These experiments (and previously published phosphoproteomics data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>) indicated that serine 27, serine 33, and threonine 31 are also TORC1 dependent sites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>; Table S2).</p>

<p>Next, we wanted to identify the stimuli that impact TORC1 signaling to Ser33. Using Phostag gel electrophoresis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, we found that rapamycin, glucose starvation, and complete nitrogen starvation (but not amino acid starvation) all lead to the rapid dephosphorylation of Ser33 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). As expected, mutation of the seven TORC1 dependent phosphorylation sites listed above to alanine, or deletion of Pib2, also blocked the rapamycin dependent phosphorylation events detected on the gel (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5c</xref>, d).</p>
<p>The pattern of regulation seen for Ser33—with strong glucose, rapamycin and nitrogen, but limited amino acid, dependence—matched that seen previously for Sch9/Rps6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, leading to the question; what, if any, unique property (or properties) does TORC1-Pib2 dependent signaling to Ser33 have? To address this question, we first measured Ser33 phosphorylation during leucine and glutamine starvation. Here, we saw slow dephosphorylation in leucine starvation, and no change in glutamine starvation, just as with Rps6 (compare <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We then wondered if TORC1-Pib2 signaling to Ser33 responds to the quality of the nitrogen source in the growth medium. To test this, we followed Ser33 phosphorylation in a prototrophic strain as it transitioned from growth in a poor-quality nitrogen source (proline medium) to a high-quality nitrogen source (glutamine medium)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. This experiment revealed that Ser33 phosphorylation is exquisitely sensitive to the quality of the amino acid/nitrogen source, with the TORC1 dependent sites going from unphosphorylated in proline, to &gt;80% phosphorylated in glutamine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5f</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5S1a, b</xref>). Other substrates we looked at (as detailed in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) do not behave in this manner, suggesting that the Pib2 dependence underlies this unique connection between TORC1 and Ser33.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="570342v1_fig6.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We also wanted to understand why the TORC1 dependent phosphorylation of Ser33 (and Ser3) requires Pib2. To address this question, we examined our recently published interactome data for Kog1 (the major regulatory subunit in TORC1) and Pib2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. This analysis revealed that Ser3 and Ser33 are two out of a total of six proteins that are captured at a significantly higher level in a Pib2 immunopurification than in a Kog1 immunopurification (out of &gt;200 proteins enriched in the Kog1 IP), suggesting that Ser3 and Ser33 bind to Pib2 and not TORC1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5S</xref>1d). In line with this, we found that Ser33-HA is enriched in a Pib2 purification (2.5-fold) but not a Gtr1/2 purification (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, to see if the TORC1 and Pib2 dependent phosphorylation of Ser33 is important for cell function, we followed the growth of phosphonull (S7A) and phosphomimic (S7D) versions of Ser33 in medium missing serine and glycine (in a Ser3 delete background). These experiments showed that the phosphonull (but not the phosphomimic) strain has a significant delay exiting quiescence, but then grows at the same rate as the wild-type strain once it is dividing rapidly (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>). These data suggest (but do not prove) that the TORC1 and Pib2 dependent phosphorylation of Ser33 helps drive serine and glycine synthesis as cells transition into a rapid growth state, but TORC1 dependent phosphorylation is not required to maintain basal Ser33 activity during log phase growth.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Multilevel signaling through TORC1</title>
<p>Our discovery that the deletion of Gtr1/2 or Pib2 leads to a change in TORC1 signaling through some substrates (particularly those involved in amino acid transport and metabolism), but not those involved in cell growth control, led us to hypothesize that the TORC1 pathway can take up three distinct signaling states (the first two of which are well known; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>): (I) A fully active state to promote cell growth and inhibit the Npr1 dependent amino acid starvation response. (II) An inactive state to block cell growth and activate the Npr1 dependent amino acid starvation response. (III) A partially active state to simultaneously promote cell growth and activate the Npr1 dependent amino acid starvation response.</p>
<p>To test this model (i.e. see if State III exists in a wild-type strain), we needed reliable reporters of the TORC1 dependent cell growth and amino acid starvation responses. We therefore turned to two well established assays:</p>
<p>First, to follow the cell growth response, we monitored the phosphorylation of cleaved Sch9 using an SDS-PAGE mobility assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. This assay follows the phosphorylation of seven TORC1 target sites at the C-terminus of Sch9, known to play a key role in activating the kinase and protein synthesis. These C-terminal sites remain phosphorylated in the Gtr1/2 and Pib2 delete strains (Ser 723 and 726; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and right column <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, to follow the TORC1 dependent amino acid starvation response, we monitored the phosphorylation of full length Par32 using an SDS-PAGE mobility assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Par32 regulates amino acid transporter activity and is a substrate/reporter for the key TORC1 dependent amino acid starvation response regulator, Npr1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Importantly, both Par32 and Npr1 are highly sensitive to the deletion of Gtr1/2 or Pib2 (left columns; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">4S1</xref>). In the case of Par32, some sites are dephosphorylated in rapamycin and the mutant strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and left column, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), while others (targeted by Npr1, a kinase that is repressed by TORC1) are hyperphosphorylated in rapamycin and the mutant strains (left column, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4S1</xref>). As a result, Par32 exists in a partially phosphorylated state in synthetic complete medium (SC) and then shifts to a hyperphosphorylated (slow migrating) state during amino acid starvation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>), and in <italic>gtr1</italic>1&lt;<italic>gtr2</italic>1&lt; and <italic>pib2</italic>1&lt; cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>).</p>
<p>Once we established the Par32 and Sch9 reporter assays, we looked to see if transferring a prototrophic strain from medium that contains an excess of all 20 amino acids (SC), to medium containing a single high quality nitrogen source (glutamine) or a single poor quality nitrogen source (leucine or proline), pushes the cell into the predicted Sch9 on and Par32 on, intermediate signaling state (State III). This was not the case: In glutamine medium, the intermediate signaling state was populated for a short time (2.5 and 5 min; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>), but Par32 was dephosphorylated again after 10 min (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). In leucine medium, we also saw transient population of the intermediate state, but here Sch9 was entirely dephosphorylated after 30 min (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Finally, in proline medium, we saw a transition into the complete starvation state (State II), where Par32 is phosphorylated and Sch9 is dephosphorylated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we looked to see if the intermediate state is populated as cells transition from growth in a poor-quality nitrogen source (proline) to a high-quality nitrogen source (glutamine). This was the case, and to our surprise, TORC1 was already in the intermediate (Sch9 on, Par32 on) signaling state during steady state growth in proline medium (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). Thus, it appeared that the TORC1 pathway is driven into a complete starvation state (State II) when cells are first exposed to a poor nitrogen source (2.5-60 min, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>) but then transitions into the intermediate signaling state (State III) as the cells adapt to the poor growth conditions (time 0, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p>
<p>To test this model further, we grew a prototrophic strain in glutamine medium and transferred it to proline medium, but this time followed Par32, Sch9, (and Npr1) phosphorylation for four hours. As predicted, Sch9 was dephosphorylated initially, but then reactivated (phosphorylated) over time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6e</xref>). In contrast, Par32 and Npr1 remained in their active forms (highly phosphorylated and dephosphorylated, respectively) during the entire time-course (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>).</p>
<p>We also carried out the same experiment in a <italic>npr1</italic>1&lt; strain to test the prediction that the adaptation to a poor-quality nitrogen source is driven by the activation of Npr1 and Par32. This was the case, as Sch9 remained dephosphorylated during the entire time course in <italic>npr1</italic>1&lt; cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>).</p>
<p>The observation that cells growing at steady state in synthetic complete medium (SC), or glutamine medium, activate Sch9 and inhibit the Npr1-Par32 amino acid starvation response (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c, e</xref>), while cells growing in proline medium activate both Sch9 and the Npr1-Par32 dependent amino acid starvation response (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>), also led to another prediction. Wild-type and <italic>npr1</italic>1&lt; cells should grow at the same rate in SC and glutamine medium, since the adaptive amino acid starvation response is off. However, in proline medium, where Npr1-Par32 signaling is active and presumably ensures that the cells can import/synthesize adequate amounts of nitrogen and each amino acid, the <italic>npr1</italic>1&lt; cells should grow much slower than wild-type cells. This was also true (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Tod6 is activated in the intermediate signaling state</title>
<p>The growth curves we collected in SC, glutamine and proline medium, highlight an important fact; yeast grow about four-times faster in SC medium than in proline medium (compare red and black lines, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>). However, we see relatively little difference between the phosphorylation level of Sch9--the presumed master regulator of cell growth downstream of TORC1--in those two conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). This observation led us to posit that one or more of the cell growth control factors is also part of the intermediate (State III) response and acts to slow cell growth in proline medium. The relevant cell growth regulators in yeast are: (i) Sfp1, a TORC1 dependent activator of ribosome and protein synthesis gene expression (and thus growth)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>; (ii) Tod6, a TORC1 and Sch9 dependent repressor of ribosome and protein synthesis genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>; (iii) Stb3, another TORC1 and Sch9 dependent repressor of ribosome and protein synthesis genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>; (iv) Maf1, a TORC1 and Sch9 dependent repressor of RNA Polymerase III and tRNA degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Therefore, to test our model, we searched our phosphoproteomics data to see if any of the aforementioned factors are sensitive to the deletion of Gtr1/2 or Pib2 (and thus likely activated/repressed in the intermediate state). We did not detect Sfp1 in our experiments, but found that Stb3 and Maf1 remain phosphorylated, while Tod6 is dephosphorylated, in the Gtr1/2 and Pib2 delete cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that TORC1 inhibition triggers the movement of Stb3 and Tod6 into the nucleus where they act to recruit the Rpd3L deacetylase to, and thus repress, the ribosome protein and ribosome biogenesis genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Therefore, to test if Tod6 is part of the intermediate (State III) response, we measured the localization of Tod6-GFP and Stb3-GFP in a prototrophic strain carrying the nuclear marker Htb2-RFP and growing in SC medium, SC medium + rapamycin, or proline medium. As predicted, Tod6 moved into the nucleus in both proline medium and rapamycin, while Stb3 only moved into the nucleus in rapamycin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

The Tod6-GFP and Stb3-GFP strains are both prototrophic and carry the nuclear marker, Htb2-RFP, at its native locus. The numbers in the Stb3-GFP and Tod6-GFP panels show the fraction of cells with a strong nuclear GFP signal. In the SD and rapamycin control experiments these values are from a single experiment examining &gt;200 cells. In the proline experiments the values are an average from three biological replicates, with &gt;200 cells per replicate. In those three replicates, Stb3 was nuclear in 21% 17%, and 15% (18 ± 3%) of the cells, while Tod6 was nuclear in 70%, 70%, and 60% (67 ± 6%) of the cells.</p></caption>

<p>Thus, Tod6 is dephosphorylated/activated in proline medium (State III), presumably to help slow the growth rate of the cell in the poor-quality nitrogen source.</p>

<title>Gtr1/2 and Pib2 signaling during growth in a poor-quality nitrogen source</title>
<p>As a last step in our study, we wanted to see if, and how, changes in Gtr1/2 and Pib2 signaling drive TORC1 into the intermediate state. To address this question, we measured Par32 phosphorylation during the transition from growth in glutamine medium, to growth in proline medium, as we did earlier (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>), but this time in a strain carrying mutations that lock Gtr1 and 2 into their active Gtr1-GTP and Gtr2-GDP bound forms (Gtr1<sup>Q65L</sup> and Gtr2<sup>S23L</sup>, Gtr1/2<sup>on</sup> for short<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>). In the Gtr1/2<sup>on</sup> strain, Par32 was hyper-phosphorylated during the initial phase of the starvation response (when TORC1 is completely inactive; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>), but then (erroneously) dephosphorylated over time (compare <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>), demonstrating that: (i) Gtr1/2 are normally inhibited during steady state growth in proline, and (ii) Gtr1/2 must remain inactive to keep TORC1 pathway in the intermediate (Par32 on) signaling state. We also measured the impact that locking Gtr1 and 2 in their inactive Gtr1-GDP and Gtr2-GTP bound forms (Gtr1/2<sup>off</sup>) has on Rps6 and Sch9 phosphorylation during steady state growth in proline medium and the transition to growth in glutamine medium. Locking Gtr1/2 off caused a moderate decrease in Sch9 (but not Rps6) phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a, b</xref>), indicating that Gtr1/2 is partially (rather than fully) inactive during growth in proline medium.</p>

<p>In a parallel set of experiments, we also examined the role that Pib2 plays in regulating TORC1 during growth in proline medium. This was more challenging since relatively little is known about the mechanisms underlying Pib2 signaling. Nevertheless, to assess the role of Pib2 in Npr1-Par32 activation we measured Par32 phosphorylation during the transition from growth in glutamine medium, to growth in proline medium, in a <italic>pib2</italic>1&lt;<italic>NID</italic> strain (to lock Pib2 in an active form). Unexpectedly, Par32 was completely degraded in the absence of a NID domain in these conditions (data not shown). We have not seen the loss of Par32 in any natural condition, indicating that the NID domain of Pib2 is required for the normal function of the Npr1-Par32 branch of the TORC1 pathway, and that we cannot trap Pib2 in an active state. We then measured the impact that deleting Pib2 has on Rps6 and Sch9 phosphorylation during steady state growth in proline medium and the transition to growth in glutamine medium. These experiments showed that deleting Pib2 causes a large decrease in Rps6 and Sch9 phosphorylation at time zero (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a, b</xref>) and thus that Pib2 is active, or mostly active, during growth in proline medium.</p>
<p>Thus, we conclude that Gtr1/2 is partially off, and Pib2 is on (or mostly on), during steady state growth in proline medium, and this pushes TORC1 into the intermediate/adaptive (Par32 on, Sch9 on) signaling state.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this report we show that the TORC1 pathway takes up three distinct signaling states (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). In nutrient rich medium, TORC1 is fully active and phosphorylates (i) Sch9 and other proteins to drive cell growth, and (ii) Npr1 to suppress the amino acid starvation response (left panel, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). In contrast, when cells are first transferred to medium containing a poor-quality nitrogen source like proline, TORC1 is completely inhibited (middle panel, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). This blocks cell growth and triggers the activation of Npr1. Then, as cells adapt to the poor-quality nitrogen source (via Npr1), TORC1 is driven into an intermediate activity state where it phosphorylates Sch9 to re-initiate growth, but not Npr1, so that the cell continues to stimulate the increased amino acid transport and synthesis needed to support mass accumulation (right panel, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Tod6 is also dephosphorylated in the intermediate state, presumably to slow the growth rate of the cell so that it matches the maximum rate achievable in the poor-quality nitrogen source (right panel, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The TORC1 pathway is driven into one of the three signaling states described above based on the combination of signals transmitted through Gtr1/2 and Pib2 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). In nutrient rich medium, Gtr1/2 and Pib2 are both on and push TORC1 into the fully active state. Then, when cells are first transferred to a poor-quality nitrogen source, Gtr1/2 and Pib2 turn off, triggering complete TORC1 inhibition. Finally, as the cells adapt to the new conditions, Pib2 (but not Gtr1/2) is reactivated, so that TORC1 can phosphorylate most of the cell growth proteins but not Npr1, Tod6 and other proteins described in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>.</p>
<p>This three-state signaling system provides an elegant solution to a problem facing yeast as they transition between nutrient sources. Specifically, when yeast cells grow in nutrient-rich medium they focus on rapid growth via the import of key amino acids using highly selective transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. As a result, when amino acid levels fall, the cells do not know if there is a low-quality nitrogen source in the extracellular milieu, and do not have the capacity to import it even if it is there. Thus, the cells have to inactivate TORC1 and slow/halt their growth. However, once Npr1 is activated, the cells build the capacity to import, and grow using, a wide range of nitrogen containing compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. Then, if an adequate nitrogen source is available, Pib2 (but not Gtr1/2) is turned back on so that the cell restarts growth while keeping the Npr1 dependent starvation response (and the import of alternate nitrogen sources) active.</p>
<p>Important implications of this three-state model include that: (i) yeast cells (likely including fungal pathogens) can be pushed to import alternative nitrogen sources, including toxic amino acid analogs and related compounds, by deletion or inhibition of Gtr1/2 or Pib2, and (ii) yeast cell growth on poor nitrogen sources can be halted by deletion of, or inhibition of, Pib2.</p>
<p>The data presented here also reveal another unique aspect of the Gtr1/2 and Pib2 control circuit, namely that the activity of Ser33 (and its homolog of Ser3) depends on signaling through TORC1-Pib2, and that this in turn appears to ensure that Ser33 is only phosphorylated in the presence of a high-quality nitrogen source. Our data suggests that this occurs due to direct binding of Ser33 to Pib2, leading to a model that is reminiscent of the RagC dependent binding and regulation of TFEB in human cells, where TFEB is regulated in response to amino acid signals (via RagC), but not the hormone signals transmitted to TORC1 through Rheb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that the TORC1-Pib2 connection to Ser33 is setup this way to couple Ser33 activity to the level of glutamate/glutamine in the cell (rather than overall amino acid levels and other stress signals that regulate Gtr1/2) since the second step in serine synthesis involves the transfer of an amine group from glutamate to the Ser33 product, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Beyond the implications this work has for understanding TORC1 signaling in yeast, our study also provides important insight into the design (and analysis) of other signaling pathways, including mTOR. Previous experiments examining TORC1 signaling in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, including our own, focused on measuring TORC1 activity using one or two downstream reporters (usually pRps6 or pSch9). This led to the view that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 act as redundant activators of TORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In reality, however, Gtr1/2 and Pib2 are semi-redundant activators of TORC1, and drive TORC1 into a fully active, partially active, or inactive state via on/on, off/on or off/off modes of Gtr1/2 and Pib2 signaling. Fully active TORC1 then phosphorylates all of its downstream targets, while partially active TORC1 phosphorylates a subset of its targets, to create a condition-dependent response. We argue that other stress and starvation signaling pathways likely work in a similar way, it is just that multi-level signaling has been overlooked since is difficult to detect using standard reporter assays.</p>

<title>Phosphoproteomics</title>
<p>The cells examined using phosphoproteomics were collected using TCA precipitation, as described above. All remaining steps used MS-grade reagents (including water):</p>
<p>First, the cell pellets were resuspended in 400 μL of MS-urea buffer (8M urea, 100mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), 5mM EDTA). Proteins were then extracted by bead beating (as described above) and eluted into wide-mouth tubes (without a 65 °C denaturation step) and the final protein concentration in each sample measured using a BCA assay.</p>
<p>200 μg of total protein was taken from each sample and diluted to 1 μg/μL in a 2.0 mL Low-bind tube (Thermo Scientific 88379) using the 8 M urea buffer above. The samples were alkylated and reduced by treatment with 5 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) and 5 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min. The reduced and alkylated samples were then diluted by adding 70 μL of 50 mM ABC (so that the final urea concentration was 5.5 M) and 20 ng/μL of LysC (New England Biolabs, P8109S) to each sample, and digested at 37 °C, sharking at 700 rpm, for 3 hours. The samples were then diluted again with 1.3 mL 50 mM ABC to bring the urea concentration to 1 M, and treated with 2 μg trypsin (Promega, v511c), shaking overnight at 700 rpm, and 37 °C.</p>
<p>The next morning trypsinization was quenched by adding TFA to a final concentration of 1% v/v, and the samples clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The peptide mix was then desalted using Sep Pak Plus C18 cartridges (Waters: WAT020515) on a vacuum manifold. First, cartridges were equilibrated by flushing with 5 mL of solution B (65% acetonitrile (MeCN), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)) and then 10 mL solution A (2% MeCN, 0.1% TFA). The peptide samples, now around 2 mL in volume, were then diluted with 8 mL of solution A and slowly run through the cartridges. The columns were then washed with 10 mL of solution A and then peptides eluted twice using 600 μL of solution B and collected in a Lo-Bind tube. The peptides were then dried in a speed vac at room temperature and stored at −80 °C. Phosphopeptides were enriched using magnetic Ti(IV)-IMAC beads (MagReSyn MR-TIM005) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Specifically, 40 μL beads were equilibrated using three washes with loading buffer (0.1 M glycolic acid in 80% MeCN, 5% TFA). Dried peptide samples were then resuspended in 200 μL loading buffer and incubated with the beads for 20 minutes, shaking at 600 rpm and room temperature. The beads were then washed with 200 μL of loading solution, 100 μL wash solution 1 (80% ACN, 1% TFA), and 100 μL wash solution 2 (10% ACN, 0.2% TFA) for 2 minutes each, with 600 rpm agitation.

In-line de-salting was accomplished using a reversed-phase trap column (100 μm × 20 mm) packed with Magic C<sub>18</sub>AQ (5-μm, 200Å resin; Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) followed by peptide separations on a reversed-phase column (75 μm × 250 mm) packed with Magic C<sub>18</sub>AQ (5-μm, 100Å resin; Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) directly mounted on the electrospray ion source. A 45-min gradient from 2% to 35% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 400 nL/min was used for chromatographic separations. A spray voltage of 2500V was applied to the electrospray tip and the Orbitrap Elite instrument was operated in the data-dependent mode, switching automatically between MS survey scans in the Orbitrap (AGC target value 1,000,000, resolution 120,000, and injection time 250 milliseconds) with collision induced dissociation MS/MS spectra acquisition in the linear ion trap (AGC target value of 10,000 and injection time 100 milliseconds), higher-energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) MS/MS spectra acquisition in the Orbitrap (AGC target value of 50,000, 15,000 resolution and injection time 250 milliseconds) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) MS/MS spectra acquisition in the Orbitrap (AGC target value of 50,000, 15,000 resolution and injection time 250 milliseconds). The three most intense precursor ions from the Fourier-transform (FT) full scan were consecutively selected for fragmentation in the linear ion trap by CID with a normalized collision energy of 35%, fragmentation in the HCD cell with normalized collision energy of 35%, and fragmentation by ETD with 100 ms activation time. Selected ions were dynamically excluded for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Data analysis was performed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). The data were searched against the Saccharomyces Genome Database (downloaded 02/03/2011; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org">www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>) that was appended with protein sequences from the common Repository of Adventitious Proteins or cRAP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thegpm.org/crap/">www.thegpm.org/crap/</ext-link>). Two searches were performed corresponding to the proteolytic enzymes trypsin, and trypsin/thermolysin (no enzyme selected). The Maximum missed cleavages was set to 2. The precursor ion tolerance was set to 10 ppm and the fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.8 Da. Variable modifications included oxidation on methionine (+ 15.995 Da), carbamidomethyl (+ 57.021 Da) on cysteine, and phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine (+ 79.996 Da). Sequest HT was used for database searching. PhosphoRS 3.1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> was used for assigning phosphosite localization probabilities. All search results were run through PSM Validator for false discovery rate evaluation of the identified peptides.</p>

<p>For microscopy in SC + proline, cells were grown in 25 mL over three days, refreshing the media by removing half and readding equivalent volume each day, until they reached the logarithmic growth phase. Cells grown in SC were inoculated into a 10 mL starter culture, and then diluted again into a 25 mL overnight culture. In both cases, cells were grown to log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.4-0.6) and then pipetted onto 8-well microslides (Ibidi, 80826) that had been pretreated with Concanavalin A. Cells were then washed with matching media (SD + proline or SC) and then imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E microscope equipped with a 100X objective and a Photometrics Prime 95B camera. GFP images were acquired with an excitation of 488 nm and an emission of 515 nm using 1 second exposure. RFP images were acquired with an excitation of 561 nm and an emission of 632 nm using a 500 ms exposure. DIC images were captured using a 60 ms exposure. To examine the impact of complete TORC1 inhibition, cells growing in SC medium were treated 200 mM rapamycin for 60 min (within the well) and then imaged again with the same settings. Images were analyzed and quantified in ImageJ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>3 biological replicates of each strain was grown overnight and aliquoted to tubes containing 1 OD<sub>600</sub> unit. Samples were then washed with 1 mL filtered water, and then resuspended in 1 mL filtered water. 100 μL of culture were diluted into 900 μL of each medium, bringing the starting concentration to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1. For each biological replicate, 3 technical replicates were plated across a 96-well plate (Corning 3370). Plates were covered with Breathe-Easy membranes (Z380059 Sigma-Aldrich) and growth was measured on a TECAN Infinite M Nano plate reader. Growth settings were orbital shaking with a 5 mm amplitude for 8 minutes followed by a linear shake with a 5 mm amplitude for 2 minutes at 30°C. OD<sub>600</sub> readings were taken every 10 minutes for 23 hours.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>TOR complex 1 (TORC1) is a key regulator cell growth in response to nutrients, and it therefore integrates inputs from multiple nutrient-sensing regulators. However, we still do not understand how each upstream regulatory branch contributes to TORC1 activity under different nutrient conditions. The authors set out to answer this question using budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model eukaryote. Yeast TORC1 is activated by two upstream regulators: the highly conserved GTPases Gtr1/2 and the PI3P-binding protein Pib2. The cooperation of these regulators towards TORC1 activation has been unclear, with some studies suggesting that they act in parallel (i.e. redundantly), and others suggesting a more complex picture. By exploring the dependence of different TORC1 substrates on Gtr1/2 and Pib2 activity, the authors have discovered that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 do not act redundantly, but instead are part of a mechanism that drives the TORC1 pathways into three distinct activity levels: i) both Gtr1/2 and Pib2 ON in rich nutrients (leading to the highest TORC1 activity), ii) Gtr1/2 OFF and Pib2 ON in poor quality nitrogen sources (intermediate TORC1 activity), and iii) both Gtr1/2 and Pib2 OFF under starvation conditions (lowest TORC1 activity).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The relation between Gtr1/2 and Pib2 has remained a mystery for a long time, making it difficult to interpret the results of experiments in which one of the two regulators is inactive or missing. By employing a phosphoproteomics assay, the authors were able to monitor the phosphorylation of multiple TORC1 substrates in response to TORC1 inhibition (via rapamycin) and in mutants carrying deletions of Gtr1/2 or Pib2. In this way, they could identify two groups of substrates: those that require the activity of both regulators, and those that remain active when a single regulator is active. These data clearly demonstrate the non-redundancy of the Gtr1/2 and Pib2, especially since the different groups of substrates seem to correspond to groups of proteins with distinct functions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The first section of the Results contains an analysis of Gtr1/2- and Pib2-dependent signaling using Rps6 as a TORC1 reporter. I do not think that Rps6 is an appropriate readout for this type of work, as it is not a direct TORC1 substrate, and it also lies downstream of TORC2 [Yerlikaya et al. 2016]. The authors obtain several puzzling results with Rps6, and later on (pg. 8) remark that the level of Rps6 phosphorylation does not always correspond to TORC1 activity. While this is an interesting finding in its own right and will certainly be interesting for the yeast TOR community, I do not see why the Results need to open with such a confusing section, and why Rps6 features so prominently throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>
- There is very large ambiguity regarding the types of media and strains that are used (prototrophic vs auxotrophic). The authors use SC medium which, if I understand correctly, contains ammonium and a supplement of amino acids. They then use single amino acid dropouts (e.g. SC -gln and SC -leu) to probe TORC1 activity under &quot;partial starvation&quot; conditions. However, the cells are anything but starved in these experiments, and I do not know how to interpret results obtained with such media. Even when amino acids are completely removed, the cells are still able to grow on ammonium. The matter gets further complicated because it appears that the authors use prototrophic strains with single nitrogen source media, but not with complete or &quot;partial starvation&quot; media. Since this study aims to elucidate the roles of nutrient-sensing regulators upstream of TORC1, I would expect that matters related to media composition and strain usage should be addressed more carefully and described more explicitly in the text, especially since nutritional complementation of auxotrophic strains is not always equivalent to genetic complementation [Pronk, 2002].</p>
<p>
- A recent publication (Zeng et al. 2023, doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2023.113599) identified Ser33 and Ser3 as TORC1 substrates and examined their dependence on Pib2 activity. More importantly, the publication addressed a question that is very similar to the one addressed here (i.e. how different amino acids require Gtr1/2 or Pib2 to activate TORC1). I would recommend that the authors cite that publication and compare their findings with the results reported there.</p>
<p>
- The GO analysis of TORC1 substrates (from Fig.4) is mentioned in the text but is not shown. The authors should present the GO analysis more explicitly, e.g. in a supplementary table.</p>
<p>
- Similar to Rps6, it should be kept in mind that Par32 is not a TORC1 substrate. While I understand the rationale behind the choice of Par32 as a readout, this point needs to be emphasized more. Additionally, previous work [Brito et al. 2019, doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2019.09.025] has suggested that Npr1 and Par32 are implicated in a feedback loop with Pib2. The potential relevance of that work should be discussed more here.</p>
<p>
- Besides Sch9, Tod6 phosphorylation is also regulated by PKA [Huber et al. 2011, doi: 10.1038/emboj.2011.221]. This point should be discussed and taken into account in the interpretation of the Tod6 results. I also find it puzzling that Tod6 persists one hour after rapamycin treatment, because the protein seems to be unstable and gets quickly degraded when TORC1 activity is lost [Kusama 2022, doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2022.103986].</p>
<p>
- Given the points raised above, I remain skeptical about the three-state model proposed by the authors. On a conceptual level, the intermediate activity state of TORC1 proposed here seems to depend absolutely on Pib2 (since Gtr1/2 appear to be off in that state). The authors make a similar point in the Discussion, where they claim that yeast growth on poor nitrogen sources can be halted by deletion of Pib2. However, they do not test this conjecture experimentally.</p>
<p>
- Fig. 6F compares the growth of different strains on different media, but the doubling times are not quantified.</p>
<p>
- The Introduction describes regulatory pathways of mTORC1, several of which do not exist in budding yeast. The transition from the second to third paragraph is very abrupt and confusing.</p>

<p>This work examines the roles of Gtr1/Gtr2 and Pib2 in activation of TORC1 in S cerevisiae and proposes they are non-redundant in activating TORC1. Previous work from many groups has suggested that the Gtr complex and Pib2 activate TORC1 in a parallel manner. One contribution of this study is the suggestion that using the standard readout(s) of TORC1 activation are not sufficient to assess the separate roles of these two components in the complex network of amino acid and starvation response signaling. The overall conclusion of the work, based on phosphoproteome analyses of deletion strains and comparison to rapamycin treatment, with some supporting experimentation, is that Pib2 signaling sustains the starvation response in poor amino acid/nitrogen sources, whereas the additional activation of the Gtr complex is required for the full spectrum of TORC1 effects on growth.</p>
<p>At first, the authors recapitulate and extend studies on TORC1 inactivation using the Rps6 reporter. Here, Pib2 could inactivate TORC1 on glutamine starvation only if the Gtr complex is partially compromised. The authors speculated that Gtr and Pib2 do lead to different responses, but these cannot be detected by monitoring the phospho state of Rps6.</p>
<p>The authors determined the phosphoproteome in wild type cells and a variety of knockout strains, in rich media and in the presence of rapamycin. The authors identified 175 phosphosites that are downregulated on rapamycin treatment, at least under these conditions. Many were dependent on both Pib2 and the Gtr complex but, of particular interest for this work , were the phosphosites on Ser33, that were dependent on the presence of Pib2 but not the Gtr complex. The authors noted that phosphosites not dependent on Pib2 or Gtr1/2 included Sch9 and other common readouts of TORC1 activation.</p>
<p>Focusing on Ser33, the authors next show that rapamycin, amino acid and nitrogen starvation result in loss of Ser33 phosphorylation. Further analysis showed that the Ser33 phosphorylation status depends on the quality of the amino acid and nitrogen source.</p>
<p>Then the authors use this to develop a model where TORC1 has three states depending on whether either Gtr1/2, or Pib2, or both are active in signaling to TORC1, depending on the nutrient state and quality of amino acids/nitrogen available. The new state is state III, where TORC1 is active to promote growth and the starvation response remains active, via the Npr1/Par32 branch. The remainder of the work involves developing tools to assess the growth (Sch9) and starvation (Par32) branches under various amino acid/nutrient states. While moving from media with an excess of all amino acids to glutamine or leucine led to only transient occupation of state III, the new state was already occupied when the cells were in a poor amino acid/nitrogen source and moved to a better one. In other words, the Pib2 signalling permitted aspects of a starvation response to be maintained in the background of a Sch9 growth signal.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors address a puzzle: Sch9 phosphorylation does not have the dynamic range to account for the difference in growth rates of yeast cells in SC or proline medium. Tod6 was dephosphorylated in the absence of Gtr1/Gtr2 or Pib2 in the phosphoproteomics and is the likely connection, as it moves to the nucleus on growth on proline media (or on rapamycin), where it may control the chromatin accessibility of ribosome growth and biogenesis genes.</p>
<p>Overall, the core of this work, the phosphoproteome analyses, convincingly demonstrates that activation of TORC1 relies on a nuanced interplay of signaling pathways and that to fully appreciate and dissect the consequences of the Gtr- and Pib2-responsive signaling pathways a more comprehensive range of readouts is required. The work elegantly shows a scenario where Pib2-based signaling is active, required to sustain some growth even when the amino acid/nitrogen mix is poor.</p>
<p>There are some areas, however, where the work could be strengthened. The model proposed in this work is based on nuanced signaling responses to various states of nitrogen/amino acid starvation. However, the phosphoproteome was determined in a synthetic rich background, supplemented with rapamycin where relevant, and comparing the phosphoproteome of pib2 del and gtr1 del/gtr2 del to this. The phosphoproteome is by far the strongest data in this work suggesting multi-level regulation so an appropriately matched phosphoproteome condition screen would likely significantly substantiate the model: the conditions used might miss all the nuanced signaling responses the authors develop throughout the paper. Not unrelated, the authors show that Pib2 can transmit glutamine starvation signals to TORC1 in the presence of a partial Gtr1/2 complex (gtr1 del or gtr2 del) but not a complete deletion of the complex (Fig. 2). Similar to the above comment, the phosphoproteome was determined only with full loss of the gtr complex, and then only in a rich background, which may miss this entire branch of Pib2 signaling. Perhaps in support of this, Pib2Ser113 phosphorylation apparently decreased significantly on rapamycin treatment but not on loss of the Gtr complex (TableS1), whereas other Pib2 phospho sites were not similarly affected by rapamycin treatment. Adding to the notion of complexity, the other sites may themselves be subject to other signaling pathways that could regulate Pib2 - and these may change on nutrient starvation.</p>
<p>The data showing the enrichment of Pib2 with Ser33 is weak (Fig. 5G, mostly because of the significant precipitation of Ser33 in the absence of Pib2), particularly without the contribution of the immunopurifications of Fig5S1. Assessing the binding of Ser3 may be a better candidate?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This work addresses an important question of how Gtr1/2 small GTPases and Pib2, two major regulators of the TORC1 cell growth controller, differentially operate in yeast. They found not all the TORC1 downstream targets respond to Gtr1/2 and Pib2 equally. In fact, they demonstrate that TORC1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser33, a 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, is responsive to only Pib2. They attributed this specificity to the physical interaction between Ser33 and Pib2. This part is novel and important, revising the canonical view in the field that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 branches act towards the same TORC1 downstream targets. Of note, this claim largely agrees with a recent independent study (PMID: 38127619).</p>
<p>Moving on, the authors describe different behaviors of TORC1 downstream readouts in intermediate nutrient conditions with a poor nitrogen source, with some readouts still active while others inactive. They argue that selective activation of certain TORC1 downstream targets reflects the &quot;Gtr1/2 off, Pib2 on&quot; state. However, this claim is not sufficiently supported by the presented data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The data presented in this paper has high value to the TOR community. In particular, a rigorous and comprehensive phospho-proteomic dataset that compares the Gtr1/2- and Pib2-dependency of diverse TORC1 downstream targets is very informative, potentially stimulating follow-up studies on each target.</p>
<p>Identification of Ser33 as a Pib2-specific TORC1 downstream is important and convincing (although whether Ser33 is a direct substrate of TORC1 was not addressed in this work). Physical interaction between Ser33 and Pib2 could represent a novel layer of TORC1 signaling regulation, in line with the mammalian Rag-TFEB interaction model, as discussed by the authors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors' three-state model, particularly the claim that cells are in the &quot;Gtr1/2 off, Pib2 on&quot; state in a poor nitrogen condition (e.g., proline medium), is not convincing enough because of the following reasons.</p>
<p>1. The &quot;Pib2 on&quot; claim contradicts with the observation that Ser33, Pib2-specific readout, is hypo-phosphorylated in proline medium (Fig 5F).</p>
<p>2. In the genetic experiments (Figure 8), the authors compare pib2D with Gtr1/2OFF. This is not appropriate, because GTR1/2OFF (GTR1-GDP and Gtr2-GTP) actively inhibits TORC1, differing from the null nature of pib2D. pib2D should be compared with gtr1/2D instead.</p>
<p>3. In general, diverse behaviors of TORC1 targets are not unexpected because their phosphorylation levels should have different dynamic ranges depending on how &quot;good&quot; they are as TORC1 substrates, with some requiring a higher TORC1 activity than others to be detectably phosphorylated. Although this aspect can be physiologically meaningful, and it is indeed important to look at multiple substrates as the authors suggest, this approach does not inform whether the signal is coming from Gtr1/2 or Pib2. An informative way in this context would be to look at the Gtr1/2- or Pib2-specific targets, but the former has not been identified, and observations on the latter, Ser33, do not support the &quot;Pib2 on&quot; claim as mentioned in the above 1).</p>
<p>4. In addition, comparisons made between direct TORC1 substrates (e.g., Sch9) and indirect downstream targets (e.g., Rps6 and Par32) are not very informative, because indirect targets can be impacted by TORC1-independent regulation of the mediating factors (e.g., Ypk3 for Rps6 and Npr1 for Par32).</p>
<p>In summary, the presented data do not tell us which of the two branches (Gtr1/2 or Pib2) is &quot;more active&quot; in the poor nitrogen condition. Their observations do not necessarily prefer their 3-state on/off model (Figure 8) over the more natural assumption that both branches have the gradation of activity depending on the nutrient status.</p>
