<title>Abstract</title><p>Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an endogenous inhibitor of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and plays an important role in pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism by which PGE2 inhibits GSIS. Our results showed that PGE2 inhibited Kv2.2 channels via increasing PKA activity in HEK293T cells overexpressed with Kv2.2 channels. Point mutation analysis demonstrated that S448 residue was responsible for the PKA-dependent modulation of Kv2.2. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 was blocked by EP2/4 receptor antagonists, while mimicked by EP2/4 receptor agonists. The immune fluorescence results showed that EP1-EP4 receptors are expressed in both mouse and human β-cells. In INS-1(832/13) β-cells, PGE2 inhibited voltage-gated potassium currents and electrical activity through EP2/4 receptors and Kv2.2 channels. Knockdown of Kv2.2 reduced the action potential firing frequency and alleviated the inhibition of PGE2 on GSIS in INS-1(832/13) β-cells. PGE2 impaired glucose tolerance in wild-type mice but did not alter glucose tolerance in Kv2.2 knockout mice. Knockout of Kv2.2 reduced electrical activity, GSIS and abrogated the inhibition of PGE2 on GSIS in mouse islets. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PGE2 inhibits GSIS in pancreatic β-cells through the EP2/4-Kv2.2 signaling pathway. The findings highlight the significant role of Kv2.2 channels in the regulation of β-cell repetitive firing and insulin secretion, and contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of β-cell dysfunction in diabetes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is the major prostaglandin formed in pancreatic islets and is closely related to islet β-cell dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Meng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Oshima, Taketo, &amp; Oshima, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Vennemann et al., 2012</xref>). As an endogenous inhibitor of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), PGE2 plays an important role in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carboneau, Breyer, &amp; Gannon, 2017</xref>). PGE2 has been demonstrated to inhibit GSIS in both mouse models of T2DM and in pancreatic islets obtained from human organ donors with T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kimple et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Neuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Parazzoli et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies have shown that plasma levels of PGE2 are correlated with T2DM status, and it has the potential to be a marker of T2DM status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fenske et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Truchan et al., 2021</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism for the PGE2 inhibition of GSIS is not fully understood.</p>
<p>PGE2 functions through the activation of four specific G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes, termed EP1-4. The EP1 receptor couples to G<sub>q</sub> and causes an intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase. The EP2 and EP4 receptors couple to G<sub>s</sub> to increase intracellular cAMP formation, while the EP3 receptor couples to G<sub>i</sub> to decrease intracellular cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sugimoto &amp; Narumiya, 2007</xref>). The mRNA expression of all four EP receptors is found in rat, mouse, and human pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bramswig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tran, Gleason, &amp; Robertson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Vennemann et al., 2012</xref>). Among all EP receptors, the EP3 receptor has attracted widespread attention due to its high expression on β-cells in diabetic mouse models (elevated more than 40 times compared to non-diabetic mice)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kimple et al., 2013</xref>). Currently, it is considered the primary effector for PGE2 in GSIS. Islets from diabetic BTBR mice exhibit increased GSIS when treated with the EP3 antagonist L-798106, and show decreased GSIS after treated with the EP3 agonist PGE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Shridas, Zahoor, Forrest, Layne, &amp; Webb, 2014</xref>). However, increasing evidence suggests that EP3 plays a role only in insulin secretion under T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carboneau et al., 2017</xref>). In human islets from non-diabetic donors, the EP3 antagonist L-798106 does not affect GSIS, but improves insulin secretion in islets from donors with T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kimple et al., 2013</xref>). Ceddia et al. reported that the EP3 antagonist DG-041 does not affect GSIS in islets from non-diabetic human or wild-type mice on a chow diet, and that global gene knockout of EP3 in mice does not alter GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ceddia et al., 2016</xref>).The impact of the PGE2 signaling pathway on nondiabetic β-cell function remains unclear. Moreover, the roles of EP1, EP2, and EP4 receptors in GSIS are rarely reported.</p>
<p>Pancreatic β-cells are electrical excitable. GSIS is associated with a complex electrical activity, which is regulated by various voltage-gated plasmalemmal ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Braun et al., 2008</xref>; S. N. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). The Kv2 channel family, which consists of Kv2.1 and Kv2.2, plays a crucial role in modulating neural excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu &amp; Bean, 2014</xref>). The effect of Kv2.1 channels on insulin secretion has been well studied. In rodents, Kv2.1 is recognized as the primary facilitator of delayed rectifier potassium currents in β-cells. Suppressing Kv2.1 results in heightened glucose-stimulated membrane potential amplitude, consequently enhancing GSIS in mouse pancreatic β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jacobson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">MacDonald et al., 2002</xref>). However, Kv2.1 inhibitor stromatoxin shows little effect on human β-cell electrical function or insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Braun et al., 2008</xref>), despite the presence of Kv2.1 protein in human islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tamarina, Kuznetsov, Fridlyand, &amp; Philipson, 2005</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that Kv2.1 regulates insulin secretion through channel clusters independently of its electrical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Greitzer-Antes et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies have shown that human islet β-cells express both Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 channels, with much higher levels of Kv2.2 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Blodgett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fu et al., 2017</xref>). Jensen et al. reported that Kv2.2 expression is also involved in GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jensen et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, the functions of the Kv2.2 channel in the <italic>in vivo</italic> physiology of islet β-cells have not been definitively established.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the role of EP1-4 receptors and Kv2.2 in the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells and Kv2.2 knockout mice. Our findings indicate that: 1) PGE2 reduces Kv2.2 currents via the EP2/4-PKA signaling pathway; 2) PGE2 inhibits β-cell electrical activity through Kv2.2 channels; 3) Knockout of Kv2.2 channels abrogates the PGE2 induced inhibition of GSIS. These results suggest that EP2/4 receptors and Kv2.2 channels play crucial regulatory roles in the normal physiological secretion of insulin.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><bold>PGE2 inhibits Kv2.2 currents via the EP2/EP4 signaling pathway in HEK293T cells.</bold></p>
<p>We initially conducted experiments to assess the impact of PGE2 on Kv2.2 channels. Kv2.2 channels were overexpressed in HEK293T cells, and Kv2.2 currents were elicited by a 200-ms depolarization pulse from -80 to +40 mV. Extracellular application of 10 μM PGE2 significantly inhibited Kv2.2 currents. This inhibition was rapid, reaching its maximum effect in approximately 6 minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). The inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 is dose-dependent, with the maximum effect at around 10 μM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Therefore, we used 10 μM PGE2 for the subsequent experiments. The I-V curve demonstrated that PGE2 significantly inhibited Kv2.2 currents at all positive testing potentials above +20 mV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Moreover, 10 μM PGE2 did not alter the steady-state activation and inactivation properties of Kv2.2 currents (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E and F</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we investigated the mechanism of PGE2 inhibition on Kv2.2 channels. PGE2 functions by activating EP1-4 receptors. We investigated the mRNA and protein expression profiles of EP receptors in HEK293T cells. The mRNAs for all four EP receptors were detected in HEK293T cells, with notably higher levels observed for EP2 and EP4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Furthermore, immunofluorescence results confirmed the presence of protein expression for EP1-EP4 receptors in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). To determine which EP receptor is responsible for the PGE2-induced inhibition, we applied SC51089 (10 μM, the EP1 receptor antagonist) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhou, Qian, Chou, &amp; Iadecola, 2008</xref>), AH6809 (20 μM, the EP2 receptor antagonist) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Srinivasalu et al., 2020</xref>), L798106 (10 μM, the EP3 receptor antagonist) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Corboz et al., 2021</xref>), and AH23848 (20 μM, the EP4 receptor antagonist)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">He et al., 2021</xref>) to the extracellular solution to selectively inhibit the respective EP receptors. The acute application of the four antagonists alone had no effect on Kv2.2 currents (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Pretreatment with SC51089 and L798106 for 10 min did not alter the PGE2-induced inhibition. However, pretreatment with AH6809 and AH23848 partially blocked the PGE2-induced inhibition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D and E</xref>). Furthermore, the EP2 receptor agonist Butaprost (20 μM) and the EP4 receptor agonist CAY10598 (20 μM) both inhibited Kv2.2 currents (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F and G</xref>). These results suggest that PGE2 inhibits Kv2.2 via EP2/EP4 signaling pathway.</p>

<title>PGE2 inhibits Kv2.2 currents via the PKA signaling pathway in HEK293T cells</title>
<p>The EP2 and EP4 receptors couple to Gs, increasing intracellular cAMP formation and activating the PKA signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sugimoto &amp; Narumiya, 2007</xref>). We investigated whether PGE2 regulates Kv2.2 via PKA. Treatment with 10 μM PGE2 rapidly increased PKA activity in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The PKA activator, Db-cAMP, could mimic the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 channels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The PKA inhibitor, Rp-cAMP, had no effect on Kv2.2 currents (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). However, pre-incubation with Rp-cAMP blocked the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 channels in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). These findings illustrate that PGE2 inhibits Kv2.2 currents through the PKA signaling pathway.</p>

<p>We further investigated whether PKA regulates Kv2.2 currents via direct phosphorylation of the channel. The Kv2.2 channel protein contains approximately nine putative phosphorylation sites that conform to the minimal consensus sequence for PKA, according to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scansite4.mit.edu">https://scansite4.mit.edu</ext-link>. The positions of the nine sites are depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>. To identify the specific site responsible for PKA regulation of Kv2.2 channels, we introduced mutations in the amino acid sequence. We replaced all nine amino acids with aspartic acid to mimic the PKA phosphorylation state of Kv2.2 channels. Among the nine mutations, only the S448D mutation yielded a significant reduction in Kv2.2 currents (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Notably, the S448D mutation also abrogated the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). To further confirm the role of the S448 site in PGE2-induced inhibition of Kv2.2, we also conducted a mutation, changing S448 to alanine (S448A). This mutation effectively prevented the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 currents (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). These data indicate that the S448 site is responsible for the PGE2-induced inhibition of Kv2.2 currents.</p>

<title>PGE2 inhibits endogenous Kv2.2 currents through the EP2/EP4 signaling pathway in INS-1(832/13) β-cells</title>
<p>To investigate the physiological function of PGE2-induced inhibition of Kv2.2, we examined whether PGE2 could also affect the native Kv2.2 currents in pancreatic β-cells. Previous study has demonstrated that Kv2.2 channels contribute to the delayed rectifier outward K<sup>+</sup> currents in pancreatic β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fu et al., 2017</xref>).

<p>To assess the contribution of Kv2.2 channels to the PGE2-induced inhibition in INS-1(832/13) cells, we knocked down the expression of Kv2.2 using shRNA. The efficiency of the two shRNAs, named KD1-Kv2.2 and KD2-Kv2.2, were first evaluated in HEK293T cells overexpressing Kv2.2. KD2-Kv2.2 showed higher efficiency than KD1-Kv2.2 and was selected for subsequent experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Knockdown of Kv2.2 by KD2-Kv2.2 significantly reduced endogenous K<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) in INS-1(832/13) cells, and abrogated PGE2-induced inhibition of K<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E and F</xref>).

<title>PGE2 reduces electrical activity via Kv2.2 channels in INS-1(832/13) cells</title>
<p>GSIS is associated with β-cell electrical activity, which is regulated by Kv2 potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Drews, Krippeit-Drews, &amp; Dufer, 2010</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether PGE2 affects β-cell electrical activity. We found that 10 μM PGE2 reduced action potential (AP) frequency and increased AP half-width in INS-1(832/13) cells with little effect on the peak amplitude of AP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of Kv2.2 with Kv2.2-specific shRNA abrogated PGE2-induced effect on INS-1(832/13) cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). This suggests that PGE2 reduces electrical activity via Kv2.2 channels in INS-1(832/13) cells. Since PGE2 inhibits Kv2.2 via EP2/4 receptors, it is plausible to hypothesize that PGE2 reduces electrical activity via EP2/4 receptors in INS-1(832/13) cells. To test the hypothesis, we first investigated the expression of EP receptors in INS-1(832/13) cells. Immunofluorescence results revealed that all EP1-EP4 receptors are expressed in INS-1(832/13) cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). In addition, both mouse and human islet β-cells were found to express all four EP receptors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). As expected, the EP2 receptor agonist Butaprost (20 μM) and the EP4 receptor agonist CAY10598 (20 μM) both inhibited AP frequency in INS-1(832/13) cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). This indicates that PGE2 reduces electrical activity via EP2/4 in INS-1(832/13) cells.</p>

<p>To investigate the physiological role of Kv2.2 during GSIS <italic>in vivo</italic>, a mouse model was utilized in which the Kv2.2 coding gene is disrupted at exon 2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). The targeting cassette removes 446 bp in exon 2 of the Kv2.2 coding gene sequence. The disrupted sequence is detected using PCR to produce one amplicon with one primer inside the targeting sequence in combination with one Kv2.2 specific primer outside the targeting sequence (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). The Kv2.2 protein was detected only in wild-type islets using a Kv2.2-specific antibody (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). The body weight of the Kv2.2 knockout mice was similar to that of the wild-type littermates (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). Kv2.2<sup>−/−</sup> mice were assessed for possible impairment in glucose homeostasis using an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. Kv2.2<sup>−/−</sup> mice had similar fasting blood glucose levels with control group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). PGE2 treatment worsened glucose tolerance in control animals but had little effect on Kv2.2<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While EP3 has been demonstrated to exert an inhibitory influence on GSIS, increasing evidence suggests that the impact of EP3 may manifest primarily when β-cell dysfunction is already established, as observed in T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carboneau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Truchan et al., 2021</xref>). In our current investigation, we unveil that Kv2.2 channels play a crucial role in regulating β-cell repetitive firing and insulin secretion. PGE2 inhibits Kv2.2 channels via the EP2/4 signaling pathway, consequently impeding GSIS in normal β-cells.</p>
<p>Even though the previous study reported that the EP2 protein-encoding gene <italic>Ptger2</italic> was not identified by RNA-seq in mouse islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ku et al., 2012</xref>). Other studies have shown that the mRNA expression of all four EPs is observed in rat, mouse, and human pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bramswig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tran et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Vennemann et al., 2012</xref>). In our current study, we provide evidence demonstrating the presence of protein expression for all four types of PGE2 receptors in both human and mouse pancreatic β-cells. In comparison to EP3, our knowledge of the impact of EP1, EP2, and EP4 on insulin secretion is currently limited. Tran et al. have reported that the EP1 antagonist fails to impede the inhibitory effects of IL-1β on GSIS in isolated rat islets. EP3 agonists, such as misoprostol or sulprostone, decrease GSIS through Gi proteins in rat islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tran et al., 2002</xref>). A recent study has unveiled that the activation of Gi/o protein-coupled receptors leads to the stimulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase. This stimulation, in turn, hyperpolarizes the membrane potential of β-cells, consequently suppressing β-cell electrical excitability and insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dickerson et al., 2022</xref>). Consequently, one would anticipate that PGE2 activates Gi protein-coupled EP3 receptors, thereby inhibiting insulin secretion through membrane potential hyperpolarization and the reduction of β-cell electrical excitability. Surprisingly, no alterations in β-cell membrane potential were observed following PGE2 treatments. We found that PGE2 inhibits Kv2.2 channels and electroactivity of β-cells via G<sub>s</sub>- coupled EP2/4 receptors instead of EP3 receptors. PGE2 is likely to predominantly exert its effects via the EP2/4 receptors in normal β-cells. However, in instances of established β-cell dysfunction, such as in T2DM, it appears that PGE2 may act through the upregulated EP3 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kimple et al., 2013</xref>). This study found that activating either EP2 or EP4 receptors can inhibit Kv2.2 channels, and further research is needed to determine which receptor is the primary regulatory factor for GSIS.</p>
<p>Both Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 contribute to the delayed outward K<sup>+</sup> current in human β-cells, and their mRNA expression in diabetic islets is lower than that in non-diabetic islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fu et al., 2017</xref>). Kv2.1 channels in cell membrane exist in two forms: clustered and non-clustered. Non-clustered Kv2.1 channels conduct K<sup>+</sup> normally, while clustered Kv2.1 channels are barely conductive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fox, Loftus, &amp; Tamkun, 2013</xref>). A recent study has shown that Kv2.1 channels form clusters in INS-1(832/13) cells and human β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fu et al., 2017</xref>). Kv2.1-mediated insulin exocytosis requires Kv2.1 clustering and a direct interaction with syntaxin 1A but is not dependent on its electrical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fu et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the findings of the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jensen et al., 2013</xref>), we observed a significant reduction in GSIS in INS-1(832/13) cells upon knockdown of Kv2.2. Moreover, knockout of Kv2.2 also reduced GSIS in mouse islets. Kv2.2 channels play a crucial role in maintaining repetitive AP firing by promoting the recovery of voltage-gated sodium channels from inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Johnston et al., 2008</xref>). Inhibition of Kv2.2 channels significantly reduces the repetitive firing in medial nucleus of the trapezoid body neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Johnston et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). In the present study, we found that the major effect of PGE2-induced inhibition of Kv2.2 is to reduce the firing rate in β-cells, suggesting that Kv2.2 plays a key role in the β-cell repetitive firing upon stimulation. The PGE2-induced reduction in β-cell repetitive firing would decrease calcium channel opening, and thus, insulin secretion.</p>
<p>In summary, this study uncovers a previously unknown role of the EP2/4-PKA-Kv2.2 signaling pathway in the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on GSIS in normal β-cells. This provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between prostaglandins, potassium channels, and insulin secretion, contributing to our understanding of pancreatic islet function and potential implications for diabetes mellitus.</p>

<title>Isolation of Primary Mouse Pancreatic Islets</title>
<p>Pancreatic islets were isolated from 7-week-old wild-type and KCNB2-KO male mice as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lernmark, 1974</xref>). Briefly, mice were euthanized, and a collagenase XI solution (0.5 mg/ml) was injected into the pancreas via the common bile duct with approximately 3 ml per mouse. The intact pancreas was carefully dissected, and digested for 16 min at 37°C. Afterward, 20 mL of HBSS solution was added, and the mixture was filtered through a 60-micron sieve. After brief centrifugation, a density gradient centrifugation system was established using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma), Histopaque-1119 (Sigma), and HBSS solution for pancreatic islet separation and purification. The islets were manually picked under a stereo microscope and cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. The time between islet isolation and the experiment typically ranged from 24-48 h.</p>

<title>Generation of Kv2.2 knockout mice</title>
<p>The Kv2.2 channel coding gene, KCNB2 (Accession: NM_001098528.3), underwent conventional knockout using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Two guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed to target the KCNB2 gene. The sequences for the gRNAs are as follows: gRNA1: GAGAGTTAAGATCAACGTAG; gRNA2: AACTCGTCCGTGGCTGCAAA. The Cas9 protein was prepared and complexed with the two synthesized gRNAs to form ribonucleoprotein complexes. Ribonucleoprotein complexes were microinjected to fertilized C57BL/6 mouse oocytes to induce double-strand breaks at the KCNB2 gene target sites. The microinjected embryos were cultured in vitro to the appropriate developmental stage and then transferred into the oviducts or uteruses of pseudo pregnant recipient female mice. The recipient females gave birth to F<sub>0</sub> offspring. Genotyping of F<sub>0</sub> Mice: DNA was extracted from the tail tips of the F<sub>0</sub> mice. PCR was performed using two pairs of primers to amplify the regions flanking the target sites of the KCNB2 gene. The primer sequences are as follows: F1: TGATGTGGCGATGCCTATTCC; R1: TTCCCACAGACTAACACTTACGG; R2: TCTTCTGATGGTATCTGGCTTGG. The PCR products were purified and sequenced to confirm the knockout of the KCNB2 gene. Mice confirmed to have the desired KCNB2 gene knockout were bred to produce a stable line of KCNB2 conventional knockout mice for further studies. The KCNB2 knockout mouse was created by Cyagen Biosciences (Suzhou) Inc, China. All animals were accommodated in specific pathogen-free Fudan University facilities following a 12-hour light-dark cycle.</p>

<p>The study presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings on the molecular mechanisms of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic islets, focusing on the main regulatory elements of the signaling pathway in physiological conditions. While the evidence supporting the conclusions is <bold>solid</bold>, the study can be strengthened by the use of a beta cell line or knockout mice. The work will be of interest to cell biologists and biochemists working on diabetes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigated the mechanism by which PGE2 inhibits the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells in response to glucose. The researchers used a combination of cell line experiments and studies in mice with genetic ablation of the Kv2.2 channel. Their findings suggest a novel pathway where PGE2 acts through EP2/EP4 receptors to activate PKA, which directly phosphorylates a specific site (S448) on the Kv2.2 channel, inhibiting its activity and reducing GSIS.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The study elegantly demonstrates a potential pathway connecting PGE2, EP2/EP4 receptors, PKA, and Kv2.2 channel activity, using embryonic cell line.</p>
<p>
- Additional experiments in INS1 and primary mouse beta cells with altered Kv2.2 function partially support the inhibitory role of PGE2 on GSIS through Kv2.2 inhibition.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- A critical limitation is the use of HEK293T cells, which are not pancreatic beta cells. Functional aspects can differ significantly between these cell types.</p>
<p>
- The study needs to address the apparent contradiction of PKA activating insulin secretion in beta cells, while also inhibiting GSIS through the proposed mechanism.</p>
<p>
- A more thorough explanation is needed for the discrepancies observed between the effects of PGE2 versus Kv2.2 knockdown/mutation on the electrical activity of beta cells and GSIS.</p>

<p>The authors identified new target elements for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) through which insulin release can be regulated in pancreatic beta cells under physiological conditions. In vitro extracellular exposure to PGE2 could directly and dose-dependently inhibit the potassium channel Kv2.2. In vitro pharmacology revealed that this inhibition occurs through the EP2/4 receptors, which activate protein kinase A (PKA). By screening specific sites of the Kv2.2 channel, the target phosphorylation site (S448) for PKA regulation was found. The physiological relevance of the described signaling cascade was investigated and confirmed in vivo, using a Kv2.2 knockdown mouse model.</p>
<p>The strength of this manuscript is the novelty of the (EP2/4-PKA-Kv2.2 channel) molecular pathway described and the comprehensive methodological toolkit the authors have relied upon.</p>
<p>The introduction is detailed and contains all the information necessary to place the claims in context. Although the dataset is comprehensive and a logical lead is consistently built, there is one important point to consider: to clarify that the described signaling pathway is characteristic of normal physiological conditions and thus differs from pathological changes. It would be useful to carry out basic experiments in a diabetes model (regardless of whether this is in mice or rats).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their positive evaluation and constructive feedback on our study.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the concern regarding the use of HEK293T cells. In the revised manuscript, we will provide a more detailed explanation of the role of the PKA pathway in the regulation of GSIS by PGE2. To validate this regulation through Kv2.2, we will overexpress the Kv2.2 mutant channel in beta cells and assess its impact. Additionally, we will verify the specificity of the antibodies for EP1-EP4 receptors by knockdown. To confirm the receptors involved in PGE2 function, we will use additional EP receptor blockers or perform receptor knockdown experiments.</p>
<p>We will clarify that the described signaling pathway operates under normal physiological conditions and differs from pathological changes.</p>
<p>We once again thank the reviewers for their positive evaluation and constructive suggestions.</p>
