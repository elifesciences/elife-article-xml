<abstract><p>The population of kisspeptin neurons located in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) is thought to have a key role in generating the GnRH surge that triggers ovulation. Using a modified GCaMP fibre photometry procedure, we have been able to record the in vivo population activity of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons across the estrous cycle of female mice. A marked increase in GCaMP activity was detected beginning on the afternoon of proestrus that lasted in total for 13±1 hours. This was comprised of slow baseline oscillations with a period of 91±4 min and associated with high frequency rapid transients. Very little oscillating baseline or transient activity was detected at other stages of the estrous cycle. Concurrent blood sampling showed that the peak of the LH surge occurred 3.5±1.1 h after the first baseline RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron baseline oscillation on the afternoon of proestrus. The time of onset of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron oscillations varied between mice and across subsequent proestrous stages in the same mice. To assess the impact of estradiol on RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity, mice were ovariectomized and given an incremental estradiol replacement regimen. Minimal patterned GCaMP activity was found in OVX mice, and this was not changed acutely by any of the estradiol treatments. However, on the afternoon of the expected LH surge, the same oscillating baseline activity with associated transients occurred for 7.1±0.5 h. These observations reveal an unexpected prolonged oscillatory pattern of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity that is dependent on estrogen and underlies the preovulatory LH surge as well as potentially other facets of reproductive behavior.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A neural surge generator is responsible for integrating multiple signals to control the mid-cycle activation of GnRH neurons that triggers the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Herbison 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kauffman 2022</xref>). It now seems clear that a preoptic area population of kisspeptin neurons that directly activate GnRH neuron cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Piet, Kalil et al. 2018</xref>) is an essential component of the surge generator in spontaneously ovulating mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Matsuda, Ohkura et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Goodman, Herbison et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The primary regulator of surge generator activity in spontaneously ovulating species is the gradually increasing levels of circulating estradiol that occur throughout the follicular phase of the cycle. In rodents, this “estrogen positive feedback” mechanism is mediated by estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and occurs within the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wintermantel, Campbell et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Porteous and Herbison 2019</xref>); a preoptic brain region encompassing the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and periventricular preoptic nucleus (PeN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Herbison 2008</xref>). In vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to knockdown ESR1 expression selectively in RP3V kisspeptin (RP3V<sup>KISS</sup>) neurons has been shown to suppress both the LH surge and estrous cyclicity in adult female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wang, Vanacker et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Clarkson, Yip et al. 2023</xref>). Although of variable importance amongst mammalian species, a circadian input to the surge generator is also critical for the GnRH surge in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Goodman, Herbison et al. 2022</xref>). It remains unclear how this operates, but a vasopressin input from the suprachiasmatic nucleus to the RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons is suspected to be important in triggering the onset of the surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tonsfeldt, Mellon et al. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Piet 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The ability to monitor the activity of arcuate nucleus (ARN) kisspeptin neurons in freely behaving mice with GCaMP fibre photometry has been invaluable in defining and then understanding their role as the GnRH pulse generator in puberty and adulthood, as well as in pathological states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Clarkson, Han et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Han, Kane et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">McQuillan, Han et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Liu, Yeo et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">McQuillan, Clarkson et al. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Goto, Hagihara et al. 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Han, Morris et al. 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Goto, Hagihara et al. 2025</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhou, Han et al. 2025</xref>). To date, attempts to record the behaviour of the RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons have been unsuccessful due primarily to the vertical column-like topography of the RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons alongside the third ventricle. Indeed, attempts by us to employ bevelled or mirror lenses that gather fluorescence from the side of the optic fibre have been met with very limited success. We now report here the use of tapered optic fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pisano, Pisanello et al. 2019</xref>) that enable the population activity of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons to be monitored in real time in freely behaving mice. This reveals the estrogen-dependent dynamics of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron population activity across the estrous cycle and reveals an unexpected oscillatory pattern of synchronised activity that continues for over 12 hours on proestrus.</p>

<title>Characterization of GCaMP expression in RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons</title>
<p>Adult <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> (Palmiter v2) female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Padilla, Johnson et al. 2018</xref>) were injected bilaterally with recombinant Cre-dependent AAVs encoding GCaMP6s. As the relationship of Cre-driven expression to kisspeptin immunoreactivity has not been reported for the RP3V in this line, we undertook dual label immunofluorescence for GFP (GCaMP6s) and kisspeptin in 5 female mice killed on proestrus. All mice exhibited many GFP-immunoreactive cells (33.0 ± 5.9 cells/section) located primarily adjacent to the third ventricle within the preoptic area (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>) and this exhibited overlap with kisspeptin immunoreactivity (21.8 ± 3.1 cells/section) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>&amp;C). However, the numbers of clearly identifiable dual labelled cells were 10.4 ± 2.5/section resulting in 47.0 ± 5.7% of kisspeptin-immunoreactive neurons expressing GCaMP6s and 33.0 ± 5.5% of GFP cells expressing clearly cytoplasmic kisspeptin immunoreactivity. These relatively low levels of Cre-targeted expression, compared to ARN kisspeptin neurons, are typical for RP3V kisspeptin neurons in other Kiss1-Cre lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yip, Boehm et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yeo, Kyle et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Piet, Kalil et al. 2018</xref>). This presumably results from the difficulty of detecting kisspeptin immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of all RP3V kisspeptin neurons. <italic>Kiss1-Cre</italic> negative proestrus female mice given AAV injections (N=2) did not exhibit any GFP/GCaMP6s expression.</p>

<title>RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron population activity across the estrous cycle</title>
<p>To make fibre photometry recordings from RP3V kisspeptin neurons, mice were given unilateral injections of AAV9-CAG.FLEX.GCaMP6s into the RP3V of adult <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> female mice followed by the implantation of a tapered optic fibre (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). Three weeks later, mice were recorded continuously across each day of the estrous cycle. The GCaMP signals recorded from RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons (N=8) showed minimal fluctuations during metestrus and diestrus but became markedly more active on the afternoon of proestrus displaying an oscillatory pattern of increased baseline fluorescence associated with high frequency transients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>,C). This heightened activity gradually subsided by the morning of estrus before returning to a quiescent state (Fig.B,C). An assessment of relative activity across the estrous cycle using area under the curve (AUC) demonstrated a significant increase in GCaMP fluorescence on proestrus compared to all of the other stages (Friedman Test: χ²=16.2, p=0.0010; Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests: p=0.0402 (metestrus), p=0.006 (diestrus), p=0.0402 (estrus); <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D</xref>).

<title>RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron population activity in relation to the LH surge on proestrus</title>
<p>To examine the relationship between the increased activity of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons and the LH surge on proestrus, tail-tip bleeding was undertaken at 2–4-hour intervals for 8-10 hours (N=5).

<title>Oscillating baseline shifts in RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron population activity on proestrus</title>
<p>To provide a detailed analysis of the GCaMP signals recorded on proestrus, a customised MATLAB code was used to separate slow and fast signal components. A 30-minute moving average was applied to the original dF/F signal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>,D i) to extract the slow baseline changes in GCaMP activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>,D ii). Subtraction of this baseline from the original signal leaves the high frequency transients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>,D iii).</p>
<p>The baseline shifts in GCaMP fluorescence exhibited a consistent oscillatory pattern on proestrus in all 8 mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>,D ii &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4C</xref>). The first identified oscillation was observed to begin 3.7 ± 0.5 hours (range: 1.6-5.3 hours) before lights-off with the total duration of oscillatory behaviour lasting 12.7 ± 0.7 hours (range: 10.0-15.0 hours) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4C</xref>,E). The mean duration of each slow oscillation was 90.8 ± 4.4 minutes (range: 39.3-166.1 minutes). Oscillations were occasionally observed in other stages of the cycle (3 of the 8 mice) and these had similar durations (metestrus: 88.6 ± 9.5 minutes, diestrus: 120.4 ± 29.7 minutes, estrus: 91.9 ± 21.7 minutes; Kruskal-Wallis test: χ²=1.65, p=0.65). The numbers of oscillations observed on proestrus were substantially greater than at all other stages of the cycle (Friedman Test: χ²=18.75, p=0.0003; Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests: p=0.0402 (metestrus), p=0.0029 (diestrus), p=0.0117 (estrus); <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4E</xref>) and had significantly higher amplitudes (Friedman Test: χ²=17.86, p=0.0005; Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests: proestrus 7.2 ±0.9; metestrus 1.9 ± 1.0 p=0.0221, diestrus 1.1 ± 0.8 p=0.0084, estrus 1.5 ± 0.8 p=0.0084). Interestingly, a consistent ∼90-minute oscillation started one hour preceding “lights-off” throughout the estrous cycle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4F</xref>).</p>

<title>High frequency transient activity in RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron population activity</title>
<p>After baseline correction, high frequency transients were identified using a z-scoring approach, where dF/F traces were normalised and thresholded across multiple values (k = 1 to 4, step 0.2). This method provides a data-driven, threshold-independent way to detect transients while reducing the impact of noise and ensuring robustness across different signal amplitudes.</p>
<p>Transient activity was detected throughout the estrous cycle but had its highest frequency on proestrus (Repeated measures one-way ANOVA: F=24,35, p&lt;0.0001; Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests: p=0.0025 (metestrus), p=0.0003 (diestrus), p=0.0008 (estrus); <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5A</xref>,B). Similarly, the amplitude of individual transients was higher in proestrus compared to other stages (Repeated measures one-way ANOVA: F=35.58, p=0.0001; Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests: p=0.0032 (metestrus), p=0.0010 (diestrus), p=0.0014 (estrus); <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5A</xref>,C). Each transient typically had a duration of ∼10 s and this changed slightly across the cycle being longer in proestrus compared to estrus (Repeated measures one-way ANOVA: F=7.71, p=0.0059; Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests: p=0.0053), with transients also being longer in metestrus when compared to diestrus (Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests: p=0.040) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5D</xref>). When aligning high frequency transients with baseline oscillations, the up-state of each oscillation appears to coincide with an increased frequency of transients, whereas the troughs in the baseline correlate with a slower frequency of transients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>,D iv).</p>

<title>Shifting onset of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron population activation across subsequent proestrous stages</title>
<p>The onset of GnRH neuron surge activity exhibits substantial variability between mice and also within cycles in individual mice (Han, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yeo et al. 2025</xref>). To examine the consistency of the surge-like behaviour observed in proestrus, RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity was recorded across two or three proestrous stages in the same mouse and GCaMP signals were deconvolved to assess baseline shifts.</p>
<p>All seven mice exhibited variability in the initiation and duration of oscillatory activity occurring during proestrus across different cycles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6A</xref>,B). On average, the peak of the first oscillation varied by 2.0 ± 0.5 hours when examining surge activity in the same mice (range: 0.4-4.2 hours; n=7). There was no consistent pattern in surge onset timing across subsequent proestrous surges with mice fluctuating both forward and backward (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6A</xref>,B).</p>

To examine the effect of estradiol on RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity, five of the mice reported above were ovariectomised (OVX) and subjected to a well-established estrogen replacement regimen involving the placement of E2-containing Silastic capsules followed by s.c. injection of estradiol benzoate (EB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bronson 1981</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7</xref>). This also provided within-animal comparisons between intact and OVX states as well as the proestrous and OVX+E2+EB-induced surges.</p>

<p>Mice examined one week after OVX exhibited a significant decrease in RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron population activity compared with the intact (diestrus) state (Figs.7A,B &amp; 8A; Paired t-test: p=0.002). Despite an upward trend, the subsequent replacement of E2 did not result in any significant change in RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity 5 days after capsule implantation (Figs.7B,C &amp; 8B) (Friedman test: χ²=10.68, p=0.0055 for all groups; Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests: p=0.26 (OVX vs OVX+E2)). This procedure has been shown previously to return estradiol to physiological diestrus levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Porteous, Haden et al. 2021</xref>). Similarly, the injection of EB on day 6 did not have any significant effect on GCaMP signal in OVX+E2+EB mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7C</xref>,D &amp; 8B) Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests: p&gt;0.99 (OVX vs OVX+E2+EB). However, the following day, when an LH surge was expected, RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity became elevated with the appearance of baseline oscillations and enhanced transient activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7E</xref>) with a significant increase in AUC fluorescence compared with OVX mice (Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests: p=0.021; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8B</xref>). Qualitatively, the pattern of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron surge activity appeared similar on proestrus and OVX+E2+EB in the same mice (FIG.7E,F) but the magnitude of change was substantially reduced in the OVX+E2+EB condition (paired t-test: p=0.014; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8C</xref>).</p>

<p>To evaluate RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity in more detail in the OVX+E2+EB paradigm, the same deconvolution methods employed for the intact recordings were used (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8D</xref>,E). Three of five females exhibited identified oscillations in OVX+E2+EB surge state with 3.7 ± 0.3 oscillations (range: 3-4 oscillations) occurring during the recording period and these had a duration of 88.6 ± 10.1 minutes per oscillation (range: 59.7-169.3 minutes), and an amplitude of 4.5 ± 1.2% (range: 2.2-6.1%). Average total duration of oscillatory activity in these mice was 7.1 ± 0.5 hours (range: 6.1-8.0 hours); significantly shorter compared to that of proestrus (unpaired t-test, p=0.001). During the other treatment conditions, only one out of five females exhibited a single identified oscillation on the day of EB injection (OVX+E2+EB).</p>
<p>Notably, the oscillation observed ∼1h before lights-off in intact mice disappeared after OVX but appeared to be restored under all estrogen replacement conditions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8D</xref>).</p>
<p>The high frequency transients (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8E</xref>) were evaluated across all four conditions. The frequency of transients was significantly elevated during the OVX+E2+EB surge condition compared to OVX (Friedman test: χ²=14.04, p&lt;0.0001; Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests: p=0.0014) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8E</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The durations of transients were not different across conditions (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>., Repeated measures one-way ANOVA: F=0.50, p=0.53). Although repeated measures one-way ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of estrogen treatment on transient amplitude (F=8.1, p=0.039), post-hoc analysis using Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests did not detect any significant pairwise differences between individual conditions (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report here that RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons exhibit a marked increase in population activity on the afternoon of proestrus consisting of 90-min duration oscillations associated with high frequency transient activity that last for approximately 13 hours. Given prior evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Goodman, Herbison et al. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kauffman 2022</xref>), the first half of this activation period almost certainly drives the proestrous LH surge while the role of the latter activity remains less certain. We show that this behavior of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons is driven by circulating estradiol although the standard OVX+E2+EB model of estrogen replacement used here appears insufficient to drive the normal magnitude of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity.</p>
<p>The activity of the RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron population is relatively stable during metestrus and diestrus with only very occasional excursions from basal activity. This changes markedly on the afternoon of proestrus when substantial baseline oscillations associated with large amounts of transient activity are recorded for the next ∼ 13 hours. It appears as though the onset of this activity occurs well before the start of the LH surge as the peak of the surge occurred 3-4 hours after the onset of oscillatory RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity. While the temporal resolution of our blood sampling (hours) is poor compared to that of the neural recordings (seconds), elevated oscillatory RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity was always present at 13:00 h when LH levels were low in the 5 mice examined. In contrast, GnRH neuron activity on proestrus is much more coincident with the onset of the LH surge (Han, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yeo et al. 2025</xref>). This suggests that despite the potent and abrupt activation of GnRH neurons by exogenous kisspeptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Han, Gottsch et al. 2005</xref>) or by optogenetic activation of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Piet, Kalil et al. 2018</xref>), a sustained period of rising RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity may normally occur to activate the GnRH neurons to induce the surge.</p>
<p>We also find that RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity continues for many hours past the peak of the LH surge. This is the same as the profile of GnRH neuron activity in the mouse on proestrus (Han, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yeo et al. 2025</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu, Shen et al. 2025</xref>)(<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig.9</xref>) and long-standing observation that GnRH secretion at the median eminence long outlasts the LH surge in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sarkar, Chiappa et al. 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pau, Berria et al. 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Karsch, Bowen et al. 1997</xref>). While it remains unclear what the role of GnRH secretion after the LH surge may be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Skinner and Caraty 2002</xref>), it is very likely that the extended period of GnRH and LH secretion is driven by prolonged RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron input to the GnRH neurons.</p>

</fig>
<p>The impact of extended proestrus RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity on other neural networks in the forebrain remain unknown. The RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons project widely throughout the limbic forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yeo and Herbison 2011</xref>) and may conceivably operate to coordinate multiple functions relevant to reproduction at proestrus. Indeed, commensurate with the long period of elevated RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity detected here following the surge, these neurons have been proposed to have a role in modulating female mate preference and copulatory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hellier, Brock et al. 2018</xref>) that would typically occur a few hours after the surge. At present, a detailed analysis of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons projections is lacking and it remains unknown whether the sub-population of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons innervating GnRH neurons also send collaterals to other brain regions.</p>
<p>The recent ability to record the activity of the GnRH neuron population in vivo revealed that their elevated activity on the afternoon of proestrus occurred in an oscillatory manner with a period of ∼ 78 min (Han, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yeo et al. 2025</xref>). This provides a striking parallel with the ∼ 91 min-duration oscillations now detected in RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons activity over the exact same time period. This suggests that the unusual oscillatory pattern of GnRH neuron activity on proestrus is being driven by RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons. Indeed, the entire profile of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> and GnRH neuron activity across proestrus is strikingly similar (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig.9</xref>) making it very likely that GnRH neuron activity on proestrus is patterned almost entirely by the RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons. Nevertheless, a small role may also exist for the ARN kisspeptin neuron pulse generator as it remains active during the ascending phase of the proestrous LH surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">McQuillan, Han et al. 2019</xref>, Han, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yeo et al. 2025</xref>). As such, the episodic release of kisspeptin from the ARN pulse generator on GnRH neuron dendrons may potentiate early GnRH secretion driven by RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons. However, the functional impact of ARN kisspeptin neurons on the surge remains unclear in mice as the deletion of ARN kisspeptin neurons was not found to have any effect on the LH surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Coutinho, Esparza et al. 2024</xref>) while selective removal of kisspeptin from ARN neurons resulted in a decrease in the amplitude of the LH surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Velasco, Franssen et al. 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>It is interesting to speculate on how oscillatory activity may be generated in RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons and what role it may play. We find that the baseline GCaMP oscillations are associated with intense high frequency transient activity with each transient having a duration of approximately 10 s. This may represent the signature of single or small groups of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons exhibiting 10 s burst firing that then go on to synchronise into 90 min episodes of activity. In acute brain slices, RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons often exhibit spontaneous burst firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jamieson and Piet 2022</xref>) and each burst is known to generate 5-10 s-duration calcium transients in GCaMP recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Piet, Fraissenon et al. 2015</xref>). It is also interesting to note that the optogenetic induction of burst firing in RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons is the most efficient mode for activating GnRH neurons and LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Piet, Kalil et al. 2018</xref>). How RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons may synchronise their activity is unknown. It is possible that, like ARN kisspeptin neurons, they use direct recurrent collateral innervation to facilitate periods of synchronous bursting. Alternatively, synchronicity may be generated within a wider network of RP3V circuitry and/or by afferent inputs. The physiological roles and necessity for episodic activity in GnRH neurons, driven by RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons, are also unknown. As these neurons are required to be intensely active for prolonged periods of over 12 hours, it is possible that recurrent episodes of inhibition protect RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> and GnRH neurons from excitotoxicity.</p>
<p>It is well established that the onset of the LH surge is entrained by circadian inputs in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tonsfeldt, Mellon et al. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Piet 2023</xref>). However, this entrainment is not highly time locked compared to other circadian-timed events such as locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Starnes and Jones 2023</xref>). We show here that the onset of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity between mice, and even within the same mouse, varies by several hours around the time of “lights off” on proestrus. The exact same observations have been made for GnRH neuron activation and the LH surge on proestrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Miller, Olson et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Minabe, Uenoyama et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Czieselsky, Prescott et al. 2016</xref>, Yeo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Han et al. 2025</xref>). Given this variability, we were surprised to observe a tightly time-locked RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron increment in activity almost exactly one hour before “lights off” on proestrus, as well as on every other day of the cycle. While this would appear to be a rigid circadian input to the RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons, its role in triggering the LH surge is unclear and will require further investigation. Interestingly, OVX mice were the only group in which we did not observe this circadian event. This dependence on estrogen is reminiscent of the excitatory effect of vasopressin on RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron firing that is unchanging in different estrogenic states but absent in OVX mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Piet, Fraissenon et al. 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>We find that the activity of the RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron population is reduced 7-days following ovariectomy but that relatively little change is evoked by a sequential regimen of estrogen replacement until the day of the expected surge when proestrus-like oscillatory activity emerges. This is consistent with the concept of the surge being generated by rising estrogen levels that harness slow transcriptional mechanisms to alter RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Glidewell-Kenney, Hurley et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Herbison 2015</xref>). Increments in circulating estradiol either in the OVX+E model or during diestrus, when estradiol levels peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wall, Desai et al. 2023</xref>), appear to have little immediate effect on RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity patterns. This is broadly in agreement with acute brain slice studies that have consistently found reduced RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons firing rates following OVX but then rather few consistent changes in firing across the estrous cycle itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jamieson and Piet 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, it is clear that estrogen treatment of OVX mice slowly up-regulates sodium (I<sub>NaP</sub>), calcium (I<sub>T</sub>), and hyperpolarization-activated (I<sub>h</sub>) ion channels in RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons, that would all be expected to result in increased excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jamieson and Piet 2022</xref>). Once established, these changes in ion channel expression are presumably at least partly responsible for the enhanced oscillatory-like activity patterns of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons observed on the day of the surge.</p>
<p>While the same pattern of RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity is observed on the afternoon of proestrus and in the OVX+E2+EB model, it is evident that the magnitude of change is dramatically reduced in the latter. Although we did not assess surge LH levels in the OVX+E2+EB mice used in this study, prior work from the laboratory using the same model has shown that peak LH surge levels (7.7±0.7 ng/mL) are half of that observed on proestrus (14.5±1.5 ng/mL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Czieselsky, Prescott et al. 2016</xref>). This inability to recreate proestrous-like LH surge levels is typical in estrogen-replaced OVX mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bronson and Vom Saal 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dror, Franks et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Silveira, Burger et al. 2017</xref>). We would suggest that the reduced amplitude of the LH surge in estrogen-replaced OVX models likely originates from sub-optimal activation of the RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons. This may be due to the lack of progesterone or other ovarian factors in estrogen-replaced OVX models. However, it is important to note that the seminal experiments of Bronson and Vom Saal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bronson and Vom Saal 1979</xref>) identified that a full LH surge can be achieved in OVX+E2+EB mice with careful attention to the timing of the EB injection. Our present OVX+E2+EB protocol matches the most efficacious protocol of Bronson and Vom Saal with the exception of using 4 compared to 5 μg E2 capsules and a 12:12 rather than 14:10 lighting regimen.</p>
<p>In summary, we demonstrate that RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neurons exhibit an unusual, extended period of baseline oscillatory activity on proestrus. The genesis of oscillatory RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuronal activity is critically dependent on long-term exposure to estradiol with a less clear involvement of circadian inputs. This oscillatory RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity almost certainly drives the same pattern of GnRH neuron activity detected at this time which is critical for triggering the preovulatory LH surge. It possible that the oscillatory RP3V<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity existing beyond the generation of the LH surge operates to coordinate other neural circuits controlling reproduction such as those underlying female sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hellier, Brock et al. 2018</xref>).</p>

Fluorescence signals were sampled at 10 Hz using a scheduled mode (2 seconds on/ 2 seconds off) of light emission with custom software (Tussock Innovation). Twenty two-hour recordings were made from mice across each stage of the estrous cycle, 1 week after ovariectomy, and during different times of the OVX+E2+EB surge protocol (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7</xref>); with all starting 4 hours after lights-on.</p>
<p>Analysis of fluorescent signals was performed in MATLAB with the subtraction of the 405 signal from the 465 signal to extract the calcium-dependent fluorescence signal.

<p>Numpy.trapezoid function was used in Python to calculate the definite integral of the curve, approximating the area under the curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule.

With this approach, slow oscillations in baseline were then identified by findpeaks function in MATLAB with a) a minimum peak height set as two standard deviations above the mean calcium signal from 11:00-13:00 hours, b) minimum peak distance as 30 minutes, and c) minimum peak prominence as 0.15 of maximum signal in proestrous recording for each animal. Time taken between one trough to another in individual oscillations was calculated as the duration of each oscillation. The total duration of the surge signals was measured from their onset to offset. Onset was defined as the trough at the start of the first oscillation, and offset was defined as the trough at the end of the last oscillation.</p>
<p>To analyse the high frequency transients, the 30-minute moving average was subtracted from the original signal, and an additional exponential fit algorithm with a 400-second window was applied in MATLAB to correct baseline shifts. To identify significant calcium transients, the method of Dombeck and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dombeck, Harvey et al. 2010</xref>) was adapted for GCaMP6s dynamics. First, the dF/F trace was z-scored such that its median was normalised to zero, and the standard deviation was set to one. Then, a series of thresholds iterated over the range 1 to 4 with step size 0.2: k = [1, 1.2, 1.4, …, 4] were defined. For each threshold k: positive and negative-going transients (T<sub>pos</sub> and T<sub>neg</sub>) were identified. The z-scored trace was then thresholded such that z-score &gt; k to generate a binary array. The segments of the array labelled as 1 (active transient) were classified as T<sub>pos</sub>. The z-scored trace was also thresholded so that z-score &lt; -k, producing another binary array, with segments labelled as 1 classified as T<sub>neg</sub>. For each transient in T<sub>pos</sub>, the transient significance was also assessed for its duration size s. The number of transients with sizes larger than s in both T<sub>pos</sub> and T<sub>neg</sub> were counted, as n<sub>pos</sub> and n<sub>neg</sub> respectively. If n<sub>neg</sub>/ n<sub>pos</sub> &lt; 0.05, the positive transients with sizes greater than s were identified as significant. Any part of the trace identified as significant under any combination of k and s was considered a significant transient.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10 software. Each dataset was tested for normality with Shapiro-Wilk test and visual inspection of Q-Q plots. Homogeneity of variance was tested by F-test when comparing two groups or Bartlett’s test when comparing three or more groups. If data are normally distributed and variances are homogeneous, one-way ANOVA, repeated measures one-way ANOVA with Geisser-Greenhouse correction followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, and paired t-tests were applied. Non-parametric tests, such as Friedman test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison tests were used when data are not normally distributed, or when the variances are not homogeneous. The threshold level for statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work advances our understanding of the role of kisspeptin neurons in regulating the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in females. The evidence demonstrating increased neuronal activity in anterior hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons just before the LH surge is <bold>compelling</bold>, though additional neuroanatomical evidence showing the specificity of the methods would strengthen the study. It also confirms that high circulating levels of estradiol, but also other unidentified factors, are required for the full daily activation. This research will be of interest to reproductive biologists and neuroscientists studying the female ovarian cycle.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an excellent, timely study investigating and characterizing the underlying neural activity that generates the neuroendocrine GnRH and LH surges that are responsible for triggering ovulation. Abundant evidence accumulated over the past 20 years implicated the population of kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic RP3V region (also referred to as the POA or AVPV/PeN kisspeptin neurons) as being involved in driving the GnRH surge in response to elevated estradiol (E2), also known as the &quot;estrogen positive feedback&quot;. However, while former studies used Cfos coexpression as a marker of RP3V kisspeptin neuron activation at specific times and found this correlates with the timing of the LH surge, detailed examination of the live in vivo activity of these neurons before, during, and after the LH surge remained elusive due to technical challenges.</p>
<p>Here, Zhou and colleagues use fiber photometry to measure the long-term synchronous activity of RP3V kisspeptin neurons across different stages of the mouse estrous cycle, including on proestrus when the LH surge occurs, as well as in a well-established OVX+E2 mouse model of the LH surge.</p>
<p>The authors report that RP3V kisspeptin neuron activity is low on estrous and diestrus, but increases on proestrus several hours before the late afternoon LH surge, mirroring prior reports of rising GnRH neuron activity in proestrus female mice. The measured increase in RP3V kisspeptin activation is long, spanning ~13 hours in proestrus females and extending well beyond the end of the LH secretion, and is shown by the authors to be E2 dependent.</p>
<p>For this work, Kiss-Cre female mice received a Cre-dependent AAV injection, containing GCaMP6, to measure the neuronal activation of RP3V Kiss1 cells. Females exhibited periods of increased neuronal activation on the day of proestrus, beginning several hours prior to the LH surge and lasting for about 12 hours. Though oscillations in the pattern of GCaMP fluorescence were occasionally observed throughout the ovarian cycle, the frequency, duration, and amplitude of these oscillations were significantly higher on the day of proestrus. This increase in RP3V Kiss1 neuronal activation that precedes the increase in LH supports the hypothesis that these neurons are critical in regulating the LH surge. The authors compare this data to new data showing a similar increased activation pattern in GnRH neurons just prior to the LH surge, further supporting the hypothesis that RP3V Kiss1 cell activation causes the release of kisspeptin to stimulate GnRH neurons and produce the LH surge.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study provides compelling data demonstrating that RP3V kisspeptin neuronal activity changes throughout the ovarian cycle, likely in response to changes in estradiol levels, and that neuronal activation increases on the day of the LH surge.</p>
<p>The observed increase in RP3V kisspeptin neuronal activation precedes the LH surge, which lends support to the hypothesis that these neurons play a role in regulating the estradiol-induced LH surge. Continuing to examine the complexities of the LH surge and the neuronal populations involved, as done in this study, is critical for developing therapeutic treatments for women's reproductive disorders.</p>
<p>This innovative study uses a within-subject design to examine neuronal activation in vivo across multiple hormone milieus, providing a thorough examination of the changes in activation of these neurons. The variability in neuronal activity surrounding the LH surge across ovarian cycles in the same animals is interesting and could not be achieved without this within-subjects design. The inclusion and comparison of ovary-intact females and OVX+E2 females is valuable to help test mechanisms under these two valuable LH surge conditions, and allows for further future studies to tease apart minor differences in the LH surge pattern between these 2 conditions.</p>
<p>This study provides an excellent experimental setup able to monitor the daily activity of preoptic kisspeptin neurons in freely moving female mice. It will be a valuable tool to assess the putative role of these kisspeptin neurons in various aspects of altered female fertility (aging, pathologies...). This approach also offers novel and useful insights into the impact of E2 and circadian cues on the electrical activity of RP3V kisspeptin neurons.</p>
<p>An intriguing cyclical oscillation in kisspeptin neural activity every 90 minutes exists, which may offer critical insight into how the RP3V kisspeptin system operates. Interestingly, there was also variability in the onset and duration of RP3V Kisspeptin neuron activity between and within mice in naturally cycling females. Preoptic kisspeptin neurons show an increased activity around the light/dark transition only on the day of proestrus, and this is associated with an increase in LH secretion. An original finding is the observation that the peak of kisspeptin neuron activation continues a few hours past the peak of LH, and the authors hypothesize that this prolonged activity could drive female sexual behaviors, which usually appear after the LH surge.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrated that ovariectomy resulted in very little neuronal activity in RP3V kisspeptin neurons. When these ovarietomized females were treated with estradiol benzoate (EB) and an LH surge was induced, there was an increase in RP3V kisspeptin neuronal activation, as was seen during proestrus. However, the magnitude of the change in activity was greater during proestrus than during the EB-induced LH surge. Interestingly, the authors noted a consistent peak in activity about 90 minutes prior to lights out on each day of the ovarian cycle and during EB treatment, but not in ovariectomized females. The functional purpose of this consistent neuronal activity at this time remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Though not part of this study, the comparison of neuronal activation of GnRH neurons during the LH surge to the current data was convincing, demonstrating a similar pattern of increased activation that precedes the LH surge.</p>
<p>In summary, the study is well-designed, uses proper controls and analyses, has robust data, and the paper is nicely organized and written. The data from these experiments is compelling, and the authors' claims and conclusions are nicely supported and justified by the data. The data support the hypothesis in the field that these RP3V neurons regulate the LH surge. Overall, these findings are important and novel, and lend valuable insight into the underlying neural mechanisms for neuroendocrine control of ovulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) LH levels were not measured in many mice or in robust temporal detail, such as every 30 or 60 min, to allow a more detailed comparison between the fine-scale timing of RP3V neuron activation with onset and timing of LH surge dynamics.</p>
<p>(2) The authors report that the peak LH value occurred 3.5 hours after the first RP3V kisspeptin neuron oscillation. However, it is likely, and indeed evident from the 2 example LH patterns shown in Figures 3A-B, that LH values start to increase several hours before the peak LH. This earlier rise in LH levels (&quot;onset&quot; of the surge) occurs much closer in time to the first RP3V kisspeptin neuron oscillatory activation, and as such, the ensuing LH secretion may not be as delayed as the authors suggest.</p>
<p>(3) The authors nicely show that there is some variation (~2 hours) in the peak of the first oscillation in proestrus females. Was this same variability present in OVX+E2 females, or was the variability smaller or absent in OVX+E2 versus proestrus? It is possible that the variability in proestrus mice is due to variability in the timing and magnitude of rising E2 levels, which would, in theory, be more tightly controlled and similar among mice in the OVX+E2 model. If so, the OVX+E2 mice may have less variability between mice for the onset of RP3V kisspeptin activity.</p>
<p>(4) One concern regarding this study is the lack of data showing the specificity of the AAV and the GCaMP6s signals. There are no data showing that GCaMP6s is limited to the RP3V and is not expressed in other Kiss1 populations in the brain. Given that 2ul of the AAV was injected, which seems like a lot considering it was close to the ventricle, it is important to show that the signal and measured activity are specific to the RP3V region. Though the authors discuss potential reasons for the low co-expression of GCaMP6 and kisspeptin immunoreactivity, it does raise some concern regarding the interpretation of these results. The low co-expression makes it difficult to confirm the Kiss1 cell-specificity of the Cre-dependent AAV injections. In addition, if GFP (GCaMP6s) and kisspeptin protein co-localization is low, it is possible that the activation of these neurons does not coincide with changes in kisspeptin or that these neurons are even expressing Kiss1 or kisspeptin at the time of activation. It is important to remember that the study measures activation of the kisspeptin neuron, and it does not reveal anything specific about the activity of the kisspeptin protein.</p>
<p>(5) One additional minor concern is that LH levels were not measured in the ovariectomized females during the expected time of the LH surge. The authors suggest that the lower magnitude of activation during the LH surge in these females, in comparison to proestrus females, may be the result of lower LH levels. It's hard to interpret the difference in magnitude of neuronal activation between EB-treated and proestrus females without knowing LH levels. In addition, it's possible that an LH surge did not occur in all EB-treated females, and thus, having LH levels would confirm the success of the EB treatment.</p>
<p>(6) This kisspeptin neuron peak activity is abolished in ovariectomized mice, and estradiol replacement restored this activity, but only partially. Circulating levels of estradiol were not measured in these different setups, but the authors hypothesize that the lack of full restoration may be due to the absence of other ovarian signals, possibly progesterone.</p>
<p>(7) Recordings in several mice show inter- and intra-variability in the time of peak onset. It is not shown whether this variability is associated with a similar variability in the timing of the LH surge onset in the recorded mice. The authors hypothesized that this variability indicates a poor involvement of the circadian input. However, no experiments were done to investigate the role of the (vasopressinergic-driven) circadian input on the kisspeptin neuron activation at the light/dark transition. Thus, we suggest that the authors be more tentative about this hypothesis.</p>
