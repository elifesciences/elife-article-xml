<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Serine(S)/threonine(T)-glutamine(Q) cluster domains (SCDs), polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts and polyglutamine/asparagine (polyQ/N) tracts are Q-rich motifs found in many proteins. SCDs often are intrinsically disordered regions that mediate protein phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions. PolyQ and polyQ/N tracts are structurally flexible sequences that trigger protein aggregation. We report that due to their high percentages of STQ or STQN amino acid content, four SCDs and three prion-causing Q/N-rich motifs of yeast proteins possess autonomous protein expression-enhancing activities. Since these Q-rich motifs can endow proteins with structural and functional plasticity, we suggest that they represent useful toolkits for evolutionary novelty. Comparative Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of the near-complete proteomes of 27 representative model eukaryotes reveal that Q-rich motifs prevail in proteins involved in specialized biological processes, including <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> RNA-mediated transposition and pseudohyphal growth, <italic>Candida albicans</italic> filamentous growth, ciliate peptidyl-glutamic acid modification and microtubule-based movement, <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> xylan catabolism and meiosis, <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> development and sexual cycles, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection, and the nervous systems of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>. We also show that Q-rich-motif proteins are expanded massively in ten ciliates with reassigned TAA<sup>Q</sup> and TAG<sup>Q</sup> codons. Notably, the usage frequency of CAG<sup>Q</sup> is much lower in ciliates with reassigned TAA<sup>Q</sup> and TAG<sup>Q</sup> codons than in organisms with expanded and unstable Q runs (e.g., <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>H. sapiens</italic>), indicating that the use of noncanonical stop codons in ciliates may have coevolved with codon usage biases to avoid triplet repeat disorders mediated by CAG/GTC replication slippage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>We reported previously that the NH2-terminal domain (NTD; residues 1–66) of budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Rad51 protein contains three SQ motifs (S<sup>2</sup>Q, S<sup>12</sup>Qand S<sup>30</sup>Q) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The S/T-Q motifs, comprising S or T followed by Q, are the target sites of DNA damage sensor protein kinases, i.e., ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated), ATR (RAD3-related) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Mec1 (<underline>M</underline>itotic <underline>E</underline>ntry <underline>C</underline>heckpoint 1) and Tel1 (<underline>TEL</underline>omere maintenance 1) are the budding yeast homologs of mammalian ATR and ATM, respectively. Budding yeast lacks a DNA-PK homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). This clustering of three SQ motifs within a stretch of 31 amino acids in Rad51-NTD fulfills the criteria to define an S/T-Q cluster domain (SCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The three SQ motifs of Rad51-NTD are phosphorylated in a Mec1-and Tel1-dependent manner during vegetative growth and meiosis. Mec1/Tel1-dependent NTD phosphorylation antagonizes Rad51 degradation via the proteasomal pathway, increasing the half-life of Rad51 from <bold>∼</bold>30 min to <bold>≥</bold> 180 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), supporting the notion that Mec1 and Tel1 exhibit an essential function in regulating protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>A unifying definition of an SCD is having ≥3 S/T-Q sites within a stretch of 50-100 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). One of the best-understood mechanisms of SCD phosphorylation involves the association of SCDs with their binding partners containing a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. For example, Mec1/Tel1-dependent phosphorylation of Rad53-SCD1 (residues 1-29) and Hop1-SCD (residues 258-324) specifically recruits and activates their downstream DNA damage checkpoint kinases Dun1 and Mek1, respectively (9-11). Dun1 phosphorylates three serine residues (S56, S58 and S60) of the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor Sml1, subsequently promoting Sml1 ubiquitination by the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rad6 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr2, as well as promoting Sml1 degradation via the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Mek1 phosphorylates two Rad51 accessory factors, Rad54 and Hed1 (a meiosis-specific inhibitor of Rad51), suppressing Rad51’s strand-exchange activity and preventing Rad51-mediated DSB repair, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>There are many other SCD-containing proteins that are neither targets of ATM/Tel1 or ATR/Mec1 nor functionally linked to DNA Damage response or DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), indicating that SCDs might possess previously uncharacterized biochemical properties or physiological functions. Interestingly, due to their high percentages of STQ amino acid content, SCDs often are intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in their native states rather than adopting stable secondary and/or tertiary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). A common feature of IDRs is their high content of serine (S), threonine (T), glutamine (Q), asparanine (N), proline (P), glycine (G) or charged amino acids [arginine (R), lysine (K) and histidine (H)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Functionally, IDRs are key components of subcellular machineries and signaling pathways because they have the potential to associate with many partners due to their multiple possible metastable conformations. Many IDRs are regulated by alternative splicing and post-translational modifications. Some IDRs are involved in the formation of various membraneless organelles via intracellular liquid-liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Highly-charged IDRs can act as entropic bristles that, when translationally fused to their partner proteins, only enhance the water solubility but not the steady-state levels of their partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we first report that seven Q-rich motifs of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins, including Rad51-NTD (1), have high STQN or STQ amino acid contents and exhibit autonomous expression-enhancing activity for high-level production of native protein and when fused to exogenous target proteins, e.g., β<bold>-</bold>galactosidase (LacZ), <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also reveal structural and genetic requirements for the “nanny” function of these Q-rich motifs in regulating protein homeostasis, leading to the hypothesis that Q-rich motifs are useful toolkits for structural and functional plasticity, as well as evolutionary novelty. Next, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses on all proteins having Q-rich motifs (i.e., SCDs, polyQ and polyQ/N), as well as those with the homorepeat (polyX) motifs of other amino acid residues, in 20 non-ciliate and 17 ciliate species. Notably, relative to most other eukaryotes, many ciliates reassign their standard stop codons into amino acids (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For example, several ciliates possess two noncanonical nuclear genetic codes (UAA<sup>Q</sup> and UAG<sup>Q</sup>), in which the UAA and UAG stop codons have been reassigned to glutamine (Q) so that UGA is the sole functional stop codon, including <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic>, <italic>Paramecium bursaria</italic>, <italic>Oxytricha trifallax, Stylonychia lemnae</italic>, <italic>Pseudocohnilembus persalinus</italic>, <italic>Aristerostoma</italic> sp<italic>., Favella ehrenbergii, Pseudokeronopsis</italic> spp., <italic>Strombidium inclinatum,</italic> and <italic>Uronema</italic> spp. Both the UAA and UAG stop codons are reassigned to tyrosine (Y) in <italic>Favella ehrenbergii</italic>, whereas the UGA stop codon is translated to tryptophan (W) or cysteine (C) in <italic>Blepharisma japonicum</italic> and <italic>Euplotes focardii,</italic> respectively. In contrast, <italic>Stentor coeruleus, Climacostomum virens, Litonotus pictus</italic> and <italic>Protocruzia adherens</italic> utilize the universal set of genetic codons. <italic>Condylostoma magnum</italic> and <italic>Parduzcia</italic> sp. have no dedicated genetic codes. Their UAA, UAG and UGA codons can be stop codons or translated to Q, C and W, respectively. Translation termination at the mRNA 3′ end occurs in a context-dependent manner to distinguish stop from sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Although it has been reported previously that Q is used more frequently in <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> and <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> than in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), many important questions regarding stop codon reassignment in ciliates remain unresolved. For instance, fundamentally, it is unclear if Q, Y, W and C are used more frequently in other ciliates in which stop codons are reassigned. Moreover, whether there are common or specific structural motif(s) in proteins arising from stop codon reassignment is not clear. Furthermore, what are the structural and functional impacts of such genome-wide alterations? Finally, the codons that code for the polyQ motifs are prone to a CAG/GTC-slippage mechanism during DNA replication, and thus many Q-runs are unstable and expanded in some eukaryotic organisms, leading to polyQ-associated diseases (e.g., Huntington’s Disease) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Accordingly, polyQ tracts in proteins associated with disease are more enriched in the CAG codon, becoming almost CAG exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). In contrast, CAA insertions in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of a polyQ-associated disease revealed that even though the resulting polyQ tract is of the same length as the disease-associated tract, the proteins display reduced toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). In this study, we determine and compare the usage frequency of TAA<sup>Q</sup>, TAG<sup>Q</sup>, CAA<sup>Q</sup>, and CAG<sup>Q</sup> in ciliates and non-ciliate eukaryotes.</p>

<p>We have shown previously in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that Rad51-NTD autonomously promotes high-level production of native Rad51 and its COOH-terminal fusion protein LacZ (β-galactosidase) <italic>in vivo</italic> (1). To do so, in brief, we expressed Rad51-NTD-LacZ-NVH fusion proteins using a <italic>CEN-ARS</italic> plasmid (low-copy number) under the control of the native <italic>RAD51</italic> gene promoter (<italic>P<sub>RAD51</sub></italic>) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The NVH tag contains an SV40 nuclear localization signal (<underline>N</underline>LS) peptide preceding a <underline>V</underline>5 epitope tag and a hexahistidine (<underline>H</underline>is<sub>6</sub>) affinity tag (1). We confirmed that the N-terminal addition of Rad51-NTD to LacZ-NVH increased both steady-state levels of LacZ-NVH fusion proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and β-galactosidase activities <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Here, we further report that yeast Rad53-SCD1, Hop1-SCD, Sml1-NTD<sup>1–50</sup> (residues 1–50) and Sml1-NTD<sup>1–27</sup> (residues 1–27) also exhibit protein expression-enhancing (PEE) activities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The Sml1 protein in the SK1 strain harbors three S/T-Q motifs (S<sup>4</sup>Q, S<sup>14</sup>Q and T<sup>47</sup>Q), whereas that in the S288c strain only has one SQ motif (S<sup>4</sup>Q, C<sup>14</sup>Q and T<sup>47</sup>M).</p>

<title>The Q-rich motifs of three yeast prion-causing proteins also exhibit PEE activities</title>
<p>Since Sml1-NTD<sup>1–27</sup> in the SK1 strain only harbors two S/T-Q motifs (S<sup>4</sup>Q and S<sup>14</sup>Q), the number of S/T-Q motifs alone could not account for PEE activity. Notably, Rad51-NTD, Rad53-SCD1, Hop1-SCD, Sml1-NTD<sup>1-27</sup> and Sml1-NTD<sup>1-50</sup> all represent Q- or Q/N-rich motifs. Rad51-NTD contains 9 serines (S), 2 threonines (T), 9 glutamines (Q) and 4 asparagines (N). Rad53-SCD1 has 2S, 4T, 7Q and 1N. Hop1-SCD has 6S, 6T, 8Q and 9N. Sml1-NTD<sup>1–27</sup> and Sml1-NTD<sup>1–50</sup> in SK1 possess 3S and 5S, 2T and 3T, 6Q and 7Q, as well as 2N and 3N, respectively.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we investigated if other Q- or Q/N-rich motifs in yeast can also promote protein expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. PolyQ and polyQ/N tracts are the most common homorepeats acting as structurally flexible motifs for protein aggregation or protein–protein interactions in many eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). PolyN is not as structurally flexible as polyQ due to a stronger propensity for β-turn formation in polyN than in polyQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). In so-called polyQ-associated diseases, long Q-, Q/N- or even N-rich motifs result in an excess of interactions, resulting in dysfunctional or pathogenic protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Many prion-causing proteins contain Q/N-rich prion-forming domains (PFDs). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the best-characterized prion-causing proteins are Sup35 (or translation terminator eRF35), New1 ([<italic>NU+</italic>] prion formation protein 1), Ure2 (uridosuccinate transport 2), Rnq1 (rich in N and Q 1) and Swi1 (switching deficient 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). We found that the Q/N-rich NTDs of Sup35, Ure2 and New1 also display PEE activities, i.e., the prion nucleation domain (PND; residues 1-39) of Sup35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), the Ure2 prion domain (UPD) (residues 1-91) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), and the New1 prion domain (NPD; residue 1-146) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, Table S1). Sup35-PND containing 3S, 12Q, 18N and an S<sup>17</sup>Q motif exerts critical functions in promoting [<italic>PSI+</italic>] prion nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). The UPD of the Ure2 nitrogen catabolite repression transcriptional regulator is the basis of the prion [<italic>URE3<sup>+</sup></italic>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). The UPD is critical for Ure2’s function <italic>in vivo</italic> because its removal in the corresponding Ure2-ΔUPD mutants elicits reduced protein stability and steady-state protein levels (but not transcript levels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Ure2-UPD contains 10S, 5T, 10Q and 33N, adopting a completely disordered structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). New1 is a non-essential ATP-binding cassette type F protein that fine-tunes the efficiency of translation termination or ribosome recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). The NPD of New1 supports [<italic>NU<sup>+</sup></italic>] and is susceptible to [<italic>PSI+</italic>] prion induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). New1-NPD contains 19S, 8T, 14Q, 28N and an S<sup>145</sup>Q motif. Here, we applied the LacZ-NVH fusion protein approach to show that N-terminal fusion of Sup35-PND, Ure2-UPD or New1-NPD to LacZ-NVH all increased steady-state protein levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and β-galactosidase activities <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>The PEE function is not affected by the quaternary structures of target proteins</title>
<p>We found that N-terminal fusion of Rad53-SCD1 to four different NVH-tagged target proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) or Rad51-ΔN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) all resulted in higher protein production <italic>in vivo</italic>. LacZ is a tetrameric protein, glutathione S-transferase (GST) is dimeric, and non-dimerizing GST (GSTnd) and GFP are monomeric proteins. As reported recently (1), removal of the NTD from Rad51 reduced by ∼97% the levels of corresponding Rad51-ΔN proteins relative to wild type (WT) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), leading to lower resistance to the DNA damage agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, the autonomous PEE function of Rad51-NTD could be fully rescued in <italic>rad51-</italic>Δ<italic>N</italic> (Table S2) by N-terminal fusion of Rad53-SCD1, Rad53-SCD1-5STA (all five S/T-Q motifs changed to AQs) or Sup35-PND, respectively. Rad53-SCD1-5STA is a mutant protein defective in Mec1- and Tel1-mediated phosphorylation. Compared to wild-type yeast cells, the three corresponding yeast mutants (<italic>rad53-SCD1-rad51-</italic>Δ<italic>N</italic>, <italic>rad53-SCD1-5STA-rad51-</italic>Δ<italic>N</italic> and <italic>sup35-PND-rad51-</italic>Δ<italic>N</italic>) not only produced similar steady-state levels of Rad51-ΔN fusion proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), but they also exhibited high MMS resistance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>During homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), Rad51 polymerizes into helical filaments on DSB-associated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and then promotes homologous search and strand exchange of the ssDNA-protein filament with a second double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). We inferred that the catalytic activity of Rad51-ΔN during DSB repair is likely similar to that of wild-type Rad51 because the weak MMS-resistant phenotype of <italic>rad51</italic>-Δ<italic>N</italic> is mainly due to very low steady-state levels of Rad51-ΔN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results indicate that the quaternary structures of the target proteins (i.e., GFP, GSTnd, GST, LacZ and Rad51-ΔN) are irrelevant to the autonomous PEE activity. We assert that our use of a nuclear localization signal on the C-terminal VHN tag was unlikely to influence protein degradation kinetics or to sequester the reporter, leading to their accumulation and the appearance of enhanced expression for two reasons. First, the negative control LacZ-NV also possesses the same nuclear localization signal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 2). Second, as an endogenous fusion target, Rad51-ΔN does not harbor the NVH tag (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, lanes 3-4). Compared to wild-type Rad51, Rad51-ΔN is highly labile. In our previous study, removal of the NTD from Rad51 reduced by ∼97% the protein levels of corresponding Rad51-ΔN proteins relative to wild-type (1).</p>

<title>The protein quality control system moderately regulates autonomous PEE activities</title>
<p>The protein quality control system is a mechanism by which cells monitor proteins to ensure that they are appropriately folded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). In the current study, we compared the protein steady-state levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and β-galactosidase activities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>) of Rad51-NTD-LacZ-NVH and LacZ-NVH in WT, <italic>hsp104</italic>Δ, <italic>new1</italic>Δ, <italic>doa1</italic>Δ, <italic>doa4</italic>Δ, <italic>san1</italic>Δ and <italic>oaz1</italic>Δ yeast cell lines. The protein products encoded by each of the six genes deleted from the latter mutant lines are all functionally relevant to protein homeostasis or prion propagation. Hsp104 is a heat-shock protein with disaggregase activities that disrupts protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). New1 is a translation factor that fine-tunes ribosome recycling and the efficiency of translation termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Doa1 (also called Ufd3) is an ubiquitin- and Cdc48-binding protein with a role in ubiquitin homeostasis and/or protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). The <italic>doa1</italic>Δ mutant exhibits diminished formation of [<italic>PSI+</italic>] prion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Doa4 is a deubiquitinating enzyme required for recycling ubiquitin from proteasome-bound ubiquitinated intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). The <italic>doa4</italic>Δ mutant exhibits increased sensitivity to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). San1 is an ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets highly aggregation-prone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Oaz1 (<underline>o</underline>rnithine decarboxylase <underline>a</underline>nti<underline>z</underline>yme) stimulates ubiquitin-independent degradation of Spe1 ornithine decarboxylase by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). We found that the β-galactosidase activities of Rad51-NTD-LacZ-NVH in WT and all six of the gene-knockout strains we examined were 10- to 29-fold higher than those of LacZ-NVH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Intriguingly, the β-galactosidase activities of LacZ-NVH in the six gene-knockout mutants are all lower (30-70%) than those in WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the β-galactosidase activities of Rad51-NTD-LacZ-NVH in WT are either slightly higher or lower than those in the six null mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). These results indicate that the addition of Rad51-NTD to LacZ-NVH can abrogate the protein homeostasis defects caused by the loss of each of these six genes. For example, Rad51-NTD might compensate for the ribosome assembly and translation defects in <italic>new1</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), as well as the cycloheximide-hypersensitive phenotype displayed by <italic>doa4</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Accordingly, the β-galactosidase activities of Rad51-NTD-LacZ-NVH in the <italic>new1</italic>Δ and <italic>doa4</italic>Δ lines are higher than those in the WT, respectively. In contrast, the β-galactosidase activities of LacZ-NVH in the <italic>new1</italic>Δ and <italic>doa4</italic>Δ lines are lower, respectively, than those of WT. Finally, although the <italic>doa1</italic>Δ mutant is defective in [<italic>PSI+</italic>] prion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>), the steady-state levels of Rad51-NTD-LacZ-NVH in the <italic>doa1</italic>Δ line are also slightly higher than those in WT.</p>

<title>The N-end rule is not likely relevant to the PEE function of Q-rich motifs</title>
<p>The N-end rule links the <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residues. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the N-end rule operates as part of the ubiquitin system and comprises two pathways. First, the Arg/N-end rule pathway, involving a single N-terminal amidohydrolase Nta1, mediates deamidation of N-terminal asparagine (N) and glutamine (Q) into aspartate (D) and glutamate (E), which in turn are arginylated by a single Ate1 R-transferase, generating the Arg/N degron. N-terminal R and other primary degrons are recognized by a single N-recognin Ubr1 in concert with ubiquitin-conjugating Ubc2/Rad6. Ubr1 can also recognize several other N-terminal residues, including lysine (K), histidine (H), phenylalanine (F), tryptophan (W), leucine (L) and isoleucine (I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Second, the Ac/N-end rule pathway targets proteins containing N-terminally acetylated (Ac) residues. Prior to acetylation, the first amino acid methionine (M) is catalytically removed by Met-aminopeptidases (MetAPs), unless a residue at position 2 is non-permissive (too large) for MetAPs. If a retained N-terminal M or otherwise a valine (V), cysteine (C), alanine (A), serine (S) or threonine (T) residue is followed by residues that allow N-terminal acetylation, the proteins containing these AcN degrons are targeted for ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation by the Doa10 E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>).</p>
<p>For two reasons, the PEE activities of these Q-rich domains are unlikely to arise from counteracting the N-end rule. First, the first two amino acid residues of Rad51-NTD, Hop1-SCD, Rad53-SCD1, Sup35-PND, Rad51-ΔN, and LacZ-NVH are MS, ME, ME, MS, ME, and MI, respectively, where M is methionine, S is serine, E is glutamic acid and I is isoleucine. Second, Sml1-NTD behaves similarly to these N-terminal fusion tags, despite its methionine and glutamine (MQ) amino acid signature at the N-terminus.</p>

<title>The relationship between PEE function, amino acid contents and structural flexibility</title>
<p>We applied an alanine scanning mutagenesis approach to reduce the percentages of S, T, Q or N in Rad51-NTD, Rad53-SCD1, and Sup35-NPD, respectively. These three Q-rich motifs exhibit a very strong positive relationship between STQ and STQN amino acid percentages and β-galactosidase activities (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).

<p>It is important to note that the threshold of STQ or STQN content varies in the three cases presented herein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, the percentage of STQ or STQN residues is not likely the only factor contributing to protein expression levels. Since G, P and glutamate (E) are enriched by &gt;10% in Rad51-NTD, Rad53-SCD1 and Sup35-NPD, these three amino acids may also contribute to the PEE activities and structural flexibility of these three Q-rich motifs. Given that IDRs can endow proteins with structural and functional plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>), we hypothesized that Q-rich motifs (e.g., SCD, polyQ and polyQ/N) represent useful toolkits for creating new diversity during protein evolution.</p>

<title>Comparative proteome-wide analyses of amino acid contents, SCDs and polyX motifs</title>
<p>Next, we designed four JavaScript software programs (AS-aa-content, AS-codon-usage, AS-Finder-SCD and AS-Finder-polyX) for proteome-wide analyses (Table S4). AS-aa-content and AS-codon-usage determine the proteome-wide average contents of 20 different amino acids and the proteome-wide usage frequency of 64 genetic codons, respectively.

Among the 6050 proteins in the most recently updated <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> reference proteome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000002311">https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000002311</ext-link>), we identified 1016 SCD-hosting proteins (DS3), including all 436 SCD-harboring proteins previously revealed by ScanProsite (5). ScanProsite is a publicly available database of protein families, domains and motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>).</p>
<p>The most striking finding in our study is that, due to their usage of the two noncanonical codons (UAA<sup>Q</sup> and UAG<sup>Q</sup>), Q (but not S, T or N) is used more frequently in five unicellular ciliates (i.e., <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic>, <italic>O. trifallax</italic>, <italic>S. lemnae</italic> and <italic>P. persalinus</italic>) than in eukaryotes with standard genetic codons, including the unicellular ciliate <italic>S. coeruleus</italic> and all of the 20 non-ciliate species we examined herein (Figures S1 and DS2). Hereafter, we refer to the five unicellular ciliates with reassigned stop codons as ‘group I’ ciliates. Due to higher proteome-wide Q contents, there are higher percentages of SCD, polyQ and polyQ/N in the five group I ciliates than in <italic>S. coeruleus</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>, S2, S3, and DS2-DS4).</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed the SCD and polyX proteins encoded by the transcriptomes of 11 different ciliate species. These transcripts were originally generated as part of the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>), which were then reassembled and reannotated by Brown and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>). All transcripts are publicly available from Zendo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zenodo.org/record/1212585#.Y79zoi2l3PA">https://zenodo.org/record/1212585#.Y79zoi2l3PA</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>). We applied TransDecoder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/wiki">https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/wiki</ext-link>) to identify candidate coding regions within the transcript sequences. Five of those eleven ciliates have reassigned UAA<sup>Q</sup> and UAG<sup>Q</sup> codons (hereafter termed “group II ciliates”), i.e., <italic>Aristerostoma</italic> spp<italic>., Favella ehrenbergii, Pseudokeronopsis</italic> spp., <italic>Strombidium inclinatum,</italic> and <italic>Uronema</italic> spp.. Like sessile <italic>S. coeruleus,</italic> group III ciliates (<italic>Climacostomum virens</italic>, <italic>Litonotus pictus</italic> and <italic>Protocruzia adherens</italic>) possess the standard genetic codes. Group IV ciliates encompass <italic>Mesodinium pulex</italic>, <italic>Blepharisma japonicum</italic> and <italic>Euplotes focardii</italic>, each of which utilizes the reassigned codons UAA<sup>Y</sup>, UAG<sup>Y</sup>, UGA<sup>W</sup> and UGA<sup>C</sup>, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For two reasons, the proteins encoded by these MMESTP transcripts are unlikely to represent the entire protein complement of all 11 ciliate species. First, many MMETSP transcripts are not intact (i.e., broken mRNAs) and thus encode incomplete protein sequences. Second, except for <italic>C. virens</italic> (94.7%), the BUSCO protein scores of these MMESTP transcripts only range from 52.6% to 89.9% (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Nevertheless, our results indicate that Q is used more frequently in group I and group II ciliates than in group III and group IV ciliates or in a further 20 non-ciliate species (Figure S1 and DS2). Accordingly, proportions of SCD, polyQ and polyQ/N proteins in all group I and group II ciliates are higher than they are in the three group III ciliates (except <italic>L. pictus</italic>) and the three group IV ciliates, respectively. Since N is used more frequently in <italic>L. pictus</italic> than the other ciliates in groups II-IV, it has higher percentages of polyN and polyQ/N proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>, S2, S3, and DS2-DS4). Our data also indicates that Y, W or C are not used more frequently in the three group IV ciliates than in the other 14 ciliate or 20 non-ciliate species (Figure S1 and DS2). Reassignments of stop codons to Y, W or C also do not result in higher percentages of polyY, polyW or polyC proteins in the three group IV ciliates, respectively (Figure S3).</p>
<p>To further confirm the above-described results, we normalized the runs of amino acids and created a null expectation from each proteome by determining the ratios of the overall number of X residues for each of the seven polyX motifs relative to those in the entire proteome of each species, respectively. The results for four different polyX motifs, i.e., polyQ, polyN, polyS and polyT, are presented in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>-<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> and DS5. The results summarized in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>-<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> support that polyX prevalence differs among species and that the overall X contents of polyX motifs often but not always correlate with the X usage frequencies in entire proteomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Most importantly, our results reveal that, compared to <italic>S. coeruleus</italic> or several non-ciliate eukaryotic organisms (e.g., <italic>P. falciparum, C. elegans</italic>, <italic>D. rerio</italic>, <italic>M. musculus</italic> and <italic>H. sapiens</italic>), the five ciliates with reassigned TAA<sup>Q</sup> and TAG<sup>Q</sup> codons not only have higher Q usage frequency but also more polyQ motifs in their proteomes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and DS5). In contrast, polyQ motifs prevail in <italic>C. albicans, C. tropicalis, D. discoideum, C. reinhardtii, D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, though the Q usage frequencies in their entire proteomes are not significantly higher than those of other eukaryotes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and DS5). Due to their higher N usage frequencies, <italic>D. discoideum, P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. persalinus</italic> have more polyN motifs than the other 23 eukaryotes we examined here (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> and DS5). Generally speaking, all 26 eukaryotes we assessed have similar S usage frequencies and percentages of S contents in polyS motifs (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> and DS5). Among these 26 eukaryotes, <italic>D. discoideum</italic> possesses many more polyT motifs, though its T usage frequency is similar to that of the other 25 eukaryotes (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> and DS5). Several other polyX motifs are particularly enriched in specific eukaryotes, for example, polyK and polyY in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, polyK and polyF in <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, polyG, polyA, polyP and polyW in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, as well as the longest polyC (i.e., ≥21C and ≥50%C) in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> (DS5). Further investigations will decipher the structural and functional relevance of those polyX motif proteins. In conclusion, these normalized results further confirm that reassignment of stop codons to Q indeed results in both higher Q usage frequencies and more polyQ motifs in ciliates.</p>

<title>The frequency of TAA<sup>Q</sup> and TAG<sup>Q</sup>, CAA<sup>Q</sup> and CAG<sup>Q</sup> usage in 26 different organisms</title>
<p>PolyQ motifs have a particular length-dependent codon usage that relates to strand slippage in CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeat regions during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). In most organisms having standard genetic codons, Q is encoded by CAG<sup>Q</sup> and CAA<sup>Q</sup>.

Our results reveal that the likelihood of forming long CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats is higher in five eukaryotes due to their higher CAG<sup>Q</sup> usage frequencies, including <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (86.6% Q), <italic>D. rerio</italic> (74.0% Q), <italic>M. musculus</italic> (74.0% Q), <italic>H. sapiens</italic> (73.5% Q), and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> (87.3% Q) (orange background, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, another five eukaryotes that possess high numbers of polyQ motifs (i.e., <italic>D. discoideum, C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. tropicalis, P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>S. coeruleus</italic>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) utilize more CAA<sup>Q</sup> (96.2%, 84.6%, 84.5%, 86.7% and 75.7%) than CAG<sup>Q</sup> (3.8%, 15.4%, 15.5%, 13.3% and 24.3%), respectively, to avoid forming long CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats (green background, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Q-rich-motif proteins are overrepresented in specialized biological processes of various eukaryotic proteomes</title>
<p>To determine the biological impacts of Q-rich-motif proteins, we designed a JavaScript software tool AS-GOfuncR-FWER (Table S4) to carry out comparative Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses using information on the functions of genes provided by the GO knowledgebase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneontology.org">http://geneontology.org</ext-link>). Rigorous statistical testing for overrepresentation or underrepresentation of SCD and polyX proteins was performed using GOfuncR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GOfuncR.html">https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GOfuncR.html</ext-link>), an R package program that conducts standard candidate vs. background enrichment analysis employing the hypergeometric test.

<p>Our results are also consistent with a previous report that there is an overrepresentation of conserved Q-rich-motif proteins in pathways related to the human nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). For instance, human CTTNBP2 (1663 amino acid residues) is a neuron-specific F-actin-associated SCD protein that is involved in the formation and maintenance of dendritic spines and it is associated with autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>). Human CTTNBP2 possesses ten S/T-Q motifs (T<sup>466</sup>Q, T<sup>493</sup>Q, S<sup>1580</sup>Q, S<sup>553</sup>Q, S<sup>634</sup>Q, S<sup>994</sup>Q, S<sup>1392</sup>Q, S<sup>1580</sup>Q, T<sup>1621</sup>Q and S<sup>1624</sup>Q). Mouse CTTNBP2 has 630 amino acid residues, four S/T-Q motifs (S<sup>419</sup>Q, T<sup>463</sup>Q, S<sup>550</sup>Q, S<sup>624</sup>Q), and it shares a high amino acid identity with the N-terminus (1-640 amino acid residues) of human CTTNBP2. IUPred2A (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://iupred2a.elte.hu/plot_new">https://iupred2a.elte.hu/plot_new</ext-link>) also reveals that both human CTTNBP2 (220-1633 residues) and mouse CTTNBP2 (220-630 residues) are Q/N-rich IDRs with high percentages of S, T, Q, N, G, P, R and K. We reported recently that mouse CTTNBP2 forms self-assembled condensates through its C-terminal IDR and it facilitates co-condensation of an abundant excitatory postsynaptic scaffold protein SHANK3 at dendritic spines in a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>).</p>

<title>Q-rich-motif proteins prevail in the <italic>T. thermophila</italic> xylan catabolic process</title>

<title>Most proteins involved in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> meiosis harbor one or more Q-rich motif(s)</title>
<p>Ciliate meiosis is remarkable relative to that of other studied sexual eukaryotes. Ciliates often have two types of nuclei. Their diploid micronucleus (MIC) carries the cell germline, the genetic material of which is inherited via sexual reproduction and meiosis. The polyploid macronucleus (MAC) or vegetative nucleus provides nuclear RNA for vegetative growth. The MAC is generated from the MIC by massive amplification, editing and rearrangement of the genome (see reviews in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>)). In <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, the most intensively studied ciliate, meiotic MICs undergo extreme elongation (by ∼50-fold) and form proteinaceous condensates called “crescents”. Within these elongated crescents, telomeres and centromeres of all meiotic chromosomes are rearranged at opposing ends in a stretched bouquet-like manner. Meiotic pairing and recombination take place within the crescents (see review in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>)). It has been reported that ATR1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated 1), an evolutionarily conserved DNA damage senor protein kinase, senses Spo11-induced DSBs and triggers the elongation of MICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>). Meiosis-specific CYC2 and CYC17 cyclins, as well as cyclin-dependent kinase CDK3, are required to initiate meiosis and for crescent assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>). CYC2/CDK2 promotes bouquet formation in MICs by controlling microtubule-directed elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>) and it also controls the gene expression of proteins involved in DSB formation (SPO11), DNA repair (COM1, EXO1, DMC1), and crossover formation (HOP2, MND1, MSH4, MSH5, ZPH3, BIM1, and BIM2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>). The DPL2/E2fl1 complex, a meiosis-specific transcription factor, promotes transcriptional induction of DNA repair proteins and chromosome-associated structural proteins, including MRE11, COM1, EXO1, RAD50, RAD51, SMC1, SMC2, SMC3, SMC4, REC8, ESP1, and CNA1, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying crescent assembly and disassembly remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Among the 124 <italic>T. thermophila</italic> meiotic proteins (DS34, see review in (92)), we identified 85 SCD proteins, 54 polyQ proteins, 106 polyQ/N proteins, 32 polyN proteins, 32 polyS proteins, and 48 polyK proteins, respectively. Notably, there are 48 and 59 meiotic proteins that contain ≥4 SCDs and/or ≥4 polyQ/N tracts, respectively. For instance, DPL2, CYC2, CYC17, and ATR1 each contain 15, 6, 8 and 5 SCDs, 2, 0, 1 and 2 polyQ tracts, as well as 11, 4, 4 and 5 polyQ/N tracts, respectively. Pars11, a chromatin-associated protein required for inducing and limiting Spo11-induced DSBs, has 14 SCDs, 2 polyQ tracts and 6 polyQ/N tracts. Spo11-induced DSBs promote ATR1-dependent Pars11 phosphorylation and its removal from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>). Many <italic>T. thermophila</italic> meiotic DSB repair proteins also harbor several SCDs, polyQ tracts and/or polyQ/N tracts, including MSH4, MSH5, SGS1, FANCM, REC8, and ZPH3, among others.</p>
<p>Several <italic>T. thermophila</italic> proteins involved in editing and rearrangement of the MIC genome also harbor multiple Q-rich motifs. PDD1 (programmed DNA degradation 1), a conjugation-specific HP1-like protein, has 13 SCDs, 3 polyQ tracts and 6 polyQ/N tracts. Mutations in the chromodomain or the chromoshadow domain of PDD1 were found previously to elicit PDD1 mislocalization, prevented histone H3 dimethylation on K9, abolished removal of internal eliminated sequences (IES), and/or resulted in the production of inviable progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>). DCL1 (Dicer-like 1) has 5 SCDs, 1 polyQ tract and 8 polyQ/N tracts. DCL1 is required for processing the MIC transcripts to siRNA-like scan (scn) RNAs, as well as for methylation of histone H3 at Lys 9. This latter modification occurs specifically on sequences (IESs) to be eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>). GIW1 (gentlemen-in-waiting 1) physically directs a mature Argonaute-siRNA complex to the MIC nucleus, thus promoting programmed IES elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>). GIW1 has 9 SCDs and 2 polyQ/N tracts (DS34).</p>
<p>Using IUPred2A (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://iupred2a.elte.hu/plot_new">https://iupred2a.elte.hu/plot_new</ext-link>), we found that the Q-rich motifs in most (if not all) of these meiotic proteins are intrinsically disordered. Accordingly, we speculate that, like the C-terminal IDR of mammalian CTTNBP2, the Q-rich motifs in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> meiotic proteins might form tunable proteinaceous condensates to regulate assembly and disassembly of the “crescents” in ciliate MICs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We present three unexpected results in this report. First, the Q-rich motifs of several yeast proteins (Rad51-NTD, Rad53-SCD1, Hop1-SCD, Sml1-NTD, Sup35-PND, Ure2-UPD, and New1-NPD) all exhibit autonomous PEE activities. These structurally flexible Q-rich motifs have useful potential for applications in both basic research (e.g., synthetic biology) and biotechnology. Further investigations would prove illuminating as to how these Q-rich motifs exert this PEE function in yeast and whether Q-rich motifs in other eukaryotes also possess similar PEE activities. Second, the reassignment of stop codons to Q in the group I and group II ciliates significantly increases proteome-wide Q usage, leading to massive expansion of structurally flexible or even intrinsically disordered Q-rich motifs. In contrast, reassignments of stop codons to Y, W or C do not result in higher usages of these three amino acid residues, nor higher percentages of W-, Y- or C-rich proteins in the three group IV ciliates, respectively. These results are consistent with the notion that, unlike for Q, the Y, W and C residues are not common in IDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Third, the results in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> support that a decrease or increase of CAG<sup>Q</sup> usage frequency in different eukaryotes is responsible for a reduction or augmentation, respectively, of polyQ instability (or expansion) caused by DNA strand slippage in CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeat regions during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Accordingly, it would be interesting to decipher how the molecular mechanism(s) that controls the codon usage bias of TAA<sup>Q</sup>, TAG<sup>Q</sup>, CAA<sup>Q</sup> and CAG<sup>Q</sup> evolved.</p>
<p>Due to their structural flexibility, Q-rich motifs can endow proteins with structural and functional plasticity. Based on previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>) and our findings from this study, Q-rich motifs, such as IDRs, are useful toolkits for generating novel diversity during protein evolution, including by enabling greater protein expression, protein-protein interactions, posttranslational modifications, increased solubility, and tunable stability, among other important traits. This speculation may explain three intriguing phenomena. First, due to higher Q usage, many proteins involved in evolutionarily conserved biological processes in group I and group II ciliates display more diverse amino acid sequences than the respective proteins in other ciliate or non-ciliate species. Accordingly, it is sometimes difficult to identify authentic protein homologs among different ciliates, particularly for group I and group II ciliates. We highlight the example of the 58 proteins involved in xylan catabolysis in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> (Dataset DS33). Second, our GO enrichment results reveal that Q-rich motifs prevail in proteins involved in specialized biological processes (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref> and <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>). In theory, structurally flexible Q-rich motifs might form various membraneless organelles or proteinaceous condensates via intracellular liquid-liquid phase separation in tunable manners, including protein posttranslational modification, protein-protein interaction, protein-ligand binding, among other processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). A typical example is that the C-terminus of mouse CTTNBP2 facilitates co-condensation of CTTNBP2 with SHANK3 at the postsynaptic density in a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). Third, Borgs are long and linear extrachromosomal DNA sequences in methane-oxidizing <italic>Methanoperedens archaea</italic>, which display the potential to augment methane oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>). A striking feature of Borgs is pervasive tandem direct repeat (TR) regions. TRs in open reading frames (ORFs) are under very strong selective pressure, leading to perfect amino acid TRs (aaTRs) that are commonly IDRs. Notably, aaTRs often contain disorder-promoting amino acids, including Q, N, P, T, E, K, V, D and S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>). Accordingly, distinct evolutionary strategies are employed in different species to alter protein regions that are structurally flexible or even intrinsically disordered. Further investigations are needed to determine if liquid-liquid phase separation prevails in ciliates with reassigned TAA<sup>Q</sup> and TAG<sup>Q</sup> codons and/or in the specialized biological processes in various species we have described herein.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>One of the most interesting questions in genome diversity is why many ciliates reassign their nuclear stop codons into amino acids, e.g., glutamine (Q), tyrosine (Y), tryptophan (W) or cysteine (C). The impacts of such genome-wide alternations had not been well understood. Here, we show that glutamine (Q) is used more frequently in all 10 ciliate species possessing reassigned TAA<sup>Q</sup> and TAG<sup>Q</sup> codons than in other ciliates and non-ciliate species. The consequence of this preponderance of Q is the massive expansion of proteins harboring structurally flexible or even intrinsically disordered Q-rich motifs. Since Q-rich motifs can endow proteins with structural and functional plasticity and Q-rich-motif proteins are overrepresented in several species-specific or even phylum-specific biological processes, we suggest that Q-rich motifs are useful toolkits for evolutionary novelty.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>All plasmids, yeast strains, and PCR primers used in this study are listed in Tables S1-S3, respectively. Guinea pig antisera against Rad51, and rabbit antisera against phosphorylated Rad51-S<sup>12</sup>Q, phosphorylated Rad51-S<sup>30</sup>Q, and phosphorylated Hop1-T<sup>318</sup>Q were described previously (1, 11). The mouse anti-V5 antibody was purchased from BioRad (CA, USA). The rabbit anti-Hsp104 antiserum was kindly provided by Chung Wang (Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan). Rabbit antisera against phosphorylated Sup35-S<sup>17</sup>Q were raised using the synthetic phosphopeptide N<sup>12</sup>YQQYS<sup>(P)</sup>QNGNQQQGNNR<sup>28</sup> as an antigen, where S<sup>(P)</sup> is phosphorylated serine. Phosphopeptide synthesis and animal immunization were conducted by LTK BioLaboratories, Taiwan. Western blotting analyses were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Quantitative β-galactosidase activity assays were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>). The sources of proteome and transcript datasets are described in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This study seeks to understand the connection between protein sequence and function in disordered regions enriched in polar amino acids (specifically Q, N, S and T). While the authors suggest that specific motifs facilitate protein-enhancing activities, their findings are correlative, and the evidence is incomplete. Similarly, the authors propose that the re-assignment of stop codons to glutamine-encoding codons underlies the greater user of glutamine in a subset of ciliates, but again, the conclusions here are, at best, correlative. The authors perform extensive bioinformatic analysis, with detailed (albeit somewhat ad hoc) discussion on a number of proteins. Overall, the results presented here are interesting but are unable to exclude competing hypotheses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Following up on previous work, the authors wish to uncover a mechanism associated with poly-Q and SCD motifs explaining proposed protein expression-enhancing activities. They note that these motifs often occur IDRs and hypothesize that structural plasticity could be capitalized upon as a mechanism of diversification in evolution. To investigate this further, they employ bioinformatics to investigate the sequence features of proteomes of 27 eukaryotes. They deepen their sequence space exploration uncovering sub-phylum-specific features associated with species in which a stop-codon substitution has occurred. The authors propose this stop-codon substitution underlies an expansion of ploy-Q repeats and increased glutamine distribution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors were provided with a series of suggested changes to improve clarity, and a series of concerns raised. Some of these have been addressed but many have not. At this point, I do not see my role as telling the authors how to re-write their manuscript, but many of the concerns raised in my original review remain, and the authors have done little to allay those concerns in their revisions.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This study presents potentially valuable results on glutamine-rich motifs in relation to protein expression and alternative genetic codes. The author's interpretation of the results is so far only supported by incomplete evidence, due to a lack of acknowledgment of alternative explanations, missing controls and statistical analysis and writing unclear to non experts in the field. These shortcomings could be at least partially overcome by additional experiments, thorough rewriting, or both.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank both the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor for handling this manuscript.</p>
<p>Based on your suggestions, we have provided controls, performed statistical analysis, and rewrote our manuscript. The revised manuscript is significantly improved and more accessible to non-experts in the field.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>This work contains 3 sections. The first section describes how protein domains with SQ motifs can increase the abundance of a lacZ reporter in yeast. The authors call this phenomenon autonomous protein expression-enhancing activity, and this finding is well supported. The authors show evidence that this increase in protein abundance and enzymatic activity is not due to changes in plasmid copy number or mRNA abundance, and that this phenomenon is not affected by mutants in translational quality control. It was not completely clear whether the increased protein abundance is due to increased translation or to increased protein stability.</p>
<p>In section 2, the authors performed mutagenesis of three N-terminal domains to study how protein sequence changes protein stability and enzymatic activity of the fusions. These data are very interesting, but this section needs more interpretation. It is not clear if the effect is due to the number of S/T/Q/N amino acids or due to the number of phosphorylation sites.</p>
<p>In section 3, the authors undertake an extensive computational analysis of amino acid runs in 27 species. Many aspects of this section are fascinating to an expert reader. They identify regions with poly-X tracks. These data were not normalized correctly: I think that a null expectation for how often poly-X track occur should be built for each species based on the underlying prevalence of amino acids in that species. As a result, I believe that the claim is not well supported by the data.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>This work is about an interesting topic and contains stimulating bioinformatics analysis. The first two sections, where the authors investigate how S/T/Q/N abundance modulates protein expression level, is well supported by the data. The bioinformatics analysis of Q abundance in ciliate proteomes is fascinating. There are some ciliates that have repurposed stop codons to code for Q. The authors find that in these proteomes, Q-runs are greatly expanded. They offer interesting speculations on how this expansion might impact protein function.</p>
<p>Weakness</p>
<p>At this time, the manuscript is disorganized and difficult to read. An expert in the field, who will not be distracted by the disorganization, will find some very interesting results included. In particular, the order of the introduction does not match the rest of the paper.</p>
<p>In the first and second sections, where the authors investigate how S/T/Q/N abundance modulates protein expression levels, it is unclear if the effect is due to the number of phosphorylation sites or the number of S/T/Q/N residues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are three reasons why the number of phosphorylation sites in the Q-rich motifs is not relevant to their autonomous protein expression-enhancing (PEE) activities:</p>
<p>First, we have reported previously that phosphorylation-defective Rad51-NTD (Rad51-3SA) and wild-type Rad51-NTD exhibit similar autonomous PEE activity. Mec1/Tel1-dependent phosphorylation of Rad51-NTD antagonizes the proteasomal degradation pathway, increasing the half-life of Rad51 from ∼30 min to ≥180 min (1). (page 1, lines 11-14)</p>
<p>Second, in our preprint manuscript, we have already shown that phosphorylation-defective Rad53-SCD1 (Rad51-SCD1-5STA) also exhibits autonomous PEE activity similar to that of wild-type Rad53-SCD (Figure 2D, Figure 4A and Figure 4C). We have highlighted this point in our revised manuscript (page 9, lines 19-21).</p>
<p>Third, as revealed by the results of Figure 4, it is the percentages, and not the numbers, of S/T/Q/N residues that are correlated with the PEE activities of Q-rich motifs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors also do not discuss if the N-end rule for protein stability applies to the lacZ reporter or the fusion proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The autonomous PEE function of S/T/Q-rich NTDs is unlikely to be relevant to the N-end rule. The N-end rule links the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residues. In S. cerevisiae, the N-end rule operates as part of the ubiquitin system and comprises two pathways. First, the Arg/N-end rule pathway, involving a single N-terminal amidohydrolase Nta1, mediates deamidation of N-terminal asparagine (N) and glutamine (Q) into aspartate (D) and glutamate (E), which in turn are arginylated by a single Ate1 R-transferase, generating the Arg/N degron. N-terminal R and other primary degrons are recognized by a single N-recognin Ubr1 in concert with ubiquitin-conjugating Ubc2/Rad6. Ubr1 can also recognize several other N-terminal residues, including lysine (K), histidine (H), phenylalanine (F), tryptophan (W), leucine (L) and isoleucine (I) (68-70). Second, the Ac/N-end rule pathway targets proteins containing N-terminally acetylated (Ac) residues. Prior to acetylation, the first amino acid methionine (M) is catalytically removed by Met-aminopeptidases (MetAPs), unless a residue at position 2 is non-permissive (too large) for MetAPs. If a retained N-terminal M or otherwise a valine (V), cysteine (C), alanine (A), serine (S) or threonine (T) residue is followed by residues that allow N-terminal acetylation, the proteins containing these AcN degrons are targeted for ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation by the Doa10 E3 ligase (71).</p>
<p>The PEE activities of these S/T/Q-rich domains are unlikely to arise from counteracting the N-end rule for two reasons. First, the first two amino acid residues of Rad51-NTD, Hop1-SCD, Rad53-SCD1, Sup35-PND, Rad51-ΔN, and LacZ-NVH are MS, ME, ME, MS, ME, and MI, respectively, where M is methionine, S is serine, E is glutamic acid and I is isoleucine. Second, Sml1-NTD behaves similarly to these N-terminal fusion tags, despite its methionine and glutamine (MQ) amino acid signature at the N-terminus. (Page 12, line 3 to page 13, line 2)</p>

<p>The most interesting part of the paper is an exploration of S/T/Q/N-rich regions and other repetitive AA runs in 27 proteomes, particularly ciliates. However, this analysis is missing a critical control that makes it nearly impossible to evaluate the importance of the findings. The authors find the abundance of different amino acid runs in various proteomes. They also report the background abundance of each amino acid. They do not use this background abundance to normalize the runs of amino acids to create a null expectation from each proteome. For example, it has been clear for some time (Ruff, 2017; Ruff et al., 2016) that Drosophila contains a very high background of Q's in the proteome and it is necessary to control for this background abundance when finding runs of Q's.</p>

<p>We thank Reviewer #1 for this helpful suggestion and now address this issue by means of a different approach described below.</p>
<p>Based on a previous study (43), we applied seven different thresholds to seek both short and long, as well as pure and impure, polyX strings in 20 different representative near-complete proteomes, including 4X (4/4), 5X (4/5-5/5), 6X (4/6-6/6), 7X (4/7-7/7), 8-10X (≥50%X), 11-10X (≥50%X) and ≥21X (≥50%X).</p>
<p>To normalize the runs of amino acids and create a null expectation from each proteome, we determined the ratios of the overall number of X residues for each of the seven polyX motifs relative to those in the entire proteome of each species, respectively. The results of four different polyX motifs are shown in our revised manuscript, i.e., polyQ (Figure 7), polyN (Figure 8), polyS (Figure 9) and polyT (Figure 10). Thus, polyX prevalence differs among species and the overall X contents of polyX motifs often but not always correlate with the X usage frequency in entire proteomes (43).</p>
<p>Most importantly, our results reveal that, compared to Stentor coeruleus or several non-ciliate eukaryotic organisms (e.g., Plasmodium falciparum, Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens), the five ciliates with reassigned TAAQ and TAGQ codons not only have higher Q usage frequencies, but also more polyQ motifs in their proteomes (Figure 7). In contrast, polyQ motifs prevail in Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Dictyostelium discoideum, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti, though the Q usage frequencies in their entire proteomes are not significantly higher than those of other eukaryotes (Figure 1). Due to their higher N usage frequencies, Dictyostelium discoideum, Plasmodium falciparum and Pseudocohnilembus persalinus have more polyN motifs than the other 23 eukaryotes we examined here (Figure 8). Generally speaking, all 26 eukaryotes we assessed have similar S usage frequencies and percentages of S contents in polyS motifs (Figure 9). Among these 26 eukaryotes, Dictyostelium discoideum possesses many more polyT motifs, though its T usage frequency is similar to that of the other 25 eukaryotes (Figure 10).</p>
<p>In conclusion, these new normalized results confirm that the reassignment of stop codons to Q indeed results in both higher Q usage frequencies and more polyQ motifs in ciliates.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study seeks to understand the connection between protein sequence and function in disordered regions enriched in polar amino acids (specifically Q, N, S and T). While the authors suggest that specific motifs facilitate protein-enhancing activities, their findings are correlative, and the evidence is incomplete. Similarly, the authors propose that the re-assignment of stop codons to glutamine-encoding codons underlies the greater user of glutamine in a subset of ciliates, but again, the conclusions here are, at best, correlative. The authors perform extensive bioinformatic analysis, with detailed (albeit somewhat ad hoc) discussion on a number of proteins. Overall, the results presented here are interesting, but are unable to exclude competing hypotheses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Following up on previous work, the authors wish to uncover a mechanism associated with poly-Q and SCD motifs explaining proposed protein expression-enhancing activities. They note that these motifs often occur IDRs and hypothesize that structural plasticity could be capitalized upon as a mechanism of diversification in evolution. To investigate this further, they employ bioinformatics to investigate the sequence features of proteomes of 27 eukaryotes. They deepen their sequence space exploration uncovering sub-phylum-specific features associated with species in which a stop-codon substitution has occurred. The authors propose this stop-codon substitution underlies an expansion of ploy-Q repeats and increased glutamine distribution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The preprint provides extensive, detailed, and entirely unnecessary background information throughout, hampering reading and making it difficult to understand the ideas being proposed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The introduction provides a large amount of detailed background that appears entirely irrelevant for the paper. Many places detailed discussions on specific proteins that are likely of interest to the authors occur, yet without context, this does not enhance the paper for the reader.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The paper uses many unnecessary, new, or redefined acronyms which makes reading difficult. As examples:</p>
<p>1. Prion forming domains (PFDs). Do the authors mean prion-like domains (PLDs), an established term with an empirical definition from the PLAAC algorithm? If yes, they should say this. If not, they must define what a prion-forming domain is formally.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The N-terminal domain (1-123 amino acids) of S. cerevisiae Sup35 was already referred to as a “prion forming domain (PFD)” in 2006 (48). Since then, PFD has also been employed as an acronym in other yeast prion papers (Cox, B.S. et al. 2007; Toombs, T. et al. 2011).</p>

<p>1. SCD is already an acronym in the IDP field (meaning sequence charge decoration) - the authors should avoid this as their chosen acronym for Serine(S) / threonine (T)-glutamine (Q) cluster domains. Moreover, do we really need another acronym here (we do not).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>SCD was first used in 2005 as an acronym for the Serine (S)/threonine (T)-glutamine (Q) cluster domain in the DNA damage checkpoint field (4). Almost a decade later, SCD became an acronym for “sequence charge decoration” (Sawle, L. et al. 2015; Firman, T. et al. 2018).</p>

<p>1. Protein expression-enhancing (PEE) - just say expression-enhancing, there is no need for an acronym here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. Since we have shown that the addition of Q-rich motifs to LacZ affects protein expression rather than transcription, we think it is better to use the “PEE” acronym.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The results suggest autonomous protein expression-enhancing activities of regions of multiple proteins containing Q-rich and SCD motifs. Their definition of expression-enhancing activities is vague and the evidence they provide to support the claim is weak. While their previous work may support their claim with more evidence, it should be explained in more detail. The assay they choose is a fusion reporter measuring beta-galactosidase activity and tracking expression levels. Given the presented data they have shown that they can drive the expression of their reporters and that beta gal remains active, in addition to the increase in expression of fusion reporter during the stress response. They have not detailed what their control and mock treatment is, which makes complete understanding of their experimental approach difficult. Furthermore, their nuclear localization signal on the tag could be influencing the degradation kinetics or sequestering the reporter, leading to its accumulation and the appearance of enhanced expression. Their evidence refuting ubiquitin-mediated degradation does not have a convincing control.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although this reviewer’s concern regarding our use of a nuclear localization signal on the tag is understandable, we are confident that this signal does not bias our findings for two reasons. First, the negative control LacZ-NV also possesses the same nuclear localization signal (Figure 1A, lane 2). Second, another fusion target, Rad51-ΔN, does not harbor the NVH tag (Figure 1D, lanes 3-4). Compared to wild-type Rad51, Rad51-ΔN is highly labile. In our previous study, removal of the NTD from Rad51 reduced by ~97% the protein levels of corresponding Rad51-ΔN proteins relative to wild-type (1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Based on the experimental results, the authors then go on to perform bioinformatic analysis of SCD proteins and polyX proteins. Unfortunately, there is no clear hypothesis for what is being tested; there is a vague sense of investigating polyX/SCD regions, but I did not find the connection between the first and section compelling (especially given polar-rich regions have been shown to engage in many different functions). As such, this bioinformatic analysis largely presents as many lists of percentages without any meaningful interpretation. The bioinformatics analysis lacks any kind of rigorous statistical tests, making it difficult to evaluate the conclusions drawn. The methods section is severely lacking. Specifically, many of the methods require the reader to read many other papers. While referencing prior work is of course, important, the authors should ensure the methods in this paper provide the details needed to allow a reader to evaluate the work being presented. As it stands, this is not the case.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. As described in detail below, we have now performed rigorous statistical testing using the GofuncR package (Figure 11, Figure 12 and DS7-DS32).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, my major concern with this work is that the authors make two central claims in this paper (as per the Discussion). The authors claim that Q-rich motifs enhance protein expression. The implication here is that Q-rich motif IDRs are special, but this is not tested. As such, they cannot exclude the competing hypothesis (&quot;N-terminal disordered regions enhance expression&quot;).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In fact, “N-terminal disordered regions enhance expression” exactly summarizes our hypothesis.</p>
<p>On pages 12-13 and Figure 4 of our preprint manuscript, we explained our hypothesis in the paragraph entitled “The relationship between PEE function, amino acid contents, and structural flexibility”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors also do not explore the possibility that this effect is in part/entirely driven by mRNA-level effects (see Verma Na Comms 2019).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As pointed out by the first reviewer, we present evidence that the increase in protein abundance and enzymatic activity is not due to changes in plasmid copy number or mRNA abundance (Figure 2), and that this phenomenon is not affected in translational quality control mutants (Figure 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As such, while these observations are interesting, they feel preliminary and, in my opinion, cannot be used to draw hard conclusions on how N-terminal IDR sequence features influence protein expression. This does not mean the authors are necessarily wrong, but from the data presented here, I do not believe strong conclusions can be drawn. That re-assignment of stop codons to Q increases proteome-wide Q usage. I was unable to understand what result led the authors to this conclusion.</p>
<p>My reading of the results is that a subset of ciliates has re-assigned UAA and UAG from the stop codon to Q. Those ciliates have more polyQ-containing proteins. However, they also have more polyN-containing proteins and proteins enriched in S/T-Q clusters. Surely if this were a stop-codon-dependent effect, we'd ONLY see an enhancement in Q-richness, not a corresponding enhancement in all polar-rich IDR frequencies? It seems the better working hypothesis is that free-floating climate proteomes are enriched in polar amino acids compared to sessile ciliates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this reviewer for raising this point, however her/his comments are not supported by the results in Figure 7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Regardless, the absence of any kind of statistical analysis makes it hard to draw strong conclusions here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for not explaining more clearly the results of Tables 5-7 in our preprint manuscript.</p>
<p>To address the concerns about our GO enrichment analysis by both reviewers, we have now performed rigorous statistical testing for SCD and polyQ protein overrepresentation using the GOfuncR package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GOfuncR.html">https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GOfuncR.html</ext-link>). GOfuncR is an R package program that conducts standard candidate vs. background enrichment analysis by means of the hypergeometric test. We then adjusted the raw p-values according to the Family-wise error rate (FWER). The same method had been applied to GO enrichment analysis of human genomes (89).</p>
<p>The results presented in Figure 11 and Figure 12 (DS7-DS32) support our hypothesis that Q-rich motifs prevail in proteins involved in specialized biological processes, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA-mediated transposition, Candida albicans filamentous growth, peptidyl-glutamic acid modification in ciliates with reassigned stop codons (TAAQ and TAGQ), Tetrahymena thermophila xylan catabolism, Dictyostelium discoideum sexual reproduction, Plasmodium falciparum infection, as well as the nervous systems of Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens (78). In contrast, peptidyl-glutamic acid modification and microtubule-based movement are not overrepresented with Q-rich proteins in Stentor coeruleus, a ciliate with standard stop codons.</p>

<p>The order of paragraphs in the introduction was very difficult to follow. Each paragraph was clear and easy to understand, but the order of paragraphs did not make sense to this reader. The order of events in the abstract matches the order of events in the results section. However, the order of paragraphs in the introduction is completely different and this was very confusing. This disordered list of facts might make sense to an expert reader but makes it hard for a non-expert reader to understand.</p>

<p>The section beginning on pg 12 focused on figures 4 and 5 was very interesting and highly promising. However, it was initially hard for me to tell from the main text what the experiment was. Please add to the text an explanation of the experiment, because it is hard to figure out what was going on from the figures alone. Figure 4 is fantastic, but would be improved by adding error bars and scaling the x-axis to be the same in panels B,C,D.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this recommendation. We have now scaled both the x-axis and y-axis equivalently in panels B, C and D of Figure 4.  Error bars are too small to be included.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is hard to tell if the key variable is the number of S/T/Q/N residues or the number of phosphosites. I think a good control would be to add a regression against the number of putative phosphosites. The sequences are well designed. I loved this part but as a reader, I need more interpretation about why it matters and how it explains the PEE.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described above, we have shown that the number of phosphorylation sites in the Q-rich motifs is not relevant to their autonomous protein expression-enhancing (PEE) activities.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I believe that the prevalence of polyX runs is not meaningful without normalizing for the background abundance of each amino acid. The proteome-wide abundance and the assumption that amino acids occur independently can be used to form a baseline expectation for which runs are longer than expected by chance. I think Figures 6 and 7 should go into the supplement and be replaced in the main text with a figure where Figure 6 is normalized by Figure 7. For example in P. falciparum, there are many N-runs (Figure 6), but the proteome has the highest fraction of N’s (Figure 7).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these suggestions. The three figures in our preprint manuscript (Figures 6-8) have been moved into the supplementary information (Figures S1-S3). For normalization, we have provided four new figures (Figures 7-10) in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The analysis of ciliate proteomes was fascinating. I am particularly interested in the GO enrichment for “peptidyl-glutamic acid modification” (pg 20) because these enzymes might be modifying some of Q’s in the Q-runs. I might be wrong about this idea or confused about the chemistry. Do these ciliates live in Q-rich environments? Or nitrogen rich environments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Polymeric modifications (polymodifications) are a hallmark of C-terminal tubulin tails, whereas secondary peptide chains of glutamic acids (polyglutamylation) and glycines (polyglycylation) are catalyzed from the γ-carboxyl group of primary chain glutamic acids. It is not clear if these enzymes can modify some of the Q’s in the Q-runs.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, ciliates are abundant in almost every liquid water environment, i.e., oceans/seas, marine sediments, lakes, ponds, and rivers, and even soils.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I think you should include more discussion about how the codons that code for Q’s are prone to slippage during DNA replication, and thus many Q-runs are unstable and expand (e.g. Huntington’s Disease). The end of pg 24 or pg 25 would be good places.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these comments.</p>
<p>PolyQ motifs have a particular length-dependent codon usage that relates to strand slippage in CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeat regions during DNA replication. In most organisms having standard genetic codons, Q is encoded by CAGQ and CAAQ.  Here, we have determined and compared proteome-wide Q contents, as well as the CAGQ usage frequencies (i.e., the ratio between CAGQ and the sum of CAGQ, CAGQ, TAAQ, and TAGQ).</p>
<p>Our results reveal that the likelihood of forming long CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats are higher in five eukaryotes due to their higher CAGQ usage frequencies, including Drosophila melanogaster (86.6% Q), Danio rerio (74.0% Q), Mus musculus (74.0% Q), Homo sapiens (73.5% Q), and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (87.3% Q) (orange background, Table 2). In contrast, another five eukaryotes that possess high numbers of polyQ motifs (i.e., Dictyostelium discoideum, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Plasmodium falciparum and Stentor coeruleus) (Figure 1) utilize more CAAQ (96.2%, 84.6%, 84.5%, 86.7% and 75.7%) than CAAQ (3.8%, 15.4%, 15.5%, 13.3% and 24.3%), respectively, to avoid the formation of long CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats (green background, Table 2). Similarly, all five ciliates with reassigned stop codons (TAAQ and TAGQ) have low CAGQ usage frequencies (i.e., from 3.8% Q in Pseudocohnilembus persalinus to 12.6% Q in Oxytricha trifallax) (red font, Table 2). Accordingly, the CAG-slippage mechanism might operate more frequently in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens than in Dictyostelium discoideum, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Plasmodium falciparum, Stentor coeruleus and the five ciliates with reassigned stop codons (TAAQ and TAGQ).</p>

(1), Rad53-SCD1 (1-29 a.a.) and Sup35-NPD (1-39 a.a.) are highly structurally flexible. Since a high content of serine (S), threonine (T), glutamine (Q), asparanine (N) is a common feature of IDRs (17-20), we applied alanine scanning mutagenesis approach to reduce the percentages of S, T, Q or N in Rad51-NTD, Rad53-SCD1 or Sup35-NPD, respectively.
