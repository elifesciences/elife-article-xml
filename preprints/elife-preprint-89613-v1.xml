<title>Abstract</title><p>Although preclinical and clinical studies have shown that exercise can inhibit bone metastasis progression, the mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we found that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells adjacent to bone tissue had a much lower proliferative capacity than the surrounding tumor cells. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that osteocytes, sensing mechanical stimulation generated by exercise, inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation and sustain the dormancy thereof by releasing small extracellular vesicles with tumor suppressor micro RNAs, such as miR-99b-3p. Furthermore, mechanical loading of the tibia inhibited the bone metastasis progression of NSCLC. Notably, bone metastasis progression of NSCLC was inhibited by moderate exercise, and combinations with zoledronic acid had additive effects. Moreover, exercise preconditioning effectively suppressed bone metastasis progression. This study significantly advances the understanding of the mechanism underlying exercise-afforded protection against bone metastasis progression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lung cancer is the second most common cancer type and the leading global cause of cancer mortality (18.0% of the total cancer deaths) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Approximately 85% of lung cancer patients have a group of histological subtypes collectively termed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Despite important advancements in NSCLC treatment that have been achieved over the past two decades, prognosis remains poor owing to the presence of locally advanced or widely metastatic tumors in most patients at the time of diagnosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Approximately 20% – 30% of patients with NSCLC present with bone metastases at diagnosis, and 35%–60% will develop them during their disease course <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Bone metastases are frequent events associated with advanced-stage malignancies and often cause skeletal-related events (SREs) such as severe bone pain, pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia, which reduce the quality of life and predict a poor prognosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In general, bone metastases are incurable; goals of management include maximizing symptom control, preserving function, minimizing SREs, and enhancing local tumor control <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. A multi-disciplinary treatment approach is required, including pain management, osteoclast inhibitors and other bone-specific therapy, systemic anti-cancer therapy, surgery, radiation, and interventional techniques. Although there have been many advances in treatment, the median survival from diagnosis of bone metastases has been reported to be very short in patients with lung cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is of considerable clinical significance to elucidate the mechanism of bone metastasis and to find new drugs and combination therapies for bone metastasis prevention and treatment in NSCLC.</p>
<p>Many preclinical and clinical studies have shown that exercise can reduce the incidence of various cancers, inhibit cancer progression, reduce symptom burden, mitigate side effects of cancer treatment, and improve survival and the quality of life in patients with cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In contrast, sedentary behavior and lack of physical activity is positively associated with an increased risk for cancer and mortality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Exercise is safe perioperatively, and multiple international organizations have published exercise recommendations for patients with cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The evidence to-date suggests a benefit of exercise in all stages of lung cancer and lung cancer survivors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Exercise has the potential to improve physical function and the quality of life in individuals with bone metastases and appears safe and feasible when it includes an element of supervised exercise instruction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The optimal exercise prescription for patients with bone metastases is currently undefined <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Each patient with cancer may require a more personalized exercise prescription. Therefore, a clearer understanding of the mechanisms by which exercise modulates tumors is required.</p>
<p>Exercise induces systemic changes involving every system over the entire body, including circulating substances, the immune system, and metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Throughout life, the skeleton undergoes continuous remodeling, which is a balance between the resorption of mineralized bone by bone-resorbing cells (osteoclasts) and new bone formation by bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Osteocytes, the most abundant cell type in bone, are terminally differentiated osteoblasts that have become buried in their own matrix. During this process, their morphology changes to stellate, facilitating the formation of an extensive interconnected network throughout the bone matrix termed the lacunar-canalicular network (LCN) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Through the LCN, osteocytes sense mechanical stimulus and translate them into biochemical signals, and appropriately control bone homeostasis by regulating the function of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Therefore, the osteocyte is now recognized as a major orchestrator of the bone remodeling process. However, the understanding of the relationship between osteocytes and bone metastasis remains limited.</p>
<p>Bone metastasis is a multistage process. Long before the development of clinically detectable metastases, circulating tumor cells settle and enter a dormant state in normal vascular and endosteal niches present in the bone marrow, which provide immediate attachment and shelter, and the cells only become active years later as they proliferate and alter the functions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, promoting skeletal destruction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The endosteal niche, including osteoblasts and osteoclasts, has been reported to provide tumor cells with an environment supporting their survival and outgrowth, however, the role of osteocytes has been rarely addressed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Tumor cell dormancy is defined as an arrest in the cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The details of niches and signals that support tumor cell dormancy in bone metastasis are largely unknown. In the current study, we discuss the effect of exercise on bone metastasis of NSCLC, and investigated the potential effects and mechanisms of the osteocyte on the dormancy of bone metastasis NSCLC cells.</p>

<title>Osteocytes inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation</title>
<p>To study the spatial distribution of NSCLC cell proliferation in bone metastasis, bone metastasis tissues of six NSCLC patients were obtained. Bone destruction was found in the presence of bone metastasis in NSCLC (Supplemental Figure 1a). Surprisingly, immunohistochemical staining showed that Ki-67 was much lower in tumor cells adjacent to bone tissue than in the surrounding tumor cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). An intraosseous model was used to investigate the biological progression of NSCLC cells in a bone microenvironment via direct tibial implantation of A549 in nude mice. The results of biophotonic imaging, micro-CT, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining indicated that the model was successfully established 21 days after modeling (Supplemental Figure 1, b– d). Consistent with the result in the clinical samples, Ki-67 expression was much lower in tumor cells adjacent to bone tissue than in the surrounding tumor cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). The above results indicated that NSCLC cells adjacent to bone tissue have a much lower proliferative capacity than the surrounding tumor cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that bone tissues release some substance that inhibits tumor growth.</p>

<p>To determine which type of cell inhibits proliferation after NSCLC cells have invaded bone tissue, A549 was co-cultured with MLO-Y4 and MC3T3-E1 for 48 h, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). We found that the A549 migration ability was improved after co-culture with MLO-Y4, with the promotional effect being much significantly stronger on co-culture with MC3T3-E1 (Supplemental Figure 1e). More importantly, NSCLC cell proliferation was inhibited after co-culture with MLO-Y4, whereas no inhibitory effect was found after co-culture with MC3T3-E1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d, e</xref> and Supplemental Figure 1f), indicating that it is osteocytes that inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation. Surprisingly, MC3T3-E1 proliferation was effectively enhanced on co-culture with MLO-Y4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>), which indicated that the effect of osteocytes on NSCLC cell and osteoblast proliferation were different. Taken together, these data suggested that it is osteocytes that inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation in the endosteal niche.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Osteocyte small extracellular vesicles inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism by which osteocytes inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation, osteocyte-conditioned medium (CM) was separated into soluble factor (SF), large extracellular vesicles (lEVs), and small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) fractions by serial ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration as performed previously with some modifications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). The purified sEVs were verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), NanoSight analysis, and immunoblotting for protein markers (CD9, Alix, and TSG101), according to the proposal of the International Society of Extracellular Vesicles (Supplemental Figure 2a– c). sEVs were labeled with PKH67 and were observed to be internalized by NSCLC cells (Supplemental Figure 2d). Subsequently, we treated the NSCLC cells with fractions derived from osteocyte CM, with EV-depleted media as a negative control (fetal bovine serum [FBS] 10%). Interestingly, sEVs from osteocyte CM had a much significantly greater potential to inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation than the other groups (Supplemental Figure 2e, f), whereas sEVs from osteoblast CM had no inhibitory effect on NSCLC cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 b, c</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To confirm the role of sEVs in osteocyte inhibition of NSCLC cell proliferation, GW4869 was used to inhibit sEVs secretion. The significant reduction of sEVs released from MLO-Y4 on GW4869 treatment was confirmed by NanoSight Analysis and western blotting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d, e</xref>). More importantly, it was found that GW4869 effectively eliminated the inhibitory effect of MLO-Y4 on NSCLC cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f, g</xref>), which suggested that sEVs release was required for osteocytes to inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation. Taken together, osteocytes inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation by releasing sEVs.</p>

<title>Osteocyte sEV miR-99b-3p inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation by directly targeting murine double minute2 (MDM2)</title>
<p>Subsequently, we performed micro-RNA (miRNA) sequencing to investigate how osteocyte-derived sEVs inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation. The miRNAs, which can be abundantly encapsulated in sEVs, are key regulators of cancer cell proliferation. To identify the specific miRNAs involved, we compared the miRNA profiles of MLO-Y4-sEVs and MC3T3-E1-sEVs, the results of which are shown as heatmaps (Supplemental Figure 3a). Four of the maximally upregulated miRNAs and two of the downregulated miRNAs were validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure. 3a</xref>).</p>

<p>These four upregulated miRNA sequences are identically conserved in the human and mouse. To determine the effects of these miRNAs on NSCLC cell proliferation, A549 and NCI-H23 cells were transfected with miRNA mimics or negative controls. We found that both miR-99b-3p and miR-193a-5p significantly inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation 48 h after transfection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), with miR-99b-3p having the most significant inhibitory effect. Inhibitors of miR-99b-3p, by contrast, promoted NSCLC cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c, d</xref>). These data indicated that sEVs released by osteocytes carried tumor suppressor miRNAs, such as miR-99b-3p.</p>
<p>Notably, in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated high miR-99b-3p expression in the cortical bone of patients with bone metastases of NSCLC (Supplemental Figure 3b). To identify the targets of miR-99b-3p, first, we applied PicTar and TargetScan to search for putative targets, and &gt; 100 mRNAs were predicted to be regulated by miR-99b-3p. Among these candidates, six genes are involved in cell cycle or proliferation regulation. To determine whether miR-99b-3p targets these genes directly, we cloned the 3’UTRs of the putative target into a dual luciferase assay system. MDM2, as a negative regulator of p53, has been shown to exert oncogenic activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. A reporter assay using A549 cells revealed that miR-99b-3p significantly repressed MDM2 3’UTRs. Mutations of the putative miRNA sites in MDM2 3’UTRs abrogated the responsiveness to miRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). Furthermore, transfection of miR-99b-3p mimicked reduced endogenous MDM2 protein levels in A549 cells. By contrast, inhibition of miR-99b-3p significantly increased the MDM2 protein level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggested that miR-99b-3p derived from osteocyte sEVs directly down-regulates MDM2 expression through its 3’UTR, by which osteocytes inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation.</p>

<title>Mechanical stimulation increased osteocyte sEV release and enhanced the inhibitory effect of osteocytes on NSCLC cell proliferation</title>
<p>Osteocytes are thought to be the principal mechanosensors of bone by translating mechanical stimuli into molecular signals and appropriately controlling the downstream remodeling balance. Exercise has the potential to improve physical function and the quality of life in individuals with bone metastases. To determine whether osteocytes inhibit tumor proliferation by receiving mechanical stimulation, MLO-Y4 cells were subjected to sinusoidal stretching at 12% strain at a 1.25 Hz frequency for 12 h, and sEVs were extracted from the CM. Interestingly, sEVs released from mechanically-stimulated MLO-Y4 cells significantly inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation compared to static osteocyte sEVs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a, b</xref>). Notably, the concentration of sEVs of mechanically-stimulated osteocytes was much significantly higher than that of static osteocyte sEVs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c, d</xref>). Moreover, the miR-99b-3p content of osteocyte sEVs increased significantly after stretching (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>).</p>

<p>To identify the effect of mechanical stimulation on bone metastasis of lung cancer in vivo, mechanical loading (1 N at 2 Hz for 10 min per day, 5 days per week for four weeks) was applied to the tibiae with bone metastasis induced by direct tibial implantation of GFP-LLC in mice. The biophotonic imaging showed that tumor growth was inhibited by mechanical loading (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref>). Consistent with this, Ki-67 expression in NSCLC cells in the mechanical loading group was much lower than that of the control group, which indicated that mechanical loading could effectively inhibit tumor growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4g</xref>).

<title>Moderate exercise combined with zoledronic acid effectively suppressed bone metastasis progression of NSCLC</title>
<p>Exercise is one of the ways in which the body senses mechanical stress, so we evaluated the effect of exercise in a mouse bone metastasis model. An intraosseous mouse model was used to investigate the biological progression of NSCLC cells in a bone microenvironment by direct tibial implantation of murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). These mice were subsequently randomized into tumor-bearing only (control), zoledronic acid (ZA), treadmill running, and treadmill running combined with ZA (treadmill running+ZA) groups. Moderate exercise was provided by treadmill running for mice, which were involuntarily placed on a 12-lane rodent treadmill for 30 min per day at a speed of 15cm/s for at least 5 days per week, and were euthanized after 4 weeks. Biophotonic imaging showed that tumor progression in the three treated groups was significantly slower than that in the control group, among which, the treadmill running+ZA group suppressed the growth of tumors in the tibia most effectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). Tumor growth inhibition by the ZA and treadmill running groups was similar, with no statistical difference. Ki-67 protein has been widely used as a proliferation marker for tumor cells. In this study, immunofluorescence assessment results of Ki-67 were largely consistent with those of biophotonic imaging (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). The Ki-67 expression level was the lowest in the treadmill running+ZA group lung cancer cells in the tibia, which confirmed that in the treadmill running+ZA group, tumor growth in the tibia was suppressed most effectively. Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), specifically expressed in osteocytes, was used as a specific molecular marker of osteocytes in this study. The micro-computed tomography (microCT) analysis showed that treadmill running and/or ZA protected bone integrity and delayed bone destruction in the presence of bone metastasis in NSCLC, among which, the treadmill running+ZA group displayed the strongest effect, specifically reflected in the bone volume / total volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c–e</xref>). The protective effect of bone integrity in the ZA and treadmill running groups was similar, with no statistical difference.

<title>Exercise preconditioning effectively suppressed bone metastasis progression of NSCLC</title>
<p>Physical exercise offers therapeutic potentials for bone metastasis. However, it remains mostly unknown whether and how exercise preconditioning affects bone metastasis progression. In this study, we examined the effects of preconditioning on bone metastasis progression in mature adult mice using treadmill running. Male, 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 4 weeks of treadmill exercise followed by tibial implantation of NSCLC cells. Mice were randomized into tumor-bearing only (control), treadmill running before and after tibial implantation of NSCLC cells (exercise preconditioning), and treadmill running after tibial implantation of NSCLC cells (treadmill running) groups. The biophotonic imaging showed that tumor growth in the two exercise groups was significantly slower than that in the control group, with the exercise preconditioning group suppressing the tumor growth more significantly effectively than treadmill running only after tibial implantation of NSCLC cells, which were consistent in C57BL/6J and nude mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>). Regarding the proliferation marker, the Ki-67 immunofluorescence assessment results were largely consistent with those of the biophotonic imaging (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>). The Ki-67 expression level in NSCLC cells in the exercise preconditioning group was much significantly lower than that in the other groups, which indicated that exercise preconditioning could effectively inhibit tumor growth.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although many preclinical and clinical studies have shown that exercise can inhibit bone metastasis progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, the mechanism remains poorly understood. Clarifying the mechanism of action is essential to determine optimal exercise programs, design appropriate combination therapy with standard therapy regimens, or identify specific targets for new treatment. In this study, we found that NSCLC cells adjacent to bone tissue had a much lower proliferative capacity than the surrounding tumor cells, thus we hypothesized that bone tissues release some substance that inhibits tumor growth and sustains tumor dormancy in bone metastasis. Next, we demonstrated that osteocytes inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation by releasing sEVs containing tumor suppressor miRNAs, such as miR-99b-3p. Meanwhile, both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that mechanical loading stimulated osteocytes to release more sEVs and miR-99b-3p to delay the progression of bone metastasis of NSCLC. In addition, we showed that bone metastasis progression of NSCLC was inhibited by moderate exercise, and combinations with ZA had additive effects. Furthermore, exercise preconditioning effectively suppressed bone metastasis progression of NSCLC. Taken together, our work elucidated a mechanism for the clinical observation that bone metastasis was inhibited by moderate exercise.</p>
<p>In bone metastasis, only a limited number of disseminated tumor cells survive following bone colonization, and these are retained in a dormant state for prolonged periods through engagement in specialized endosteal niches before becoming reactivated to form overt metastases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Currently, molecular mechanisms for tumor cell dormancy in the endosteal niche remain poorly understood, representing both a challenge and an opportunity for therapeutic targeting <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Bone metastases occur from a complex interplay between cancer cells and bone cells. Interestingly, here we found that NSCLC cells adjacent to bone tissue have a much lower proliferative capacity than the surrounding tumor cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that bone tissues release some substance that inhibits tumor growth and sustains NSCLC cell dormancy in bone metastasis.</p>
<p>Osteoclast and osteoblast functions in bone metastases have been well characterized; however, the role of osteocytes needs to be elucidated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Osteocytes act as mechanosensors to control responses to mechanical loading of the skeleton. For bone metastases, osteocytes may play a pivotal role in the interaction between mechanical loading and SREs. Here we demonstrated that it is osteocytes that inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation in the endosteal niche, but not osteoblasts. Furthermore, we demonstrated that osteocytes inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation by releasing sEVs containing tumor suppressor miRNAs, such as miR-99b-3p. Recent studies showed that miR-99b-3p functions as a potential tumor suppressor in oral squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We found that osteocyte sEV miR-99b-3p inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation by directly targeting MDM2. As a negative regulator of the p53, the most extensively studied human tumor suppressor, MDM2 has been shown to exert oncogenic activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. To date, three regions of interaction between MDM2 and p53 have been identified, by which MDM2 inhibits the binding of p53 to the transcriptional machinery. MDM2 is significantly highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared with adjacent tissues, and is regarded as a proto-oncogene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Our findings identified MDM2 as a direct target of miR-99b-3p, emphasizing the crucial role of miRNA in bone metastases. Interestingly, the miR-99b-3p content in osteocyte sEVs increased dramatically after mechanical loading, suggesting that miR-99b-3p may play a role in the inhibition of bone metastases by exercise.</p>
<p>SREs resulting from bone metastasis are a major clinical problem that significantly harm patient outcomes, and are commonly considered an incurable consequence of terminal malignancies. Bone metastases from lung cancer represent the majority of cases, followed by prostate cancer and breast cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. A recent animal study showed that in vivo exercise was protective against metastatic bone loss and inhibited breast cancer progression in bone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. However, there was no report about the effect of exercise on bone metastasis of lung cancer until recently. In the present study, we showed that bone metastasis progression in lung cancer was inhibited by exercise. More interestingly, exercise preconditioning effectively suppressed bone metastasis progression of NSCLC, suggesting that maintaining exercise habits affords protection against bone metastasis. Bisphosphonates are the standard of care in patients with bone metastases. Our study demonstrated that moderate exercise and ZA have additive effects.</p>
<p>Exercise is quite complex because it involves multiple organs of the body. The bone can sense the mechanical stress stimulus in the process of exercise. Using in vivo models, mostly breast cancer bone metastasis models, several studies suggested that mechanical stimulation of the tibia can contribute to inhibiting bone metastatic colonization and cancer progression in bone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Tibial compression has been used to stimulate bone formation and study the interplay between mechanical stimuli and SREs. One study showed that moderate tibial loading, but not overloading, protected adult murine bone from destruction by metastasized breast cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, our work showed that mechanical loading of the tibia inhibited bone metastasis progression of NSCLC. Although many preclinical and clinical studies have shown that exercise can inhibit cancer progression, the ideal mechanism of implementation remains to be determined. The prescription of exercise for patients with cancer requires further research, including exercise type, frequency, duration, intensity, and whether it is supervised <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Exercise has been underutilized in patients with advanced cancer despite the benefits, particularly for those with bone metastases because of concerns over skeletal complications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Multiple studies showed that individuals with NSCLC were engaged in significantly less physical activity than similar-aged healthy individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Exercise models such as running are more realistic for healthy people, but mechanical loading such as tibial compression provides for isolating the impacts of mechanical stimuli on bone tissue in the context of SREs, which are more effective and safer for patients with advanced cancer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study provides new insights into understanding the mechanism underlying exercise-afforded protection against bone metastasis progression. Bone metastasis progression of NSCLC was inhibited by moderate exercise. Osteocytes, sensing mechanical stimulation generated by exercise, inhibit the proliferation of NSCLC cells and sustain their dormancy by releasing sEVs containing tumor-suppressive miRNAs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Understanding the mechanism underlying tumor dormancy may provide the foundation for the development of strategies to prevent dormant bone metastasis from emerging as overt bone metastasis.</p>

All surgical interventions were performed under anesthesia with a mixture of 13.3% urethane and 0.5% chloralose (0.65 ml/100 g body weight). All efforts were made to reduce the number of animals used and to minimize animal discomfort.</p>
<p>For in situ studies, 25 × 10<sup>4</sup> LLC cells or A549 cells were injected into the tibiae of 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice or nude mice. In brief, 25 × 10<sup>4</sup> LLC cells and A549 cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the tibia of C57BL/6 mice and nude mice, respectively. Mice were euthanized on day 21 for analyses, unless otherwise indicated. For stress-induced experiments, after 2 days of recovery, tibiae loading was performed daily on the tumor-inoculated tibiae. Using an ElectroForce device (Bose, Framingham, MA, United States), the tibiae of the mask-anesthetized mice were given daily loads of 1 N (peak-to-peak) at 2 Hz for 10 min, 5 days per week for 4 weeks.</p>

Cells were immediately removed from the plate with 10 ml ice-cold DMEM containing 10% FBS, pipetted into a 15 ml conical tube, and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in a 50 ml conical tube in 25 ml ice-cold PBS (without Ca or Mg) and counted. This was centrifuged to re-pellet, and finally resuspend at 25 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/10 μl in ice-cold PBS.</p>
<p>The mice were anesthetized using a mixture of 13.3% urethane and 0.5% chloralose (0.65 mL/100 g body weight). Both legs were cleaned with 10% povidone/iodine swab/solution, followed by ethanol, repeated twice. The skin was wetted with 70% ethanol to increase visibility of the underlying patellar ligament, which should be visible as a distinct, thick, white line. While firmly grasping the ankle/leg of the mouse, a 28g ½ needle was inserted under the patella, through the middle of patellar ligament, and into the anterior intercondylar area in the top of the tibia. A gentle, lateral movement of the needle was applied to ensure it was in tibia and passed through the growth plate. The plunger was slowly depressed to inject 10 μl of cell solution. After 3 min, the needle was slowly extracted. The treated mice were kept on a heating pad until revived.</p>

<p>Micro-CT was performed using the Skyscan 1172 (Bruker-MicroCT, Kontich, Belgium). The X-Ray tube settings were 80 kV and 500 µA and images were acquired at the highest resolution without charge coupled device binning, resulting in a voxel size of 9.44 µm. A 0.66° rotation step through a 195° angular range with 6500 msec exposure was used. After processing with a three-dimensional Gaussian filter to reduce noise, the ROIs were manually segmented such that they corresponded to the cortical and trabecular bone regions. Cortical ROIs comprised 470 µm thick regions (50 slices, 9.4 µm thickness per slice) located 3 mm distal to the growth plate, while 300 µm thick trabecular sections began 0.27 mm distal to the growth plate.</p>

<p>This study describes a potential role for mechanical stimulation on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development. The findings are <bold>important</bold> and their observations are interesting, as models to study exercise in a mouse cancer setting would have practical implications beyond lung cancer, and biological roles of osteocytes in bone metastatic cancer is an area of great interest for potential therapy development. However, the methods and data interpretation are <bold>incomplete</bold> and the claims of osteocytes inducing tumor dormancy are overstated. The mechanism by which osteocytes affect tumor cells is not clear and the authors' theory on this remains unproven since much of the data are correlative rather than causative, and adequate controls, data quantification, and confirmation with secondary cell lines are often lacking.</p>

<p>Xie and Colleagues propose here to investigate the mechanism by which exercise inhibits bone metastasis progression. The authors describe that osteocyte, sensing mechanical stimulation generated by exercise, inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation and sustain the dormancy thereof by releasing sEVs with tumor suppressor microRNAs. Furthermore, mechanical loading of the tibia inhibited the bone metastasis progression of NSCLC. Interestingly, exercise preconditioning effectively suppressed bone metastasis progression.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Xie and colleagues investigate the contribution of osteocytes to bone metastasis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) using a combination of clinical samples and in vitro and in vivo data. They find that metastatic NSCLC cells exhibit lower levels of the proliferation marker Ki-67 when located in areas adjacent to the bone surface in both NSCLC patients and an intraosseous animal model of NSCLC. Using in vitro approaches, they show that osteocyte-like cells inhibit the proliferation of NSCLC cells through the secretion of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). They identify miR-99b-3p as a component of sEVs and demonstrate that miR-99b3p inhibits the proliferation of NSCLC cells by targeting the transcription factor MDM2. Interestingly, the data also shows that mechanical stimulation of osteocytes enhances the inhibitory effect of osteocytes on NSCLC cell proliferation via increasing sEVs release. By performing different in vivo studies, the authors show that tibial loading and moderate exercise (treadmill running), before and after tumor cell inoculation, suppress tumor progression in bone and protect bone mass. Intriguingly, the moderate exercise regime shows additive/synergistic effects with the co-administration of anti-resorptive therapy. These data add to the growing evidence pointing towards osteocytes as important cells of the tumor microenvironment capable of influencing the progression of tumors in bone.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the paper, however, are not well supported by the data, and some critical aspects of image analysis and data analysis need to be clarified and extended.</p>
<p>1. The histological images are analyzed in a qualitative manner, with no description of the methodology used. In bone metastases, cancer cells are frequently mixed with bone marrow cells. The lack of cell markers to identify NSCLC cells versus bone marrow cells makes the interpretation of the imaging data difficult. The authors rely on KI-67 as a marker of proliferation. Yet, it is intriguing that some osteocytes, non-proliferating cells by definition, are often positive for this marker, which questions the specificity of the staining. To make these results more solid, the authors should have provided the proper immunostaining controls to check for specificity and use additional markers of proliferation.</p>
<p>2. Adding control groups to fully assess the impact of the in vivo interventions (tibial loading, moderate exercise, anti-resorptive therapy) on bone mass would be needed. The authors should have used naive mice or analyzed the bones from the non-injected contralateral legs. Further, validating the in vivo work with other osteocyte-like cells or primary osteocytes would have strengthened the results.</p>
<p>3. The data on miRNA99b-3p on NSCLC in Supplementary Figure 3 is not convincing. The positive cells are difficult to see and most of the osteocyte lack nuclei. Better data, in humans and the mouse model, would have helped to confirm that osteocytes produce miRNA99b-3p.</p>
<p>4. The conclusions of the paper are not fully supported by the data provided. Osteocytes, as well as other bone cells, can respond to mechanical stimulation and thus could virtually be responsible for the protective effects of mechanical loading or moderate exercise. In vivo experiments demonstrating a direct role of osteocytes-produced miRNA99b-3p are needed to support the notion that osteocytes maintain tumor dormancy in NSCLC bone metastasis. Further, the authors solely rely on Ki-67 as a marker of dormancy. Completing this analysis with an assessment of a dormant gene expression signature or in vivo studies assessing tumor dormancy directly would be needed to confirm this notion.</p>
