<title>Abstract</title><p>Sequence-specific DNA recognition underlies essential processes in gene regulation, yet methods for simultaneous prediction of genomic DNA recognition sites and their binding affinity remain lacking. Here, we present the Interpretable protein-DNA Energy Associative (IDEA) model, a residue-level, interpretable biophysical model capable of predicting binding sites and affinities of DNA-binding proteins. By fusing structures and sequences of known protein-DNA complexes into an optimized energy model, IDEA enables direct interpretation of physicochemical interactions among individual amino acids and nucleotides. We demonstrate that this energy model can accurately predict DNA recognition sites and their binding strengths across various protein families. Additionally, the IDEA model is integrated into a coarse-grained simulation framework that quantitatively captures the absolute protein-DNA binding free energies. Overall, IDEA provides an integrated computational platform alleviating experimental costs and biases in assessing DNA recognition and can be utilized for mechanistic studies of various DNA-recognition processes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gene regulation is essential for controlling the timing and extent of gene expression in cells. It guides important processes from development to disease response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Gene expressions are tightly controlled by various DNA binding proteins, including transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic regulators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> TFs initiate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, during which time a primary RNA transcript is synthesized from a gene’s DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> On the other hand, epigenetic regulators control gene expression by binding to specific chromatin regions, which spread post-translational modifications that modulate 3D genome organization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> Therefore, characterizing the DNA-interaction specificities of DNA binding proteins is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying many DNA-templated processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>To establish a comprehensive understanding of DNA binding processes, various experimental technologies have been developed and performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> These methods, such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Protein-binding microarray (PBM),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX),<sup>1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> have proven invaluable for measuring DNA-specific protein recognition. Nonetheless, due to the need for protein-specific antibodies,<sup>1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> as well as the cost and intrinsic bias associated with these experiments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> high-throughput measurement of large numbers of protein-DNA variants remains challenging.</p>
<p>Computational methods complement experimental efforts by providing the initial filter for assessing protein-DNA binding specificity. Numerous methods have emerged to enable predictions of binding sites and affinities of DNA-binding proteins. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> These methods often utilized machine-learning-based training to extract sequence preference information from DNA or protein by utilizing experimental high-throughput (HT) assays,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> which rely on the availability and quality of experimental binding assays. Additionally, many approaches employ deep neural networks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> which could obscure the interpretation of interaction patterns governing protein-DNA binding specificities. Understanding these patterns, however, is crucial for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying various DNA-recognition processes, such as those seen in TFs.<sup>3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nowadays, over 5000 protein-DNA 3D structures, including TF-DNA complexes, have been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> These data provide invaluable resources for understanding the physicochemical properties of protein-DNA binding patterns, extending beyond mere sequence information. Utilization of these data enables the training of a model for predicting the binding affinities of protein-DNA interactions. The very robustness of evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> offers an approach to extract the sequence-structure relation embedded in these available complexes, which learns an interpretable binding energy landscape that governs the recognition processes of those DNA-binding proteins.</p>
<p>Here, we introduce the Interpretable protein-DNA Energy Associative (IDEA) model, a predictive model that learns protein-DNA physicochemical interactions by fusing available biophysical structures and their associated sequences into an optimized energy model (Figure 1). We show that the model can be used to accurately predict the sequence-specific DNA binding affinities of DNA-binding proteins and is transferrable across the same protein superfamily. Moreover, the model can be enhanced by incorporating experimental binding data and can be generalized to enable base-pair resolution predictions of genomic DNA-binding sites. Notably, IDEA learns the interaction matrix between each amino acid and nucleotide, allowing for direct interpretation of the “molecular grammar” governing the binding specificities of DNA binding proteins. This interpretable energy model is further integrated into a simulation framework, facilitating mechanistic studies of various biomolecular functions involving protein-DNA dynamics.</p>

<title>Residue-Level Protein-DNA Energy Model for Predicting ProteinDNA Recognition Specificities</title>
<p>IDEA is a coarse-grained biophysical model at the residue resolution for investigating the binding interactions between protein and DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). It leverages both structures and corresponding sequences of known protein-DNA complexes to learn an interpretable energy model based on the interacting amino acids and nucleotides at the protein-DNA interface. The model was trained using available protein-DNA complexes curated from existing database.<sup>3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> Unlike existing deep-learning-based protein-DNA binding prediction models, IDEA aims to learn a physicochemical-based energy model that quantitatively characterizes sequences-specific interactions between amino acids and nucleotides, thereby interpreting the “molecular grammar” driving the binding energetics of protein-DNA interactions. The optimized energy model can be used to predict the binding affinity of given protein-DNA pairs based on their structures and sequences. Additionally, it enables the prediction of genomic DNA binding sites by a given protein, such as a transcription factor. Finally, the learned energy model is integrated into a simulation framework that can be used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying various DNA-templated activities, such as initiation of gene transcription,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> epigenetic regulation of gene expression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and DNA replication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Further details of the optimization protocol are provided in Methods Section <italic>Energy Model Optimization</italic>.</p>

<p>The protein–DNA complex, represented by the human MAX–DNA complex structure (PDB ID: 1HLO), was used for training the IDEA model. The sequences of the protein and DNA residues that form close contacts (highlighted in blue) in the structure were included in the training dataset. In addition, a series of synthetic decoy sequences were generated by randomizing the contacting residues in both the protein and DNA sequences. The amino acid–nucleotide energy model was then optimized by maximizing the ratio of the binding energy gap (<italic>δE</italic>) between protein and DNA in the native complex and the decoy complexes relative to the energy variance (Δ<italic>E</italic>). The optimized energy model can be used for multiple predictive applications, including the evaluation of binding free energies for various protein–DNA sequence pairs, prediction of genomic DNA binding sites by transcription factors or other DNA-binding proteins, and integration into a sequence-specific, residue-resolution simulation framework for dynamic simulations.</p></caption>

<title>IDEA Accurately Predicts Protein-DNA Binding Specificity</title>
<p>We first examine the predictive accuracy of IDEA by comparing its predicted TF-DNA binding affinity with experimental measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> We focused on the MAX TF, a basic Helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TF with the most comprehensive experimental binding data. The binding affinity of MAX to various DNA sequences has been quantified by multiple experimental platforms, including different SELEX variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and microfluidic-based MITOMI assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> Among them, the MITOMI quantitatively measured the binding affinities of MAX TF to a comprehensive set of 255 DNA sequences with mutations in the enhancer box (Ebox) motif, a consensus MAX DNA binding sequence, and can thus serve as a reference for us to benchmark our model predictions. Our <italic>de novo</italic> prediction based on one MAX crystal structure (PDB ID: 1HLO) correlates well with the experimental values (Pearson Correlation 0.67, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Including additional human-associated MAX-DNA complex structures and their associated sequences slightly improves the correlation (Pearson Correlation 0.68, Fig. S1), albeit not significantly, likely due to the structural similarity of protein-DNA interfaces across all MAX proteins. Prior works have proven it instrumental in incorporating experimental binding data to improve predicted protein-nucleic acid binding affinities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> Inspired by these approaches, we developed an enhanced predictive protocol that integrates additional experimental binding data if available (see the Methods Section <italic>Enhanced Modeling Prediction with SELEX Data</italic>). Encouragingly, when training the model with the SELEX-seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> of MAX TF, IDEA gained a significant predictive improvement in reproducing the MITOMI measurement (Pearson Correlation 0.79, Fig. S2).</p>

<title>IDEA Decodes the Molecular Grammar Governing Protein-DNA Interactions</title>
<p>IDEA protocol learns the physicochemical interactions that determine protein-DNA interactions by utilizing the sequence-structure relationship embedded in the protein-DNA experimental structures. Such a physicochemical interaction pattern can be interpreted directly from the learned energy model. To illustrate this, we focused on the energy model learned from the MAX-DNA complexes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Notably, DNA Cytosine (DC) exhibited strong interactions with Arginine (R), consistent with the fact that the E-box region (CACGTG) frequently attracts the positively charged residues of bHLH TFs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> Importantly, Arginine was in close contact with Cytosine in the crystal structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), thus consistent with the strong DC-R interactions shown in the learned energy model. Upon integrating the SELEX data into our model training, we found that the improved energy model shows additional unfavorable interactions between glutamic acid (E) and all DNA nucleotides, consistent with their negative charges (Fig. S3). Thus, including more experimental data can boost IDEA’s predictive accuracy by refining the amino-acid-nucleotide interacting energy model to better align with physical principles.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>IDEA Generalizes across Various Protein Families</title>
<p>To examine IDEA’s predictive accuracy across different DNA-binding protein families, we applied it to calculate protein-DNA binding affinities using a comprehensive HT-SELEX dataset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> We focused on evaluating the capability of IDEA to distinguish strong binders from weak binders for each protein with experimentally determined structures. We calculated the probability density distribution of the top and bottom binders identified in the SELEX experiment. A well-separated distribution indicates the successful identification of strong binders by IDEA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and Fig. S4). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score for these predictions. Further details are provided in Methods Section <italic>Evaluation of IDEA prediction using HT-SELEX data</italic>. Our analysis shows that for 80% of the proteins across 14 protein families, IDEA successfully differentiates strong binders from weak ones, with an AUC score greater than 0.5. We further performed 10-fold cross-validation on the binding affinities of the protein-DNA pairs in this dataset and found that IDEA outperforms state-of-theart protein-DNA models for cases with available experimentally determined protein-DNA complex structures (Fig. S5)</p>
<p>We also applied IDEA to calculate the binding affinity of additional TFs with available MITOMI measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> IDEA’s predicted binding affinity of Pho4 protein, another bHLH transcription factor, correlates well with the experimental measurement (Pearson Correlation 0.6, Fig. S6A) by training on the only available protein-DNA structure (PDB ID: 1A0A). We further evaluated IDEA’s predictive performance for the zinc-finger protein Zif268, which has a different structure from the bHLH TFs and thus requires a different atom to represent the DNA nucleotides (Table S1). Due to limited experimental data for all the possible DNA sequence combinations, we focused on testing IDEA’s predictions on point-mutated DNA sequences, which was known to be a challenging task due to their minor deviation from the wild-type sequence. Despite the challenge, IDEA achieves accurate predictions, with a Pearson Correlation of 0.57 (Fig. S6B). We further expanded the training dataset to include all the Zif268 structures and their associated sequences from the same CATH zinc finger superfamily (CATH ID: 3.30.160.60). Incorporating these additional training data further improves the predictive accuracy (Pearson Correlation 0.63, Fig. S7).</p>

<title>IDEA Demonstrates Transferability across Proteins in the Same CATH Superfamily</title>
<p>Since IDEA relies on the sequence-structure relationship of given protein-DNA complexes to reach predictive accuracy, we inquired whether the trained energy model from one proteinDNA complex could be generalized to predict the binding specificities of other complexes.</p>
<p>To test this, we assessed the transferability of IDEA predictions across all 11 structurally available protein-DNA complexes within the MAX TF-associated CATH superfamily (CATH ID: 4.10.280.10, Helix-loop-helix DNA-binding domain). We trained IDEA based on each of these 11 complexes and then used the trained model to predict the MAX-based MITOMI binding affinity. Our results show that IDEA generally makes correct predictions of the binding affinity when trained on proteins that are homologous to MAX, with Pearson Correlation coefficients larger than 0.5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>IDEA prediction shows transferability within the same CATH superfamily.</title>
<p>(A) The predicted MAX binding specificity, trained on other protein-DNA complexes within the same protein CATH superfamily, correlates well with experimental measurement. The proteins are ordered by their probability of being homologous to the MAX protein, determined using HHpred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> Training with a homologous protein (determined as a hit by HHpred) usually leads to better predictive performance (Pearson Correlation coefficient <italic>&gt;</italic> 0.5) compared to non-homologous proteins.

<graphic xlink:href="595895v2_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>The transferability of IDEA within the same CATH superfamily can be understood from the similar structural interfaces among different DNA-binding proteins, which determines a similar learned energy model. For example, the Pho4 protein (PDB ID: 1A0A) shares a highly similar DNA-binding interface with the MAX protein (PDB ID: 1HLO) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), despite having a 33.41% probability of being homologous. Consequently, the energy model derived from the Pho4-DNA complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) exhibits a similar amino-acid-nucleotide interactive pattern as that learned from the MAX-DNA complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of Genomic Protein-DNA Binding Sites</title>
<p>The genomic locations of DNA binding sites are causally related to major cellular processes. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Although multiple techniques have been developed to enable high-throughput mapping of genomic protein-DNA binding locations, such as ChIP–seq, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> DAP-seq,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and FAIREseq,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> challenges remain for precisely pinpointing protein-binding sites at a base-pair resolution. Furthermore, the applicability of these techniques for different DNA-binding proteins is restricted by the quality of antibody designs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Therefore, a predictive computational framework would significantly reduce the costs and accelerate the identification of genomic binding sites of DNA-binding proteins.</p>
<p>We incorporated IDEA into a protocol to predict the genomic protein-DNA binding sites at the base-pair resolution, given a DNA-binding protein and a genomic DNA sequence. To evaluate the predictive accuracy of this protocol, we utilized publicly available ChIP-seq data for MAX TF binding in GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> As the experimental measurements were conducted at the 420 base pairs resolution, we averaged our modeling prediction over a window spanning 500 base pairs. Since the experimental signals are sparsely distributed across the genome, we focused our prediction on the 1 Mb region of Chromosome 1, which has the densest and most reliable ChIP-seq signals (156000 kb 157000 kb, representative window shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> top). Lower predicted binding free energy corresponds to stronger protein-DNA binding affinity, indicating higher probability binding sites.</p>

<p>The predicted binding free energies were further normalized by those of the randomized decoy sequences (see the Methods Section <italic>Processing of ChIP-seq Data</italic> for details). The identified MAX-binding sites are marked in red, with a normalized Z score <italic>&lt;</italic> −0.75. Our prediction successfully identifies the majority of the MAX binding sites, achieving an AUC score of 0.81 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We also tested IDEA’s predictive performance on two additional typical DNA-binding proteins and successfully identified their genomic binding sites (Fig. S8). Therefore, IDEA provides an accurate initial prediction of genomic recognition sites of DNA-binding proteins based only on DNA sequences, facilitating more focused experimental efforts. Furthermore, IDEA holds the potential to identify binding sites beyond the experimental resolution and can aid in the interpretation of other sequencing techniques to uncover additional factors that influence genome-wide DNA binding, such as chromatin accessibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup></p>

<p>To refine this simulation model by including protein-DNA interaction specificity, we incorporated the IDEA-optimized protein-DNA energy model into the coarse-grained simulation model as a short-range Van der Waals (VdW) interaction in the form of a Tanh function (See Methods Section <italic>Sequence Specific Protein-DNA Simulation Model</italic> for modeling details).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The protein-DNA interaction landscape has evolved to facilitate precise targeting of proteins towards their functional binding sites, which underlie essential processes in controlling gene expression. These interaction specifics are determined by physicochemical interactions between amino acids and nucleotides. By integrating sequences and structural data from available protein-DNA complexes into an interaction matrix, we introduce IDEA, a datadriven method that optimizes a system-specific energy model. This model enables highthroughput <italic>in silico</italic> predictions of protein-DNA binding specificities and can be scaled up to predict genomic binding sites of DNA-binding proteins, such as TFs. IDEA achieves accurate <italic>de novo</italic> predictions using only protein-DNA complex structures and their associated sequences, but its accuracy can be further enhanced by incorporating available experimental data from other binding assay measurements, such as the SELEX data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> achieving accuracy comparable or better than state-of-the-art methods (Figs. S2 and S5). Despite significant progress in genome-wide sequencing techniques, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> determining the binding specificities of DNA-binding biomolecules remains time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, IDEA presents a cost-effective alternative for generating the initial predictions before pursuing further experimental refinement.</p>
<p>A key advantage of IDEA is its incorporation of both structural and sequence information, which greatly reduces the demand for extensive training data. Prior efforts have applied deep learning techniques to predict the interactions between proteins and DNA based on their sequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> These approaches usually require a large amount of sequencing training data. By leveraging the sequence-structure relationship inherent in protein-DNA complex structures, IDEA achieves accurate <italic>de novo</italic> prediction using only a few protein-DNA complexes within the same protein superfamily.</p>
<p>In addition, despite the complicated <italic>in vivo</italic> environment, IDEA enables predictions of genomic binding sites and shows good agreement with the ChIP-seq measurements (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, S8). Moreover, IDEA features rapid prediction, typically requiring 1-3 days to predict base-pair resolution genomic binding sites of a 1 Mb DNA region using a single CPU. Furthermore, IDEA’s prediction can be trivially parallelized, making it possible to perform genome-wide predictions of DNA recognition sites by a given protein within weeks.</p>
<p>Another highlight of IDEA is its ability to present an interpretable amino acid-nucleotide interaction energy model for given protein-DNA complexes. Unlike other machine-learning approaches, IDEA’s optimized energy model not only predicts binding affinities and binding sites of DNA-binding proteins but also provides an interpretable representation of interaction specifics between each type of amino acid and nucleotide. Additionally, we integrated this physicochemical-based energy model into a simulation framework, thereby improving the characterization of protein-DNA binding dynamics. Therefore, IDEA-based simulation enables investigations into dynamic interactions among various proteins and DNA, facilitating molecular-based simulations to understand the physical mechanisms underlying many DNA-binding processes, such as transcription, epigenetic regulations, and their modulation by sequence mutations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since the IDEA-optimized energy model serves as a “molecular grammar” for guiding protein-DNA interaction specifics, it can be expanded to include additional variants of amino acids and nucleotides. With recent advancements in sequencing and structural characterization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> as well as deep-learning-based structural predictions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> thousands of structures and sequences have been solved for these variants.

We collected the sequences from both the strong binders and decoy binders (considered weak binders) for model parameterization. Synthetic decoy binders were generated by randomizing either the DNA (1000 sequences) or protein sequences (10,000 sequences) from the strong binders. The IDEA protocol optimizes a pairwise amino-acid-nucleotide energy model by maximizing the gap in binding energies between the strong and decoy binders.

In cases where no sequences had an M-word score below 0.3, we used alternative cutoffs of 0.4 or 0.5 to ensure that at least three weak-binding sequences were included. These labeled strong and weak binders were then used as the ground truth for evaluating IDEA’s predictions. We assessed IDEA’s predictive accuracy by calculating the probability density distributions of the predicted binding free energies (Fig. S4). A well-separated distribution between strong and weak binders indicates a successful prediction. Additionally, we calculated the AUC score based on ROC analysis of these probability distributions.

where <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> = 8 Å and <italic>η</italic> = 0.7 Å<sup>−1</sup>. <italic>W</italic> is a 4 × 20 matrix that characterizes the interaction energy between each type of amino acid and DNA nucleotide. Here, W used the normalized IDEA-learned energy model based on 9 protein-DNA complexes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The IDEA-learned energy model was normalized by the sum of the absolute value of each term of the energy model. Detailed parameters are provided in Table S2. Additional details on the protein-DNA simulation are provided in the Supplementary Materials.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> work presents an interpretable protein-DNA Energy Associative (IDEA) model for predicting binding sites and affinities of DNA-binding proteins. The study provides a detailed description of the method, making it reproducible. However, the generalizability of the prediction model presents certain concerns, and the supporting evidence appears <bold>incomplete</bold>. Nonetheless, with a thorough re-examination of the training and testing procedures, this model can be widely applicable for predicting genome-wide protein-DNA binding sites.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work presents an Interpretable protein-DNA Energy Associative (IDEA) model for predicting binding sites and affinities of DNA-binding proteins. Experimental results demonstrate that such an energy model can predict DNA recognition sites and their binding strengths across various protein families and can capture the absolute protein-DNA binding free energies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The IDEA model integrates both structural and sequence information, although such an integration is not completely original.</p>
<p>(2) The IDEA predictions seem to have agreement with experimental data such as ChIP-seq measurements.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim that the binding free energy calculated by IDEA, trained using one MAX-DNA complex, correlates well with experimentally measured MAX-DNA binding free energy (Figure 2) based on the reported Pearson Correlation of 0.67. However, the scatter plot in Figure 2A exhibits distinct clustering of the points and thus the linear fit to the data (red line) may not be ideal. As such. the use of the Pearson correlation coefficient that measures linear correlation between two sets of data may not be appropriate and may provide misleading results for non-linear relationships.</p>
<p>(2) In the same vein, the linear Pearson Correlation analysis performed in Figure 5A and the conclusion drawn may be misleading.</p>
<p>(3) The authors included the sequences of the protein and DNA residues that form close contacts in the structure in the training dataset, whereas a series of synthetic decoy sequences were generated by randomizing the contacting residues in both the protein and DNA sequences. In particular, synthetic decoy binders were generated by randomizing either the DNA (1000 sequences) or protein sequences (10,000 sequences) from the strong binders. However, the justification for such randomization and how it might impact the model's generalizability and transferability remain unclear.</p>
<p>(4) The authors performed Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and reported the Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores in order to quantitate the successful identification of the strong binders by IDEA. It would be beneficial to analyze the precision-recall (PR) curve and report the PRAUC metric which could be more robust.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhang et al. present a methodology to model protein-DNA interactions via learning an optimizable energy model, taking into account a representative bound structure for the system and binding data. The methodology is sound and interesting. They apply this model for predicting binding affinity data and binding sites in vivo. However, the manuscript lacks discussion of/comparison with state-of-the-art and evidence of broad applicability. The interpretability aspect is weak, yet over-emphasized.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well organized with good visualizations and is easy to follow. The methodology is discussed in detail. The IDEA energy model seems like an interesting way to study a protein-DNA system in the context of a given structure and binding data. The authors show that an IDEA model trained on one system can be transferred to other structurally similar systems. The authors show good performance in discriminating between binding-vs-decoy sequences for various systems, and binding affinity prediction. The authors also show evidence of the ability to predict genome-wide binding sites.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>An energy-based model that needs to be optimized for specific systems is inherently an uncomfortable idea. Is this kind of energy model superior to something like Rosetta-based energy models, which are generally applicable? Or is it superior to family-specific knowledge-based models? It is not clear.</p>
<p>Prediction of binding affinity is a well-studied domain and many competitors exist, some of which are well-used. However, no quantitative comparison to such methods is presented. To understand the scope of the presented method, IDEA, the authors should discuss/compare with such methods (e.g. PMID 35606422).</p>
<p>The term &quot;interpretable&quot; has been used lavishly in the manuscript while providing little evidence on the matter. The only evidence shown is the family-specific residue-nucleotide interaction/energy matrix and speculations on how these values are biologically sensible. Recent works already present more biophysical, fine-grained, and sometimes family-independent interpretability (e.g. PMID 39103447, 36656856, 38352411, etc.). The authors should put into context the scope of the interpretability of IDEA among such works.</p>
<p>The manuscript disregards subtle yet important differences in commonly used terminology in the field. For example, the authors use the term &quot;specificity&quot; and &quot;affinity&quot; almost interchangeably (for example, the caption for Figure 3A uses &quot;specificity&quot; although the Methods text describes the prediction as about &quot;affinity&quot;). If the authors are looking to predict specificity, IDEA needs to be put in the context of the corresponding state-of-the-art (PMID 36123148, 39103447, 38867914, 36124796, etc).</p>
<p>It is not clear how much the learned energy model is dependent on the structural model used for a specific system/family. It would be interesting to see the differences in learned model based on different representative PDB structures used. Similarly, the supplementary figures show a lack of discriminative power for proteins like PDX1 (homeodomain family), POU, etc. Can the authors shed some light on why such different performances?</p>
<p>It is also not clear if IDEA's prediction for reverse complement sequences is the same for a given sequence. If so, how is this property being modelled? Either this description is lacking or I missed it.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Protein-DNA interactions and sequence readout represent a challenging and rapidly evolving field of study. Recognizing the complexity of this task, the authors have developed a compact and elegant model. They have applied well-established approaches to address a difficult problem, effectively enhancing the information extracted from sparse contact maps by integrating artificial sequences decoy set and available experimental data. This has resulted in the creation of a practical tool that can be adapted for use with other proteins.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors integrate sparse information with available experimental data to construct a model whose utility extends beyond the limited set of structures used for training.</p>
<p>(2) A comprehensive methods section is included, ensuring that the work can be reproduced. Additionally, the authors have shared their model as a GitHub project, reflecting their commitment to transparency of research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The coarse-graining procedure appears artificial, if not confusing, given that full-atom crystal structures provide more detailed information about residue-residue contacts. While the selection procedure for distance threshold values is explained, the overall motivation for adopting this approach remains unclear. Furthermore, since this model is later employed as an empirical potential for molecular modeling, the use of P and C5 atoms raises concerns, as the interactions in 3SPN are modeled between Cα and the nucleic base, represented by its center of mass rather than P or C5 atoms.</p>
<p>(2) Although the authors use a standard set of metrics to assess model quality and predictive power, some ΔΔG predictions compared to MITOMI-derived ΔΔG values appear nonlinear, which casts doubt on the interpretation of the correlation coefficient.</p>
<p>(3) The discussion section lacks information about the model's limitations and a comprehensive comparison with other models. Additionally, differences in model performance across various proteins and their respective predictive powers are not addressed.</p>

<p>We really appreciate the reviewer for pointing out our conflation of “specificity” and “affinity” in the manuscript. To clarify, IDEA’s primary function is to predict the binding affinities of protein-DNA pairs in a sequence-specific manner. The acquired binding affinities of target DNA sequences can then be used to assess the specific binding motifs. We will revise our text to clarify this point.</p>

<p>Regarding the simulation model, we acknowledge a potential disconnection between the coarse-grained level of the 3SPN model (3 coarse-grained sites per nucleotide) and the data-driven model (1 coarse-grained site per nucleotide). The selection of nucleic bases for molecular interactions in the 3SPN model follows the PI’s previous work [PMID: 34057467] and its code implementation. We will test the simulation model by incorporating interactions between Cff and P atoms. In the future, we will work on implementing IDEA model output for 1-bead-per-nucleotide DNA simulation models.</p>
