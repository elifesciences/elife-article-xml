<title>Abstract</title><p>Photoreceptor loss results in vision loss in many blinding diseases, and metabolic dysfunction underlies photoreceptor degeneration. So, exploiting photoreceptor metabolism is an attractive strategy to prevent vision loss. Yet, the metabolic pathways that maintain photoreceptor health remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the dependence of photoreceptors on glutamine (Gln) catabolism. Gln is converted to glutamate via glutaminase (GLS), so mice lacking GLS in rod photoreceptors were generated to inhibit Gln catabolism. Loss of GLS produced rapid rod photoreceptor degeneration. In vivo metabolomic methodologies and metabolic supplementation identified Gln catabolism as critical for glutamate and aspartate biosynthesis. Concordant with this amino acid deprivation, the integrated stress response (ISR) was activated with protein synthesis attenuation, and inhibiting the ISR delayed photoreceptor loss. Furthermore, supplementing asparagine, which is synthesized from aspartate, delayed photoreceptor degeneration. Hence, Gln catabolism is integral to photoreceptor health, and these data reveal a novel metabolic axis in these metabolically-demanding neurons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Photoreceptor (PR) death is the cause of vision loss in many retinal diseases. A paucity of effective therapies exist that prevent PR death, so there is an unmet need for therapeutics that improve or prolong PR survival. The retina has a significant energetic demand, driven in large part by PRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pan et al., 2021</xref>). The prodigious bioenergetic requirements of photoreceptors (PRs) are due to the need to conduct phototransduction and neurotransmission as well as manufacture the lipid- and protein-rich outer segment, which is shed daily and phagocytosed by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Young, 1967</xref>). PRs have little reserve capacity to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and as a result, are adversely affected by small changes in energy homeostasis. As such, metabolic dysfunction has been shown to underlie PR cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bowne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hartong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kooragayala et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pan et al., 2021</xref>), and exploiting PR metabolism to make these cells more robust to stress is an attractive neuroprotective strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pan et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, beyond glucose, the metabolic pathways integral to PR health remain largely unknown. This is a critical knowledge gap as identification of these pathways is likely to reveal new strategies for therapeutic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Duncan et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Glucose is central to PR metabolism as these cells utilize aerobic glycolysis, or the conversion of glucose to lactate despite the presence of oxygen, for the production of both energy and anabolic building blocks, similar to cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ait-Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chinchore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kanow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Petit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Swarup et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies have shown that genetic knockdown of enzymes key to aerobic glycolysis leads to PR dysfunction and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chinchore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Petit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rajala, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Weh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wubben et al., 2017</xref>). However, like other metabolically-demanding cells, recent work has demonstrated that PRs have the flexibility to utilize fuel sources beyond glucose to meet their metabolic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Daniele et al., 2022</xref>; Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Joyal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Glutamine (Gln) is the most abundant amino acid found in the body and circulating within the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), and many rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells, which utilize aerobic glycolysis, depend on Gln for their survival and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Gln can serve as a substrate for multiple pathways, providing a carbon and nitrogen source for biosynthesis, energetics, and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). These features potentially make Gln an ideal alternative fuel source for PRs, whose bioenergetic demand rivals that of cancer cells despite being terminally differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ng et al., 2015</xref>). To this end, over half of the Gln in the retina is found in the outer retina, which is primarily composed of PRs (Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Voigt et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Ex</italic> vivo experiments have shown that Gln can be a source of carbons for TCA cycle intermediates in the retina and contribute to amino acid biosynthesis (Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tsantilas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, Gln was demonstrated to support nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) generation in the absence of glucose <italic>in vitro</italic> in isolated PRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adler et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, in a genetically altered mouse model that disrupts glucose transport to the PRs, both Gln and its transporter were upregulated in the retina, implying that metabolism of this amino acid may be supporting PR survival when glucose is limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Swarup et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Glutaminolysis is the process by which Gln is metabolized into TCA cycle intermediates for critical biosynthetic precursors. This process is initiated by the catabolism of Gln to glutamate (Glu) via one of two glutaminase enzymes: kidney-type glutaminase (GLS) or liver-type glutaminase (GLS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Single-cell RNA sequencing data (GSE63473 and GSE142449) has demonstrated that GLS is the predominant isoform in the retina and PRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Voigt et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, it has been shown that glutaminase activity is at least two-fold higher in mitochondria-rich PR inner segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ross et al., 1987</xref>). Since the inner segments of PRs are responsible for supporting the majority of energy production and metabolism, GLS activity is likely critical for metabolic functions in PRs.</p>
<p>Glutaminolysis via GLS is indispensable to the metabolism of many cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Altman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), and a variety of data show the similarities between cancer cell metabolism and retinal metabolism, and specifically, metabolism of the PRs in the outer retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chinchore et al., 2017</xref>; Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rajala, 2020</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that GLS-initiated Gln catabolism may also be essential to PR metabolism, function, and survival. Previous studies utilizing <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>ex vivo</italic> methods with whole retinas from wild-type mice or mice with genetic perturbations not confined to PRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2020</xref>) have provided a foundation for this governing hypothesis, but none have examined the role of Gln catabolism specifically in PRs <italic>in vivo.</italic> In this study, we generated a rod photoreceptor-specific knockout of GLS to comprehensively study the importance of GLS-driven Gln catabolism in PRs.</p>

<title>Generation of a rod photoreceptor-specific, <italic>Gls</italic> knockout mouse</title>
<p>To confirm the single-cell RNA sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Voigt et al., 2020</xref>), we conducted real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) with primers specific for either <italic>Gls</italic> or <italic>Gls2</italic> (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary File 1</xref>). These data show that <italic>Gls</italic> expression is 14 times greater than that of <italic>Gls2</italic> in the mouse retina (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that GLS is indeed the predominant isoform in murine retina. Furthermore, retinal sections stained for GLS using immunofluorescence showed that GLS is expressed throughout the retina with enrichment in the PR inner segments (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1B</xref>). It has been shown that GLS activity is at least two-fold higher in the PR inner segments, which are rich in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ross et al., 1987</xref>). Accordingly, GLS segregated to the mitochondrial-enriched fraction more than the cytosolic fraction in the retina (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p>

Animals homozygous for a floxed <italic>Gls</italic> allele and expressing a Cre-recombinase under the control of the rhodopsin promoter (<italic>Gls<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Rho-Cre<sup>+</sup>,</italic> cKO) as well as animals expressing only the Cre-recombinase (<italic>Gls<sup>wt/wt</sup>;Rho-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>, WT) were generated. Total retinal lysate was collected from cKO and WT animals at postnatal day 14 (P14) and GLS expression was measured (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These data show that cKO animals have significantly less GLS expression compared to WT animals.

<title>Loss of GLS causes rapid PR degeneration</title>
<p>These data clearly show that GLS is significantly downregulated in cKO animals. To determine if loss of GLS effects PR survival, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to measure the <italic>in vivo</italic> thickness of each retinal layer at various timepoints in cKO and WT animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). At P14, cKO and WT animals are indistinguishable in total retinal and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). However, by P21 a significant loss in total retinal, ONL, and IS/OS thickness is observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>) and cKO animals continue to experience loss of retinal, ONL and IS/OS thickness out to P84. Considering mice open their eyes around P14, we assessed if light exposure was contributing to PR degeneration. cKO mice were reared in the dark, but no change in the rate of ONL degeneration was observed when comparing dark-reared mice to those reared in 12-hour light/12-hour dark cyclic lighting conditions (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2</xref>). Histology at P14, P21, and P42 confirmed loss of PR cell bodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). As has been seen in other models of PR degeneration, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is a marker of stress-induced Müller glial cell activation, was increased in the retina of the cKO mouse at P21 and P42 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, to assess the cell death pathways contributing to PR degeneration in the cKO mouse, retinal sections from P21 animals were stained for TUNEL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). At P21, there is a significant increase in TUNEL positive outer retinal cells in cKO mice compared to WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis of cell death-related gene expression at P14 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>) demonstrated an increase in genes involved in apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis. These data coincide with the thought that apoptosis is the predominant mechanism of PR death in many retinal diseases, considering <italic>Casp8</italic> showed the greatest increase in expression in the cKO retina, but also that other cell death mechanisms can contribute to PR cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wubben et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Retinas were stained for RHO expression using immunofluorescence, which indicated rod OSs were shorter after <italic>Gls</italic> knockout (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 4A</xref>). Because cKO mice demonstrated shorter OSs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate the ultrastructure of cKO rod OSs (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figures 1 – figure supplement 4B-C</xref>). The rod OSs in the cKO mouse appeared largely normal with well-organized, stacked disc membranes that maintained interdigitation with the RPE similar to the WT mouse, just shorter than WT rod OSs.</p>
<p>A deficiency in GLS activity could lead to a significant decrease in Glu, the main neurotransmitter used by PRs. TEM was utilized to assess the ultrastructure of rod PR ribbon synapses, which appear structurally intact in the remaining rod PRs of the cKO retina at P21 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 4D</xref>). To further evaluate the synaptic connectivity between PRs and the inner retina, retinal sections from cKO and WT mice at P14 were labeled with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a plant lectin that binds N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid residues, to highlight PR synaptic membranes and non-synaptic membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">McLaughlin et al., 1980</xref>). Retinal sections from P14 WT and cKO mice stained with WGA did not demonstrate significant differences in the labeling of PR synaptic membranes in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 5A</xref>). Staining of P14 retinal sections from WT and cKO mice with an antibody against Bassoon, which labels the ribbon synapses of rods and cones in the OPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kutsyr et al., 2021</xref>), did not demonstrate differences in the synaptic connectivity between PRs and second-order neurons (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 5B</xref>). Additionally, retinal sections at P14, P21, and P42 were stained with antibodies against major cell-types in the inner retina, such as amacrine, ganglion, and bipolar cells, and no significant alterations in immunofluorescent patterns to suggest an inner retinal developmental abnormality were observed between cKO and WT animals (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 5C</xref>). Accordingly, inner retinal thinning was not observed until P42 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 5D</xref>), when approximately 25% of cells remained in the ONL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). This thinning of the inner retinal area is likely secondary to the primary PR degeneration similar to that seen in other mouse models of retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ueta et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>Gls</italic> in rod photoreceptors impairs retinal function</title>
<p>Loss of IS/OS thickness, shorter OSs, and loss of PR cell bodies can result in functional loss. Thus, electroretinography (ERG) analysis was performed on cKO and WT animals at P21 and P42 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). As expected, cKO animals show a significant loss in rod-driven scotopic a- and b-wave amplitudes at P21, which are further decreased by P42 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-2C</xref>). Interestingly, a significant loss in photopic b-wave amplitude was also found at P42, suggesting a cone PR defect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).

<title>GLS is necessary for maintenance of mature photoreceptors</title>
<p>In mice expressing a Cre-recombinase under the control of the rhodopsin promoter, Cre-mediated excision of floxed genomic DNA has been observed as early as P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Le et al., 2006</xref>).

<p>Beyond survival, GLS is also critical for PR function. ERG analyses performed 10 days after TAM induction, a time prior to major structural changes in the outer retina, demonstrated statistically significant reductions in the IND-cKO scotopic a- and b-waves as compared to the WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Similarly, photopic ERG demonstrated statistically significant decreases in the b-wave of the IND-cKO retina (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). These data suggest that GLS-driven Gln catabolism plays a significant role not only in rod PR survival but their function as well. Additionally, <italic>Pde6g</italic> is expressed by rods to a significant degree but also by cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Voigt et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the IND-cKO likely knocks out GLS from both rods and cones, which is in accordance with the immunofluorescence image in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> where GLS is not observed in rod or cone inner segments unlike in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> where GLS remains in cones. Hence, the reduction in IND-cKO photopic b-wave may suggest that GLS-driven Gln catabolism in cones impairs their synaptic transmission.</p>

<title>GLS knockout does not alter nucleotide metabolism</title>
<p>Gln, and its breakdown product, Glu, have several fates in cellular metabolism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), which may underly the rapid and significant PR degeneration observed when GLS is knocked out of rod PRs. PRs require nucleotides to support phototransduction as well as transcriptional efforts for the continued synthesis of OSs. The catabolism of Gln to Glu by GLS produces an ammonium ion that can be used for the synthesis of nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>).

<p>Gln can also be used for the generation of the antioxidant molecule glutathione as well as in a non-canonical NADPH generating pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Son et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). Glutathione is a tripeptide of glutamate, glycine, and cysteine. Glutamate is a product of the GLS reaction, and previous studies have demonstrated that inhibiting GLS reduces glutathione levels and increases reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2015</xref>). As such, the NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH ratio was statistically significantly increased by 16% in the P14 cKO retina as compared to WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), and the relative abundance of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was decreased in the P14 cKO retina as compared to WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). While an increased NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH ratio in the cKO retina may imply that the abundance of GSSG should be increased in the cKO retina since reduced glutathione can be recovered from the oxidized form by the conversion of NADPH to NADP<sup>+</sup>, the levels of GSSG have been seen to be reduced in other models where GLS is pharmacologically inhibited or genetically knocked down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daemen et al., 2018</xref>). The lower levels of GSSG may signal an overall reduction in the biosynthesis of glutathione considering the product of the GLS reaction, glutamate, is directly necessary for its synthesis as well as indirectly responsible for cysteine via the SLC7A11 (xCT) cystine/glutamate antiporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). The expression of <italic>Slc7a11</italic> was reduced in the P14 cKO retina (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Hence, the biosynthesis of glutathione in rod PRs may be affected directly and indirectly when GLS is knocked out. In accordance with the antioxidants NADPH and glutathione potentially being reduced, the expression of the antioxidant enzymes <italic>Sod1</italic> and <italic>Sod2</italic>, which detoxify superoxide radicals, were increased in the P14 cKO retina (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).

<title>Relative abundance of TCA cycle intermediates and mitochondrial function mostly unchanged in <italic>Gls</italic> cKO retina</title>
<p>While the changes in certain redox elements were statistically significant, they were modest alterations and may not account in full for the significant and rapid PR degeneration noted in the GLS cKO mouse. Many cancer cells that utilize aerobic glycolysis rely on Gln to replenish TCA cycle intermediates, which maintain oxidative metabolism and provide biosynthetic precursors. Considering PRs utilize aerobic glycolysis, similar to cancer cells, and have significant bioenergetic demands, we next sought to determine if rod PRs also depend on GLS-initiated glutaminolysis for TCA cycle metabolites and oxidative metabolism. Interestingly, LC-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics demonstrated very few changes in the relative pool sizes of TCA cycle metabolites in the cKO compared to WT retina at P14 with only malate showing a statistically significant decrease (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Since GLS is enriched in the PR mitochondria (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1B</xref>) and previous studies demonstrated that inhibiting GLS in certain cell lines reduces mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alkan et al., 2018</xref>), mitochondrial stress tests were also performed on P14 cKO and WT retina, prior to PR loss, using the BaroFuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kamat et al., 2023</xref>). The basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as well as the changes in OCR in response to oligomycin or carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) were not statistically significantly different between WT and cKO retina (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). The expression of complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation were also unchanged between the WT and cKO retina at P14 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>).</p>
<p>As stated earlier, a Cre-recombinase under the control of the rhodopsin has been shown to be activated as early as P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2005</xref>). To circumvent this early knockout of GLS, rod PRs may rewire their metabolism, as has been seen in other conditional knockout mouse models with this Cre-recombinase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Subramanya et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wubben et al., 2017</xref>), to utilize different fuel sources for the maintenance of the TCA cycle and mitochondrial function. To this end, the expression of genes involved in glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and the TCA cycle were examined in the P14 cKO and WT retina before PR degeneration. Numerous genes were significantly altered in the cKO retina across the metabolic pathways (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1</xref>). The expression of multiple genes in glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism were increased (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1A</xref>), possibly suggesting that rod PRs are stimulating glucose oxidation to maintain the TCA cycle and mitochondrial function similar to that seen in certain cancer cells when GLS is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Okazaki et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the only significant change in expression of these genes in eyecup tissue was <italic>Pdk4,</italic> with a significant decrease in cKO vs WT mice (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 2</xref>). However, targeted metabolomics demonstrated only a minor change in glycolytic intermediates between the cKO and WT retina at P14 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). As targeted metabolomics at the P14 timepoint provides only a snapshot of the pool size, additional analyses with stable isotope tracing metabolomics are necessary to assess nutrient utilization, in this case glucose. Uniformly-labeled, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose was intraperitoneally injected in P14 WT and cKO mice, and the retina harvested 45 minutes later for metabolomic analysis via LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). No change in the fractional labeling of glycolytic intermediates was observed between the WT and cKO retina, and more so, an increase in the fractional labeling of TCA cycle intermediates was not observed in the cKO retina (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A, 5B</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 1</xref>).

<p>We initially anticipated that GLS knockout in rod PRs would significantly alter the relative TCA cycle metabolite pools in the cKO retina, similar to what is seen in Gln-dependent cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daemen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), as PRs and cancer cells have common metabolic relationships (Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rajala, 2020</xref>), and previous <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies demonstrated Gln can supplement the TCA cycle in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tsantilas et al., 2021</xref>). However, as observed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, very few changes were observed in the relative pool sizes of TCA cycle metabolites in the cKO compared to WT retina. To delineate how Gln is metabolized, we used LC-MS/MS to trace the metabolic fate of uniformly-labeled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-Gln in the WT and cKO retina <italic>in vivo</italic> at P14. Uniformly-labeled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-Gln was intraperitoneally injected into the mice and the retina harvested 45 minutes later. In accordance with GLS being the enzyme that initiates glutaminolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), the fractional labeling of glutamate, TCA cycle intermediates, and pyruvate was decreased in the P14 cKO retina as compared to WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C, 5D</xref> and <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 2</xref>). Previous <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies have also observed that isotopically labeled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-Gln can contribute to m+3 pyruvate in the retina possibly via the decarboxylation of m+4 malate by malic enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>a-ketoglutarate (α-KG) is the main entry point for Gln into the TCA cycle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) and has been shown to be a key metabolite in Gln metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> stable isotope tracing demonstrated decreased incorporation of Gln carbons into α-KG in the cKO retina compared to the WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, supplementation with α-KG has been shown to improve PR survival in mouse models of inherited retinal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wert et al., 2020</xref>). So, we attempted to rescue the PR degeneration phenotype in the GLS cKO mouse by supplementing cKO animals with 10 mg/mL of α-KG in the drinking water starting at P4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rowe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wert et al., 2020</xref>). A small, but significant increase in ONL thickness was identified in α-KG-treated animals at P22 using OCT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These data further suggest that Gln’s role in supporting the TCA cycle is not the major mechanism by which PRs utilize Gln to suppress PR apoptosis.</p>

<title><italic>Gls</italic> cKO retina has reduced NEAA levels and an upregulated integrated stress response</title>
<p>Gln and GLS-derived Glu play a central role in the biosynthesis of several NEAAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). So, the disruption of GLS-initiated Gln catabolism may be causing a disruption in available NEAAs for biomass production. To this end, targeted metabolomics on the cKO retina at P14 showed a significant increase in the substrate of GLS, Gln, and a significant decrease in its NEAA product Glu, further illustrating loss of GLS function (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>).

<p>Deprivation of amino acids can activate the integrated stress response (ISR), which responds to an array of stressors to maintain cellular homeostasis and particularly, protein homeostasis. Acutely, ISR activation can protect cells by temporarily halting protein synthesis. However, chronic ISR activation and global protein synthesis inhibition can trigger apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). ISR activation leads to phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), which reduces global protein synthesis while preferentially allowing for the translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). Considering the reduced levels of NEAAs Glu and Asp, retinas from P14 GLS cKO animals were assayed for these ISR components using Western blotting (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>), which demonstrated increased levels of both phosphorylated eIF2α and total ATF4, suggesting ISR activation. To determine if global protein synthesis was affected in GLS cKO retinas, we applied the SUnSET (SUrface SEnsing of Translation) method to quantify protein synthesis in WT and cKO retinas at P14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fort et al., 2022</xref>). These data show a significant decrease of puromycin incorporation into nascent polypeptide chains, indicating a decrease in global protein synthesis consistent with ISR activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). To determine if PR degeneration could be rescued by inhibiting the ISR, ISRIB (2.5 mg/kg) was administered systemically daily starting at P5. In WT mice, ISRIB treatment did not impact retinal anatomy as assessed by OCT at P21 (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 2A</xref>). Notably, at P21, ISRIB treatment in the cKO mouse significantly increased ONL thickness compared to vehicle using OCT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>) and histology (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 3A</xref>), and this effect was sustained at P28 (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results suggest that ISR activation is downstream of Gln catabolism and contributes to PR degeneration in the cKO mouse retina.</p>
<p>Previous work has demonstrated that when certain cancer cell lines are faced with Gln deprivation, α-KG alone does not restore cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pavlova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Son et al., 2013</xref>). Rather, NEAA supplementation is necessary to restore proliferation in these reports. Similarly, α-KG supplementation had an incomplete survival impact on PR survival, showing approximately 10% increase in ONL thickness in cKO animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Since systemic or intravitreal glutamate supplementation has demonstrated retinal toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sisk &amp; Kuwabara, 1985</xref>), and Asp concentration is normally low in plasma with poor cellular membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sullivan et al., 2018</xref>), we investigated other NEAA approaches to rescue the PR degeneration observed in the GLS cKO mouse. The potential of asparagine (Asn) to rescue PR degeneration was chosen due to the growing list of Asn-mediated cellular processes that improve cancer cell survival and growth under metabolic stress, such as Gln deprivation. These Asn-mediated cellular processes include inhibiting ISR-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>),(1) promoting protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pavlova et al., 2018</xref>), and maintaining Asp pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Halbrook et al., 2022</xref>). All these processes may be relevant to the PR degeneration observed in the cKO mouse. Following administration of systemic Asn (200 mg/kg) daily starting at P5, <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of retinal structure via OCT and histology at P21 demonstrated a significant improvement in ONL thickness compared to animals treated with vehicle, with a 22-26% increase in ONL thickness in some retinal locations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref> and <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the importance of Gln catabolism in PR metabolism, function, and survival <italic>in vivo</italic>. Rod PRs lacking GLS demonstrated rapid and complete degeneration with concomitant functional loss. Mechanistically, lack of GLS-initiated Gln catabolism in rod PRs, specifically, resulted in changes in redox homeostasis and a decrease in the fractional labeling of TCA cycle intermediates from stable isotope-labeled Gln <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, Gln anaplerosis did not appear to be driving the TCA cycle as targeted metabolomics showed few changes in the relative levels of TCA cycle intermediates, and supplementation with αKG showed a modest rescue effect in PR degeneration. The NEAAs Glu and Asp were found to be significantly decreased in the cKO mouse retina, and in accordance with this AA deprivation, the ISR was upregulated with a reduction in global protein synthesis suggesting Gln catabolism in rod PRs plays a significant role in supporting biomass production via NEAA synthesis. Interestingly, supplementing cKO mice with Asn significantly rescued PR degeneration, revealing a novel link between Gln and Asn metabolism in PRs. This work further demonstrates that PRs have the flexibility to utilize fuel sources other than glucose to meet their metabolic needs and that Gln is a critical amino acid that supports PR cell biomass, redox balance, and survival.</p>
<p>The rapid degenerative phenotype observed with conditional deletion of <italic>Gls</italic> in rod PRs was unexpected considering glucose is viewed as the primary substrate for the retina and PRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Swarup et al., 2019</xref>). The <italic>Gls</italic> cKO mouse demonstrated comparable ONL thickness to WT controls at P14 with approximately 50% loss of PR cell bodies by P21 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3A-B</xref>) and near complete PR degeneration by P84 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, conditional deletion of numerous enzymes within central glucose metabolism, including hexokinase 2 (HK2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Weh et al., 2020</xref>), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wubben et al., 2017</xref>), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Daniele et al., 2022</xref>), mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>), and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rajala et al., 2023</xref>), results in a slower, age-related degeneration. For example, loss of GLUT1 in the retina and rod PRs does not demonstrate 50% thinning of the ONL until approximately 4 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Daniele et al., 2022</xref>), and the others noted above demonstrate even slower outer retinal degeneration. It has also been shown that PRs can utilize fatty acid β-oxidation for energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Joyal et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, in retinas lacking the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), which facilitates fatty acid uptake, the PRs remained largely intact. In any of these transgenic mouse models, PRs may use other transporters to take up fatty acids or glucose, rewire their metabolism, or utilize metabolic redundancies to maintain metabolic homeostasis and stave off degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Subramanya et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wubben et al., 2017</xref>). Our data show that any metabolic reprogramming that is occurring in the cKO mouse retina appears unable to significantly circumvent the significant and rapid PR degeneration suggesting the importance of Gln catabolism in rod PRs. Furthermore, inducing GLS knockdown in mature PRs also demonstrated rapid PR degeneration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Traditionally, it has been thought that Gln maintains cell survival through Gln-derived α-KG and maintenance of the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).(1) While stable isotope tracing with uniformly labeled Gln demonstrated a reduction in fractional labeling of the TCA cycle intermediates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), targeted metabolomics showed few changes in the relative levels of the intermediates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and supplementation with αKG did not rescue PR degeneration to a large degree (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Gln is also required for the biosynthesis of NEAAs, and the NEAAs Glu and Asp were reduced nearly two-fold in the retina of cKO mouse (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Glu is the product of the GLS reaction so it is not surprising that Glu was substantially reduced. Glu is involved in glutathione biosynthesis directly and indirectly, can be converted into α-KG to enter the TCA cycle, and is crucial for the biosynthesis of NEAAs including Asp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). Alterations in redox homeostasis were observed in the retina of the cKO mouse in accordance with the reduced level of Glu (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). While these redox imbalances likely contribute to the PR degeneration observed, it is unlikely these small but statistically significant changes fully account for the rapid and complete PR degeneration. Future rescue studies with antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine, are needed to shed light on the role of redox imbalance in this novel transgenic mouse model.</p>
<p>Previous <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies demonstrated that Gln can contribute carbons to Asp synthesis via the TCA cycle and/or contribute a nitrogen via glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminases (Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Lindsay, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2020</xref>), the latter of which have been shown to be critical in the Gln metabolic rewiring of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Son et al., 2013</xref>) and more recently, in rod PR metabolism, function, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Subramanya et al., 2023</xref>). Our data shows that Gln-derived carbons via Glu are entering the TCA cycle <italic>in vivo</italic> and contributing to the synthesis of Asp (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), and this contribution is reduced in the cKO mouse retina. Based on the previous studies noted above, Gln may also be contributing to Asp synthesis via the glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase catalyzed transfer of a nitrogen from Glu. Future studies using amine-labeled Gln are needed to dissect the contributions of Gln-derived carbon versus nitrogen to the synthesis of Asp in the retina <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Asp is a proteinogenic amino acid that has many biosynthetic roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alkan et al., 2018</xref>), and <italic>ex vivo</italic> neural retina studies have suggested that the retina needs Asp to maintain its metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In accordance with this data, Asp was one of the few metabolites that was significantly reduced in the retina of cKO mouse prior to rapid PR degeneration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Based on <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies, it has been postulated that Asp utilization in the retina is necessary to maintain aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism through the recycling of NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup>, shuttling electrons into the mitochondria via the malate-aspartate shuttle, replenishing oxaloacetate for biosynthesis and/or producing pyruvate via malic enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Our <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolomics data further support this last point as uniformly labeled Gln contributed to m+3 pyruvate in the retina possibly via the decarboxylation of m+4 malate by malic enzyme (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). The m+4 isotopologue of malate could arise from m+4 Asp via glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) as part of the malate-aspartate shuttle. Furthermore, the decarboxylation of malate by malic enzyme produces pyruvate and also NADPH. A previous study revealed high malic enzyme activity in the retina and suggested it is capable of producing NADPH in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Winkler et al., 1986</xref>). The observation that malate was reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and the NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH ratio was increased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) in the cKO retina further supports a metabolic pathway in PRs where the Gln carbon skeleton is converted into Asp, then OAA, malate, and finally, pyruvate via the cytosolic enzymes of the malate-aspartate shuttle and malic enzyme. This non-canonical Gln metabolism pathway is also necessary to sustain cancer cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Son et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The m+4 isotopologue of oxaloacetate (OAA) can also be converted to m+3 pyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). A recent <italic>ex vivo</italic> study postulated that PRs can utilize different metabolic cycles, such as the Cahill cycle or mini-Krebs cycle, to uncouple glycolysis from oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2024</xref>). These cycles are fueled by Gln and require PEPCK to replenish pyruvate from OAA. While the lack of m+4 citrate in both the P14 WT and cKO retina and decrease in m+2 citrate in the cKO retina (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 2</xref>) may further support the existence of these previously postulated metabolic cycles, which avoid the citrate synthase step of the TCA cycle as well as others, further studies are needed to confirm the activity of these pathways in the retina and specifically, the PRs.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we did not observe any significant changes in glycolysis or mitochondrial function in the cKO retina despite a reduction in the relative level of Asp. It is hypothesized that Asp catabolism sustains glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the retina by recycling NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> and shuttling electrons into the mitochondria via the malate-aspartate shuttle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2020</xref>). However, in the GLS cKO retina, the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio (<italic>P</italic> = 0.125) and its oft-used proxy, the pyruvate/lactate ratio (<italic>P</italic> = 0.192), were not statistically significantly altered. Compensatory metabolic rewiring, which has been seen in other conditional knockout mouse models using the same Cre-recombinase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Subramanya et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wubben et al., 2017</xref>), may be maintaining the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio in the cKO retina at P14 when there are equal numbers of PRs in the WT and cKO retina. To this end, the expression of the <italic>Mdh1</italic> gene, which is a component of the malate-aspartate shuttle that recycles NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> in the cytoplasm, was upregulated in the cKO retina (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). The conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to glycerol 3-phosphate via glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is an alternative pathway to regenerate NAD<sup>+</sup>. DHAP levels were significantly reduced in the cKO retina possibly suggesting increased activity of this pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Yet, the gene expression and activity of glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the retina has been shown to be low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adler &amp; Klucznik, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Voigt et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Asp is also the immediate precursor to Asn. Intracellular levels of Asn are the lowest among the NEAAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), so it was not surprising that Asn was below the level of confident detection in our targeted metabolomics analyses on the WT or cKO retina. Asn had been shown to rescue cancer cells from ISR-induced apoptosis, increase protein synthesis during Gln deprivation, and protect the Asp pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Halbrook et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pavlova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). As metabolic similarities exist between PRs and cancer cells (Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ng et al., 2015</xref>), and the <italic>Gls</italic> cKO mouse retina demonstrated ISR activation and apoptosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1I</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C-6D</xref>), decreased protein synthesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), and decreased Asp (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), Asn supplementation was explored and proved effective as observed in the rescue of PR degeneration in the cKO mouse (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). These results offer the first evidence for a role of Asn downstream of Gln metabolism in PR survival, but further studies are necessary to define which of the Asn-mediated processes is crucial for PR neuroprotection following targeted <italic>Gls</italic> knockout. Of note, while Asn supplementation provided a greater PR neuroprotective effect than α-KG, the two supplements had different routes of administration with Asn being provided intraperitoneally as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Xu et al., 2021</xref>) and α-KG being provided in the drinking water as had previously improved PR survival in a mouse model of inherited retinal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wert et al., 2020</xref>). It is unclear if supplementing α-KG to GLS cKO animals intraperitoneally would further boost retinal protection. Yet, the relative abundance of α-KG and most other TCA cycle intermediates were unchanged between WT and cKO retinas suggesting Gln may not be driving the TCA cycle in PRs.</p>
<p>The ISR is activated with reduced global protein synthesis in the <italic>Gls</italic> cKO mouse retina (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>) and inhibiting the ISR with ISRIB delayed PR degeneration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). ISR activation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including retinal degenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gorbatyuk et al., 2020</xref>). Chronic activation of the ISR and protein synthesis attenuation has been observed in a multitude of preclinical models of retinal degeneration and shown to contribute to PR degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gorbatyuk et al., 2020</xref>). Metabolic dysfunction and deprivation of key nutrients, such as glucose and amino acids, are not only known stressors that activate the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>), but also underlying mechanisms of PR degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ait-Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Caruso et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pan et al., 2021</xref>). There is a paucity of studies that examine the link between metabolism and the ISR in retinal degenerative disease, which is a critical gap in our knowledge since identification of molecular and metabolic pathways triggering PR death is likely to reveal novel targets for therapeutic intervention. A recent study demonstrated that imbalanced pro-apoptotic ISR signaling contributes to deoxysphingolipid-mediated toxicity in retinal disease and identified potential therapeutic strategies, such as pharmacologic enhancement of ATF6 activity or treatment with ATF6-regulated neurotrophic factor MANF, that attenuate the associated retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rosarda et al., 2023</xref>). The novel transgenic mouse model of retinal degeneration described here provides a unique tool to obtain further insight on the nexus of metabolism, ISR activation, and protein synthesis attenuation in PR degeneration to identify pharmacologically and metabolically tractable nodes for therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>Collectively, our results indicate that Gln is critical for maintaining the pools of key biosynthetic precursors, Glu and Asp, in rod PRs and disrupting Gln catabolism results in profound loss of PR function and survival in part secondary to an imbalance in ISR activation and protein synthesis attenuation. Glucose remains central in PR metabolism, but improving our understanding of other metabolic pathways that support PR function and survival and how these metabolic pathways connect with cell death mechanisms could be transformative for preventing PR degeneration and vision loss in a multitude of retinal degenerative diseases.</p>

<title>Ideas and Speculation</title>
<p>Beyond glucose, the metabolic pathways integral to photoreceptor health remain largely unknown. This is a critical knowledge gap as identification of these pathways is likely to reveal new strategies for therapeutic intervention. This work demonstrates that rod photoreceptors depend on glutamine catabolism and suggests a metabolic axis where glutamine catabolism in rod photoreceptors supports the production of aspartate and asparagine to promote anabolism and prevent signaling through the pro-apoptotic integrated stress response pathway. Considering activation of the integrated stress response is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic dysfunction underlies photoreceptor degeneration, defining the pathways by which glutamine catabolism contributes to photoreceptor health is likely to identify nodes that may be targeted to make photoreceptors less vulnerable to stress.</p>

<title>Metabolomics</title>
<p>For unlabeled targeted metabolomics, both retinas from a single animal were rinsed in PBS, combined, and snap-frozen on dry ice. Metabolites were extracted using 80% methanol at −80°C and an OMNI Bead Ruptor (OMNI International, Kennesaw, GA, USA, Cat # 19-050A). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 x RCF for 10 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatant stored at −80°C until being processed in the SpeedVac. The pellet from each sample was saved for protein estimation. To determine the protein concentration for each sample, 150 µL of 0.1 M NaOH was added to the pellet for 24 hours at 37°C. The sample was then vortexed and centrifuged at 5000 x RCF at room temperature. The protein estimation was performed as described above. The protein concentration of each sample was used to normalize amount of sample for lyophilization with a SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # 13875355). Dried metabolite pellets were resuspended for liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis using an Agilent Technologies Triple Quad 6470 instrument (Santa Clara, CA, USA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wubben et al., 2020</xref>). Previously published parameters were used for data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). Agilent MassHunter Workstation Quantitative Analysis Software (B0900) was used to process raw data. Additional statistical analyses were performed in Microsoft Excel. Each sample was normalized by the total intensity of all metabolites to reflect sample protein content. To obtain relative metabolites, each metabolite abundance level in each sample was divided by the mean of the abundance levels across all control samples.</p>
<p>To analyze the incorporation of non-radioactive stable isotope carbon-13 (<sup>13</sup>C) into metabolites in central carbon metabolism and related pathways, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 2g/kg of uniformly labeled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cat # CLM-1396) or 300 mg/kg of uniformly labeled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-glutamine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cat # CLM-1822-H) and retinas were harvested 45 minutes later and snap-frozen as described above.

<title>BaroFuse</title>
<p>Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was determine as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kamat et al., 2023</xref>). Briefly, a BaroFuse (Entox Sciences, Mercer Island, WA) was used to determine the OCR of freshly isolated retinas. Single, whole retinas were dissected into Hank’s Balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.1 g/ 100 mL BSA (HBSS, Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA, Cat # SH30031FS). Perifusion media consisted of commercial Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate buffer (KRB, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # J67795.K2) supplemented with 0.1g /100 mL fatty-acid free BSA (Millipore-Sigma, Cat # A9647) and 4.4 mM glucose, for a final concentration of 5.5 mM glucose (Millipore-Sigma, Cat # G8270). The oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of the perifusion media is maintained by saturating the solution in a 21% oxygen, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, and the temperature was maintained at 37°C throughout the experiment. At various times throughout the experiment Oligomycin-A (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, Cat # 11342), FCCP (Trifluoromethoxy carbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone, Cayman Chemical, Cat# 15218), and KCN (Potassium Cyanide, Thermo Fisher, Cat # 012136) were added to the perifusion media through an injection port.

<title>NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH and NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH Measurements</title>
<p>The NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH and NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH measurements were conducted using the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH-Glo Assay (Promega, Cat # G9071) and NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH-Glo Assay (Promega, Cat # G9081), respectively, following manufacturer’s instructions in whole retina from P14 WT and cKO mice. Briefly, two fresh retina per mouse were harvested for each sample in 150 µL of PBS/Bicarbonate/0.5%dodecyltrimethylammonimum bromide (DTAB) buffer. DTAB is used in the buffer to preserve dinucleotide stability. The samples were sonicated (20% strength and 1sec/10 iterations) to create a uniform suspension and diluted with 150 µL of PBS/Bicarbonate/0.5% DTAB buffer (lysate). For measuring NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADP<sup>+</sup>, 150 µL of lysate was mixed with 75 µL of 0.4N HCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # A144) and heated to 60°C for 15 minutes. The lysate mixture was cooled to room temperature for 10 min and then neutralized by adding 150 µL 0.5M Trizma base (Millipore-Sigma, Cat # T1503). For measuring NADH/NADPH, the remaining 150 µL of lysate was heated to 60°C for 15 minutes, cooled to room temperature for 10 min and 150 µL 0.5M Trizma base was added to the sample. Following lysate preparation, 50 µL of lysate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 50 µL of either the NAD+/NADP+-Glo or NADH/NAPDH-Glo detection reagent in a 96-well white walled tissue culture plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # 3610).

<p>(A) ISRIB (2.5 mg/kg) or vehicle (50% PEG 400, 43.4% saline and 6.6% DMSO) was delivered intraperitoneally in WT mice starting at P5. Total retinal (TRT), outer nuclear layer (ONL) and the inner segment/outer segment thickness were measured at P21 by OCT. N=3 animals per group. (B) ONL thickness at P28 in cKO mice as assessed by OCT following intraperitoneal injection of ISRIB (2.5 mg/kg) or vehicle (50% PEG 400, 43.4% saline and 6.6% DMSO) from P5-P28. N=4-5 animals per group. Statistical differences in (A) and (B) are based on an unpaired two-tail Student’s t-test where *P &lt;0.05 and **P&lt;0.01. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show for the first time that deleting GLS from rod photoreceptors results in the rapid death of these cells. The death of photoreceptor cells could result from loss of synaptic activity because of a decrease in glutamate, as has been shown in neurons, changes in redox balance, or nutrient deprivation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this manuscript is that the author shows a similar phenotype in the mice when Gls was knocked out early in rod development or the adult rod. They showed that rapid cell death is through apoptosis, and there is an increase in the expression of genes responsive to oxidative stress.</p>

<p>The authors addressed all of my concerns in their responses to reviewers.</p>

<p>Photoreceptor neurons are crucial for vision, and discovering pathways necessary for photoreceptor health and survival can open new avenues for therapeutics. Studies have shown that metabolic dysfunction can cause photoreceptor degeneration and vision loss, but the metabolic pathways maintaining photoreceptor health are not well understood.

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show for the first time that deleting GLS from rod photoreceptors results in the rapid death of these cells. The death of photoreceptor cells could result from loss of synaptic activity because of a decrease in glutamate, as has been shown in neurons, changes in redox balance, or nutrient deprivation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this manuscript is that the author shows a similar phenotype in the mice when Gls was knocked out early in rod development or the adult rod. They showed that rapid cell death is through apoptosis, and there is an increase in the expression of genes responsive to oxidative stress.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their time reviewing the manuscript and their comments regarding the potential mechanism(s) by which rod photoreceptors rapidly degenerate upon knockout of GLS.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors show a &quot;metabolic dependency of photoreceptors on glutamine catabolism in vivo&quot;. However, there is a potential bias in their thinking that glutamine metabolism in rods is similar to cancer cells where it feeds into the TCA cycle. They should consider that as in neurons, GLS1 activity provides glutamate for synaptic transmission. The modest rescue shown by providing α-ketoglutarate in the drinking water suggests that glutamine isn't a key metabolic substrate for rods when glucose is plentiful. The ERG studies performed on the iCre-Glsflox/flox mice showed a large decrease in the scotopic b wave at saturating flashes which could indicate a decrease in glutamate at the rod synapse as stated by the authors. While EM micrographs of wt and iCre-Glsflox/flox mice were shown for the outer retina at p14, the synapse of the rods needs to be examined by EM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that in the presence of sufficient glucose, it appears a lack of GLS-driven glutamine (Gln) catabolism does not drastically alter the levels of TCA cycle metabolites or mitochondrial function as we demonstrated in Figure 4, and supplementation with alpha-ketoglutarate improved outer nuclear layer thickness by only a small amount as observed in Figure 5e. Hence, as we stated in the Results and Discussion, at least in the mouse where <italic>Gls</italic> is selectively deleted from rod photoreceptors by crossing <italic>Gls<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with <italic>Rho-Cre</italic> mice (<italic>Gls<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic><italic>;</italic> <italic>Rho-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>,</italic> cKO), Gln’s role in supporting the TCA cycle is not the major mechanism by which rod photoreceptors utilize Gln to suppress apoptosis.</p>
<p>With regards to GLS-driven Gln catabolism providing glutamate (Glu) for synaptic transmission, we again agree with the reviewer that Glu is an important excitatory neurotransmitter, but it is also a key metabolite necessary for the synthesis of glutathione, amino acids, and proteins. As noted and discussed at length in the manuscript, a lack of GLS-driven Gln catabolism in rod photoreceptors leads to reduced levels of oxidized glutathione (Figure 4D) possibly signaling an overall reduction in the biosynthesis of glutathione as Glu is directly and indirectly responsible for its synthesis. Furthermore, Gln and GLS-derived Glu play a central role in the biosynthesis of several nonessential amino acids and proteins. To this end, we see a reduction in the level of Glu, which is the product of the GLS reaction and further confirms the loss of GLS function. We also noted a significant decrease in aspartate (Asp), which can be constructed from the carbons and nitrogens of Gln as discussed at length in the manuscript (Figure 6A). Finally, we noted a significant decrease in global protein synthesis in the cKO retina as compared to the wild-type animal as well (Figure 6E). Therefore, the data suggest that GLS-driven Gln catabolism is critical for amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis and to some degree redox balance; although, the small but statistically significant changes in oxidized glutathione, NADP/NADPH, and redox gene expression may not fully account for the rapid and complete photoreceptor degeneration observed. Future studies are necessary to shed light on the role of redox imbalance in this novel transgenic mouse model.</p>
<p>Glu also plays a role in synaptic transmission, and we considered this scenario as described in Figure 1 – figure supplement 5. Here, the synaptic connectivity between photoreceptors and the inner retina did not demonstrate significant differences in the labeling of photoreceptor synaptic membranes in the outer plexiform layer nor alterations in the labeling of a key protein (Bassoon) in ribbon synapses. These data suggest that the synaptic connectivity between photoreceptors and second-order neurons was unaltered at P14 in the cKO retina, which is the time just prior to rapid photoreceptor degeneration when Glu was shown to be decreased (Figure 6A).</p>
<p>With regards to the ERG changes noted in Figure 2, we agree with the reviewer that a large decrease was noted in the scotopic b-wave at P21 and P42 in the cKO. We also agree, that to obtain greater insight into these ERG changes, the ribbon synapse in EM images can be examined. The EM images shown in Figure 1 – figure supplement 4 are from P21, which coincide with the age at which the ERG changes were first noted and when significant photoreceptor degeneration has already occurred. These images were utilized to assess the ribbon synapse for the revised version of the manuscript. As now shown in Figure 1 – figure supplement 4D, ribbon synapses are intact in WT animals as denoted by the yellow boxes. Similarly, the ribbons (yellow arrows) appear structurally intact in the photoreceptors that remain in the P21 cKO retina. These results are in accordance with the lack of significant differences in the labeling of photoreceptor synaptic membranes in the outer plexiform layer as well as the lack of alterations in the labeling of a key protein (Bassoon) in ribbon synapses (Figure 1-figure supplement 5A and B).  While we cannot fully rule out that the decrease in glutamate is altering synaptic transmission, our structural data suggests the synapses remain intact. These data have been added to the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>However, an even larger reduction in the scotopic a-wave was noted at these ages as well. In animal models that disrupt photoreceptor synaptic function (Dick et al. Neuron. 2003; Johnson et al. J Neuroscience. 2007; Haeseleer et al. Nature Neuroscience. 2004; Chang et al. Vis Neurosci. 2006), a more negative ERG pattern is typically observed with the b-wave altered to a much larger degree than the a-wave. Additionally, in these models that disrupt photoreceptor synaptic transmission, the overall structure of the retina with respect to thickness is maintained (Dick et al. Neuron. 2003) or noted to have modest changes in the outer plexiform layer within the first two months of age with the outer nuclear layer not significantly altered until 8-10 months of age (Haeseleer et al. Nature Neuroscience. 2004). In contrast, a rapid decline in the outer nuclear layer thickness was observed in the cKO retina after P14 likely contributing to the ERG changes noted in Figure 2. Also, Gln is catabolized to Glu primarily by GLS as suggested by the approximately 50% reduction in Glu levels in the cKO retina (Figure 6A), but other enzymes are also capable of catabolizing Gln to Glu, so Glu levels in the rod photoreceptors are unlikely to be zero. Coupling this with the fact that rods are equipped with a self-sufficient Glu recollecting system at their synaptic terminals (Hasegawa et al. Neuron. 2006; Winkler et al. Vis Neurosci. 1999) and that GLS activity is at least two-fold higher in the photoreceptor inner segments, which support energy production and metabolism, than any other layer in the retina (Ross et al. Brain Res. 1987) suggests that altered synaptic transmission secondary to reduced levels of Glu likely does not account in full for the rapid and robust photoreceptor degeneration observed in the cKO retina.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors note that the outer segments are shorter but they do not address whether there is a decrease in the number of cones.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have adjusted Figure 2E by removing the GLS staining to better highlight the secondary degeneration of cone outer segments, the main point of the Figure, as we had already shown that GLS was cleanly knocked out of rod photoreceptors in Figure 1. Furthermore, qualitatively the number of cones appears the same at P14, P21, and P42 between the WT and cKO, which is consistent with other retinal degeneration models, like <italic>rd1</italic> and <italic>rd10</italic>, where cones do not begin to die until all the rods have degenerated (Xue et al. eLife. 2021).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Rod-specific Gls ko mice with an inducible promoter were generated by crossing the Pde6g-CreERT2 and homozygous for either the WT or floxed Gls allele (IND-cKO). In Figure 3 the authors document that by western blots and antibody labeling the GLS1 expression is lost in the IND-cKO 10 days post tamoxifen. OCT images show a decrease in the thickness of the outer nuclear layer between 17 and 38 days post-TAM. Ergs should be performed on the animals at 10 and 30 days post TAM, before and after major structural changes in rod photoreceptor cells, to determine if changes in light-stimulated responses are observed. These studies could help to parse out the cause of photoreceptor cell death.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the IND-cKO is a useful tool to help parse out the cause of photoreceptor cell death in this model as well as shed light on the role of GLS-driven Gln catabolism in photoreceptor synaptic transmission as discussed at length above. Hence, ERG analyses were performed 10 days post TAM, before major structural changes in the ONL are observed. Interestingly, ERG demonstrated statistically significant reductions in the IND-cKO scotopic a- and b-waves as compared to the WT 10 days post TAM. Similarly, photopic ERG demonstrated statistically significant decreases in the b-wave of the IND-cKO retina. These data suggest that GLS-driven Gln catabolism plays a significant role not only in rod photoreceptor survival but their function as well. This data has been added to Figure 3H-I and discussed in the corresponding manuscript text.</p>
<p>To this end, as discussed below and added to Figure 6 – figure supplement 1, amino acid levels, including glutamate (Glu), are already reduced 10 days post TAM. Reductions in the level of Glu may impact synaptic transmission and as a result, the scotopic b-wave. However, as noted above, altered synaptic transmission secondary to reduced levels of Glu likely does not account in full for the rapid and robust photoreceptor degeneration observed in the cKO retina as the b-wave to a-wave ratio is not significantly altered in the IND-cKO retina as compared to the WT retina, suggesting GLS-driven Gln catabolism is impairing both to a similar degree.</p>
<p>Additionally, <italic>Pde6g</italic> is expressed by rods to a significant degree but also by cones (GSE63473, scRNAseq data). Therefore, the IND-cKO mouse likely knocks out GLS from both rods and cones, which is in accordance with the immunofluorescence image in Figure 3B where GLS is not observed in rod or cone inner segments unlike in Figure 1B where GLS remains in cones. Hence, the reduction in photopic b-wave may be demonstrating that GLS-driven Gln catabolism in cones impairs synaptic transmission. As noted in our reply to reviewer #3’s comments, we have generated mice lacking GLS in cone photoreceptors specifically and are currently elucidating the role of GLS in cone photoreceptor metabolism, function, and survival. These results will be published in a separate manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The studies in Figure 4 were all performed on iCre-Glsflox/flox and control mice at p14, why weren't the IND-cKO mice used for these studies since the findings would not be confounded by development?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To gain further insight into the role of GLS-driven Gln catabolism in the maintenance of rod photoreceptors as compared to their development/maturation, we conducted a targeted metabolomic analysis on IND-cKO and WT retinas 10 days post TAM. For the purpose of this manuscript, we have included data regarding changes in amino acid levels in Figure 6 – figure supplement 1. Specifically, levels of glutamate, aspartate and asparagine are all significantly decreased in the IND-cKO retina prior to PR degeneration, which demonstrates that similar to the GLS cKO mouse (i.e. iCre-Gls flox/flox), GLS-driven Gln catabolism is critical for amino acid biosynthesis in mature rod PRs as well.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In all rescue studies, the endpoint was an ONL thickness, which only addressed rod cell death. The authors should also determine whether there are small improvements in the ERG, which would distinguish the role of GLS in preventing oxidative stress.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides a sensitive in vivo method to detect small changes in retinal thickness without potential artifacts incurred through histological processing. Considering the <italic>Gls</italic> cKO retina demonstrates significant and rapid photoreceptor degeneration, we wanted to assess pathways that may be critical to photoreceptor survival downstream of GLS-driven Gln catabolism using rescue experiments with pharmacologic treatment or metabolite supplementation. That said, disruption of GLS-driven Gln catabolism may also significantly alter rod photoreceptor function beyond that which is secondary to photoreceptor cell death as we have demonstrated in the IND-cKO animal for the revised version of this manuscript and discussed in a response above. Therefore, the IND-cKO model provides a unique tool to assess the impact of rescue studies on photoreceptor function as the functional changes occur prior to significant degeneration. Also, unlike the GLS cKO mouse (i.e. iCre-Gls flox/flox) where photoreceptor degeneration starts very early, impairing our ability to capture reliable and robust ERG measurements, the IND-cKO mice are older at the time of functional changes allowing for robust ERG measurements. While the rate of photoreceptor degeneration in both mouse models is similar and the levels of key amino acids are altered similarly in both models, the mechanisms of cell death in developing/maturing photoreceptors may be different than that in mature photoreceptors. Hence, before we can assess if similar rescue experiments impact photoreceptor function via ERG in the IND-cKO mouse, we need to thoroughly examine how these photoreceptors are dying. These experiments and results will be published in a separate manuscript in the future.</p>

<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful comments and time spent reviewing this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Recent studies have explored the metabolic &quot;crosstalk&quot; that exists within the mammalian retina, where metabolites are transferred between the various retinal cells and the retinal pigment epithelium. It would be of interest to test whether the conditional knockout mice have changes in metabolism (via qPCR such as shown in Figure 4 - Supplemental Figure 1) within the retinal pigment epithelium that may be contributing to the authors' findings in the neural retina. Additionally, the authors have very compelling data to show that inhibition of eIF2a or supplementation with asparagine can delay photoreceptor death via OCT measurements in their conditional knockout mouse model (Figure 6G, H). However, does inhibition of eIF2a or asparagine adversely impact the WT retina? It would also be impactful to know whether this has a prolonged effect, or if it is short-term, as this would provide strength to potential therapeutic targeting of these pathways to maintain photoreceptor health.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that metabolic communication in the outer retina is crucial to the function and survival of both photoreceptors and RPE. Therefore, we have performed qRT-PCR on eyecups from cKO and WT mice at P14, prior to photoreceptor degeneration. These data, now included in Figure 4 – figure supplement 2, show no significant changes in genes related to glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism and the TCA cycle in eyecups from cKO mice compared to WT mice at P14. The only exception is a significant decrease in <italic>Pdk4</italic> in cKO mouse eyecups compared to WT, which was not observed in retina samples.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have added data demonstrating that systemic treatment with ISRIB does not adversely impact the anatomy of the wild-type retina. Specifically, we performed OCT after 21 days of ISRIB treatment via intraperitoneal delivery in WT mice and show that total retinal, ONL and inner segment/outer segment thickness is unchanged compared to vehicle. These data are now included in Figure 6 – figure supplement 2A. We have also included data to suggest that the effect of ISRIB extends beyond P21 in the cKO mouse. This data, presented in Figure 6 – figure supplement 2B, shows that at P28, ISRIB continues to statistically significantly increase ONL thickness compared to vehicle in cKO animals.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that the downstream metabolic and molecular mechanisms by which Gln catabolism impacts rod photoreceptor health are not fully elucidated. Defining these mechanisms will advance our understanding of photoreceptor metabolism and identify therapeutic targets promoting photoreceptor resistance to stress. Future studies are underway to uncover these mechanisms. Additionally, while outside the scope of the current manuscript, we have generated mice lacking GLS in cone photoreceptors specifically and are currently elucidating the role of GLS in cone photoreceptor metabolism, function, and survival.

<p>(1) The results could start at line 135, but the first paragraph isn't necessary. The data is published and could be referred to in the introduction.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to shorten the beginning of the Results section; however, we believe the supplementary data, which is described in these lines, confirms the scRNAseq gene expression data, while adding GLS expression and localization data within the retina. The scRNAseq data and its publication was noted in the introduction, so we removed the sentence in line 117-119 that restates these results to shorten this section. We also reduced redundancy by removing an introductory sentence to the second Results paragraph.</p>

<p>(2) &quot;However, like other metabolically-demanding cells, recent work has demonstrated that PRs have the flexibility to utilize fuel sources beyond glucose to meet their metabolic needs (Adler et al., 2014; Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; Grenell et al., 2019; Joyal et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2020).&quot; The paper by Daniele et al. demonstrated that glucose is essential for maintaining the viability of rod photoreceptor cells.</p>

<p>(4) The immunolabeling in Figure 2 looks like the images are overexposed, and the Gls antibody is labeling the outer segment, not just the inner segment of photoreceptors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments regarding our immunofluorescence data. There was background staining of the outer segment in both the WT and cKO retina with decreased GLS staining in the inner segment of the cKO rod photoreceptors at P14 demonstrating loss of GLS in rod photoreceptors similar to Figure 1B.  For Figure 2E, we have provided adjusted images with PNA staining only that better represent the secondary cone degeneration that occurs in the rod photoreceptor-specific <italic>Gls</italic> cKO, which is the take home point of Figure 2E.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to assess glutamate levels in the wild-type and <italic>Gls</italic> KO retina via antibody labeling. Our targeted metabolomics studies in Figure 6A provide quantitative evidence that glutamate, the product of the GLS-catalyzed reaction, is decreased as one would expect in that <italic>Gls</italic> KO retina. The antibody would add to these data by providing the localization of glutamate in the retina. With a rod photoreceptor-specific genetic KO, we would expect glutamate levels to be decreased in these cells. The antibody may also show that glutamate is not only decreased in the rod photoreceptor inner segment, where GLS predominates, but also in the synaptic terminal in accordance with the reviewer’s concerns regarding the impact of GLS KO on synaptic transmission. We have addressed this concern at length above, adding TEM images of the ribbon synapses in the GLS KO retina, and ERG analyses from the IND-cKO animals prior to significant degeneration. In the end, we agree with the reviewer that reduced Glu levels in the GLS cKO retina may impact synaptic transmission to a degree, but the synapses remain intact based on immunofluorescence and TEM analyses and a negative ERG pattern is not observed in the GLS cKO (i.e. iCre-Gls flox/flox) or IND-cKO mouse. As noted above, the structure of the retina in models that disrupt photoreceptor synaptic transmission is maintained (Dick et al. Neuron. 2003) or noted to have modest changes within the first two months of age with the outer nuclear layer not significantly altered until 8-10 months of age (Haeseleer et al. Nature Neuroscience. 2004). So, the impact of the reduced Glu levels on synaptic transmission in the GLS KO retina are unlikely to account in full for the rapid and profound photoreceptor degeneration observed. That said, the IND-cKO mouse, which allows us to assess photoreceptor function prior to significant degeneration unlike the GLS cKO mouse (i.e. iCre-Gls flox/flox), demonstrates GLS-driven Gln catabolism plays a significant role in photoreceptor function but still does not demonstrate a negative ERG pattern. Therefore, assessing Glu localization in this mouse model 10 days post TAM will be informative as to how GLS-driven Gln catabolism impacts photoreceptor function prior to degeneration. The IND-cKO mouse model is currently being extensively characterized for future publication.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Main Concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The authors checked for Gls2 compensation at P14 in the mouse retina. However, this data would be more compelling with an additional timepoint, particularly at P21 which is used in many of their figures throughout the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. Figure 1-figure supplement 1D demonstrates no change in <italic>Gls2</italic> gene expression at P14 between the WT and cKO retina. With regards to the reviewer’s concern, in Figure 1-figure supplement 1E of the original submission, we demonstrate that the expression of GLS2 is not increased in the cKO retina at P21 via immunofluorescence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Recent studies have explored the metabolic &quot;crosstalk&quot; that exists within the mammalian retina, where metabolites are transferred between the various retinal cells and the retinal pigment epithelium. It would be compelling to see whether the cKO mice have changes in metabolism (via qPCR such as shown in Supplementary Figure 1 for Figure 4) within the RPE that may be contributing to their findings in the neural retina. Additionally, mention of this crosstalk and how it may impact their results should be added to the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern for metabolism changes in the RPE of <italic>Gls</italic> cKO mice. In agreement with reviewer 2, we performed qRT-PCR on eyecups from cKO and WT mice at P14, prior to photoreceptor degeneration. These data, now included in Figure 4 – figure supplement 2, show no significant changes in genes related to glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism and the TCA cycle in eyecups from cKO mice compared to WT mice at P14. The only exception is a significant decrease in <italic>Pdk4</italic> in cKO mouse eyecups compared to WT, which was not observed in retina samples.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors use a tamoxifen-inducible cKO model to support their findings in developed rods. However, in Figure 3A it appears that this model has a greater reduction in GLS compared to the Rho-cre mouse model. Can the authors discuss this? Is this cre more efficient at targeting rods or is it leaky and may have affected other retinal cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this interesting result associated with using the <italic>Pde6g</italic>-Cre-ERT2 mouse line. <italic>Pde6g</italic> is expressed by rods to a significant degree but also by cones (GSE63473, scRNAseq data). Therefore, the IND-cKO mouse likely knocks out GLS from both rods and cones upon the TAM induction. To this end, the immunofluorescence image in Figure 3B shows GLS is knocked out in both rod or cone inner segments unlike in Figure 1B where GLS remains in cones when using the rod photoreceptor-specific, <italic>Gls<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> <italic>Rho-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup> mouse. As such, as the astute reviewer noted, the fact that Western blot demonstrates greater reduction in GLS protein content fits with the protein being knocked out of both rods and cones. We have added this note about the mouse model in the corresponding text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors have very compelling data to show that inhibition of eIF2a can delay photoreceptor death via OCT measurements in their cKO mouse model (Figure 6G). However, does ISRIB adversely impact the WT retina? WT vehicle and ISRIB should be shown. It would also be compelling to know whether this has a prolonged effect, or if it is short-term (i.e. would the effect still be present at P42)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments regarding antagonizing the effects of p-eIF2a to prolong photoreceptor survival in the <italic>Gls</italic> cKO retina. As described above, we have data demonstrating systemic treatment with ISRIB does not adversely impact the anatomy of the wild-type retina (Figure 6-figure supplement 2A). Specifically, we treated WT animals with daily intraperitoneal ISRIB starting at P5 and performed OCT at P21 to show that total retinal, ONL and the inner segment/outer segment thickness is unchanged compared to vehicle-treated WT animals. Additionally, we have included data demonstrating the photoreceptor neuroprotective effect of ISRIB treatment in the <italic>Gls</italic> cKO mouse extends beyond P21 in the cKO mouse (Figure 6-figure supplement 2B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) For Figure 6H, same as point #4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we have not specifically assessed potential retinal toxicity secondary to systemic Asn supplementation, oral Asn supplementation (up to 100mg/kg/day) was provided to patients for 24 months and found to be well-tolerated (PMID:31123592). Allometric scaling of this dose to the mouse would yield a mouse dose of 1234 mg/kg/day, which is much greater than the 200mg/kg/day dose provided here (PMID: 27057123). Additionally, a 90-day toxicity study of Asn in rats demonstrated a no observed adverse effect level of 1.62g/kg bodyweight/day in males and 1.73g/kg bodyweight/day in females (PMID: 18508175). The lower dose in that study equates to a mouse dose of 3.2g/kg bodyweight/day, well above the mouse dose utilized in this report. As such, future studies should focus on a dose-response relationship with Asn supplementation, and as the reviewer suggested, determining the duration of effect with Asn supplementation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggestions for improved or additional experiments, data, or analyses.</p>
<p>(1) Figure 6: ISRIB seems to give the most dramatic rescue of cKO GLS in P21 rods. Does it completely prevent rod death? i.e. What's the ONL thickness of P21 WT control? What's the ISRIB rescue of an older cKO animal, say P35?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The ONL thickness of P21 WT control is on average 0.06 mm (Figure 1E), while the ONL thickness of the <italic>Gls</italic> cKO retina with ISRIB treatment at P21 is on average 0.044 mm. Therefore, rod death is not completely prevented with ISRIB but rather, rod photoreceptor survival is prolonged. As noted above, we have provided data to demonstrate that the photoreceptor neuroprotective effect of ISRIB lasts beyond P21 (Figure 6-figure supplement 2B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) What's the mechanistic link between ISR and GLS beyond current speculation? Does GLS have other unknown functions beyond converting glutamine to glutamate? Any novel insights from GLS protein structure?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful question. It is certainly possible that GLS has other functions outside of its role in glutaminolysis. It is well known that other metabolic enzymes have moonlighting functions including hexokinase 2, which has been shown to be important in preventing intrinsic apoptosis through blocking the binding of pro-apoptotic proteins to the mitochondria. While not directly related to ISR, a single report suggests GLS functions non-canonically in Gln-deprived states, promoting mitochondrial fusion to suppress ROS production (PMID: 29934617). Investigating the moonlighting functions of metabolic enzymes is part of our ongoing research program and GLS is included in these studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Just curious about GLS cKO in cones. Any similar phenotype?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s curiosity regarding <italic>Gls</italic> cKO in cones and this study is currently ongoing with a poster presented at ARVO 2024 (Subramanya et al; Glutaminase-driven glutamine catabolism supports cone photoreceptor metabolism, function, and structure. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2024;65(7):193) and a manuscript in preparation. As discussed above, GLS knock out in cones likely impacts their function, in accordance with the data presented at ARVO 2024.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation.</p>
<p>(1) In the Discussion, lines 458-466, it's incorrect to compare the importance of glucose metabolism to GLS-dependent pathway to photoreceptors in this way. An alternative explanation: glucose metabolism is so important that the system has many redundancies, e.g. HK1 exists in addition to HK2, thus single gene KO leads to no phenotype. The only fair comparison is nutrient deprivation, e.g. taking out glucose or glutamine from retina explants (Punzo et al., 2009).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer makes an excellent point. While we do not see an upregulation of GLS2 in the retina or rod PRs upon GLS knockout (Figure 1-figure supplement 1 D and E), loss of <italic>Gls</italic> in rod PRs does alter the expression of many metabolism-related genes (Figure 4-figure supplement 1).  We alluded to these data and the reviewer’s point in the second paragraph of the discussion: “In any of these transgenic mouse models, PRs may use other transporters to take up fatty acids or glucose or rewire their metabolism to maintain metabolic homeostasis and stave off degeneration (Subramanya et al., 2023; Wubben et al., 2017). Our data show that any metabolic reprogramming that is occurring in the cKO mouse retina appears unable to significantly circumvent the significant and rapid PR degeneration suggesting the importance of Gln catabolism in rod PRs. Furthermore, inducing GLS knockdown in mature PRs also demonstrated rapid PR degeneration (Figure 3).”</p>
<p>In the revised article, we have amended these sentences to include the importance of metabolic redundancies. “In any of these transgenic mouse models, PRs may use other transporters to take up fatty acids or glucose, rewire their metabolism, or utilize metabolic redundancies to maintain metabolic homeostasis and stave off degeneration (Subramanya et al., 2023; Wubben et al., 2017). Our data show that any metabolic reprogramming that is occurring in the cKO mouse retina appears unable to significantly circumvent the significant and rapid PR degeneration suggesting the importance of Gln catabolism in rod PRs. Furthermore, inducing GLS knockdown in mature PRs also demonstrated rapid PR degeneration (Figure 3).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Please discuss the mosaic activity of Rho-cre used in this study, as described in the original study (Le et al 2006). Line 221 (Li et al 2005) seems to be a different <italic>Rho-Cre</italic> created by a different group. Please make sure the citation is correct and consistent.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion and have corrected the reference on line 221 to Le et al, 2006. The reviewer is correct that the original report (Le at al. 2006) demonstrated a mosaic of Cre-mediated recombination in rod photoreceptors and rod bipolar cells in the mouse line that had the shorter (0.2 kb) mouse opsin promoter-controlled Cre. In contrast, this same report showed only Cre-mediated recombination in rod photoreceptors in another line that utilized a long (4.1 kb) mouse opsin promoter-controlled Cre. We have published using this latter promoter-controlled Cre recombinase in at least 5 different mouse models (Wubben et al. 2017; Weh et al. 2020; Weh et al. 2023; Subramanya et al. 2023; the current report), and in all these models, we observe clear and consistent knockout by immunofluorescence only in rod photoreceptors with residual protein in cones and no significant change in protein expression in the INL where bipolar cells reside. Western blots confirm the reduction in protein expression.</p>
