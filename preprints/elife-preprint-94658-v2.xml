<title>Abstract</title><p>In the realm of cancer immunotherapy, the meticulous selection of neoantigens plays a fundamental role in enhancing personalized treatments. Traditionally, this selection process has heavily relied on predicting the binding of peptides to human leukocyte antigens (pHLA). Nevertheless, this approach often overlooks the dynamic interaction between tumor cells and the immune system. In response to this limitation, we have developed an innovative prediction algorithm rooted in machine learning, integrating T cell receptor β chain (TCRβ) profiling data from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients for a more precise neoantigen prioritization. TCRβ sequencing was conducted to profile the TCR repertoire of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from 28 CRC patients. The data unveiled both intra-tumor and inter-patient heterogeneity in the TCRβ repertoires of CRC patients, likely resulting from the stochastic utilization of V and J segments in response to neoantigens. Our novel combined model integrates pHLA binding information with pHLA-TCR binding to prioritize neoantigens, resulting in heightened specificity and sensitivity compared to models using individual features alone. The efficacy of our proposed model was corroborated through ELISpot assays on long peptides, performed on four CRC patients. These assays demonstrated that neoantigen candidates prioritized by our combined model outperformed predictions made by the established tool NetMHCpan. This comprehensive assessment underscores the significance of integrating pHLA binding with pHLA-TCR binding analysis for more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In metastatic CRC patients, immunotherapy has fulfilled promise in improving survival rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which block negative regulatory pathways in T-cell activation, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) CRC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). However, there is an urgent need for alternative immunotherapy strategies for metastatic CRC patients, as patients with proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) or microsatellite stability (MSS) have not shown significant responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>Neoantigens (neopeptides) have emerged as potential targets for personalized cancer immunotherapy, including CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Neoantigens are peptides that result from somatic mutations and can be displayed by class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA-I) molecules on the surface of cancer cells, thereby activating immune-mediated tumor killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of neoantigens is associated with better responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in CRC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). A high neoantigen burden has been linked to improved overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with various solid tumors, including CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Therefore, neoantigen-based immunotherapies are considered to have significant potential for improving treatment outcomes for CRC patients.</p>
<p>The successful development of neoantigen-based therapies hinges upon the identification of neoantigens that exhibit a strong binding affinity to their respective HLA-I molecules and demonstrate high immunogenicity. Initially, DNA sequencing of tumor tissues and paired Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells identifies cancer-associated genomic mutations. RNA sequencing then determines the patient’s HLA-I allele profile and the gene expression levels of mutated genes. <italic>In silico</italic> tools are then applied to analyze the tumor somatic variant, HLA-I allele, and gene expression data, predicting the binding affinity of neoantigens to the patient’s HLA-I alleles and their potential to activate T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). This standard workflow has been successful in identifying clinically relevant neoantigens in various malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>However, despite its achievements, the current approach’s impact on patient outcomes remains limited due to the scarcity of mutations in cancer patients that lead to effective immunogenic neoantigens. This limitation arises primarily from the fact that the selection of neoantigen candidates by these workflows relies solely on neoantigen-HLA-I binding affinity as the criteria for immunogenicity prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). While HLA-I binding is indeed a crucial factor for neoantigen presentation, it does not fully account for T cell receptor (TCR) recognition and interaction. The recognition of the neoantigen-HLA complex through TCR is of paramount importance for T cell activation and eliciting an immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Various factors, such as the specific TCR repertoire, TCR clonality, and the structural characteristics of the TCR-peptide-HLA complex, profoundly influence TCR recognition. Unfortunately, these critical aspects are not entirely captured by HLA-I binding prediction alone.</p>
<p>The TCR is a critical component of the adaptive immune system, responsible for recognizing specific antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This membrane-bound heterodimer protein complex is expressed on the surface of T cells and exists in two distinct forms: TCRα/TCRβ for αβ T cells and TCRγ/TCRδ for γδ T cells, both intricately associatedwith invariant CD3 chain molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). TCR diversity arises from the recombination of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes at the TCRβ and TCRδ loci, along with VJ recombination at the TCRα and TCRγ loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), giving rise to a broad array of unique TCRs collectively known as the TCR repertoire. The complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), situated at the junction of V, D, and J gene segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), plays a pivotal role in antigen recognition, with the unique combination of CDR3 sequences contributing significantly to the specificity and diversity of the TCR repertoire. With advancements in technology, TCR sequencing has become a powerful technique used to characterize the diversity and composition of TCR repertoires. Valuable information directly obtained through TCR sequencing, including TCR clonotype diversity, V(D)J gene usage, repertoire size, clonal expansion, and repertoire changes, has provided invaluable insights into immune responses, antigen recognition, and the development of targeted immunotherapies.</p>
<p>Sequencing the T cell receptors (TCRs) of TILs or lymphocytes found in peripheral blood provides crucial insights into the T-cell repertoire and their responses against neoantigens associated with tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). This information holds paramount importance in identifying TCRs that specifically target these neoantigens. Additionally, it proves to be invaluable in assessing the immunogenic potential of predicted neoantigens. Unfortunately, the current bioinformatic workflows used in neoantigen selection and prioritization do not incorporate TCR sequencing data. Therefore, we speculate that integrating TCR sequencing data into the assessment of immunogenicity of predicted neoantigens holds promise for unveiling effective neoantigens which can induce immune response, consequently, advancing the development of personalized immunotherapies for cancer.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we first performed TCR sequencing on frozen samples collected from CRC patients to profile TCRβ repertoire of tumor filtrating T cells. We next exploited the peptide-HLA (pHLA) and pHLA-TCR binding affinity of peptides with known immunogenicity status from six public databases including 10X Genomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), McPAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), PRIME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), VDJdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), IEDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) and TBAdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) to develop a predictive algorithm. Subsequently, we employed this algorithm to predict and rank neoantigens by using the TCRβ HLA types and mutation profiles identified from patients’ frozen tumor tissues. Finally, we experimentally verified the efficacy of our model by measuring the immunogenicity of the ranked peptides by an ELISpot assay.</p>

<title>Tumor biopsy and peripheral blood collection</title>
<p>Twenty-eight patients diagnosed with CRC were enrolled in this study at the University Medical Center in Ho Chi Minh City between June 2022 and May 2023. CRC confirmation was based on abnormal colonoscopies and histopathological analysis. The stages of CRC were determined according to guidelines provided by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union for Cancer Control (the eighth version) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Prior to participation, all patients provided written informed consent for tumor and whole blood sample collection. Relevant clinical data, including demographics, cancer stages, and pathology information, were extracted from the medical records of the University Medical Center. Detailed information regarding the clinical factors of the patients can be found in <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. For four patients, ten mL of peripheral blood was collected before surgery and stored in Heparin tubes prior isolation of PBMCs.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Targeted DNA, RNA and TCRβ sequencing</title>
<p>The DNA/RNA samples were isolated using either the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit or the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, Germany) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. In addition, matched genomic DNA from the white blood cells (WBC) of individuals was also extracted from the buffy coat using the GeneJET Whole Blood Genomic DNA Purification Mini kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA samples from the patients’s paired tumor tissues and WBCs were used to prepare DNA libraries for DNA sequencing with the ThruPLEX Tag-seq Kit (Takara Bio, USA). The libraries were then pooled and hybridized with pre-designed probes for 95 targeted genes (Integrated DNA Technologies, USA). This gene panel encompasses commonly mutated genes in CRC tumors, as reported in the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. The DNA libraries were then subjected to massive parallel sequencing on the DNBSEQ-G400 sequencer (MGI, Shenzhen, China) for paired-end reads of 2×100 bp with a sequencing depth of 10X.</p>
<p>Isolated total RNA was processed using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) to isolate intact poly(A)+ RNA following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). These libraries were subsequently sequenced for paired-end reads of 2×100 bp on an MGI system at a sequencing depth of 50X.</p>
<p>For TCRβ library construction, mRNA was utilized with the SMARTer Human TCR a/b Profiling Kit v2 (Takara, USA). The resulting libraries were sequenced for paired-end reads of 2×250 bp on an Illumina system at a sequencing depth of 7.5X.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Microsatellite instability status</title>
<p>Microsatellite instability (MSI) status was determined in both tumor DNA and corresponding DNA from blood, serving as the control, using the MSI Analysis System, version 1.2 (Promega, US). This analysis identified alterations in 5 mononucleotide repeat markers: BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24, and MONO-27. The results were classified as microsatellite stability (MSS) in cases where either none or only one marker was unstable. Samples showing alterations in two or more markers were categorized as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Variant calling from DNAseq and RNAseq data</title>
<p>The approach of integrating RNA-seq into calling variants was performed as described in our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Briefly, we used Dragen (Illumina) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) in tumor-normal mode to detect somatic mutations from DNAseq data. The default filtering thresholds of Dragen were applied for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels). SNPs were further filtered using the dbSNP and 1000 Genome datasets. Germline mutations in tumor tissues were identified by comparison with matched WBC DNA samples. Mutations within immunoglobulin and HLA genes were excluded due to alignment difficulties in these highly polymorphic regions, necessitating specialized analysis tools. Additionally, synonymous mutations were removed from downstream analysis. For analysis, we included somatic mutations that exceeded a minimum threshold of ≥2% variant allele frequency (VAF) in DNA extracted from fresh frozen tissues.</p>
<p>Sequencing reads underwent trimming using Trimmomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) and were then aligned to the human reference genome using STAR (version 2.6.0c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Prior to alignment, raw sequencing reads were subjected to quality checks using FastQC version 0.11.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). VarScan 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), , which accepts both DNA and RNAseq data, was employed to identify mutations in paired tumor and WBC samples across 95 cancer-associated genes. This analysis was carried out in tumor-normal mode. Four filtering steps were applied: (i) only calls with a PASS status were utilized, (ii) population SNPs overlapping with a panel of normal samples from the 1000 Genome dataset were excluded, (iii) somatic mutations included for analysis met a minimum threshold of ≥10 × read depth and ≥2% variant allele frequency (VAF) in RNA extracted from FF tissue, and (iv) synonymous mutations and those related to HLA were removed from downstream analysis.</p>
<p>The resulting BAM files were sorted, indexed using Samtools version 1.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), and had PCR duplicates removed using Picard tools version 2.25.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Somatic variants were manually reviewed using Integrative Genomics Viewer (v2.8.2). The VCF files generated by Dragen (for DNAseq) and VarScan 2 (for RNAseq) were subsequently annotated using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP version 105) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) to extract information about the potential effects of variants on the phenotypic outcome.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>CDR3β calling from TCRseq data</title>
<p>To define the CDR3β from TCRseq, we utilized Cogent NGS Immune Profiler Software v1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Before calling clonotypes, the raw sequencing reads underwent filtering based on the following criteria: (i) allowing only one mismatch while splitting reads by matching read sequences to different receptor chains, (ii) excluding reads shorter than 30 bp and reads ambiguously matched to multiple receptor chains, (iii) excluding reads that failed correction when linker-based correction was enabled, (iv) excluding reads that failed the abundance check during sequencing error correction, and (v) excluding molecular identifier groups (MIGs) with fewer than 3 unique molecular identifier (UMI) reads. The filtered MIGs were then assembled and aligned to the V(D)J reference to define the TCR clonotype.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Shannon index and clonality</title>
<p>We utilized two indices to characterize T-cell diversity and expansion: the Shannon entropy index and the clonality index.</p>
<p>Shannon entropy:
<disp-formula>

</disp-formula>
Clonality:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="567478v2_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
These indices consider both the number of T-cell clone types ’n’ and the frequency ’p<sub>i</sub>’ of each clone. Here, ’p<sub>i</sub>’ represents the proportion of the i-th clone within the TCR library containing n clones.</p>

<p>Class I HLA alleles (HLA-A/B/C) with two-digit resolution were identified from patient tumor RNAseq data using the OptiType tool (<bold>Supplementary Table 2)</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). The annotated VCF files were analyzed using pVACseq, a tool in pVACtools (v1.5.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). We used the default settings, except for disabling the coverage and MAF filters. We used all peptide-HLA-I binding algorithms that were implemented in pVACseq to predict 8 to 11-mer epitopes binding to HLA-I (A, B, or C) for downstream analysis. Mutants with lower binding affinity than wildtype peptides were prioritized using a two-step ranking process. The minimum binding affinity score was calculated from the distribution of scores among the peptides derived from each mutation, and priority was given to mutations with the lowest binding affinity scores. Moreover, in pVACseq, we collected peptides with binding affinity scores lower than wildtype from multiple tools, calculated minimum binding affinity scores for each unique peptide, and incorporated this data into a combined machine learning model.</p>
<p>We used the peptide-HLA-TCR binding algorithm implemented in pMTNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) to predict peptide binding to HLA and TCR with default settings. These scores represented the predicted likelihood of peptides being immunogenic. A ranking value for immunogenicity was assigned to each unique peptide by determining the minimum TCR ranking of its immunogenicity score.</p>

<title>Construction of a combined machine learning model</title>
<p>To identify immunogenic peptides, we conducted a thorough search across multiple databases, including 10X Genomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), McPAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), VDJdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), IEDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), and TBAdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). For the creation of non-immunogenic pHLA-TCR complex, we assembled a negative dataset using the PRIME tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). This dataset was generated by associating each pHLA with 10 randomly generated TCRs sourced from the following databases: 10X Genomics, McPAS, VDJdb, IEDB, and TBAdb. To objectively train and evaluate the model, we separated the dataset mentioned above into two data subsets: discovery dataset (70%) and validation dataset (30%). These subsets are mutually exclusive and do not overlap (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1</bold>). pHLA-TCR complex in the discovery dataset, whether labeled as immunogenic or non-immunogenic, were used for model training to classify whether a peptide is positive or not. We examined three machine learning algorithms - Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) - for each feature type (pHLA binding, pHLA-TCR binding), as well as for combined features. Feature selection was tested using a k-fold cross-validation approach on the discovery dataset with ’k’ set to 10-fold. This process splits the discovery dataset into 10 equal-sized folds, iteratively using 9 folds for training and 1 fold for validation. Model performance was evaluated using the ‘roc_auc’ (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve) metric, which measures the model’s ability to distinguish between positive and negative peptides. The average of these scores provides a robust estimate of the model’s performance and generalizability. The model with the highest ‘roc_auc’ average score, XGB, was chosen for all features. The model cut-off was set based on a threshold specificity of &gt;90% or &gt;95% to achieve high specificity for selecting peptides. This combined model’s performance was evaluated on the independent validation dataset of immunogenic and non-immunogenic pHLA-TCR complex to assess its ability to classify positive peptides from negative peptides.

<title>Isolation, culture, and stimulation of PBMCs with long peptides</title>
<p>Peripheral blood samples were collected from eight patients prior to surgery using BD Vacutainer Heparin Tubes (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated through gradient centrifugation using Lymphoprep (STEMCELL Technologies) within 4 hours of blood collection. The PBMCs were then resuspended in a solution of FBS (10%) and DMSO (7-10×10^6 cells/mL) for cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen. Frozen PBMCs were thawed in AIM-V media (Gibco, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Cytiva, USA) and DNase I (Stemcell Technology, Canada) (1 mg/mL) solution. A total of 10^5 PBMCs were allowed to rest in a 96-round bottom well-plate containing AIM V media supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, and 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol overnight before stimulation with synthesized long peptides at a concentration of 5 mM in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. PBMCs were further stimulated with GM-CSF (2000 IU/mL, Gibco, MT, USA) and IL-4 (1000 IU/mL, Invitrogen, MA, USA) for 24 hours. Following this initial stimulation, LPS (100 ng/mL, SigmaAldrich, MA, USA) and IFN-γ (10 ng/mL, Gibco, MT, USA) were added to the PBMCs along with the peptides for an additional 12 hours. On the following day, IL-7, IL-15, and IL-21 (each at a concentration of 10 ng/mL) (Peprotech, NJ, USA) were added to the PBMC culture. The restimulation process involved exposing the peptides to fresh media containing IL-7, IL-15, and IL-21 every 3 days, for a total of 3 times. On day 12, PBMCs were restimulated with peptides and cultured in media without cytokines. ELISpot assays were performed on stimulated PBMCs on day 13.</p>

Developed spots on the ELISpot plate were then counted using an ELISpot reader (Mabtech, Sweden). Reactivity was determined by measuring the fold increase in the number of spots in PBMCs treated with mutant peptides compared to those treated with wild-type peptides.

<title>The workflow of identifying neoantigens by combining both HLA and TCR binding characteristics</title>
<p>The identification of neoantigens has traditionally heavily relied on peptide-HLA (pHLA) binding prediction while often neglecting the significance of pHLA-TCR interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). In this study, we introduce a novel workflow that integrates both pHLA and pHLA-TCR interactions to enhance the precision of neoantigen identification and prioritization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In the first step (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), we conducted RNA and DNA sequencing on matched tumor tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from 28 CRC patients to detect cancer-associated nonsynonymous mutations and determine HLA types, as detailed in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Additionally, T-cell receptor sequencing (TCR-Seq) was performed to profile the TCRβ repertoire of TILs. In the second step (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), we used the pVACseq and pMTNet tools to predict the binding affinities of both pHLA and pHLA-TCR interactions. To exploit the information of both pHLA and pHLA-TCR binding for selecting and ranking neoantigen candidates, we constructed a machine learning model by using immunogenic and non-immunogenic peptide information sourced from five publicly available databases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, we designed long peptide (LP) candidates encompassing the selected neoantigens and experimentally assessed their immunogenicity using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from the same patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Heterogenous tumor infiltrating TCRβ profiles in colorectal cancer patients</title>
<p>Autologous TILs have exhibited varying reactivity levels to neoantigens, suggesting the potential of TIL-based recognition to improve the identification of immunogenic neoantigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Furthermore, characterizing T cell receptors (TCRs) can complement efforts to predict immunogenicity. To explore this, we initiated our study by characterizing the TIL repertoire in a cohort of 28 colorectal cancer patients. This characterization involved sequencing the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of T-cell receptor beta (TCRβ), renowned for its remarkable diversity within the TCR gene. Our sequencing analysis yielded an average of 2,992,949 productive TCR reads per sample, with a range between 256,035 and 10,888,726 (<bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>), following correction for duplications, sequencing errors, and exclusive use of uniquely barcoded reads mapped to TCRβ CD3 sequences from the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) databases. Across the 28 patients, we observed variable numbers of TCRβ-CDR3 clonotypes, ranging from 433 to 27,749 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref><bold> &amp; Supplementary Table 3,</bold> 28 patients were arranged in ascending order), indicating the intra-tumor heterogeneity of TCR clonotypes. Of these clonotypes, 59.5% exhibited a single uniquely barcoded read mapped to the TCRβ-CDR3 sequences (depicted in yellow in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), while 40.5% had at least two TCRβ-CDR3 reads confidently identified (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). As observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), the length distribution of CDR3 was approximately normally distributed (median 14, range 4-43, <bold>Supplementary Figure 2A &amp; Supplementary Table 4</bold>). Subsequently, we explored potential associations between TCR diversity, as quantified by the Shannon index, and patient characteristics. In accordance with prior investigations, we identified an inverse relationship between the number of TCR clones and the Shannon index (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Based on our current sequencing depth, we have observed that many of our samples (14 out of 28) have reached sufficient saturation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) as their diversity of clonotypes was saturated. Additionally, the TCR clones selected in our studies are unique molecular identifier (UMI)-collapsed reads, with each representing at least three raw reads sharing the same UMI. Consequently, despite some samples having low sequencing depth for TCRβ sequencing, likely due to the diversity of TIL infiltration between patients, our TCRβ profiling analysis is robust and reliable. However, we did not detect any significant correlations between TCR clonality or diversity and clinical variables, including microsatellite status, tumor staging, patient gender and tumor location (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4</bold>). In contrast, MSI-H tumors, which are known to be rich in neoantigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), displayed a significantly lower number of TCRβ clonotypes compared to MSS tumors (2181 versus 5330, p=0.057, <bold>Supplementary Figure 3 &amp; 4A</bold>), aligning with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>).</p>

<p>After filtering out TCR clones with read counts below 1, we obtained a total of 74,590 TCR clones. Subsequently, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of TCRβ repertoire similarity by calculating the proportion of overlapping TCRβ CDR3 clones across the 28 patients. The preeminent majority, constituting 95.1% of all identified TCRβ-CDR3 clones, comprised unique clonotypes found in one patient, while the remaining 4.9% were recurrently observed in at least two patients (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2B</bold>). This observation underscores the substantial inter-patient heterogeneity in TCR profiles. The TCRβ repertoire is generated by the random rearrangement of variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments. We conducted a search specifically targeting the D segment by scoring the similarities of sub-sequences within the junction sequences against the reference sequences of D segments. Consistent with a previous study, we were unable to unambiguously assign the D segments to any defined D region usage due to the truncation of this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). In contrast to the diversified D segments, V and J sequments displayed high recurrent rates across 28 patients (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2B</bold>). As anticipated, we identified 59 distinct V segments (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2C</bold>) and 13 distinct J segments (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2D</bold>), collectively sharing 185,627 clones across the 28 tumor tissue samples. This underscores the conservation of these segments (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2C</bold> &amp; <bold>D</bold>). Conversely, we observed a varied combination of V and J segments, which significantly contributes to the heterogeneity of the TIL TCRβ repertoire (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2E</bold>). Collectively, our data elucidate the presence of both intra-tumor and inter-patient heterogeneity in the TCRβ repertoires of CRC patients, likely stemming from the stochastic utilization of V and J segments in response to neoantigens.</p>

<title>pHLA and pHLA-TCR interactions are two complement determinants of neoantigen immunogenicity</title>
<p>While <italic>in silico</italic> tools predicting HLA-peptide binding affinity have traditionally played a pivotal role in determining neoantigen immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), the evaluation of TCR-peptide binding for screening immunogenic neoantigens remains understudied. In light of this, our study aimed to assess the contributions of both pHLA and pHLA-TCR binding affinity in predicting immunogenic neoantigens. To accomplish this, we gathered HLA and TCRβ sequences from established datasets containing immunogenic and non-immunogenic pHLA-TCR complexes (<bold>Supplementary Table 5)</bold>. Subsequently, we employed NetMHCpan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) and pMTNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) tools to predict pHLA and pHLA-TCR binding, respectively.</p>
<p>For comparative purposes, we generated plots depicting predicted percentile rank values, with lower percentile ranks signifying stronger binding affinity. As anticipated, our analysis revealed a significantly higher prevalence of peptides with robust HLA binding (percentile rank &lt; 2%) among immunogenic peptides in contrast to their non-immunogenic counterparts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, p&lt; 0.00001). Similarly, immunogenic peptides exhibited a greater proportion of peptides with percentile ranks indicating pHLA-TCR binding of &lt; 2% compared to non-immunogenic peptides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, p=0.086). As recommended by NetMHCpan and pMTNet, we considered peptide candidates with predicted percentile ranks below 2% as binders. Utilizing this predefined threshold, both pHLA and pHLA-TCR binding affinity exhibited comparable positive predictive values (PPV), at 68.5% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) and 64.3% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), respectively. This substantiates the significance of both pHLA and pHLA-TCR binding in determining the immunogenicity of peptides. When we simultaneously applied the cutoff values for both HLA-peptide and TCR-peptide percentile ranks (Q1 group, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), the PPV increased to 76.9% from 68.5% and 64.3% for individual binding features (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). This underscores the rationale for combining these two criteria to enhance the accuracy of neoantigen prediction. Notably, pHLA-TCR binding displayed a remarkedly lower sensitivity but higher specificity in comparison to pHLA binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), implying their potential as a complementary criteria for the selection of immunogenic peptides.</p>

<title>Combination of peptide-HLA and peptide-HLA-TCR interactions improves neoantigen prediction</title>
<p>The combination of peptide-HLA and peptide-HLA-TCR binding ranking with a fixed cutoff values of 2% for each feature resulted in high specificity but low sensitivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). To optimize the precision of immugenic neoantigens, we examined three distinct machine learning classifiers, namely Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) classifiers. We first partitioned the pHLA binding and pHLA-TCR binding ranks for immunogenic and non-immunogenic peptides from publicly available databases into separate discovery and validation datasets. These datasets were used to develop and validate machine learning algorithms, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>. We next assessed the performance of the three examined algorithms, employing a 10-fold cross-validation strategy. Among these algorithms, XGB demonstrated the highest performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.82 in the training dataset and 0.84 in the validation dataset (<bold>Supplementary Figure 5</bold>). Consequently, the model combining pHLA and pHLA-TCR binding, referred to as the ’combined model’ was chosen for further validation.</p>

<p>Our findings revealed that the combined model outperformed methods relying on pHLA-TCR or pHLA binding feature separately. The combined model yielded sensitivity AUC values of 0.82 (95% CI 0.81-0.84) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.82-0.86) for discovery and validation cohorts, whereas the pHLA-TCR feature alone achieved AUC values of 0.69 (95% CI 0.66-0.71) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.71-0.77). Meanwhile, the pHLA feature resulted in AUC values of 0.76 (95% CI 0.75-0.78) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.77) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In order to address the elevated false positive rates associated with current prediction tools for neoantigens, we set the specificity at high thresholds of &gt;95% and &gt;99%. We observed that the combined model achieved a greater sensitivity (39.7% versus 5.9% and 19.7% at &gt; 95% specificity; 47.1% versus 3.5% and 18.8% at &gt; 99% specificity, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), Negative Predictive Value (NPV, 87.7% versus 82% and 84.2% at &gt; 95% specificity; 88.9% versus 81.5% and 83.9% at &gt; 99% specificity, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), and Positive Predictive Value (PPV, 65.9% versus 22.2% and 47.1% at &gt; 95% specificity; 62.3% versus 11.8% and 39.4% at &gt; 99% specificity, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) compared to the single feature methods.</p>
<p>The accurate prioritization of neoantigen candidates with high immunogenicity holds the potential to streamline the validation process, reducing both costs and time expenditures. Consequently, we proceeded to evaluate the combined model’s capacity to prioritize neoantigens by computing the ranking coverage score, which considers the accuracy in ranking immunogenic peptides versus non-immunogenic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). In the validation phase, the combined model exhibited superior rank coverage scores in comparison to the individual feature-based methods. The combined model attained a ranking coverage score of 0.37, while the single-feature methods, pHLA-TCR and pHLA, yielded scores of -0.26 and 0.25, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).

<title>Experimental validation of the pHLA-TCR and pHLA combined approach in selecting neoantigen candidates in patients with CRC</title>
<p>To experimentally validate the efficacy of our combined approach, we conducted a comparative analysis of the percentage of confirmed immunogenic neoantigen candidates and the ranking coverage scores between the conventional NetMHCpan method, which relies solely on pHLA binding percentiles, and our combined approach (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Due to the limited availability of patient blood samples, we were only able to perform validation on eight patients who possessed sufficient quantity of PBMCs. For each patient, we chose the top three neoantigen candidates predicted by each method. Among the neoantigen candidates, three were found to be common between the two methods, while twenty neoantigen candidates were uniquely identified by either NetMHCpan or the combined model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), bringing the total number of candidates to 44. Subsequently, we synthesized 44 long peptides (LPs) covering these 44 selected neoantigen candidates, along with 44 LPs corresponding to the wild-type sequences. The LPs were utilized in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> ELISpot assay to measure the release of interferon-gamma (IFNγ) from the four patients’ PBMCs.

In agreement with our <italic>in silico</italic> analyses, we observed higher rank coverage scores for the combined method in five out of the eight patients, resulting in an overall score of 0.04 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref><bold> &amp; Supplementary Figure 6</bold>). In contrast, the NetMHCpan method exhibited a lower rank coverage score of -0.37 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref><bold> &amp; Supplementary Figure 6</bold>). To further evaluate our model, we gathered additional public data and assessed its effectiveness in comparison to other models. We utilized immunogenic peptides from databases such as NEPdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>), NeoPeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), dbPepneo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>), Tantigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>), and TSNAdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>), ensuring there was no overlap with the datasets used for training and validation. For non-immunogenic peptides, we used data from 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Immune Profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The findings indicate that the combined model from pMTNet and NetMHCpan outperforms NetTCR tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>) (<bold>Supplementary Table 6</bold>). These outcomes conclusively demonstrate the ability of the combined approach to enhance the prediction and ranking of immunogenic neoantigens in cancer patients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The selection of neoantigens plays a pivotal role in enhancing the efficacy of personalized treatments in cancer immunotherapy. Historically, neoantigen selection has predominantly hinged upon the prediction of peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) binding. However, the limitations of this approach have become increasingly evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>), as it often neglects the dynamic interplay between tumor cells and the immune system. The findings of our study shed new light on this critical aspect of neoantigen selection. Our research highlights the potential of integrating pHLA binding prediction with the assessment of pHLA-Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte T Cell Receptor (TIL TCR) binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). By encompassing the interaction between neoantigens and the tumor microenvironment, we have demonstrated a substantial enhancement in the accuracy of neoantigen selection and prioritization. Our findings underscore the significance of comprehensive neoantigen assessment in harnessing the full potential of immunotherapeutic strategies in the fight against cancer.</p>
<p>Our investigation into the TIL TCRβ repertoire across 28 CRC patients has unveiled a complex tapestry of intra-tumor and inter-patient heterogeneity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref><bold>, Supplementary Figure 2B</bold>). One underlying cause of this diversity is the random rearrangement of variable (V) and joining (J) segments, which contributes to the distinct TCRβ sequences observed (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2C, D &amp;E</bold>). This remarkable diversity in the TCRβ profile, as elucidated in our study, presents a potential link to the heterogeneity of cancer mutations and neoantigens within CRC. The intricate relationship between the TCRβ repertoire and the genetic alterations within the tumor microenvironment underscores the need for a more comprehensive understanding of this dynamic interplay to develop more precise immunotherapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). Furthermore, our research revealed a compelling observation regarding patients with MSI-H, who are known to exhibit high mutation and neoantigen burdens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). Intriguingly, MSI-H patients with strong immune reactivity to neoantigens was shown to display a lower number of TCR clonotypes and reduced diversity, as characterized by the Shannon index, compared to CRC patients with Microsatellite Stable (MSS) (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4A</bold>). This stark contrast in TCRβ diversity hints at the potential enrichment of neoantigen-reactive TCR clonotypes in MSI-H patients. These findings provide valuable insights into the immune responses to different subtypes of CRC and may guide the development of more tailored immunotherapies for patients with differing mutational landscapes.</p>
<p>By utilizing proven immunogenic and non-immunogenic peptides from public databases, we have demonstrated that predicting the strength of pHLA-TCR binding can be a crucial criterion for selecting immunogenic candidates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). For the prediction of pHLA-TCR binding, we employed the well-established tool pMTnet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). This choice was driven by its proven efficacy, based on its consistently high performance across different validated datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Although it exhibited lower sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) when compared to pHLA binding alone, pHLA-TCR binding strength exhibited notably superior specificity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). This implies that incorporating pHLA-TCR binding strength as a selection criterion would result in a reduced false positive rate, a crucial factor in the context of neoantigen selection. What makes our study particularly compelling is the convergence of these observations. The integration of both criteria, specifically, pHLA binding and pHLA-TCR binding strength, emerged as a strategy that not only enhanced the PPV but also fortified the rationale for combining these two features in the neoantigen selection process.</p>
<p>The integration of both pHLA binding and pHLA-TCR binding strength features in our approach exhibited superior performance in neoantigen selection and prioritization when compared to the single-feature method (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). This observation aligns with the findings of previous studies, which consistently indicate that combining multiple criteria enhances the accuracy and efficacy of neoantigen identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Furthermore, our experimental validation confirmed the robustness of our approach by consistently demonstrating performance consistent with our analysis on publicly available data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref><bold> &amp; Supplementary Table 6</bold>). When examining the percentile ranks of positive LPs predicted by netMHCpan from those predicted by our combined model, the results further underscored the strength of our approach (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This alignment between experimental validation and computational analysis enhances the reliability and applicability of our neoantigen selection method. Interestingly, the four identified neoantigen candidates with confirmed immunogenicity by the combined approach have not been previously reported in public neoantigen databases, indicating that they could serve as novel targets for neoantigen based therapies.</p>
<p>However, several limitations must be acknowledged. Firstly, the relatively small sample size employed for validation raises the potential for ranking score bias. Additionally, while both TCRα and TCRβ regions play essential roles in engaging peptide-bound HLA complexes, our study focused solely on TCRβ sequences to predict pHLA-TCR binding strength. Future investigations should include TCRα sequences to provide a more comprehensive analysis. Although the PBMC and TILs were previously shown to be congruent in neoantigen reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>), it is important to recognize that differences in the contribution of TIL and PBMC TCR repertoires in neoantigen selection may introduce variability in the selection and validation of neoantigen candidates, and future studies are warranted to address the consistency in neoantigen reactivity between these two sources of T cells. Moreover, to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the machine learning model in predicting and ranking neoantigens, we have developed an in-house tool called EpiTCR. This tool will utilize immunogenic assays, such as ELISpot and single-cell sequencing, for validation.</p>
<p>In summary, our study delves into the diversity and variation within the TCRβ repertoire of TILs in the tumor tissues of colorectal cancer patients. Through our research, we have introduced a novel approach for the identification and prioritization of neoantigen candidates. This approach combines the assessment of peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) binding and peptide-human leukocyte antigen-T cell receptor (pHLA-TCR) binding. Our findings underscore the significance of considering pHLA-TCR binding interactions as part of the process for selecting neoantigen candidates. This is a crucial step in the development of personalized immunotherapy strategies. By combining these two factors, we can more accurately identify the neoantigens that hold promise for effective immunotherapy, ultimately improving the prospects for tailored and effective cancer treatment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper introduces a novel approach for improving personalized cancer immunotherapy by integrating TCR profiling with traditional pHLA binding predictions, addressing the need for more precise neoantigen CRC patients. By analyzing TCR repertoires from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and applying machine learning algorithms, the authors developed a predictive model that outperforms conventional methods in specificity and sensitivity. The validation of the model through ELISpot assays confirmed its potential in identifying more effective neoantigens, highlighting the significance of combining TCR and pHLA data for advancing personalized immunotherapy strategies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Comprehensive Patient Data Collection: The study meticulously collected and analyzed clinical data from 27 CRC patients, ensuring a robust foundation for research findings. The detailed documentation of patient demographics, cancer stages, and pathology information enhances the study's credibility and potential applicability to broader patient populations.</p>
<p>
(2) The use of machine learning classifiers (RF, LR, XGB) and the combination of pHLA and pHLA-TCR binding predictions significantly enhance the model's accuracy in identifying immunogenic neoantigens, as evidenced by the high AUC values and improved sensitivity, NPV, and PPV.</p>
<p>
(3) The use of experimental validation through ELISpot assays adds a practical dimension to the study, confirming the computational predictions with actual immune responses. The calculation of ranking coverage scores and the comparative analysis between the combined model and the conventional NetMHCpan method demonstrate the superior performance of the combined approach in accurately ranking immunogenic neoantigens.</p>
<p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper reports a number of somewhat disparate findings on a set of colorectal tumour and infiltrating T-cells. The main finding is a combined machine-learning tool which combines two previous state-of-the-art tools, MHC prediction, and T-cell binding prediction to predict immunogenicity. This is then applied to a small set of neoantigens and there is a small-scale validation of the prediciton at the end.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The prediction of immunogenic neoepitopes is an important and unresolved question.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper contains a lot of extraneous material not relevant to the main claim. Conversely, it lacks important detail on the major claim.</p>
<p>(1) The analysis of T cell repertoire in Figure 2 seems irrelevant to the rest of the paper. As far as I could ascertain, this data is not used further.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for their valuable feedback. We concur with the reviewer's observation that the analysis of the TCR repertoire in Figure 2 should be moved to the supplementary section. We have moved Figures 2B to 2F to Supplementary Figure 2.</p>
<p>However, the analysis of TCR profiles is still presented in Figure 2, as it plays a pivotal role in the process of neoantigen selection. This is because the TCR profiles of eight (out of 28) patients were used for neoantigen prediction. We have added the following sentences to the results section to explain the importance of TCR profiling: “Furthermore, characterizing T cell receptors (TCRs) can complement efforts to predict immunogenicity.” (Results, Lines 311-312, Page 11)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The key claim of the paper rests on the performance of the ML algorithm combining NETMHC and pmtNET. In turn, this depends on the selection of peptides for training. I am unclear about how the negative peptides were selected. Are they peptides from the same databases as immunogenic petpides but randomised for MHC? It seems as though there will be a lot of overlap between the peptides used for testing the combined algorithm, and the peptides used for training MHCNet and pmtMHC. If this is so, and depending on the choice of negative peptides, it is surely expected that the tools perform better on immunogenic than on non-immunogenic peptides in Figure 3. I don't fully understand panel G, but there seems very little difference between the TCR ranking and the combined. Why does including the TCR ranking have such a deleterious effect on sensitivity?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable feedback. We believe the reviewer implies 'MHCNet' as NetMHCpan and 'pmtMHC' as pMTnet tools. First, the negative peptides, which have been excluded from PRIME (1), were not randomized with MHC (HLA-I) but were randomized with TCR only. Secondly, the positive peptides selected for our combined algorithms are chosen from many databases such as 10X Genomics, McPAS, VDJdb, IEDB, and TBAdb, while MHCNet uses peptides from the IEDB database and pMTNet uses a totally different dataset from ours for training. Therefore, there is not much overlap between our training data and the training datasets for MHCNet and pMTNet. Thus, the better performance of our tool is not due to overlapping training datasets with these tools or the selection of negative peptides.</p>
<p>To enhance the clarity of the dataset construction, we have added Supplementary Figure 1, which demonstrates the workflow of peptide collection and the random splitting of data to generate the discovery and validation datasets. Additionally, we have revised the following sentence: &quot;To objectively train and evaluate the model, we separated the dataset mentioned above into two subsets: a discovery dataset (70%) and a validation dataset (30%). These subsets are mutually exclusive and do not overlap.” (Methods, lines 221-223, page 8).</p>
<p>Initially, the &quot;combine&quot; label in Figure 3G was confusing and potentially misleading when compared to our subsequent approach using a combined machine learning model. In Figure 3G, the &quot;combine&quot; approach simply aggregates the pHLA and pHLA-TCR criteria, whereas our combined machine learning model employs a more sophisticated algorithm to integrate these criteria effectively. The combined analysis in Figure 3G utilizes a basic &quot;AND&quot; algorithm between pHLA and pHLA-TCR criteria, aiming for high sensitivity in HLA binding and high specificity. However, this approach demonstrated lower efficacy in practice, underscoring the necessity for a more refined integration method through machine learning. This was the key point we intended to convey with Figure 3G. To address this issue, we have revised Figure 3G to replace &quot;combined&quot; with &quot;HLA percentile &amp; TCR ranking&quot; to clarify its purpose and minimize confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The key validation of the model is Figure 5. In 4 patients, the authors report that 6 out 21 neo-antigen peptides give interferon responses &gt; 2 fold above background. Using NETMHC alone (I presume the tool was used to rank peptides according to binding to the respective HLAs in each individual, but this is not clear), identified 2; using the combined tool identified 4. I don't think this is significant by any measure. I don't understand the score shown in panel E but I don't think it alters the underlying statistic.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Acknowledging the limitations of our study's sample size, we proceeded to further validate our findings with four additional patients to acquire more data. The final results revealed that our combined model identified seven peptides eliciting interferon responses greater than a two-fold increase, compared to only three peptides identified by NetMHCpan (Figure 5)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In conclusion, the paper demonstrates that combining MHCNET and pmtMHC results in a modest increase in the ability to discriminate 'immunogenic' from 'non-immunogenic' peptide; however, the strength of this claim is difficult to evaluate without more knowledge about the negative peptides. The experimental validation of this approach in the context of CRC is not convincing.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper introduces a novel approach for improving personalized cancer immunotherapy by integrating TCR profiling with traditional pHLA binding predictions, addressing the need for more precise neoantigen CRC patients. By analyzing TCR repertoires from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and applying machine learning algorithms, the authors developed a predictive model that outperforms conventional methods in specificity and sensitivity.

<p>(4) The use of experimental validation through ELISpot assays adds a practical dimension to the study, confirming the computational predictions with actual immune responses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While multiple advanced tools and algorithms are used, the study could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the rationale behind algorithm choice and parameter settings, ensuring reproducibility and transparency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. We have revised the explanation regarding the rationale behind algorithm choice and parameter settings as follows: “We examined three machine learning algorithms - Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) - for each feature type (pHLA binding, pHLA-TCR binding), as well as for combined features. Feature selection was tested using a k-fold cross-validation approach on the discovery dataset with 'k' set to 10-fold. This process splits the discovery dataset into 10 equal-sized folds, iteratively using 9 folds for training and 1 fold for validation. Model performance was evaluated using the ‘roc_auc’ (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve) metric, which measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative peptides. The average of these scores provides a robust estimate of the model's performance and generalizability. The model with the highest ‘roc_auc’ average score, XGB, was chosen for all features.” (Method, lines 225-234, page 8).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While pHLA-TCR binding displayed higher specificity, its lower sensitivity compared to pHLA binding suggests a trade-off between the two measures. Optimizing the balance between sensitivity and specificity could be crucial for the practical application of these predictions in clinical settings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion. Due to the limited availability of patient blood samples and time constraints for validation, we have chosen to prioritize high specificity and positive predictive value to enhance the selection of neoantigens.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The experimental validation was performed on a limited number of patients (four), which might affect the generalizability of the findings. Increasing the number of patients for validation could provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's performance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This has been addressed earlier. Here, we restate it as follows: Acknowledging the limitations of our study's sample size, we proceeded to further validate our findings with four additional patients to acquire more data. The final results revealed that our combined model identified seven peptides eliciting interferon responses greater than a two-fold increase, compared to only three peptides identified by NetMHCpan (Figure 5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents a new approach of combining two measurements (pHLA binding and pHLA-TCR binding) in order to refine predictions of which patient mutations are likely presented to and recognized by the immune system. Improving such predictions would play an important role in making personalized anti-cancer vaccinations more effective.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study combines data from pre-existing tools pVACseq and pMTNet and applies them to a CRC patient population, which the authors show may improve the chance of identifying immunogenic, cancer-derived neoepitopes. Making the datasets collected publicly available would expand beyond the current datasets that typically describe caucasian patients.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the pNetMHCpan and pMTNet tools used by the authors are entirely independent, as they appear to have been trained on overlapping datasets, which may explain their similar scores. The pHLA-TCR score seems to be driving the effects, but this not discussed in detail.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The HLA percentile from NetMHCpan and the TCR ranking from pMTNet are independent. NetMHCpan predicts the interaction between peptides and MHC class I, while pMTNet predicts the TCR binding specificity of class I MHCs and peptides.Additionally, we partitioned the dataset mentioned above into two subsets: a discovery dataset (70%) and a validation dataset (30%), ensuring no overlap between the training and testing datasets.</p>
<p>To enhance the clarity of the dataset construction, we have added Supplementary Figure 1, which demonstrates the workflow of peptide collection and the random splitting of data to generate the discovery and validation datasets. Additionally, we have revised the following sentence: &quot;To objectively train and evaluate the model, we separated the dataset mentioned above into two subsets: a discovery dataset (70%) and a validation dataset (30%). These subsets are mutually exclusive and do not overlap.” (Methods, lines 221-223, page 8). We also included the dataset construction workflow in Supplementary Figure 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Due to sample constraints, the authors were only able to do a limited amount of experimental validation to support their model; this raises questions as to how generalizable the presented results are. It would be desirable to use statistical thresholds to justify cutoffs in ELISPOT data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We chose a cutoff of 2 for ELISPOT, following the recommendation of the study by Moodie et al. (2). The study provides standardized cutoffs for defining positive responses in ELISPOT assays. It presents revised criteria based on a comprehensive analysis of data from multiple studies, aiming to improve the precision and consistency of immune response measurements across various applications.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Some of the TCR repertoire metrics presented in Figure 2 are incorrectly described as independent variables and do not meaningfully contribute to the paper. The TCR repertoires may have benefitted from deeper sequencing coverage, as many TCRs appear to be supported only by a single read.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback. We have moved Figures 2B through 2F to Supplementary Figure 2. We agree with the reviewer that deeper sequencing coverage could potentially benefit the repertoires. However, based on our current sequencing depth, we have observed that many of our samples (14 out of 28) have reached sufficient saturation, as indicated by Figure 2C. The TCR clones selected in our studies are unique molecular identifier (UMI)-collapsed reads, each representing at least three raw reads sharing the same UMI. This approach ensures that the data is robust despite the variability. It is important to note that Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) differ across samples, resulting in non-uniform sequencing coverage among them.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors</bold>:</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Please open source the raw and processed data, code, and software output (NetMHCpan, pMTnet), which are important to verify the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>NetMHCpan and pMTNet are publicly available software tools (3, 4). In our GitHub repository, we have included links to the GitHub repositories for NetMHCpan and pMTNet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/QuynhPham1220/Combined-model">https://github.com/QuynhPham1220/Combined-model</ext-link>).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Comparison with more state-of-the-art neoantigen prediction models could provide a more comprehensive view of the combined model's performance relative to the current field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To further evaluate our model, we gathered additional public data and assessed its effectiveness in comparison to other models. We utilized immunogenic peptides from databases such as NEPdb (5), NeoPeptide (6), dbPepneo (7), Tantigen (8), and TSNAdb (9), ensuring there was no overlap with the datasets used for training and validation. For non-immunogenic peptides, we used data from 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Immune Profiling (10-13).The findings indicate that the combined model from pMTNet and NetMHCpan outperforms NetTCR tool (14). To address the reviewer's inquiry, we have incorporated these results in Supplementary Table 6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) While the combined model shows a positive overall rank coverage score, indicating improved ranking accuracy, the scores are relatively low. Further refinement of the model or the inclusion of additional predictive features might enhance the ranking accuracy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. The RankCoverageScore provides an objective evaluation of the rank results derived from the final peptide list generated by the two tools. The combined model achieved a higher RankCoverageScore than pMTNet, indicating its superior ability to identify immunogenic peptides compared to existing in silico tools. In order to provide a more comprehensive assessment, we included an additional four validated samples to recalculate the rank coverage score. The results demonstrate a notable difference between NetMHCpan and the Combined model (-0.37 and 0.04, respectively). We have incorporated these findings into Supplementary Figure 6 to address the reviewer's question. Additionally, we have modified Figure 5E to present a simplified demonstration of the superior performance of the combined model compared to NetMHCpan.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Collect more public data and fine-tune the model. Then you will get a SOTA model for neoantigen selection. I strongly recommend you write Python scripts and open source.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their feedback. We have made the raw and processed data, as well as the model, available on GitHub. Additionally, we have gathered more public data and conducted evaluations to assess its efficiency compared to other methods.

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The Methods section seems good, though HLA calling is more accurate using arcasHLA than OptiType. This would be difficult to correct as OptiType is integrated into pVACtools.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We chose Optitype for its exceptional accuracy, surpassing 99%, in identifying HLA-I alleles from RNA-Seq data. This decision was informed by a recent extensive benchmarking study that evaluated its performance against &quot;gold-standard&quot; HLA genotyping data, as described in the study by Li et al.(15). Furthermore, we have tested two tools using the same RNA-Seq data from FFPE samples. The allele calling accuracy of Optitype was found to be superior to that of Acras-HLA. To address the reviewer's question, we have included these results in Supplementary Table 2, along with the reference to this decision (Method, line 200, page 07).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I am not sufficiently expert in machine learning to assess this part of the methods.</p>
<p>
TCR beta repertoire analysis of biopsy is highly variable; though my expertise lies largely in sequencing using the 10X genomics platform, typically one sees multiple RNAs per cell. Seeing the majority of TCRs supported by only a single read suggests either problems with RNA capture (particularly in this case where the recovered RNA was split to allow both RNAseq and targeted TCR seq) or that the TCR library was not sequenced deeply enough. I'd like to have seen rarefaction plots of TCR repertoire diversity vs the number of reads to ensure that sufficiently deep sequencing was performed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the suggestions provided by the reviewer. We agree that deeper sequencing coverage could potentially benefit the repertoires. However, based on our current sequencing depth, we have observed that many of our samples (14 out of 28) have reached sufficient saturation, as indicated by Figure 2C. In addition, the TCR clones selected in our studies are unique molecular identifier (UMI)-collapsed reads, each representing at least three raw reads sharing the same UMI. This approach ensures that the data is robust despite variability. It is important to note that Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) differ across samples, resulting in non-uniform sequencing coverage among them. We have already added the rarefaction plots of TCR repertoire diversity versus the number of reads in Figure 2C. These have been added to the main text (lines 329-335).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In order to support the authors' conclusions that MSI-H tumors have fewer TCR clonotypes than MSS tumors (Figure S2a) I would have liked to see Figure 2a annotated so that it was easy to distinguish which patient was in which group, as well as the rarefaction plots suggested above, to be sure that the difference represented a real difference between samples and not technical variance (which might occur due to only 4 samples being in the MSI-H group).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their recommendation. Indeed, it's worth noting that the number of MSI-H tumors is fewer than the MSS groups, which is consistent with the distribution observed in colorectal cancer, typically around 15%. This distribution pattern aligns with findings from several previous studies, as highlighted in these studies (16, 17). To provide further clarification on this point, we have included rarefaction plots illustrating TCR repertoire diversity versus the number of reads in Supplementary Figure 3 (line 339). Additionally, MSI-H and MSS samples have been appropriately labeled for clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors write: &quot;in accordance with prior investigations, we identified an inverse relationship between TCR clonality and the Shannon index (Supplementary Figure S1)&quot; &gt;&gt; Shannon index is measure of TCR clonality, not an independent variable. The authors may have meant TCR repertoire richness (the absolute number of TCRs), and the Shannon index (a measure of how many unique TCRs are present in the index).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comment regarding the correlation between the number of TCRs and the Shannon index. We have revised the figure to illustrate the relationship between the number of TCRs and the Shannon index, and we have relocated it to Figure 2B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors continue: &quot;As anticipated, we identified only 58 distinct V (Figure 2C) and 13 distinct J segments (Figure 2D), that collectively generated 184,396 clones across the 27 tumor tissue samples, underscoring the conservation of these segments (Figure 2C &amp; D)&quot; &gt;&gt; it is not clear to me what point the authors are making: it is well known that TCR V and J genes are largely shared between Caucasian populations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10810226">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10810226</ext-link>/), and though IMGT lists additional forms of these genes, many are quite rare and are typically not included in the reference sequences used by repertoire analysis software. I would clarify the language in this section to avoid the impression that patient repertoires are only using a restricted set of J genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank for the reviewer’s feedback. We have revised the sentence as follows: &quot; As anticipated, we identified 59 distinct V segments (Supplementary Figure 2C) and 13 distinct J segments (Supplementary Figure 2D), collectively sharing 185,627 clones across the 28 tumor tissue samples. This underscores the conservation of these segments (Supplementary Figure 2C &amp; D)” (Result, lines 354-356, page 12)</p>

<p>As a result I would suggest moving Figure 2 with the exception of 2A into the supplementals - I would have been more interested in a plot showing the distribution of TCRs by frequency, i.e. how what proportion of clones are hyperexpanded, moderately expanded etc. This would be a better measure of the likely immune responses.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. With the exception of Figure 2A, we have relocated Figures 2B through 2F to Supplementary Figure 2.</p>

<p>The authors write &quot;To accomplish this, we gathered HLA and TCRβ sequences from established datasets containing immunogenic and non-immunogenic peptides (Supplementary Table 3)&quot; &gt;&gt; The authors mean to refer to Table S4.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback. Here's the revised sentence: &quot;To accomplish this, we gathered HLA and TCRβ sequences from established datasets containing immunogenic and non-immunogenic pHLA-TCR complexes (Supplementary Table 5)” (lines 368-370).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors write &quot;As anticipated, our analysis revealed a significantly higher prevalence of peptides with robust HLA binding (percentile rank &lt; 2%) among immunogenic peptides in contrast to their non-immunogenic counterparts (Figure 3A &amp; B, p&lt; 0.00001)&quot; &gt;&gt; this is not surprising, as tools such as NetMHCpan are trained on databases of immunogenic peptides, and thus it is likely that these aren't independent measures (in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/W1/W449/5837056">https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/W1/W449/5837056</ext-link> the authors state that &quot;The training data have been vastly extended by accumulating MHC BA and EL data from the public domain. In particular, EL data were extended to include MA data&quot;). In the pMTNet paper it is stated that pMNet encoded pMHC information using &quot;the exact data that were used to train the netMHCpan model&quot; &gt;&gt; While I am not sufficiently expert to review details on machine learning training models, it would seem that the pHLA scores from NetMHCpan and pMTNet may not be independent, which would explain the concordance in scores that the authors describe in Figures 3B and 3D. I would invite the authors to comment on this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The HLA percentiles from NetMHCpan and TCR rankings from pMTNet are independent. NetMHCpan predicts the interaction between peptides and MHC class I, while pMTNet predicts the TCR binding specificity of class I MHCs and peptides. NetMHCpan is trained to predict peptide-MHC class I interactions by integrating binding affinity and MS eluted ligand data, using a second output neuron in the NNAlign approach. This setup produces scores for both binding affinity and ligand elution. In contrast, pMTNet predicts TCR binding specificity of class I pMHCs through three steps:</p>
<p>(1) Training a numeric embedding of pMHCs (class I only) to numerically represent protein sequences of antigens and MHCs.</p>
<p>(2) Training an embedding of TCR sequences using stacked auto-encoders to numerically encode TCR sequence text strings.</p>
<p>(3) Creating a deep neural network combining these two embeddings to integrate knowledge from TCRs, antigenic peptide sequences, and MHC alleles. Fine-tuning is employed to finalize the prediction model for TCR-pMHC pairing.</p>
<p>Therefore, pHLA scores from NetMHCpan and pMTNet are independent. Furthermore, Figures 3B and 3D do not show concordance in scores, as there was no equivalence in the percentage of immunogenic and non-immunogenic peptides in the two groups (≥2 HLA percentile and ≥2 TCR percentile).</p>

<p>Many of the authors of this paper were also authors of the epiTCR paper, would this not have been a better choice of tool for assessing pHLA-TCR binding than pMTNet?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>When we started this project, EpiTCR had not been completed. Therefore, we chose pMTNet, which had demonstrated good performance and high accuracy at that time. The validated performance of EpiTCR is an ongoing project that will implement immunogenic assays (ELISpot and single-cell sequencing) to assess the prediction and ranking of neoantigens. This study is also mentioned in the discussion: &quot;Moreover, to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the machine learning model in predicting and ranking neoantigens, we have developed an in-house tool called EpiTCR. This tool will utilize immunogenic assays, such as ELISpot and single-cell sequencing, for validation.&quot; (lines 532-535).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 3G it would appear that the pHLA-TCR score is driving the interaction, could the authors comment on this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The authors sincerely appreciate the reviewer for their valuable feedback. Initially, the &quot;combine&quot; label in Figure 3G was confusing and potentially misleading when compared to our subsequent approach using a combined machine learning model. In Figure 3G, the &quot;combine&quot; approach simply aggregates the pHLA and pHLA-TCR criteria, whereas our combined machine learning model employs a more sophisticated algorithm to integrate these criteria effectively.</p>
<p>The combined analysis in Figure 3G utilizes a basic &quot;AND&quot; algorithm between pHLA and pHLA-TCR criteria, aiming for high sensitivity in HLA binding and high specificity. However, this approach demonstrated lower efficacy in practice, underscoring the necessity for a more refined integration method through machine learning. This was the key point we intended to convey with Figure 3G. To address this issue, we have revised Figure 3G to replace &quot;combined&quot; with &quot;HLA percentile &amp; TCR ranking&quot; to clarify its purpose and minimize confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 4A I would invite the authors to comment on how they chose the sample sizes they did for the discovery and validation datasets: the numbers seem rather random. I would question whether a training dataset in which 20% of the peptides are immunogenic accurately represents the case in patients, where I believe immunogenic peptides are less frequent (as in Figure 5).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We aimed to maximize the number of experimentally validated immunogenic peptides, including those from viruses, with only a small percentage from tumors available for training. This limitation is inherent in the field. However, our ultimate objective is to develop a tool capable of accurately predicting peptide immunogenicity irrespective of their source. Therefore, the current percentage of immunogenic peptides may not accurately reflect real-world patient cases, but this is not crucial to our development goals.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For Figure 5C I would invite the authors to consider adding a statistical test to justify the cutoff at 2fold enrichments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your feedback. Instead of conducting a statistical test, we have implemented standardized cutoffs as defined in the cited study (2). This research introduces refined criteria for identifying positive responses in ELISPOT assays through a comprehensive analysis of data from multiple studies. These criteria aim to improve the accuracy and consistency of immune response measurements across various applications. The reference to this study has been properly incorporated into the manuscript (Method, line 281, page 10).</p>

<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>&quot;paired white blood cells&quot; &gt;&gt; use &quot;paired Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for the feedback. We agree with the reviewer's observation. The sentence has been revised as follows: &quot;Initially, DNA sequencing of tumor tissues and paired Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells identifies cancer-associated genomic mutations. RNA sequencing then determines the patient's HLA-I allele profile and the gene expression levels of mutated genes.&quot; (Introduction, lines 55-58, page 2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;while RNA sequencing determines the patient's HLA-I allele profile and gene expression levels of mutated genes.&quot; &gt;&gt; RNA sequencing covers both the mutant and reference form of the gene, allowing assessment of variant allele frequency.</p>
<p>&quot;the current approach's impact on patient outcomes remains limited due to the scarcity of effective immunogenic neoantigens identified for each patient&quot; &gt;&gt; Some clearer language here would have been preferred as different tumor types have different mutational loads</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable feedback. We agree with the reviewer's observation. The passage has been revised accordingly: “The current approach's impact on patient outcomes remains limited due to the scarcity of mutations in cancer patients that lead to effective immunogenic neoantigens.” (Introduction, lines 62-64, page 3).</p>
