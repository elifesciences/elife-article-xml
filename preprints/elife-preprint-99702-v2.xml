<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Small molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2’s strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug dis-covery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2 based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model based small molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on three different protein kinases and their type I and II inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough ac- curacy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the groundbreaking impact of Alphafold2 (AF2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> on the computational prediction of the ligand-free protein native apo structures, it appears that the determination of high quality crystal or cryo-EM ligands bound holo structures remains irreplaceable in the field of structure based drug design. When ligands bind, residues within the protein pockets may adjust their side-chain rotamer configurations to optimize contacts with ligands, a phenomenon known as the induced-fit effect. Furthermore, thermodynamic fluctuations induce protein dynamics and structural flexibility, leading to rearrangements of side-chains and even large-scale backbone movements that can reveal cryptic pockets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> These metastable conformations and associated cryptic pockets can be stabilized upon binding to specific ligands, a phenomenon known as conformational selection. Moreover, due to the similarity of native structures among protein homologs, it has been widely believed that ligands targeting highly diverse metastable conformations should result in better selectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> It is thus highly desirable to account for metastable protein conformations or states, instead of investigating native states only. Several AF2-based techniques, including reduced multiple sequence alignment (rMSA) AF2 (or MSA subsampling AF2),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> AF2-cluster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and AlphaFlow,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> have been devised to generate distinct decoy structures from native states. However, the suitability of these decoys for subsequent docking and virtual screening remains uncertain. Moreover, accurately assigning Boltzmann weights to decoys produced by those methods lacking a direct physical interpretation is challenging. Such a Boltzmann ranking is critical simply because of the explosion in number of decoys that can be hallucinated from AlphaFold2 or future generative AI methods, now including AlphaFold3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The AF2RAVE protocol integrates rMSA AF2 and the machine learning-based Reweighted Autoencoded Variational Bayes for Enhanced Sampling (RAVE) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> to systematically explore metastable states and accurately rank structures using Boltzmann weights.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Subsequently, traditional grid-based docking methods or recent generative diffusion models, like Diffdock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and DynamicBind<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> can be employed to dock ligands with a few topranked structures in metastable states, enabling further virtual screening on large ligand libraries. In this work, we chose the docking method Glide XP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>and Induced-fit docking (IFD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> from the Schrödinger suite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> as our primary docking method. By combining these two steps, we propose the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>) as an innovative approach for small molecule drug design, initiated from protein sequences. In this workflow, the conformational selection effect is addressed by probing various metastable states using AF2RAVE. Glide-IFD is then applied to account for the induced-fit effect, refine the holo-like pockets further, and predict the ligand-bound holo structures.</p>
<p>In this work, we demonstrate this AF2RAVE-Glide workflow retrospectively on three different protein kinases and their type I and type II inhibitors. Protein kinases are involved in the regulation of various cellular pathways by catalyzing the hydrolyzing of ATP and transferring the phosphate group to substrate peptides/proteins. Dysfunctions of various kinases are know to cause human pathologies and cancers. The human genome contains about 500 protein kinases which share highly conserved structures in their catalytic ATP-binding pocket, due to the selection pressure towards functional catalysis. This poses significant challenges in developing selective small-molecule ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors, as they must effectively target the intended kinase while avoiding off-target interactions and associated side effects. Research efforts aimed at achieving selectivity have led to the development of 4 distinct types of kinase inhibitors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> including two types of ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors: type I inhibitors bind to the ATP-binding site adopting the active catalytic state, while type II inhibitors target the binding pockets adjacent to the ATP-binding site adopting the inactive state. These two states primarily differ in the configurations of their activation loop (A-loop), which is a flexible loop of approximately 20 residues. In the active state, the A-loop is “extended” to create a cleft for substrate peptides to bind, while in the inactive state, it is collapsed or “folded” onto the protein surface, blocking substrate binding. Additionally, in the active state, the three residues ‘Asp-Phe-Gly’ (DFG motif) at the N-terminus of the A-loop bind to an ATP-binding Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, with the Asp side-chain pointing inward to the ATP-binding pocket, while in the inactive state, the Asp side-chain is flipped outward, and the DFG-motif adopts the DFG-out conformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> Henceforth, we will refer to the type I inhibitor binding state as the active DFG-in state and designate the type II inhibitor binding state as the classical DFG-out state, as previously proposed in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> (demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2 A and B</xref> using Abl1 kinase as an example).</p>
<p>In this work, we investigated three kinases: (i) Abl1, which is targeted by the first clinically approved small-molecule kinase inhibitor imatinib for cancer therapy; (ii) DDR1, a structurally more flexible kinase which is identified as a promiscuous kinase targeted by chemically diverse inhibitors; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and (iii) Src kinase, another crucially important member of the tyrosine kinase family. In the following section, we applied AF2RAVE to enrich hololike structures adopting the classical DFG-out state from the AF2-generated ensembles of DDR1 and Abl1 kinase, and further validated those holo-like structures by docking them with known type II kinase inhibitors. We initiated our investigation by conducting docking experiments involving both type I and type II inhibitors with the AF2 structures of these two kinases. We observed the incapacity of AF2 structures to effectively dock with type II inhibitors targeting the metastable classical DFG-out state. Subsequently, we employed rMSA AF2, an associative memory like process that generates diverse structure ensembles for both kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, exploring their relatively improved but still limited potential to contain holo-like structures suitable for type II inhibitor binding. Ultimately, our study showcases AF2RAVE’s effectiveness in enhancing the generation and selection of hololike structures in metastable states by integrating AF2-based ensemble generation with physics-based methods.</p>

<title>AF2 structures fail to dock with type II kinase inhibitors</title>
<p>The utility of AF2-generated structures for structure-based drug discovery and virtual screening campaigns has been a subject of controversy and skeptical enthusiasm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> For proteins lacking crystal and cryo-EM structures but with homologous structures available in PDB, such as CDK20 kinase, AF2 demonstrates effectiveness as a homology modeling method for generating initial structures suitable for subsequent virtual screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> Other AF2-based homology modeling method can bias AF2-generated structures towards user-selected template structures with specific druggable conformations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> However, a significant drop in the hits enrichment factor during virtual screening has been reported when employing AF2 structures as rigid receptors for docking, compared to using holo PDB structures. This occurs even in cases where the binding pockets of AF2 structures differ only slightly at 2 to 3 residues, from those of holo PDBs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> Given that ligands can induce slight relocation and side-chain rotation of pocket residues upon binding, it is important to note that AF2 does not account for this induced-fit effect, as it does not encode co-factors like ligands. Therefore, it appears necessary to perform ligand induced-fit modeling or relaxation on AF2 structures before engaging in any further structure-based drug design. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations biased towards adjacent holo-template structure have proved effective in refining apo structures and improving their early enrichment performance. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> It has also been demonstrated that AF2 structures can achieve comparable accuracy to crystal holo structures in Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) calculations, by superposing AF2 structures with crystal structures, grafting the co-crystallized ligands onto the AF2 structure, and optimizing the AF2 structure/ligand complex to account for subtle induced-fit effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> AF2 structures, decorated with ligands from template ligand grafting method or known-hits docking method, and further refined by Schrödinger IFD-MD protocol, exhibit promising performance in early enrichment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and the prediction of novel ligand/protein complex structures. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Therefore, if large backbone motion is not required, it appears feasible to refine the apo pockets in AF2 structures into holo-like pockets for structure based drug design. However, when AF2 structures exhibit significant steric clashes with holo ligands, especially in cases ligands targeting metastable states, direct application of out-of-the-box AF2 structures in docking methods for virtual screening and early enrichment may pose more challenges. The AF2 predicted kinase structures predominantly exhibit the DFG-in state, with over 95% of human kinases predicted in this conformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> Significant A-loop motion and backbone flipping of the DFG motif are necessary to transition from the AF2-predicted DFG-in state to holo-like states, for type II ligands targeting the classical DFG-out state. As a result, AF2 structures of Abl1/DDR1 kinases exhibit superior performance when docking with type I inhibitors (achieving a minimum ligand RMSD of 2.14 Å) compared to docking with type II inhibitors using Glide XP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2 C&amp;D</xref>). Even with Glide’s Induced-fit Docking (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig21">Fig S16</xref>) and the highly side-chain clashes forgiving docking method DiffDock (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig25">Fig S20</xref>), AF2 structures struggle to dock with these metastable state-targeting ligands (type II inhibitors), with ligand RMSDs above 8 Å across all docking poses from all three docking methods.</p>

<title>Holo-like metastable structures may be present among decoys generated from rMSA AF2</title>
<p>AF2-based methods can achieve structural diversity by introducing dropouts in MSA inputs stochastically (rMSA AF2) or in a clustering manner (AF2-cluster). Additionally, models modified from the AF2 framework, such as the flow-match generative model AI- phaFlow,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> have been developed to explore the diversity of conformational space. Similar protocols to rMSA AF2 have demonstrated the potential to address the induced-fit effect by generating diverse structures at the binding pocket, ranging from closed apo pockets to opened holo-like pockets. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> Other investigations have also indicated that larger backbone motions, such as DFG-motif backbone flipping and A-loop movement in at least some protein kinases, can be captured by the rMSA AF2 ensemble, although the distributions of conformations deviate significantly from the correct Boltzmann distributions. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup></p>

<p>In this section, we utilized rMSA AF2 to generate 1280 diverse structures for Abl1 kinase or DDR1 kinase: 640 for MSAs of depth 16 and 32. See Supplementary Material for information regarding Src kinase. Following a filtering step based on RMSD from corresponding AF2 structures, 1198 and 1147 structures remain for Abl1 and DDR1, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig6">Fig S1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3 A&amp;B</xref>, for Abl1 kinase, only 4 out of 1198 structures have a folded A-loop, when using a distance cutoff of 15 Å between CB atoms of N98 and R162 in Abl1. However, for DDR1 kinase, 124 out of 1147 rMSA AF2 structures exhibit a folded A-loop, when using a salt bridge distance cutoff of 10 Å between the aligned residue pairs in DDR1 (E110 and R191). We then clustered the A-loop folded structures in the Dunbrack space. For Abl1, only two clusters were identified: one adopts the DFG-in state, and the other adopts the DFG-inter state, referring to an intermediate conformation during the backbone flipping from DFG-in to DFG-out, according to the Dunbrack definition. For DDR1, structures were divided into 5 clusters, with one cluster of size 15 being the closest to the classical DFG-out state.</p>
<p>We subsequently docked type II inhibitors, ponatinib and imatinib, to the most “classical DFG-out”-like cluster from rMSA AF2 ensembles (indicated as red circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3 A&amp;B</xref>), using IFD. Despite the A-loop being folded, the DFG-motif in structures from the Abl1 cluster is not strictly DFG-out. As expected, type II ligands fail to dock with those structures, with all IFD poses exhibiting ligand RMSDs above 9 Å (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig21">Fig S16 A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5 B</xref>). While AF2-based methods can indeed generate decoy structures that deviate from the native state, it remains uncertain whether these decoys correspond to metastable basins. Additionally, it’s unclear whether these decoys includes structures that can represent the specific metastable states required for the intended types of drug design.</p>
<p>In contrast to Abl1, rMSA AF2 ensemble for DDR1 contains holo-like structure for type II inhibitors. One structure (which we label the “holo-model”, shown as a red circle filled with green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3 B</xref>), out of the 15 in the DDR1 classical DFG-out cluster docked pona-tinib with a remarkably low RMSD of 0.89 Å using IFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3 C</xref>). However, IFD poses from all the other structures exhibit large ligand RMSDs above 6 Å (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig6">Fig S16 B</xref>). Hence, an enrichment process to select holo-like structures from decoys becomes essential to ensure a practical number of pocket structures for ensemble docking and virtual screening.</p>
<p>We have also docked the “holo-model” structure with another type II ligand, imatinib. In this case, the steric clashes are more significant, rendering the refinement for the induced-fit effect more challenging compared to the ponatinib scenario. We thus introduced an extra trimming step (see SI text for details) for the DFG-Phe residue which exhibit significant clashes with the holo-imatinib in the “holo-model” structure (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig22">Fig S17 B</xref>). The IFD-trim protocol successfully achieves a minimum ligand RMSD of 1.04 Å for docking poses of the “holo-model” structure with imatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3 C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig22">Fig S17 C&amp;D</xref>).</p>

<title>AF2RAVE on DDR1 enriches holo-like classical DFG-out structures in rMSA AF2 decoys</title>
<p>To assess the utility of physics-based methods in selecting holo-like structures from AF2- generated ensembles, we utilized a physics-based protocol, AF2RAVE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> to explore the energy landscape of DDR1 kinase. We employed the identical set of collective variables (CVs) as in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> to perform regular space clustering for the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble. Two structures were selected from the clustering centers for each combination of DFG type (in, inter, or out) and A-loop position (folded or extended), resulting in a total of 12 initial structures (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig7">Fig S2</xref>). Subsequently, 50 ns unbiased MD simulations were conducted starting from each initial structure. The CVs extracted from all MD trajectories were input into the SPIB model with a linear encoder, to learn the reaction coordinates indicative of the slow motions linked to transitions between metastable states. The learnt SPIB reaction coordinates possess clear physical interpretations, with the first coordinate signifying the A-loop position and the second indicating the DFG-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4 A&amp;B</xref>). This alignment with physical features is expected as we deliberately selected diverse and representative initial structures for unbiased MD simulations. Additionally, it’s noteworthy that these reaction coordinates are transferable across various kinases and can effectively discern different metastable states.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the 15 classical DFG-out structures within the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble are situated in a region of the latent space that were not thoroughly explored by the 12 unbiased MD trajectories. To address this gap, we employed enhanced sampling to sample along the SPIB-approximated reaction coordinates and compute the free energy profile inside the classical DFG-out basin. Considering both the flipping of the DFG motif and the overall motion of the large flexible A-loop, it might be impractical to sample direct back-and-forth transitions between various states using metadynamics. Therefore, we opted for umbrella sampling for its simplicity. The reliability of umbrella sampling hinges on two issues, first whether the latent space adequately represents the conformational space and second, whether there is sufficient overlap between different windows for efficient reweighting. Addressing the first challenge remains an ongoing endeavor in the dimensionality reduction research field, and we anticipate that our SPIB latent space is sufficient enough for our current purpose. The second challenge can be managed through careful setup of umbrella sampling windows and bias strength. Given our current setup, sampling the extensive motion of A-loop relocation remains challenging, showing insufficient overlap between the A-loop folded and extended regions (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig8">Fig S3</xref>). Consequently, the quantitative reliability of the absolute ΔG values between different states is limited, allowing us only to qualitatively assess the relative thermodynamic stability of the DFG-in versus the DFG-out basins. Nevertheless, the qualitative relative stability observed from umbrella sampling aligns with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig9">Fig S4</xref>). Furthermore, the local potential of mean force (PMF) surrounding each basin should provide quantitatively reliable insights, given their thorough sampling through umbrella sampling. Reassuringly, when we ranked the classical DFG-out structures within the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble, using the local PMF values in the latent space, the “holo-model” structure emerged among the top 2 structures with free energy relative to the minimum smaller than 1 kJ/mol, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4 D</xref>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we used DiffDock to conduct docking experiments with type II ligands on the 15 classical DFG-out structures within the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble. Despite poses from most structures surprisingly demonstrating very low ligand RMSD, typically below 2 Å (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig25">Fig S20</xref>), they exhibited significant steric clashes and low DiffDock confidence score due to Diffdock’s disregard for side-chain configurations and clashes. Notably, upon ranking structures based on their AF2RAVE PMF and examining the corresponding poses with the lowest ligand RMSD, we observed that only the poses derived from the top 2 structures selected by AF2RAVE had Diffdock confidence scores higher than −1.5, surpassing the default threshold of the DiffDock model (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="tbl2">Table S1</xref>). This implies the general advantage of structures selected by physics-based methods across various docking methods.</p>
<p>In summary, Boltzmann ranking from AF2RAVE effectively distinguishes holo-like structures from other decoys. Beginning with the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble, AF2RAVE substantially enhances the likelihood of identifying the holo-like structure from 1 out of 15 to at least 1 out of 2 when using a PMF cutoff of 1 kJ/mol. We noted that although the PMF values and Boltzmann ranks may fluctuate with the setup of umbrella sampling, the enrichment effect of holo-like structures remains (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig12">Fig S7</xref>). Besides, we applied an alternative protocol to compute the PMF profile within the DDR1 classical DFG-out basin, by running unbiased MD simulations starting from the 15 classical DFG-out decoys in the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble. However, this unbiased protocol poses a risk of failing to sample rare events if barriers exit within the region of interest. In this case, the minibarriers inside the classical DFG-out basin are low enough to enable efficient sampling using 50 ns unbiased MD simulations. Consequently, the Boltzmann ranks derived from unbiased MD simulations also successfully enriched the single holo-like structure in the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble to the top 5 of the structure set (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig16">Fig S11</xref>).</p>

<title>Transferable learning of holo-like structure for Abl1 and Src kinases with AF2RAVE from DDR1 templates</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, our current Abl1 rMSA AF2 ensemble lacks any decoy structure in the classical DFG-out state. This is further illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5 A</xref>, where the Abl1 rMSA AF2 ensemble is projected onto the same latent space learnt during the DDR1 AF2RAVE protocol. Hence, it’s necessary to prepare the Abl1 decoy set adopting the classical DFG-out state before we can rank them using Boltzmann weights derived from physics-based methods and conduct further docking for selected holo-like structures.</p>
<p>There are several approaches to generate the Abl1 decoy sets. One can conduct enhanced sampling on the latent space starting from Abl1 rMSA AF2 structures to reach the classical DFG-out basin. Subsequently, MD structures from this basin can serve as templates for asking AF2 to generate crystal-like structures in classical DFG-out state. However, for simplicity, we opted to use the 15 classical DFG-out structures from the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble directly as templates and employed an AF2-based homology modeling protocol, referred to as AF2-template (tAF2 for short, detailed protocol can be found in the SI text), to generate a decoy set comprising 30 Abl1 structures, as illustrated by the green stars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5 A</xref>.</p>
<p>Compared to the AF2 and rMSA AF2 structures, the performance of IFD on type II inhibitors shows a significant improvement when using the 30 tAF2 decoy structures of Abl1. The lowest ligand RMSD achieved is 2.74 Å for imatinib and 0.78 Å for ponatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5 B</xref>). However, only 4 structures (labeled as “holo-model” structures hereafter) out of the 30 decoys are capable of docking with type II inhibitors with ligand RMSD &lt; 3 Å, and all other structures produce IFD poses with ligand RMSD&gt; 6 Å (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig23">Fig S18</xref>).</p>

<p>We then investigated whether physics-based methods could enrich the 4 “holo-model” structures from the 30 tAF2 decoys to a practical number of holo-like candidates. To explore the local classical DFG-out basin, we conducted 50 ns unbiased MD simulations starting from each tAF2 decoy structure and combined the trajectories to obtain the final Boltzmann distribution. Remarkably, the PMF for the Abl1 classical DFG-out basin calculated from the unbiased protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5 C</xref>) showed the enrichment of all 4 “holo-model” structures among the top 8 tAF2 structures with PMF value &lt; 1 kJ/mol.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Through our retrospective analysis, we have thus demonstrated that the default AlphaFold2 models are ineffective for docking ligands targeting metastable protein kinase conformations. While AF2-based methods can be coaxed into generating diverse structures, they still struggle to produce reliable accuracy decoys for metastable conformations since the AF2 ensembles do not follow Boltzmann distribution. This failure is evident in the inability to generate an Abl1 AF2-ensemble containing holo-like structures for type II inhibitors. To further investigate whether this limitation is common among AF2-based methods, including the rMSA AF2 method we employed earlier, we tested another AF2-based approach, AF2-cluster.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> The AF2-cluster ensemble of Abl1 comprises more A-loop folded structures (21 out of 197) compared to our Abl1 rMSA AF2 ensemble (4 out of 1198). However, similar to rMSA AF2, there are still no decoys in the classical DFG-out state, and all A-loop folded structures are located far from the PMF basin of the classical DFG-out state in the latent space (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig19">Fig S14 C</xref>). This indicates that AF2-cluster, like rMSA AF2, also fails to generate Abl1 metastable states effectively. Interestingly, we observed comparable structural diversity in sampling the A-loop folded configurations within the AF2-cluster ensembles for DDR1 and Abl1 (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig19">Fig S14 C&amp;D</xref>). While for the rMSA AF2 method, the promiscuous kinase DDR1 ensemble exhibit superior structural diversity compared to the Abl1 kinase. This enhanced diversity leads to the identification of one dockable structure for type II inhibitors among decoys in DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble. Through the application of a homology modeling method, AF2-template, we demonstrated that the classical DFG-out decoys in the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble can be transferred to Abl1 kinase. Furthermore, we tested an additional kinase, Src, for which non-native state decoys are reported to be even more challenging to produce using AF2 subsampling methods than Abl1 kinase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> We have also verified that rMSA AF2 and AF2-cluster struggle in producing distinct decoys from native structure of Src kinase (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig6">Fig S1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig17">Fig S12</xref>). Besides, neither the rMSA AF2 nor the AF2- cluster ensembles for Src kinase adequately sample the classical DFG-out basin in the latent space (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig18">Fig S13</xref>). Remarkably, AF2-template, as a homolgy modelling method, can easily produce the classical DFG-out structure of Src kinase, using the top 2 AF2RAVE-picked DDR1 classical DFG-out structures as templates (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig14">Fig S9</xref>). The IFD poses from the tAF2 structure of Src kinase shown a minimal ligand RMSD of 2.82 Å with imatinib (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig24">Fig S19</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>AlphaFold2 has arguably revolutionized protein structure prediction, but it remains to be constructively demonstrated if it can be reliably used for drug discovery purposes, especially involving non-native protein conformations. In this work we have demonstrated through retrospective studies on kinase inhibitors that a combination of AlphaFold2, statistical mechanics based enhanced sampling and induced fit docking can be deployed for such calculations. Specifically, we have utilized the AF2RAVE protocol by inputting the sequences of the DDR1 kinases, along with two additional pieces of prior information: a pairwise distance cutoff for evaluating A-loop positions and the Dunbrack definition of DFG-type. We then employed Glide Induced-fit Docking (IFD) to assess our AF2RAVE-generated computational models for type II kinase inhibitor binding pockets. This AF2RAVE-Glide workflow yielded holo-like structure candidates with a 50% successful docking rate for known type II inhibitors. Notably, the holo-like structures in metastable state and the latent space constructed from AF2RAVE of DDR1 are transferable to other kinases. This includes the challenging cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> of Abl1 and Src kinases, wherein we showed that SPIB and sampling performed for DDR1 allowed generating classical DFG-out structures for both Abl1 and Src kinases. This severely reduces the computational cost for retraining SPIB to learn low-dimensional latent space for different kinases.</p>
<p>This demonstration of AF2RAVE-Glide on kinase inhibitors shows its promising application for discovering drugs targeting general proteins in addition to kinases, such as G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), which are the targets for over one-third of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> For the design of novel drugs targeting general proteins, developing a protocol that does not require prior information about the system is left for future exploration. Besides, in this study we only investigate the classical DFG-out metastable state for kinases. For a comprehensive protocol, all top-ranked metastable states identified by AF2RAVE should be explored in subsequent docking experiments. Integration of algorithms capable of predicting ligand binding sites on protein surfaces, such as the Graph Attention Site Prediction (GrASP) model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> is then essential before utilizing AF2RAVE-selected structures in docking, thus expanding the workflow to AF2RAVE-GrASP-Glide. Additionally, the inclusion of free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations for front-runner ligands to evaluate the actual ligand binding affinity can further enhance this workflow.</p>
<p>The integration of AF2-based and physics-based methods presents a promising approach toward the development of a mature workflow for computer-aided drug design. AF2-based methods are capable of producing ensembles with structural diversity, which aids physics-based methods in better sampling and exploring the energy landscape of proteins. Additionally, AF2-generated structures can serve as crystal-like decoys, free from distortion that may occur in biased simulations. Physics-based methods play a crucial role in accurately assigning Boltzmann weights and ranking decoy structures to guide the enrichment of holo-like structures, essential for virtual screening on large libraries. This collaborative approach leverages the strengths of both methodologies, leading to enhanced efficiency and efficacy in drug discovery efforts.</p>
<p>We conclude this manuscript by making a final comment on the horizons opened by Generative AI methods, including those involving diffusion models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> and any such future frameworks. These approaches make it possible to easily hypothesize regions of the conformational space underlying arbitrarily complex molecules of life, that then could serve as a starting point to launch more careful investigations. However, these predictions without careful <italic>in situ</italic> or <italic>a posteriori</italic> testing through advanced simulations or experiments, are only predictions and could just be hallucinations. Having the capability to quickly generate numerous - thousands or more - such structural hypotheses is what made AlphaFold2 so crucial to this current work. We believe that a deep integration of the hypothesis creation possibilities of Generative AI with careful Molecular Dynamics, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> experiments or other forms of rapid testing is one way these methods will truly facilitate new and reliable scientific discoveries.</p>

<title>Summary of systems tested and tools used</title>
<p>In this work we tested AF2RAVE-Glide protocol on active and inactive conformations of DDR1, Abl1 and Src kinases against type I inhibitors VX-680 and Dasatinib, and type II inhibitors Imatinib and Ponatinib. The top-ranked structures obtained from AF2RAVE-Glide were compared against publicly available crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with PDB codes provided in the main text.</p>
<p>To generate diverse structural ensembles for DDR1, Abl1, and Src kinases, we primarily used the reduced MSA AF2 (rMSA AF2) method. For comparison, we also produced AF2-cluster ensembles for these three kinases.</p>
<p>For MD simulations, all the systems in this paper were parameterized with the Amber99SB*- ILDN force field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> with the TIP3P water model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and neutralized with Na<sup>+</sup> ions or Cl<sup>−</sup> ions. The simulations are performed at 300 K with the LangevinMiddleIntegrator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> in OpenMM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> with the step size of 2 fs. Particle Mesh Ewald<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> is used for calculating electrostatics and the lengths of bonds to hydrogen atoms are constrained using LINCS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> throughout all simulations. Before performing MD simulations for analysis, energy minimization is conducted for all initial structures, followed by equilibrium runs under NVT and NPT for 500 ps and 1 ns respectively.</p>
<p>To account for the induced-fit effect, Induced-Fit Docking (IFD) from the Schrödinger suite is the primary docking method used in this work. For comparison, we also tested the Glide XP docking from the Schrödinger suite and DiffDock to dock the two known type II inhibitors (Imatinib and Ponatinib) against DDR1 AF2 structure and the 15 classical DFG-out structures in the DDR1 rMSA ensemble.</p>

<title>Generation of rMSA AF2 ensemble, AF2-cluster ensemble and AF2- template structures</title>
<p>In this work, Colabfold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> was employed to generate all the AF2-based ensembles and structures. The multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were produced using mmseq2. For rMSA AF2 ensembles, the MSA depth was reduced to either 16 or 32 for each kinase. For each depth, 128 random seeds were utilized, and each seed produced 5 structural models via Colabfold, resulting in a total of 1280 rMSA AF2 structures per kinase. The structure with the highest pLDDT score among all 1280 was identified as the AF2 structure (native structure). Subsequently, any unphysical structures with an RMSD greater than 7 Å from the AF2 structure were discarded, culminating in the final rMSA AF2 ensembles.</p>
<p>AF2-cluster for DDR1, Abl1 and SrcK were run with default setups as provided in the ColabFold notebook in the original paper of AF2-cluster.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The AF2-based homology modeling protocol, AF2-template (tAF2) method is implemented using Colabfold. For a given query sequence, tAF2 structures are generated by Colabfold upon uploading desired template structure and deactivating the Evoformer module. For each template, 5 AF2-template models are generated, and the last 3 structures exhibiting lower pLDDT will be discarded. The AF2-template (tAF2) method is employed here to transfer structure sets between homologous systems. To generate tAF2 structures for Abl1 in the classical DFG-out state, each of the 15 classical DFG-out structures from the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble is used as a template, resulting in 30 tAF2 Abl1 structures in total. For Src kinase, a single representative tAF2 structure is generated using the “holo-model” DDR1 structure as the template.</p>

<title>PMF calculations from umbrella sampling</title>
<p>2D umbrella sampling is conducted along the two learnt SPIB coordinates, employing 11x11 windows. The bias potential equilibrium points are uniformly distributed in the SPIB latent space, with σ<sub>1</sub> ranging from −0.8 to −0.1 and σ<sub>2</sub> ranging from 0 to 0.8. The strength of the bias potential is set to 1000 <italic>kJ/mol/nm</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Each window originates from the structure closest to the window’s equilibrium point in Euclidean distance within the latent space among the 12 AF2RAVE initial structures and lasts for 100 ns (with the first 10 ns discarded in PMF calculation). For Abl1 kinase, we noticed a substantial proportion of the αC helix breaking in the umbrella sampling trajectories (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig10">Fig S5</xref>). This finding aligns with earlier enhanced sampling investigations on DDR1 using metadynamics, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> where the authors imposed restraints to prevent αC helix breakage. In our study, we opted to exclude all umbrella sampling windows where the ratio of broken αC helix exceeded 20% for the Abl1 PMF calculation (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig11">Fig S6</xref>). The WHAM algorithm is applied to bin and reweight the biased trajectories and compute the final PMF.</p>

<title>PMF calculations from unbiased MD</title>
<p>50 ns unbiased MD simulation was run starting from each structure in the 15 classical DFG-out structures in DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble. Upon discarding first 10 ns, all the unbiased trajectories are simply concatenated to calculate the Boltzmann distribution and PMF for each bin around the classical DFG-out basin in the latent space. For Abl1, unbiased simulations start from 30 AF2-template structures to calculate the PMF around the classical DFG-out basin.</p>

<title>Boltzmann ranks assignment for structures in AF2-based ensembles</title>
<p>After calculating the PMF value for each bin in the latent space, we projected AF2- generated structures into latent space. We then directly assign the PMF values of the corresponding bins to these AF2-generated structures.</p>
<p>We must acknowledge the limitations of the way we assigned PMF values to AF-generated candidate holo structures. First of all, the free energy profiles are derived from MD simulations, and the PMF values directly correspond to the MD structures. Here, we assumed that the latent space adequately represents the conformational changes of protein pocket within specific metastable states. Additionally, while the enrichment of holo structures in the top Boltzmann-ranked structures persists, the absolute PMF values and Boltzmann ranks of proper holo structures may fluctuate with the umbrella sampling setups, as depicted in <xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig12">Fig S7</xref>. Theoretically, the number of umbrella sampling windows and the simulation length should be sufficiently large for PMF convergence. However, there is always a trade-off between PMF accuracy and computational costs, so we opted to stick with the current setups.</p>

<title>Docking details</title>
<p>All the input structure for our docking experiments were first relaxed in solution with a MD energy minimization step. This work investigates two type I inhibitors (VX-680 and dasatinib) and two type II inhibitors (imatinib and ponatinib) by docking. For Glide XP docking or IFD, we used Ligprep in Maestro to prepare the ligand inputs from SMILES files. For DiffDock, the ligand inputs were directly provided as SMILES files.</p>
<sec id="s5-4-1">
<title>Glide XP Docking</title>
<p>Glide XP docking experiments in this work were run with default setups in the Maestro software. Glide XP docking was performed for all four ligands on the AF2 structures of DDR1 or Abl1, as well as on the 15 classical DFG-out conformations of DDR1 in the rMSA AF2 ensemble.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5-4-2">
<title>Induced-Fit Docking (IFD)</title>
<p>For Induced-fit Docking, we used the Glide XP for initial docking, followed by Prime relaxation and final Glide XP docking. Parameters remain default in Maestro IFD. IFD was performed only for the type II ligands on the AF2 structures of DDR1 or Abl1, on the classical DFG-out conformations of DDR1 or Abl1 in the rMSA AF2 ensembles, as well as tAF2 structures of Abl1 and SrcK.</p>
<p>Given ponatinib’s backbone features, notably its lengthy and slender carbon-carbon triple bond, it exhibits reduced sensitivity to steric clashes, resulting in successful docking with the DDR1 “holo-model” structure at a ligand RMSD of 0.89 Å. Conversely, the “holomodel” structure struggles to accurately dock with imatinib using IFD (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig20">Fig S15B</xref>). We then employed an extended-sampling IFD approach by initially trimming the DFG-Phe residue from the “holo-model” structure. The trimmed residue is temporarily mutated to alanine during initial docking and later restored in subsequent Prime relaxation and final docking steps. Here, in the “holo-model” structure, we manually chose the DFG-Phe residue which is significantly hindered by holo-imatinib (<xref ref-type="supplement" rid="fig21">Fig S16B</xref>). For generic systems lacking groundtruth information, broader screening of single residue trimming for the protein pocket may be necessary for this extended-sampling IFD method. In essence, it’s a tradeoff between the quality of holo-like structure to dock with and the accuracy/complexity of the docking method.</p>

<title>Diffdock performace on DDR1 classical DFG-out in rMSA AF2 ensemble</title>
<p>DiffDock docking experiments in this work were run in the webserver with default setups in the version before 3/8/2024 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/simonduerr/diffdock">https://huggingface.co/spaces/simonduerr/diffdock</ext-link>). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> DiffDock was performed only for type II ligands on the AF2 structures of DDR1, as well as on the 15 classical DFG-out conformations of DDR1 in the rMSA AF2 ensemble.</p>

<caption><p>The plot illustrates the number of gaps in the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) generated by mmseq2 (using Colabfold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) for different kinases. The non-gap count describes the coverage of each position in the MSA. The presence of residue positions with gap counts higher than 40 per cent of the total sequence in DDR1 implies that it has fewer conserved regions than abl1 kinase and src kinase. This characteristic of DDR1 MSA enables the rMSA AF2 protocol to generate multiple conformations for DDR1, including the classical DFG-out conformation, by initializing it at various states. However, the highly conserved nature of abl1 and src makes it challenging for the rMSA AF2 to initialize at a state that can lead to a classical DFGout conformation. Therefore, we used the AlphaFold template protocol to overcome this initialization issue with rMSA AF2.</p></caption>

<p>The development of effective computational methods for protein-ligand binding remains an outstanding challenge to the field of drug design. This impressive computational study combines a variety of structure prediction (AlphaFold2) and sampling (RAVE) tools to generate holo-like protein structures of three kinases (DDR1, Abl1, and Src kinases) for binding to type I and type II inhibitors. Of central importance to the work is the conformational state of the Asp-Phy-Gly &quot;DFG motif&quot; where the Asp points inward (DFG-in) in the active state and outward (DFG-out) in the inactive state. The kinases bind to type I or type II inhibitors when in the DFG-in or DFG-out states, respectively.</p>
<p>It is noted that while AlphaFold2 can be effective in generating ligand-free apo protein structures, it is ineffective at generating holo structures appropriate for ligand binding. Starting from the native apo structure, structural fluctuations are necessary to access holo-like structures appropriate for ligand-binding. A variety of methods, including reduced multiple sequence alignment (rMSA), AF2-cluster, and AlphaFlow may be used to create decoy structures. However, those methods can be limited in the diversity of structures generated and lack a physics-based analysis of Boltzmann weight critical to their relative evaluation.</p>
<p>To address this need, the authors combine AlphaFold2 with the Reweighted Autoencoded Variational Bayes for Enhanced Sampling (RAVE) method, to explore metastable states and create a Boltzmann ranking. With that variety of structures in hand, grid-based docking methods Glide and Induced-Fit Docking (IFD) were used to generate protein-ligand (kinase-inhibitor) complexes.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that using AlphaFold2 alone, there is a failure to generate DFG-out structures needed for binding to type II inhibitors. By applying the AlphaFold2 with rMSA followed by RAVE (using short MD trajectories, SPIB-based collective variable analysis, and enhanced sampling using umbrella sampling), metastable DFG-out structures with Boltzmann weighting are generated enabling protein-ligand binding. Moreover, the authors found that the successful sampling of DFG-out states for one kinase (DDR1) could be used to model similar states for other proteins (Abl1 and Src kinase). The AF2RAVE approach is shown to result in a set of holo-like protein structures with a 50% rate of docking type II inhibitors.</p>
<p>Overall, this is excellent work and a valuable contribution to the field that demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art computational methods for protein-ligand binding. The authors also suggest promising directions for future study, noting that potential enhancements in the workflow may result from the use of binding site prediction models and free energy perturbation calculations.</p>

<p>This manuscript explores the utility of AlphaFold2 (AF2) and the author's own AF2-RAVE method for drug discovery. As has been observed elsewhere, the predictive power of docking against AF2 structures is quite limited, particularly for proteins like kinases that have non-trivial conformational dynamics. However, using enhanced sampling methods like RAVE to explore beyond AF2 starting structures leads to a significant improvement.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors aim to enhance AlphaFold2 for protein conformation-selective drug discovery through the integration of AlphaFold2 and physics-based methods, focusing on improving the accuracy of predicting protein structures ensemble and small molecule binding of metastable protein conformations to facilitate targeted drug design.</p>
<p>The major strength of the paper lies in the methodology, which includes the innovative integration of AlphaFold2 with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking to produce protein ensembles with structural diversity. Moreover, the generated structures can be used as reliable crystal-like decoys to enrich metastable conformations of holo-like structures. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in producing metastable structures of three different protein kinases and perform docking with their type I and II inhibitors. The paper provides strong evidence supporting the potential impact of this technology in drug discovery. However, limitations may exist in the generalizability of the approach across other structures, especially complex structures such as protein-protein or DNA-protein complexes.</p>
<p>The authors largely achieved their aims by demonstrating that the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow can generate holo-like structure candidates with a 50% successful docking rate for known type II inhibitors. This work is likely to have a significant impact on the field by offering a more precise and efficient method for predicting protein structure ensemble, which is essential for designing targeted drugs. The utility of the integrated AF2RAVE-Glide approach may streamline the drug discovery process, potentially leading to the development of more effective and specific medications for various diseases.</p>

Starting from the native apo structure, structural fluctuations are necessary to access holo-like structures appropriate for ligand binding. A variety of methods, including reduced multiple sequence alignment (rMSA), AF2-cluster, and AlphaFlow may be used to create decoy structures. However, those methods can be limited in the diversity of structures generated and lack a physics-based analysis of Boltzmann weight critical to their relative evaluation.</p>
<p>To address this need, the authors combine AlphaFold2 with the Reweighted Autoencoded Variational Bayes for Enhanced Sampling (RAVE) method, to explore metastable states and create a Boltzmann ranking. With that variety of structures in hand, grid-based docking methods Glide and Induced-Fit Docking (IFD) were used to generate protein-ligand (kinase-inhibitor) complexes.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that using AlphaFold2 alone, there is a failure to generate DFG-out structures needed for binding to type II inhibitors. By applying the AlphaFold2 with rMSA followed by RAVE (using short MD trajectories, SPIB-based collective variable analysis, and enhanced sampling using umbrella sampling), metastable DFG-out structures with Boltzmann weighting are generated enabling protein-ligand binding. Moreover, the authors found that the successful sampling of DFG-out states for one kinase (DDR1) could be used to model similar states for other proteins (Abl1 and Src kinase). The AF2RAVE approach is shown to result in a set of holo-like protein structures with a 50% rate of docking type II inhibitors.</p>
<p>Overall, this is excellent work and a valuable contribution to the field that demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art computational methods for protein-ligand binding. The authors also suggest promising directions for future study, noting that potential enhancements in the workflow may result from the use of binding site prediction models and free energy perturbation calculations.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript explores the utility of AlphaFold2 (AF2) and the author's own AF2-RAVE method for drug discovery. As has been observed elsewhere, the predictive power of docking against AF2 structures is quite limited, particularly for proteins like kinases that have non-trivial conformational dynamics. However, using enhanced sampling methods like RAVE to explore beyond AF2 starting structures leads to a significant improvement.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a nice demonstration of the utility of the authors' previously published RAVE method.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>My only concern is the authors' discussion of induced fit. I'm quite confident the structures discussed are present in the absence of ligand binding, consistent with conformational selection. It seems the author's own data also argues for an important role in conformational selection. It would be nice to acknowledge this instead of going along with the common practice in drug discovery of attributing any conformational changes to induced fit without thoughtful consideration of conformational selection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct. We aim to highlight the significant role of conformational selection. To clarify this, we have expanded the discussion on conformational selection in the introduction.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors aim to enhance AlphaFold2 for protein conformation-selective drug discovery through the integration of AlphaFold2 and physics-based methods, focusing on improving the accuracy of predicting protein structures ensemble and small molecule binding of metastable protein conformations to facilitate targeted drug design.</p>
<p>The major strength of the paper lies in the methodology, which includes the innovative integration of AlphaFold2 with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking to produce protein ensembles with structural diversity. Moreover, the generated structures can be used as reliable crystal-like decoys to enrich metastable conformations of holo-like structures. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in producing metastable structures of three different protein kinases and perform docking with their type I and II inhibitors. The paper provides strong evidence supporting the potential impact of this technology in drug discovery. However, limitations may exist in the generalizability of the approach across other structures, especially complex structures such as protein-protein or DNA-protein complexes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Proteins undergo thermodynamic fluctuations and can occasionally reach metastable configurations. It can be assumed that other biomolecules, such as proteins and DNA, stabilize these metastable states when forming protein-protein or protein-DNA complexes. Since our method has the potential to identify these metastable states, it shows promise for designing drugs targeting proteins in allosteric configurations induced by other biomolecules.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors largely achieved their aims by demonstrating that the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow can generate holo-like structure candidates with a 50% successful docking rate for known type II inhibitors. This work is likely to have a significant impact on the field by offering a more precise and efficient method for predicting protein structure ensemble, which is essential for designing targeted drugs. The utility of the integrated AF2RAVE-Glide approach may streamline the drug discovery process, potentially leading to the development of more effective and specific medications for various diseases.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggestions</p>
<p>(1) The computational protocol is found to be insufficient to generate precise values of the relative free energies between structures generated. The authors note in the Conclusion that an enhancement in the workflow might result from the addition of free energy calculations. Can the authors comment on the prospects for generating more accurate estimates of the free energy that might be used to qualitatively evaluate poses and the free energy landscape surrounding putative metastable states? What are the principal challenges and what might help overcome them? What would the most effective computational protocol be?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>More accurate estimates of the free energy can theoretically be achieved by increasing the number of umbrella sampling windows and extending the simulation length until the PMF converges. However, there is always a trade-off between PMF accuracy and computational costs, so we have chosen to stick with the current setup. Metadynamics is another method to obtain a more accurate free energy profile, which we have used in previous versions of AlphaFold2-RAVE, but for the specific systems we investigated, it had issues in achieving back and forth movement given the high entropic nature of the activation loop. Research in enhanced sampling methods and dimensionality reduction techniques for reaction coordinates is continually evolving and will play a critical role in alleviating this problem.</p>

<p>(2) I was surprised that there was not more correlation of a funnel-like shape in Figures S16 and S18, showing a stronger correlation between low RMSD and better docking score. This is true for both the ponatinib and imatinib applications in DDR1 and Abl1. That also seems true for the trimmed results for Src kinase in Figure S19. I was also surprised that there are structures with very large RMSD but docking scores comparable to the best structures of the lowest RMSD. Might something be done to make the docking score a more effective discriminator?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The docking algorithm and docking score are used to filter out highly improbable docking poses. False positives in predicted docking poses are a common issue across all docking methods as described for instance in:</p>
<p>Fan, Jiyu, Ailing Fu, and Le Zhang. &quot;Progress in molecular docking.&quot; Quantitative Biology 7 (2019): 83-89.</p>
<p>Ferreira, R.S., Simeonov, A., Jadhav, A., Eidam, O., Mott, B.T., Keiser, M.J., McKerrow, J.H., Maloney, D.J., Irwin, J.J. and Shoichet, B.K., 2010. &quot;Complementarity between a docking and a high-throughput screen in discovering new cruzain inhibitors.&quot; Journal of medicinal chemistry, 53(13), pp.4891-4905.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is always a trade-off between docking accuracy and computational cost. While employing more accurate docking methods may decrease false positives, it can also be resource-intensive. In such scenarios, our approach to enriching holo-structures can be impactful by reducing the number of pocket structures in the input ensembles and significantly enhancing docking efficiency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) I think that it is fine to identify one structure as &quot;IFD winner&quot; but also feel that its significance is overstressed, especially given that it can be identified only in a retrospective analysis rather than through de novo prediction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. We did not intend to emphasize the specific structure &quot;IFD winner&quot;. Rather, we aimed to demonstrate that our method can enrich promising candidates for holo-structures. We verified this by showing that our holo-structure candidates performed well in retrospective docking using IFD, which we previously referred to as &quot;IFD winner&quot;. We have now revised this term to &quot;holo-model&quot;.</p>
