<title>Abstract</title><p>Eukaryotic cells control inorganic phosphate to balance its role as essential macronutrient with its negative bioenergetic impact on reactions liberating phosphate. Phosphate homeostasis depends on the conserved INPHORS signaling pathway that utilizes inositol pyrophosphates (IPPs) and SPX receptor domains. Since cells synthesize various IPPs and SPX domains bind them promiscuously, it is unclear whether a specific IPP regulates SPX domains in vivo, or whether multiple IPPs act as a pool. In contrast to previous models, which postulated that phosphate starvation is signaled by increased production of the IPP 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, we now show that the levels of all detectable IPPs of yeast, 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>, strongly decline upon phosphate starvation. Among these, specifically the decline of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> triggers the transcriptional phosphate starvation response, the PHO pathway. 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> inactivates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Pho81 through its SPX domain. This stimulates the cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85-Pho80 to phosphorylate the transcription factor Pho4 and repress the PHO pathway. Combining our results with observations from other systems we propose a unified model where 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> signals cytosolic phosphate abundance to SPX proteins in fungi, plants, and mammals. Its absence triggers starvation responses.</p>

<title>Significance statement</title>
<p>Cytosolic P<sub>i</sub> is of prime importance for cellular bioenergetics because P<sub>i</sub> influences free energy of nucleotide hydrolysis and the metabolite fluxes through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Eukaryotic cells use the INPHORS pathway to signal P<sub>i</sub> via SPX domains and their ligands, inositol pyrophosphates (IP<sub>7</sub>, IP<sub>8</sub>), which control P<sub>i</sub> homeostasis through a network of target proteins that import, export, store or detoxify P<sub>i</sub>.

<p>We performed the first time-resolved profiling of the full isomer spectrum of inositol pyrophosphates in yeast and dissected the isomer that is relevant to intracellular P<sub>i</sub> signaling. Our results can be combined with existing observations from plants, mammals, and other fungi to support a unified model of P<sub>i</sub> signaling across all eukaryotic kingdoms, which is in accord with the fundamental importance of P<sub>i</sub> management for metabolism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) is an essential nutrient for all living systems. While required in large amounts for synthesis of nucleic acids, phospholipids and phosphorylated carbohydrates and proteins, an overaccumulation of P<sub>i</sub> decreases the free energy provided by P<sub>i</sub>-liberating reactions, such as nucleotide hydrolysis, which might stall metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In fungi, plants and animals, control of P<sub>i</sub> homeostasis involves <italic>myo</italic>-inositol pyrophosphates (IPPs) and a family of evolutionarily conserved SPX domains, constituting the core of a postulated signaling pathway that we termed INPHORS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>SPX domains interact with or form part of a large variety of proteins that affect P<sub>i</sub> homeostasis by transporting P<sub>i</sub> across membranes, converting it into polyphosphates (polyP) or other metabolites, or regulating P<sub>i</sub>-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Direct regulation of an SPX-containing protein by synthetic IPPs was shown for the polyP polymerase VTC, the P<sub>i</sub> transporters Pho91 and the PHR transcription factors in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). A firm link suggesting the SPX domain as the receptor for inositol pyrophosphate regulation was provided by point mutants in the SPX domain that rendered VTC either independent of activation by IPPs, or non-responsive to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Structural analysis revealed that many of these mutations localized to a highly charged region that can bind inositol poly- and pyrophosphates with high affinity. However, this binding site discriminates poorly between different IPPs at the level of binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). By contrast, strong differences are observed in the agonist properties, leading to the suggestion that binding affinity is a poor predictor of IPP specificity and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>IPPs that can be found in a wide variety of organisms carry seven (IP<sub>7</sub>) or eight (IP<sub>8</sub>) phosphates occupying every position around myo-inositol ring. The IP<sub>7</sub> isomers 1PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> and 5PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> carry diphosphate groups at the 1- or 5-position, respectively, and 1,5(PP)<sub>2</sub>-InsP<sub>4</sub> carries two diphosphate groups at the 1 and 5 position. For convenience, we refer to these IPPs as 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> from hereon. All three IPPs are linked to phosphate homeostasis by the fact that genetic ablation of the enzymes making them, such as IP6Ks (inositol hexakisphosphate kinases), PPIP5Ks (diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases) and ITPKs (inositol tris/tetrakisphosphate kinases), alters the phosphate starvation response. Considerable discrepancies exist in the assignment of these IPPs to different aspects of P<sub>i</sub> homeostasis. In mammalian cells, 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> activates the only SPX-protein expressed in this system, the P<sub>i</sub> exporter XPR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> was also proposed as a regulator of the phosphate starvation response in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> because 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>, but not 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, promotes the interaction of SPX1 with the P<sub>i</sub>-responsive transcription factor PHR1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). On the other hand, quantitative measurements of the interaction of IPPs with rice SPX4 and its cognate P<sub>i</sub>-responsive transcription factor PHR2 revealed only a minor, twofold difference in the K<sub>d</sub> values for 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> all decrease upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation and mutants lacking either of the enzymes necessary for their synthesis in plants, the ITPKs and the PPIP5Ks, induce the phosphate starvation response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Analysis of respective <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants revealed that P<sub>i</sub> concentration in shoots correlates poorly with their content of IP<sub>7</sub> and IP<sub>8</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). While <italic>itpk1</italic> mutants, lacking one of the enzymes that generates 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, have similar 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> content as wildtype, their P<sub>i</sub> content is almost two-fold increased and their 5-IP<sub>7</sub> content is reduced by a factor of four. Inversely, mutants lacking the PPIP5K VIH2 show a 5-fold reduction of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> but normal P<sub>i</sub> content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Although 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> is the IPP that is the most responsive to Pi starvation and P<sub>i</sub> re-feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) this has rendered it difficult to clearly resolve whether IP<sub>7</sub>, IP<sub>8</sub>, or both, signal cellular P<sub>i</sub> status to the P<sub>i</sub> starvation program <italic>in vivo</italic>. That plants are composed of multiple source and sink tissues for phosphate may complicate the analysis, because systemic knockouts of IPP synthesizing enzymes may exert their main effect in a tissue that is different from the one where the starvation response is scored.</p>
<p>Pioneering studies on the regulation of the P<sub>i</sub> starvation program of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the PHO pathway, concluded that this transcriptional response is triggered by an increase in 1-IP<sub>7</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), whereas subsequent studies in the pathogenic yeast <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> proposed 5-IP<sub>7</sub> as the necessary signaling compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Studies using the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> polyphosphate polymerase VTC as a model suggested that this enzyme, which is necessary for polyP accumulation under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions, is stimulated by 5-IP<sub>7</sub> in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), whereas studies in <italic>S. pombe</italic> proposed IP<sub>8</sub> as the stimulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). <italic>S. pombe</italic> has similar enzymes for IP<sub>8</sub> synthesis and hydrolysis as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). In contrast to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, genetic ablation of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and IP<sub>8</sub> production in <italic>S. pombe</italic> leads to hyper-repression of the transcriptional phosphate starvation response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) and interferes with the induction of the transcriptional phosphate starvation response. However, the transcriptional phosphate starvation response in <italic>S. pombe</italic> occurs through a different set of protein mediators. For example, it lacks homologs of Pho81 and uses Csk1 instead of Pho85-Pho80 for phosphate-dependent transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Furthermore, PHO pathway promotors in <italic>S. pombe</italic> overlap with and are strongly regulated by lncRNA transcription units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). It is hence difficult to compare the downstream events in this system to the PHO pathway of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>
<p>The discrepancies mentioned above could either reflect a true divergence in the signaling properties of different IPPs in different organisms, in which case a common and evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism may not exist. Alternatively, the diverging interpretations could reflect limitations in the analytics of IPPs and in the <italic>in vivo</italic> assays for the fundamental processes of P<sub>i</sub> homeostasis. The analysis of IPPs is indeed very challenging in numerous ways. Their cellular concentrations are very low, the molecules are highly charged, and they exist in multiple isomers that differ only in the positioning of the pyrophosphate groups. IPP analysis has traditionally been performed by ion exchange HPLC of extracts from cells radiolabeled through <sup>3</sup>H-inositol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). This approach requires constraining and slow labeling schemes, is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, HPLC-based approaches in most cases did not resolve isomers of IP<sub>7</sub> or IP<sub>8</sub>. These factors severely limited the number of samples and conditions that could be processed and the resolution of the experiments.</p>
<p>The recent use of capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS) has dramatically improved the situation, permitting resolution of many regio-isomers of IP<sub>7</sub> and IP<sub>8</sub> without radiolabeling, and at superior sensitivity and throughput. We harnessed the potential of this method to dissect the role of the three known IPPs that accumulate in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We analyzed their impact on the PHO pathway, which is a paradigm for a P<sub>i</sub>-controlled transcriptional response and the regulation of phosphate homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Beyond this physiological function, however, the PHO pathway also gained widespread recognition as a model for promotor activation, transcription initiation, chromatin remodeling and nucleosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). In the PHO pathway, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) Pho81 translates intracellular P<sub>i</sub> availability into an activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex Pho85-Pho80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). At high P<sub>i</sub>, Pho85-Pho80 phosphorylates and inactivates the key transcription factor of the PHO pathway, Pho4, which then accumulates in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). During P<sub>i</sub> starvation, Pho81 inhibits the Pho85-Pho80 kinase, leading to dephosphorylation and activation of Pho4 and the ensuing expression of P<sub>i</sub>-responsive genes (PHO genes).</p>
<p>The activation of Pho85-Pho80 through Pho81 has been explored in detail, leading to a series of highly influential studies that have gained wide acceptance in the field. A critical function was ascribed to 1-IP<sub>7</sub> in activating the CDK inhibitor PHO81, allowing it to inhibit Pho85-Pho80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). IP<sub>7</sub> concentration was reported to increase upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation, and this increase was considered as necessary and sufficient to inactivate Pho85-Pho80 kinase through Pho81 and trigger the PHO pathway. The 1-IP<sub>7</sub> binding site on Pho81 was mapped to a short stretch of 80 amino acids, the “minimum domain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). This domain is in the central region and distinct from the N-terminal SPX domain of Pho81. Since overexpression of the minimum domain rescued P<sub>i</sub>-dependent regulation of the PHO pathway to some degree, the key regulatory function was ascribed to this minimum domain and the SPX domain was considered as of minor importance. By contrast, earlier studies based on unbiased mutagenesis, which subsequently received much less attention, had identified mutations in other regions of PHO81 with significant impact on PHO pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). The situation is complicated by further studies, which found global IP<sub>7</sub> levels to decrease rather than increase upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). The analytics used in most studies could not distinguish 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, however, leaving open the possibility that an increase of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> might be masked by a decrease of a much larger pool of 5-IP<sub>7</sub>.</p>
<p>To resolve these discrepancies and revisit the regulation of the PHO pathway by IPPs and Pho81, we capitalized on recent advances in the non-radioactive analysis of inositol pyrophosphates through CE-MS, offering superior resolution, sensitivity, and throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). We combined comprehensive analyses of PHO pathway activation and IPP profiles in mutants of key enzymes involved in IPP metabolism of yeast to determine the IPP species relevant to PHO pathway control and their impact on Pho85-Pho80 kinase. This led us to a revised model of PHO pathway regulation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>So far, analysis of the role of IPPs in P<sub>i</sub> homeostasis and P<sub>i</sub> starvation responses relied mainly on the use of mutants which ablate one of the pathways of IPP synthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Yet, as shown in plants, several IPPs can change in a similar manner upon P<sub>i</sub> depletion or replenishment, and ablation of enzymes adding phosphate groups at the 1- or 5-positions of the inositol ring induces similar P<sub>i</sub> starvation responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). This renders it difficult to distinguish a role for an individual IPP from the alternative hypothesis that all IPPs collectively contribute to signaling. To dissect this issue in yeast, we performed time course analyses of mutants in IPP phosphatases and kinases, in which we correlate the levels of all IPPs with the induction of the phosphate starvation response in yeast. The rationale was to seek for upper or lower thresholds of IPP concentrations during PHO pathway induction and using those to sieve out the IPP responsible for signaling P<sub>i</sub> starvation.</p>

<title>Dynamics of the cytosolic concentrations of 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub></title>
<p>In yeast, the <italic>myo</italic>-inositol hexakisphosphate kinases Vip1 and Kcs1 generate 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, respectively, and they are both required for synthesis of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Inositol pyrophosphatases, such as Ddp1 and Siw14 dephosphorylate these compounds at the 1- and 5-position, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>).</p>
<p>We analyzed the kinetics and the role of these inositol pyrophosphates in PHO pathway activation. To this end, yeasts were cultured in synthetic liquid (SC) media to early logarithmic phase and then transferred to P<sub>i</sub>-free SC medium. The cells were extracted with perchloric acid and inositol phosphates were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Three IPPs were detectable: 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>. We note that the CE-MS approach does not differentiate pyrophosphorylation of the inositol ring at the 1- and 3-positions. Thus, our assignments of the relevant species as 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> are based on previous characterization of the reaction products and specificities of IP6Ks and PPIPKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>).</p>
<p>Quantitation of IPPs by CE-MS was facilitated by spiking the samples with synthetic, <sup>13</sup>C-labeled inositol pyrophosphate standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). The recovery rate of inositol pyrophosphates during the extraction was determined by adding known quantities of synthetic standards to the cells already before the extractions. This demonstrated that 89 % of 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, 90 % of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 75 % of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> were recovered in the extract (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). To estimate the cellular concentrations of these compounds, the volume of the cells was determined by fluorescence microscopy after staining of the cell wall with trypan blue (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). This yielded an average cell volume of 42 fL. Detailed morphometric studies of yeast showed that the nucleus occupies around 8% of this volume and that all other organelles collectively account for approx. 18% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). Taking this into account we can estimate the concentrations in the cytosolic space (including the nucleus, which is permeable to small molecules) of cells growing logarithmically on SC medium as 0.5 µM for 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, 0.7 µM for 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, 0.3 µM for 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we determined the impact of Kcs1, Vip1, Siw14 and Ddp1 on the inositol pyrophosphate levels in the cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). 5-IP<sub>7</sub> was not detected in the <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> mutant and 1-IP<sub>7</sub> was strongly reduced in the <italic>vip1Δ</italic> strain. 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> was undetectable in <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> and decreased by 75% in <italic>vip1Δ</italic>. The nature of the residual 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> and 1-IP<sub>7</sub> signals is currently unclear. They may represent IPPs synthesized by enzymes other than Kcs1 and Vip1, such as the inositol polyphosphate multi-kinases, which can also produce IPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Importantly, residual 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> and 1-IP<sub>7</sub> were not observed in P<sub>i</sub>-starved wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). This may be due to presence of the Vip1 phosphatase activity, which is missing in <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells, but which may quench weak production of IPPs such as 1-IP<sub>7</sub> or 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> by other enzymes in wildtype cells. Since this aspect is not central to the question of our study it was not pursued further. <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> mutants showed a 2 to 3-fold decrease in 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, suggesting that the accumulation of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> depends on 5-IP<sub>7</sub>. This might be explained by assuming that, in the wildtype, most 1-IP<sub>7</sub> stems from the conversion of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> to 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>, followed by dephosphorylation of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> to 1-IP<sub>7</sub>. A systematic analysis of this interdependency will require rapid pulse-labeling approaches for following the turnover of the phosphate groups, which are not yet established for inositol pyrophosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). An unexpected finding was the up to 20-fold overaccumulation of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> in the <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutant. By contrast, <italic>ddp1Δ</italic> cells showed normal levels of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> but a 10-fold increase in 1-IP<sub>7</sub>. <italic>siw14Δ</italic> cells showed a 5-fold increase in 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, but similar levels of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> and 1-IP<sub>7</sub> as wildtype.</p>
<p>We performed time course experiments to analyze how IPP levels change under P<sub>i</sub> withdrawal. 5-IP<sub>7</sub> was the predominant inositol pyrophosphate species in wildtype cells growing on P<sub>i</sub>-replete media (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Within 30 min of P<sub>i</sub> starvation, the concentration of all three inositol pyrophosphate species rapidly decreased by 75% for 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>, by 47% for 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, and by 40% for 5-IP<sub>7</sub>. This decline continued, so that 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> became undetectable and only 3% of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> remained after 4 h, corresponding to a concentration below 50 nM. The high excess of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> in <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells also declined as soon as the cells were transferred to P<sub>i</sub> starvation medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). After two hours of starvation, it was still two-fold above the concentration measured in P<sub>i</sub>-replete wildtype cells. Even after 3.5 to 4 h, P<sub>i</sub>-starved <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells had just reached the 5-IP<sub>7</sub> concentration of P<sub>i</sub>-replete wildtype cells. A comparable decline of all IPP species upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation could be also observed in other fungi, such as <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>), suggesting that this response is conserved.</p>
<p>Taken together, P<sub>i</sub> starvation leads to a virtually complete depletion of all three inositol pyrophosphate species, with 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> declining faster than 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 5-IP<sub>7</sub>. Furthermore, inositol pyrophosphatase mutants provide the possibility to generate relatively selective increases in 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1-IP<sub>7</sub>. We used this information to dissect the impact of 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> on control of the PHO pathway.</p>

<title>1,5-IP8 signals cytosolic Pi levels to the PHO pathway</title>
<p>To this end, we correlated the measured inositol pyrophosphate concentrations to the induction of the PHO pathway. We assayed a key event of PHO pathway activation, partitioning of the fluorescently tagged transcription factor Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> between the cytosol and the nucleus. Pho4 shuttles between nucleus and cytosol and its phosphorylation through Pho85-Pho80 favors Pho4 accumulation in the cytosol. The relocation of Pho4 can hence serve as an <italic>in vivo</italic> indicator of PHO pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). It provides a readout for Pho85-Pho80 activity. <italic>PHO4</italic> was tagged at its genomic locus, making Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> the sole source of this transcription factor. Pho4 relocation was assayed through automated image segmentation and analysis. The artificial intelligence-based segmentation algorithm recognized more than 90% of the cells in a bright-field image and delimited their nuclei based on a red-fluorescent nuclear mCherry marker (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). This segmentation allows quantitative measurements of Pho4 distribution between the cytosol and nucleus in large numbers of cells. In addition, we assayed PHO pathway activation through fluorescent yEGFP reporters expressed from the <italic>PHO5</italic> (<italic>prPHO5-yEGFP</italic>) and <italic>PHO84</italic> (<italic>prPHO84-yEGFP</italic>) promotors. These are classical assays of PHO pathway activation, but their output is further downstream and hence comprises additional regulation, e. g. at the level of chromatin or RNA, or the direct activation of Pho4 through metabolites such as AICAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). Upon P<sub>i</sub> withdrawal, both promotors are induced by the PHO pathway but the <italic>PHO84</italic> promotor reacts in a more sensitive manner and is induced more rapidly than the <italic>PHO5</italic> promotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>).</p>
<p>In wildtype cells grown under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions, Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> was cytosolic and the <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> promotors were inactive, indicating that the PHO pathway was repressed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Within 30 min of starvation in P<sub>i</sub>-free medium, Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> relocated into the nucleus and <italic>PHO84</italic> and <italic>PHO5</italic> were strongly induced. By contrast, <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> cells showed Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> constitutively in the nucleus already under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions, and <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> promoters were activated. These cells have strongly reduced 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> and 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, and 50% less 1-IP<sub>7</sub> than the wildtype, Thus, a decline of IPPs not only coincides with the induction of the P<sub>i</sub> starvation program, but the genetic ablation of these compounds is sufficient for a forced triggering of this response in P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions. Therefore, we explored the hypothesis that IPPs repress the PHO pathway, and that their loss upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation creates the signal that activates the starvation response.</p>

<p>In this case, we must explain the behavior of the <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutation, which strongly reduces 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> and maintains the PHO pathway repressed in P<sub>i</sub>-replete medium. Upon withdrawal of P<sub>i</sub>, <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells did not show nuclear relocation of Pho4 after 30 min and, even after 4h of starvation, <italic>PHO5</italic> was not expressed. The <italic>PHO84</italic> promoter remained partially repressed in comparison with the wildtype. These results are at first sight consistent with the proposal that 1-IP<sub>7</sub> activates the PHO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Several further observations draw this hypothesis into question, however. First, all three inositol pyrophosphate species strongly decline upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation instead of showing the increase postulated by Lee et al. Second, <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells show a more than 15-fold overaccumulation of 5-IP<sub>7</sub>. Genetic ablation of this pool by deleting <italic>KCS1</italic> is epistatic to the <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutation. A <italic>kcs1Δ vip1Δ</italic> double mutant constitutively activates the PHO pathway already in presence of P<sub>i</sub>, despite its strong reduction of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and the complete absence of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>. Third, <italic>ddp1Δ</italic> cells, which show a 10-fold quite selective increase in 1-IP<sub>7</sub> under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions, did not induce the <italic>PHO84</italic> and <italic>PHO5</italic> promotors, nor did they show Pho4 accumulation in the nucleus in P<sub>i</sub>-replete medium. Thus, even a strong increase in 1-IP<sub>7</sub> is not sufficient to activate the PHO pathway, while reductions of inositol pyrophosphates do this.</p>
<p>The data described above argues against a diminution of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> as a critical factor for induction of the PHO pathway because <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells, which have virtually no 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, do not constitutively activate the PHO pathway. By contrast, <italic>vip1Δ kcs1Δ</italic> double mutants, which not only have low levels of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> but also strongly reduced 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, show constitutive PHO pathway activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). We hence tested the hypothesis that a decline of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> might trigger the PHO pathway. To define the critical concentration at which this happens in <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells, we assayed the induction of the PHO pathway over time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). While Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> was cytosolic in wild-type cells under high P<sub>i</sub> supply, a large fraction of it rapidly relocated into the nucleus within the first 15 min of P<sub>i</sub> starvation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A,B</xref>). In <italic>vip1Δ</italic>, Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> relocation followed a sigmoidal curve. The nuclear/cytosolic ratio strongly increased after 1 h, reaching a plateau after 3 h. Thus, relocation was stimulated when the 20-fold exaggerated 5-IP<sub>7</sub> levels of the <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells had declined below 5 µM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), which is 6 to 7 times above the maximal concentration observed in P<sub>i</sub>-replete wildtype cells. Since 5-IP<sub>7</sub> is the only IPP that exists in <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells in significant amounts, this observation places the critical concentration of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> that can repress the PHO pathway at 5 µM. In P<sub>i</sub>-replete wildtype cells, 5-IP<sub>7</sub> never reaches 5 µM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and, therefore, 5-IP<sub>7</sub> is unlikely to be a physiological repressor of the PHO pathway in wildtype cells. The 5-IP<sub>7</sub>-dependent PHO pathway repression in <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells must then be considered as a non-physiological reaction resulting from the strong overaccumulation of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> in these cells.</p>

<p>This interpretation is also consistent with the phenotype of <italic>siw14Δ</italic> cells. Although these cells accumulate 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, they accumulate it 4-fold less than <italic>vip1Δ</italic>, remaining below the 5 µM threshold where we should expect non-physiological repression of the PHO pathway. However, <italic>siw14Δ</italic> cells contain the same concentration of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> as the wildtype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), degrade it upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation as the wildtype (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>), and relocalize Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> with similar kinetics as the wildtype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Taken together with the evidence presented above, 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> thus ends up being the only IPP that correlates with the activation of the PHO pathway in all mutants and conditions. This points to 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> as the controller of the PHO pathway.</p>

<title>The PHO pathway is controlled by the SPX domain of Pho81</title>
<p>Our results strongly argue against an increase of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> as the key factor for inactivating the CDK Pho85-Pho80 through the CDK inhibitor Pho81. This prompted us to also re-evaluate the regulation of Pho81 because previous studies had proposed a small peptide from the central region of Pho81, called the minimum domain (amino acids 645-724), as a receptor for 1-IP<sub>7</sub> that triggers the PHO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). This model rests mainly on results with the isolated minimum domain used <italic>in vitro</italic> or, in highly overexpressed form, <italic>in vivo</italic>. This expression of the minimum domain outside its normal molecular context may be problematic because earlier work had suggested that the N-and C-terminal portions of Pho81, i. e. regions outside the minimum domain, could provide competing inhibitory and stimulatory functions for Pho81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>).</p>
<p>We targeted the N-terminal SPX domain of Pho81 through various mutations, leaving the rest of Pho81 and its minimum domain intact (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). First, we asked whether Pho81 lacking the N-terminal 200 amino acids, corresponding to a deletion of its SPX domain, could still activate the PHO pathway. This Pho81<sup>ΔSPX</sup> is likely to be folded because a yEGFP-tagged version of Pho81<sup>ΔSPX</sup> localized to the nucleus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, D), which requires Pho81 to interact with nuclear import factors and with Pho85-Pho80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). We tested the effect of Pho81<sup>ΔSPX</sup> on relocation of Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A, B</xref>). Whereas wild-type cells efficiently relocated Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> to the nucleus upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation, <italic>pho81<sup>ΔSPX</sup></italic> cells partially maintained Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> in the cytosol. Thus, while the SPX domain is not essential for nuclear targeting of Pho81, it is required for efficient nuclear relocation of Pho4 and the induction of the PHO pathway under P<sub>i</sub> starvation.</p>

Substituting them by alanine severely reduces the affinity of the domains for inositol pyrophosphates and can thus mimic the inositol pyrophosphate-free state.

Induction of the PHO pathway through SPX substitutions is further illustrated by <italic>PHO81</italic> expression, which itself is under the control of the PHO pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>, F). Western blots of protein extracts from cells grown under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions showed increased levels of Pho81 in <italic>pho81<sup>K154A</sup></italic> cells, like those observed in strains that constitutively activate the PHO pathway due to the absence of IPPs, such as <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> and <italic>vip1Δ/kcs1Δ</italic>. They were significantly higher than in cells that do not constitutively activate the PHO pathway, such as wildtype or <italic>vip1Δ</italic>. In sum, these results suggest that the PHO pathway is regulated through binding of IPPs to the SPX domain of Pho81.</p>
<p>This critical role of the SPX domain for controlling Pho81 also consistent with the results from two random mutagenesis approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>), which had received little attention in the previous model of PHO pathway regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). These random mutagenesis approaches generated multiple pho81<sup>c</sup> alleles, which constitutively activate the PHO pathway and carry the substitutions G4D, G147R, 158-SGSG-159, or E79K. All these alleles affect the SPX domain at residues in the immediate vicinity of the putative IPP binding site (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref>; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>). Three of the alleles (G4D, G147R, 158-SGSG-159) replace small glycine residues by bulky residues or insert additional amino acids, respectively, at sites where they should sterically interfere with binding of inositol pyrophosphates. We hence expect them to mimic the IPP-free state and constitutively activate the PHO pathway for this reason.</p>

<title>SPX and minimum domains contribute to the interaction of Pho81 with Pho85-Pho80 in vivo</title>
<p>The traditional model of PHO pathway activation has tied the effect of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> to the minimum domain of Pho81, proposing that a complex of the two competitively inhibits Pho85 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Since the results presented above argued against a role of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> in inhibiting Pho85-Pho80 and triggering the PHO pathway, we explored potential alternative roles of the minimum domain by modeling the Pho80-Pho81 interaction with a Google Colab notebook for Alphafold multimer v3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>). The non-templated structure prediction of the complex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) yields a Pho80 structure that agrees with an available crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>), showing R121 and E154 of Pho80 forming a salt bridge in a groove, which is critical for controlling Pho85 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). The prediction shows the groove binding a long unstructured loop of Pho81, which corresponds to the minimum domain. Substitutions in the minimum domain, and specifically of the residues binding the Pho80 groove in the prediction (residues 690-701), constitutively repress the PHO pathway when introduced into full-length Pho81, and they destabilize the interaction of Pho81 with Pho85-Pho80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). The same effects are also shown by the <italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> and <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic> alleles, which ablate the critical salt bridge in the Pho80 groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>). The similarity of the effects of these substitutions validates the predicted interaction of the minimum domain with the R121/E154-containing groove. It invites a re-interpretation of the role of the minimum domain and suggests that this domain may serve as an anchor for Pho80 on Pho81 rather than acting directly on the Pho85 kinase.</p>

<p>The recruitment of Pho81 to the nucleus and its interaction with Pho85-Pho80 in wildtype cells is independent of the P<sub>i</sub> regime, suggesting that it is dominated by a constitutive interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). This constitutive recruitment vanishes when the minimum domain binding site is compromised in <italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> and <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic> cells. Then, recruitment of Pho81 to the nucleus and to Pho85-Pho80 becomes P<sub>i</sub>-sensitive and is stimulated by P<sub>i</sub> starvation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). We hence used <italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> and <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic> as tools to ask whether Pho81 might be tied to Pho85-Pho80 through a second layer of interaction that provides P<sub>i</sub>-dependence. As a <italic>bona fide</italic> P<sub>i</sub>-responsive element, the SPX domain of Pho81 was a prime candidate. We combined the <italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> and <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic> with substitutions in the putative IPP binding site of a fluorescent Pho81<sup>yEGFP</sup> fusion protein, and with deletions of VIP1 or KCS1. Under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions, <italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> or <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic> cells showed Pho81<sup>yEGFP</sup> in the cytosol, but they accumulated the protein in the nucleus only upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This rescue by starvation was more pronounced in <italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> than in <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic>. Pho81<sup>K154A-yEGFP</sup>, with a substitution in its putative IPP binding site designed to mimic the low-P<sub>i</sub> state, accumulated in the nucleus of <italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> and <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic> cells already under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions, i.e., it behaved constitutively as under P<sub>i</sub> starvation. <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutants behaved like the wildtype, accumulating Pho81<sup>yEGFP</sup> in the nucleus <italic>of pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> and <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic> cells upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation, whereas <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> cells showed nuclear Pho81<sup>yEGFP</sup> already under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions. Thus, interfering with IPP signaling, be it through P<sub>i</sub> starvation, ablation of IPP synthesis, or substitution of the putative IPP binding site of Pho81, partially compensated for the destabilization of the minimum domain binding site in Pho80.</p>

<p>Two <italic>in vivo</italic> observations are consistent with the notion that this compensation may reflect an interaction of the SPX domain with Pho85-Pho80: First, Pho81<sup>ΔSPX-yEGFP</sup>, which lacks this SPX domain, did not show starvation-induced nuclear accumulation in <italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> and <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Second, a yEGFP fusion of only the SPX domain of Pho81 (Pho81SPX<sup>yEGFP</sup>), which lacks the rest of the protein and thereby excludes a constitutive interaction through the minimum domain, localized mainly to the cytosol of PHO80 wildtype cells under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions, but it concentrated in the nucleus upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). This concentration was not observed in <italic>pho80Δ</italic> cells, which lack nuclear Pho85-Pho80. By contrast, <italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> or <italic>pho80E<sup>154V</sup></italic> cells, which only target the minimum domain-Pho80 interaction but leave Pho85-Pho80 kinase active and in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>), retained the capacity to accumulate Pho81SPX<sup>yEGFP</sup> in their nuclei upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation. These results suggest that the SPX-domain contributes to the interaction of Pho81 and Pho85-Pho80. Our observations are consistent with a model in which this SPX-Pho85-Pho80 interaction is independent of the minimum domain but controlled by P<sub>i</sub> through IPPs, which can destabilize it and relieve the inhibition of Pho85-Pho80.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The transcriptional response of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to varying P<sub>i</sub> supply is an important model system for studying gene regulation, promotor structure, and the impact of chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>). However, identification of the inositol pyrophosphates relaying phosphate availability to this PHO pathway has been challenging. This is mainly due to limitations in analytics. The recent development of a CE-MS method has provided a potent tool, allowing IPP analysis without radiolabeling and under any physiological condition. The improved separation, higher throughput and lower cost of this approach led us to re-investigate the role of IPPs in PHO pathway regulation. The results inspire a revised model that differs from the traditional hypothesis in three aspects: We propose that P<sub>i</sub> scarcity is signaled by a decrease in IPPs rather than by an increase; a critical function is ascribed to the loss of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> instead of 1-IP<sub>7</sub>; and we postulate that the N-terminal SPX domain of Pho81 rather than the central minimum domain is the primary receptor mediating IPP-control over the PHO pathway.</p>
<p>Our observations reveal an effect that misled the interpretation of several preceding studies. This includes our own work on the activation of the polyphosphate polymerase VTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>), which is controlled by SPX domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> activity assays had shown a clear order of potency of IPPs in stimulating VTC, with 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> showing an apparent EC<sub>50</sub> 30-fold below that of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 50-fold below that of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). In this work, we nevertheless dismissed 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> as a physiological stimulator of the VTC SPX domains, based on the argument that a <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutant, which lacks the enzyme for 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> synthesis, shows quite normal polyP accumulation in vivo. We proposed 5-IP<sub>7</sub> for this role because a <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> mutant, which lacks the IP6K making this compound, also lacks polyP. The IPP analyses that we present now call for a re-interpretation of this data. The presence of polyP in a <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutant can well be explained by the 20-fold over-accumulation of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> in this mutant, which can compensate for the lower EC<sub>50</sub> and permit stimulation of VTC through 5-IP<sub>7</sub>. In wildtype cells, however, where 5-IP<sub>7</sub> is only twice as abundant as 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> should be the relevant activator of VTC for polyP synthesis under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions.</p>
<p>Then, the situation is also compatible with results from <italic>S. pombe</italic>, where ablation of the Vip1 homolog Asp1 impairs polyP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>). The transcriptional phosphate starvation response in <italic>S. pombe</italic> also depends on IPPs. However, the downstream executers differ from those present in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Fission yeast contains no homologs of Pho81, and the responsible transcription factor is not controlled through a Pho85-Pho80-like kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). P<sub>i</sub>-dependent transcription strongly depends on lncRNA-mediated interference, which may be linked to IPPs through an SPX-domain containing ubiquitin E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>). Nevertheless, important basic properties of the IP6K and PPIP5K system are conserved. Like in baker’s yeast, deletion of the Vip1 homolog Asp1 leads to a strong increase in IP<sub>7</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Characterization of the purified enzyme also showed that P<sub>i</sub> stimulates net production of IP<sub>8</sub> by inhibiting the phosphatase domain of Asp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In line with this, we observed that IP<sub>8</sub> rapidly decreased upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation also in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). As for Vip1 in baker’s yeast, genetic ablation of Asp1 does not interfere with the induction of the phosphate-regulated gene <italic>PHO1</italic> by P<sub>i</sub> starvation, suggesting that 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> are not essential for this transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). In P<sub>i</sub>-replete media, however, ablation of Asp1 hyper-represses <italic>PHO1</italic>, and putative overproduction of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and/or 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> by selective inactivation of only the Asp1 phosphatase domain induces this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>). It remains to be seen whether these discrepancies originate from a similar disequlibration of IP<sub>7</sub> species as in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (ablation of Asp1 increases the IP<sub>7</sub> pool 4- to 5-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>)), or whether they are due to other processes such as lncRNA-mediated interference, which plays an important role in P<sub>i</sub> homeostasis in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).</p>
<p>The PHO pathway in <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, a pathogenic yeast, shares many protein components with that of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and might hence be expected to function in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). Yet a recent study on this organism proposed 5-IP<sub>7</sub> as the critical inducer of the PHO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). This model relies on the observation that <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> mutants, which lack 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, cannot induce the PHO pathway in this yeast. This is the opposite behavior compared to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. It was hence concluded that, despite an experimentally observed moderate decline in 5-IP<sub>7</sub> upon short P<sub>i</sub> starvation, the remaining pool of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> was required for PHO pathway activity. Substitution of basic residues in the IPP-binding pocket of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Pho81 interfered with PHO pathway activation, lending further support to the conclusion. However, the same study also showed that Pho81 was lacking completely from kcs1Δ mutants. When the Pho81 IPP binding site was compromised by amino acid substitutions the Pho81 protein level was significantly reduced, and the protein almost vanished upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation. This offers an alternative explanation of the effects because absence of the critical inhibitor Pho81 activates Pho85/80 kinase and represses the PHO pathway independently of P<sub>i</sub> availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Destabilization of Pho81 will then mask effects of IPPs. Thus, it remains possible that the PHO pathway in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> is controlled as in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, i.e. that P<sub>i</sub> starvation is signaled by a decline of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>. In line with this, we observed that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells lose all IPPs within 2 hours of phosphate starvation (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). As in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> showed a faster and more profound response. Therefore, we consider it as likely that the loss of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> signals P<sub>i</sub> starvation also in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p>
<p>Our results revise the widely accepted model of increased 1-IP<sub>7</sub> as the trigger of the PHO pathway and of the minimum domain of Pho81 as its receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). This model rests upon an increase of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation, a reported constitutive activation of the PHO pathway in a <italic>ddp1Δ</italic> mutant, and upon the lack of rapid PHO pathway induction in a <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutant. A later study from O’Shea and colleagues revealed that <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells finally induced the PHO pathway after prolonged P<sub>i</sub> starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>), but this did not lead to a revision of the model. Our results rationalize the strong delay of <italic>vip1Δ</italic> in PHO pathway induction by the overaccumulation of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> in this mutant, which leads to aberrant PHO pathway silencing through this compound. Under P<sub>i</sub> starvation, it takes several hours longer to degrade this exaggerated pool, which provides a satisfying explanation for the delayed PHO pathway induction in <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells. Even though earlier studies, due to the limited resolution of the radio-HPLC approach, could not differentiate between 1- and 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, these studies reported an increase in the IP<sub>7</sub> pool upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Other studies using a similar radio-HPLC approach suggested a decline of the IP<sub>7</sub> pool upon long P<sub>i</sub> withdrawal, but they analyzed only a single timepoint and could not exclude an earlier increase in 1-IP<sub>7</sub> as a trigger for the PHO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). In our CE-MS analyses, we consistently observed strong, continuous declines of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>, 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and, upon several hours of P<sub>i</sub> starvation, their almost complete disappearance. Furthermore, we could not confirm the reported constitutive activation of the PHO pathway in a <italic>ddp1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), although this mutant did show the expected increased 1-IP7 concentration. These observations argue against a role of 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, 5-IP<sub>7</sub> or 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> as activators for Pho81 and the PHO pathway.</p>
<p>The link between 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and Pho81 activation relied mainly on the use of the 80 amino acid minimum domain from the central region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). This domain was used in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, where 1-IP<sub>7</sub> stimulated binding of the minimum domain to Pho85-Pho80 and inhibition of the enzyme. Given that 1-IP<sub>7</sub> disappears under P<sub>i</sub> starvation it appears unlikely that this <italic>in vitro</italic> effect is physiologically relevant. Furthermore, the apparent dissociation constant of the complex of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> with the minimum domain and Pho80-Pho85 was determined to be 20 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The minimum domain is thus unlikely to respond to 1-IP<sub>7</sub> in the cells because its K<sub>d</sub> is almost 50-fold above the cellular concentrations of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> in P<sub>i</sub>-replete medium (0.5 µM; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), and at least 3 orders of magnitude above the concentration remaining on P<sub>i</sub> starvation media (&lt; 20 nM). Another discrepancy is that the <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition of Pho85-Pho80 by the minimum domain was reported to be specific for 1-IP<sub>7</sub> whereas 5-IP<sub>7</sub> had no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). This contrasts with the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, where we find that even massive overaccumulation of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> by ablation of Ddp1 cannot trigger the PHO pathway, but where suppression of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> production by ablation of Kcs1 does activate it constitutively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>
<p>An argument supporting a role of the minimum domain in mediating P<sub>i</sub>-responsiveness was provided by <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments in a <italic>pho81Δ</italic> mutant, where P<sub>i</sub>-dependent activation of the PHO pathway could be partially rescued through over-expression of the minimum domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). PHO pathway activation was assayed through <italic>PHO5</italic> expression. This is relevant because the <italic>PHO5</italic> promotor is not only controlled through Pho85-Pho80-mediated phosphorylation of Pho4, but also through changes in nucleosome occupancy, which substantially influence activity and activation threshold of the <italic>PHO5</italic> promotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). It is thus conceivable that constitutive overexpression of the minimum domain reduces Pho85-Pho80 activity moderately, but sufficiently to allow regulation of <italic>PHO5</italic> expression through nucleosome positioning, which changes in a P<sub>i</sub>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though the minimum domain is unlikely to function as a receptor for IPPs this does not call into question that the minimum domain is critical for Pho81 function. A role of this domain is supported by substitutions and deletions in this domain, introduced into full-length Pho81, which constitutively repress the PHO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Our modeling approach provides a satisfying link of these residues to Pho85-Pho80 regulation. It suggests the minimum domain to be an extended unstructured loop that binds Pho80 at a groove that encompasses R121 and E154, residues that emerged from a genetic screen as essential for recruiting Pho81 to Pho85-Pho80 and for inhibiting the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the minimum domain does provide a critical connection between Pho81 and Pho80, which is per se IPP-independent, whereas the SPX domain of Pho81 may create additional contacts to Pho80-Pho85 and impart regulation through IPPs.</p>
<p>Taking all these aspects together, we propose the following working model (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>): P<sub>i</sub> sufficiency in the cytosol is signaled through the accumulation of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>. 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> binding to the SPX domain of Pho81 labilizes the interaction of this domain with Pho85-Pho80, allowing the kinase to become active. The now un-inhibited kinase phosphorylates Pho4, triggers its relocation into the cytosol and represses the PHO pathway. P<sub>i</sub> limitation is signaled by a decline in 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>, resulting in the ligand-free form of the SPX domain and the activation of Pho81. Inhibition of Pho85-Pho80 requires the Pho81 minimum domain to bind a groove in the cyclin Pho80, stabilizing the complex and inhibiting Pho85 kinase. An obvious question arising from this model is whether the Pho81 SPX domain itself could activate Pho85-Pho80 by directly binding these proteins. Alternatively, or in addition, Pho85-Pho80 might be controlled through the availability of the minimum domain for Pho80 binding, which might be restricted through an IPP-dependent SPX-minimum domain interaction. These aspects will be explored in future work.</p>

<caption><title>Working model on the control of the PHO pathway through 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> and Pho81.</title>
<p>At high P<sub>i</sub> concentrations, inositol pyrophosphates accumulate. 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> binds the SPX domain of Pho81, which labilizes the interaction of Pho81 with Pho80 and prevents Pho81 from inhibiting Pho85-Pho80 kinase.</p><p>In low P<sub>i</sub>, 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> declines. Liberation of the SPX domain from this ligand allows this domain to interact with Pho85-Pho80. This, and the interaction of the minimum domain with a critical groove of Pho80, allow Pho81 to inhibit Pho80-85. The resulting dephosphorylation of Pho4 triggers its concentration in the nucleus and activation of the PHO pathway. This inhibition is reinforced by increased expression of PHO81, which itself is a PHO pathway-controlled gene.</p></caption>

<p>This revision of PHO pathway regulation permits to develop a coherent picture on intracellular phosphate signaling across the eukaryotic kingdoms. Phosphate abundance being indicated by the accumulation of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> is compatible with the situation in mammalian cells, where 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> triggers P<sub>i</sub> export through the putative phosphate transporter XPR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>), and with the situation in plants, where IP<sub>8</sub> is particularly abundant upon shift to high-P<sub>i</sub> substrate and inhibits transcription factors for the phosphate starvation response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Thus, loss of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> may generally signal phosphate scarcity in eukaryotic cells.</p>

<p>All experiments were performed with a bare fused silica capillary with a length of 100 cm and 50 μm internal diameter. 35 mM ammonium acetate titrated by ammonia solution to pH 9.7 was used as background electrolyte (BGE). The sheath liquid was composed of a water-isopropanol (1:1) mixture, with a flow rate of 10 µL/min. 15 µL Inositol pyrophosphate extracts was spiked with 0.75 µL isotopic internal standards mixture (2 µM [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>, 10 µM [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]5-IP<sub>7</sub>, 10 µM [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 40 µM [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]IP<sub>6</sub>). Samples were introduced by applying 100 mbar pressure for 10 s (20 nL). A separation voltage of +30 kV was applied over the capillary, generating a constant CE current at around 19 µA.</p>
<p>The MS source parameters setting were as follows: nebulizer pressure was 8 psi, sheath gas temperature was 175 °C and with a flow at 8 L/min, gas temperature was 150 °C and, with a flow of 11 L/min, the capillary voltage was -2000 V with nozzle voltage 2000V.

<p>The subcellular localization of Pho4-yEGFP has been quantified from time-lapse fluorescence microscopy experiments. This quantification required the segmentation of microscopy images to discriminate cytosolic and nuclear compartments. To this end, the Hta2 histone of Pho4-yEGFP strains has been tagged with mCherry.

<p>Recent studies in plants and human cell lines argued for a central role of 1,5-InsP8 as the central nutrient messenger in eukaryotic cells, but previous studies concluded that this function is performed by 1-InsP7 in baker's yeast. Chabert et al now performed an elegant set of capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry time course experiments to define the cellular concentrations of different inositol pyrophosphosphates (PP-InsPs) in wild-type yeast cells under normal and phosphate (Pi) starvation growth conditions. These experiments, in my opinion, form the center of the present study and clearly highlight that the levels of all major PP-InsPs drop under Pi starvation, with the 1,5-InsP8 isomer showing the most rapid changes.</p>
<p>The analysis of known mutants in the PP-InsP biosynthetic pathways furthermore demonstrate that loss-of-function of the PPIP5K enzymes Kcs1 and Vip1 result in a loss of 1,5-InsP8 and a hyperaccumulation of 5-InsP7, respectively. In line with this, loss-of-function of known PP-InsP phosphatases Ddp1 and Swi14 result in hyperaccumulation of either 1- or 5-InsP7, as anticipated from their in vitro substrate specificities. These experiments are of high technical quality and add to our understanding of the kinetics of PP-InsP metabolism/catabolism in yeast.</p>
<p>Next, the authors use changes in subcellular localisation of the central transcription factor Pho4 to assay at which time point after onset of Pi starvation the PHO pathway becomes activated. The early onset of the response, the behavior of the kcs1D mutant and of the ksc1D/vip1D all strongly argue for 1,5-InsP8 as the central nutrient messenger. I find this part of the manuscript well argued, nicely correlating PP-InsP levels, dynamics and the different mutant phenotypes.</p>
<p>The third part of the manuscript is a structure-function study of the CDK inhibitor Pho81, basically using a reverse genetics approach. This analysis demonstrates at the genetic level that the Pho81 SPX domain is required for activation of the PHO pathway. Next, the authors design point mutations that should block either interaction of Pho81-SPX with 1,5-InsP8 or interaction of Pho81 with the Pho80/Pho85 complex. In my opinion, these data can only provide limited insight into the molecular mechanism, as no complementary in vitro binding assays / in vivo co-IP experiments with the wild-type and mutant forms of Pho81 are presented. This seems to be due to technical limitations in recombinantly expressing and purifying the respective Pho81 protein for in vitro PP-InsP binding and protein - protein interaction assays.</p>
<p>Taken together, the work by Chabert et al, reinvestigates and clarifies the activation of the yeast PHO pathway by PP-InsP nutrient messengers and their cellular SPX receptors. From this work, a more unified eukaryotic mechanism emerges, in which 1,5-InsP8 represents the central signaling molecule in different species, with conserved SPX receptors sensing this signaling molecule.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Chambert et al. describes a thorough and careful characterization of inositol pyrophosphate isomers and the PHO pathways in different genetic backgrounds in S. cerevisiae. The paper ultimately arrives at a proposed model in which the inositol pyrophosphate 1,5-IP8 signals phosphate abundance to SPX-domain containing proteins. To arrive at their conclusion, the authors rely heavily on CE-MS analysis of inositol pyrophosphates in different yeast strains, and monitoring inositol pyrophosphate depletion over time in response to phosphate starvation. This analysis is complemented by different reporter systems of PHO pathway activation, such as Pho4 translocation and Pho81 expression.</p>
<p>The experiments are well-designed and the results interpreted with care. With their findings, the authors demonstrate convincingly, that a previous study by O'Shea and co-workers (reference 15 and 16) had been misleading. Lee et al. claimed that the PHO pathway in S. cerevisiae is triggered by an increase in 1-IP7. This claim has been debated heavily in the community, and several groups were not able to reproduce this putative increase of inositol pyrophosphates (references 6, 11, 18). The confusion regarding these discrepancies has been resolved by the current study and is of significant importance to the community.</p>

<p>Summary. This study sought to clarify the connection between inositol pyrophosphates (IPPs) and their regulation of phosphate homeostasis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to answer the question of whether any of the IPPs (1-IP7, 5-IP7, and IP8) or only particular IPPs are involved in regulation. IPPs bind to SPX domains in proteins to affect their activity, and there are several key proteins in the PHO pathway that have an SPX domain, including Pho81. The authors use the latest methodology, capillary electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (CE-MS), to examine the cytosolic concentrations of PP-IPs in wild-type and strains carrying mutations in the enzymes that metabolize these compounds in rich medium and during a phosphate starvation time-course for the wild-type.</p>
<p>Major strengths and weaknesses. The authors have strong premises for performing these experiments: clarifying the regulatory molecule(s) in yeast and providing a unifying mechanism across eukaryotes. They use the latest methodologies and a variety of approaches including genetics, biochemistry, cell biology and protein structure to examine phosphate regulation. Their experiments are rigorous and well controlled, and the story is clearly told. The consideration of physiological levels of IPPs throughout the study was critical to interpretation of the data and a strength of the manuscript. The investigation of the structure of Pho81, its regulation by IPPs, and its interactions with Pho80 provide a vivid model for regulation.</p>
<p>Appraisal. The authors achieved their goal of determining the mechanistic details for phosphate regulation, revising the prior model with new insights. Additionally, they provided strong support for the idea that IP8 regulates phosphate metabolism across eukaryotes - including animals and plants in addition to fungi.</p>
<p>Impact. This study is likely to have broad impact because it addresses prior findings that are inconsistent with current understanding, and they provide good reasoning as to how older methods were inadequate.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Introduction: &quot;In plants, IP7 and IP8 decrease upon Pi starvation and mutants lacking either of the enzymes necessary for their synthesis induce the phosphate starvation response, leaving it open whether IP7 , IP8 , or both, control the Pi starvation program (10, 13, 14)&quot;
In plants, ITPK enzymes catalyze the formation of 5-InsP7 from InP6 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34274522/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34274522/</ext-link> and VIH enzymes the formation of 1,5-InsP8 from 5-InsP7 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25901085/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25901085/</ext-link> .

I would suggest revising this statement and citing all relevant literature.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We don't see the case for 1,5-IP8 as settled in plants, and none of the papers mentioned above draws this strong conclusion. This may be due to several limitations in the available data. The mentioned studies do not allow to differentiate the effects of 1-IP7 and 1,5-IP8 and, where binding or competition experiments have been performed, e.g. on the transcription factors, the differences in the Kd values for IP7 and IP8 were minor. Furthermore,1,5-IP8 levels and Pi starvation response do not always correlate. IPTK1 mutants, for example, show Pi overaccumulation, and low 5-IP7, but normal 1,5-IP8 (Riemer et al., 2021). Finally, plants are complex organisms with multiple tissue types that serve for accumulating, exporting, transporting or finally consuming Pi. Therefore, correlating inositol pyrophosphate levels from whole-plant extracts with a Pi starvation response is problematic, except if these data could both be obtained from the same cell types or at least tissues.</p>
<p>The comment of the reviewer made us recognize that the complex situation in plants deserves a more detailed coverage and we have therefore adjusted the introduction accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Results: &quot;We determined the corresponding lysines in Pho81 (Fig. S3), created a point mutation in the genomic PHO81 locus that substitutes one of them, K154, by alanine, and investigated the impact on the PHO pathway.&quot;</p>
<p>In my opinion, it would be important to test here in a quantitative in vitro binding assay if (i) the SPX domain of Pho81 can bind PP-InsPs including 1,5-InsP8, (ii) if the dissociation constant is in agreement with the cellular levels of 1,5-InsP8 in yeast (compare Fig. 2) and (iii) if the K154A mutation blocks or reduces the binding of 1,5-InsP8. Without such experimentation, I find the statement &quot;this result underlines the efficiency of the K154A substitution in preventing PP-IP binding to the Pho81 SPX domain.&quot; to be overly speculative, as no binding experiment has been conducted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the comment of the reviewer concerning the overstatement in the phrase. It has been deleted.</p>
<p>As mentioned already in our previous work (Wild et al., 2016), Pho81SPX counts among the SPX domains that we could not express recombinantly. Likewise, full-length Pho81, which would be the relevant object for correlating in vitro binding studies with the cellular concentrations, has not been accessible. Expression in yeast did not provide sufficient material for ITC or other quantitative techniques. Therefore, we refrained from pursuing binding studies. Nevertheless, given the high conservation of the positively charged patch on SPX domains and the fact that, in every case where it has been tested so far, SPX domains showed inositol polyphosphate binding activity, we find it a conservative assumption that the Pho81SPX binds them as well. This is supported by the effects of the binding site mutant, which mimics the effect of ablating IP8 synthesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Results: &quot;Inositol pyrophosphate binding to the SPX domain labilizes the Pho81-Pho80 interaction.&quot; Again, in the absence of any protein - protein interaction assay I find this statement not to be supported by the experiments outlined in the manuscript. The best way to address this point would be to perform either co-IP or in vitro pull-down experiments between Pho81-SPX and Pho81-85, in the pre- and absence of 1,5-InsP8 and/or using the Pho81 point-mutants described in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since Pho81 could not be produced recombinantly, neither by us nor by others who worked on this protein previously, quantitative in vitro binding assays are not accessible for now. A simple IP suffers from the problem that Pho81 interacts with Pho85-Pho80 not only through the SPX domain but also through the minimum domain. The latter interaction may be constitutive. Since the main point of the manuscript is not to dissect the exact mechanisms of Pho85-Pho80 regulations, but only to address the point why the postulated inactivation of this kinase by an 1-IP7/minimum domain complex makes no sense, we prefer not to show a profound (and more complex) analysis of how the different Pho81 domains contribute to binding.</p>
<p>To test the potential of the SPX domain for binding Pho85/Pho80 in vivo, we have created a GFP-fusion of the SPX domain of Pho81. This fusion protein localizes mainly to the cytosol when cells are on high-Pi. Upon Pi starvation, it concentrates in the nucleus. This concentration is not observed in pho80 mutant background (New Fig. S7).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In line with this, I would suggest to move the molecular modelling/docking studies from the discussion into the results section and to use these models to design some interface mutations that could be tested in coIP and/or pull-down assays. Alternatively, the authors may choose to omit the discussion section starting with: &quot;Even though the minimum domain is unlikely to function as a receptor for PP-IPs this does not ... and ending with . In sum, multiple lines of evidence support the view that the SPX domain exerts dominant, 1,5-IP8 mediated control over Pho81 activity in response to Pi availability.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now moved the modelling data to the Results section.
The structure prediction of the interface is experimentally validated. Data on the effect of interface substitutions are already published, although these substitutions had not been recognized as affecting a common interface at the time. Substituting the interface residues either on the side of Pho80 or of Pho81 constitutively activates Pho85-Pho80 kinase and destabilizes its interaction with Pho81. This was shown by Co-IP experiments from cell extracts by Huang et al. We mention the respective substitutions in the manuscript and cite the paper in which their effect on PHO pathway activation had been described.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Some points need additional attention by the authors:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In general, it would be helpful to introduce abbreviations more thoroughly (certain enzyme names, PA, MD, ...)</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We paid more attention to this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Also in general, the authors may want to think about the nomenclature of inositol pyrophosphates. Given the expansion of PP-IPs that are being detected in different organisms these days it may be a good time to convert to a more precise nomenclature, i.e. 5PP-IP5 instead of 5-IP7; and 1,5(PP)2-IP4, instead of 1,5-IP8. The latter could just be stated once, and then be abbreviated as IP8.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>To our understanding the field has not yet come up with a unified nomenclature. Therefore, we prefer to stick with the more practical nomenclature that we have chosen, which also corresponds to what is commonly used in presentations and discussions among colleagues. We have now introduced a sentence making the link to the nomenclature that the reviewer has proposed.</p>

<p>This was a leftover from a previous version of the paper. Since the paper does not treat IP6 or lower inositol polyphosphates, we have deleted this phrase.</p>

<list-item><p>p. 9, Fig 2: The exponential decay of 5-IP7 is very nicely shown in Figure 2c. But one of the most important discussion points is IP8 being the key controller of the PHO pathway - it would therefore be beneficial for the argument to also show the same kind of graph for IP8 and if possible, fit a function to the data points to better quantify and compare the decay processes (e.g. via &quot;half-life time&quot; of PP-IPs during starvation, in addition to the suggested &quot;critical concentration&quot; which was only discussed for 5-IP7 thus far).</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Kinetic resolution is an issue here. The approach shown in Figs. 2 and 5 is not apt to determine a critical concentration of IP8 because the decline upon transfer to starvation conditions is too fast and difficult to relate to the equally rapid induction of the PHO pathway. We shall address this point in a more appropriate setup in a future study.</p>

</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Currently, we do not know where these residual signals stem from. One possibility is that they represent other isomers that exist in minor concentrations and that are not resolved from 5-IP7 in CE. We added a sentence to the figure legend to indicate this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<list-item><p>p. 10: &quot;IP8 was undetectable in kcs1Δ and decreased by 75% in vip1Δ. kcs1Δ mutants also showed a 2 to 3-fold decrease in 1-IP7, suggesting that the synthesisof 1-IP7 depends on 5-IP7. This might be explained by assuming that a significant source of 1-IP7 is synthesis of 1,5-IP8 through successive action of Kcs1 and Vip1, followed by dephosphorylation to 1-IP7.&quot; - Please specify this statement. Do the authors mean that 1,5-IP8 is only produced transiently below the detection capabilities of the method but that there still is a (reduced) flux from 5-IP7 to 1,5-IP8 to 1-IP7? Otherwise it would seem paradoxical to have a dependency on a non-existing metabolite in that cell line.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>This was not clearly expressed. The revised version now says: &quot; ... a 2 to 3-fold decrease in 1-IP7, suggesting that the synthesis of 1-IP7 depends on 5-IP7. This might be explained by assuming that, in the wildtype, most 1-IP7 stems from the conversion of 5-IP7 to 1,5-IP8, followed by dephosphorylation of 1,5-IP8 to 1-IP7.&quot;. We hope that this clarifies the matter.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, we should have been more precise here.

<p>Following this comment, we have modified the respective part of the text. This part refers to a publication from the O'Shea lab (Nat. Chem Biol. 4,25) proposing the model that 1-IP7 and the Pho81 minimum domain bind competitively to the active site of Pho85 to inhibit its kinase activity. Modeling of complexes between Pho81, Pho80 and Pho85, which we present in the manuscript, rather suggests binding of the minimum domain to a groove in Pho80. This is important because it provides a viable alternative model for the action of the minimum domain. It suggests the minimum domain as a constitutive linker that attaches Pho80 to Pho85. Importantly, this model accounts perfectly for the results of previous random mutagenesis studies on Pho80 and on the minimum domain, which had independently identified both the Pho80 groove and the minimum domain residues that bind it in the prediction as critical residues for inhibition of Pho85, and for integrity of the Pho85/Pho80/Pho81 complex. We find this alternative explanation for Pho85-Pho80 regulation by Pho81, which we can derive by combining the predictions with already published experimental data, an important element to re-evaluate the relevance of 1-IP7 in PHO pathway regulation and resolve one of the existing discrepancies.</p>

<p>We are not quite sure how to interpret this remark. We do not claim that our data support a role for IP8 in mammals and plants. But we refer to and cite studies providing the strongest evidence in favor of it in these systems. The relevance of our current study relies in refuting seemingly strong evidence from yeast, which had been diametrically opposed to the data obtained in plants and mammals. The revision of the situation in yeast now paves the way to drawing a coherent concept for fungi, plants and mammals. We feel that this is important and should be underlined.</p>

<p>Trypan blue staining is not strictly required for this. It is just a simple method to fluorescently stain the cell wall. There are many other ways of delineating the cells. It could also have been done in a brightfield image.</p>

<p>1. Italicize the scientific names of the organisms; this was inconsistent throughout the manuscript. Also, gene names should be italicized; this was also inconsistent (e.g., p.12 &quot;... did not induce the PHO84 and PHO5 [sic] promoters...).</p>

<p>1. In the discussion on the data (Fig. 2A), I was tripped up by the verb tense in this phrase &quot;5-IP7 has not been detected in the kcs1Δ mutant and 1-IP7 has been strongly reduced...&quot;; I think you want to use the past tense &quot;was&quot; in both cases [as is used in the next sentence]. It made me wonder if there was a difference in the detection of 5-IP7 and IP8 in the kcs1Δ mutant, you could detect 5-IP7 but not IP8; if so, where did the 5-IP7 come from?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected the tense. Thank you for highlighting this. For the residual inositol pyrophosphate signal in kcs1Δ. We do not know its origin. One possibility, which we now mention in the text, is that it stems from IPMK side activity. It should be underlined that all signals disappear upon PI starvation.</p>

<p>We refrained from that for the line graphs. For reasons of consistency, we should do this for every line graph. If we did that, Fig. 4B would become quite hard to read.</p>

<p>1. Figure 3B-D, please check that the stipples or hatches are in the figure - the printed copy lacked them although I could see them in the electronic version; this was also true for Figures 5 and 6 (I do not know if it is a printer issue, but other hatches were visible: e.g., not seen in S4 but seen in S5).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>They are visible in our copies, also after printing. They may have been lost during file conversion at the journal.</p>

<p>1. The text description of the Pho4-yEGFP, Pho5-yEGFP and Pho84-yEGFP says that the kcs1Δ mutant &quot;showed Pho4-yEGFP constitutively in the nucleus already ... and PHO5 and PHO84 were activated&quot;. However, the data is more complex than that: whereas the localization of Pho4-yEGFP is constitutively nuclear, there is a higher basal (repressed) expression of both Pho5 and Pho84 as well as increased expression of both proteins under -Pi conditions. What accounts for the increased expression when Pho4 is already nuclear? This is also seen in the vip1Δ kcs1Δ mutant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer, but we cannot explain this effect with certainty. One possibility could be a wider dysregulation of Pi metabolism in kcs1 mutants. To name a few possibilities: Wildtype cells have polyphosphate reserves that are gradually mobilized during the first hours of P-starvation. kcs1 mutants don't have those and might fall into a &quot;deeper&quot; state of starvation faster. It should be kept in mind that the starvation response is also regulated at the level of chromatin structure, and by antisense transcripts. The influence of kcs1 on these processes is unclear.</p>

<p>They have been added to the new Fig. S6, which interprets differences between strains and conditions. Fig. S4 (now S3) shows timecourses of IPPs down to zero. Adding statistics for all pairwise differences between the timepoints would be almost an overkill.</p>
