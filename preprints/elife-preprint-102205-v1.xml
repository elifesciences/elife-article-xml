<title>Abstract</title><p>The most common primary malignancy of the liver, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a heterogeneous tumor entity with high metastatic potential and complex pathophysiology. Increasing evidence suggests that tissue mechanics plays a critical role in tumor onset and progression. Here we show that plectin, a major cytoskeletal crosslinker protein, plays a crucial role in mechanical homeostasis and mechanosensitive oncogenic signaling that drives hepatocarcinogenesis. Our expression analyses revealed elevated plectin levels in liver tumors, which correlated with poor prognosis for HCC patients. Using autochthonous and orthotopic mouse models we demonstrated that genetic and pharmacological inactivation of plectin potently suppressed the initiation and growth of HCC. Moreover, plectin targeting potently inhibited the invasion potential of human HCC cells and reduced their metastatic outgrowth in the lung. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling linked plectin-dependent disruption of cytoskeletal networks to attenuation of oncogenic FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/AKT signatures. Importantly, by combining cell line-based and murine HCC models, we show that plectin inhibitor plecstatin-1 (PST) is well-tolerated and capable of overcoming therapy resistance in HCC. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that plectin-controlled cytoarchitecture is a key determinant of HCC development and suggests that pharmacologically induced disruption of mechanical homeostasis may represent a new therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mounting evidence indicates that tissue mechanics plays a pivotal role in cancer cell and stromal cell behavior. Tumor progression is typically associated with a pathological increase of tissue stiffness caused by excessive deposition, crosslinking, and aberrant organization of dense extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers. Increasing tissue rigidity drives tumor invasion and malignancy and correlates with poor patient survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>At the cellular level, both tumor and stromal cells respond to altered mechanical properties of the extracellular milieu by translating physical cues into mechanosensitive signaling pathways. This conversion relies on focal adhesions (FAs), clusters of integrin receptors facilitating the link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton. Integrin-mediated adhesion induces the activation of FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/AKT pathways, leading to increased cell survival, migration, and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Subsequent activation of Rho-dependent pathways results in higher cytoskeletal tension and force transmission across FAs, thus establishing a mechanical reciprocity between ECM viscoelasticity and actomyosin-generated cytoskeletal tension. Importantly, many genes encoding components of the ECM- cytoskeletal axis and their regulators (e.g. <italic>αSMA</italic>, <italic>ITGβ</italic>, <italic>LMNA</italic>, <italic>ROCK</italic>, and <italic>COL</italic>) are controlled by tension-dependent transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. This creates a difficult-to-break positive feedback loop leading to cellular and matrix stiffening, further promoting the aggressive, pro-proliferative, and invasive tumor cell phenotype.</p>
<p>Emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at tumor mechanics and mechanotransduction include the targeting of the ECM and ECM modulators (e.g. lysyl oxidase and angiotensin), depletion of stromal myofibroblasts, and integrin receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Other approaches target cytoskeleton-mediated downstream cellular response to tissue stiffening (e.g. Rho-dependent actomyosin-generated contractile forces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>). We hypothesized that another efficacious strategy could be inactivation of cytoskeletal crosslinker proteins (so-called cytolinkers)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, large proteins of the plakin protein family, responsible for maintaining cellular architecture. The best-studied example, a prototypical cytolinker plectin is a well-established regulator of cellular tensional homeostasis and mechanotransduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> which is upregulated in various tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Through its canonical actin-binding domain (ABD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>) and intermediate filament (IF)-binding domain (IFBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>), plectin crosslinks actin with IF networks and recruits them to cell adhesions, including FAs. Plectin deletion or mutation results in cytoskeletal reconfiguration accompanied by altered mechanical properties, such as cellular stiffness, stress propagation, and traction force generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, plectin-dependent changes in cell adhesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and cytoskeletal tension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> are associated with aberrant integrin-mediated mechanosignaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Although multiple reports have linked plectin with tumor malignancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, mechanistic insights into how plectin functionally contributes to carcinogenesis remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>A malignancy with a well-known link to overproduction of ECM components is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. Repeated rounds of hepatocyte damage and renewal due to a number of etiologies, most commonly chronic viral infection, alcohol abuse, or a diet rich in fats and sugars, creates a pro-inflammatory environment in the liver. Activated hepatic stellate cells adopt a myofibroblast phenotype and increase production and deposition of ECM components leading to liver fibrosis which can eventually progress to liver cirrhosis. Up to 90% of HCC cases occur on a background of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, suggesting a causal link between increased deposition of ECM components and liver carcinogenesis. Consistent with this idea, plectin mRNA has been found to be upregulated in liver carcinomas, especially in later stages of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, changes in the interactions between the cytoskeleton and ECM may be important in HCC progression, particularly during the transition from local to metastatic malignancy.</p>
<p>Here we explore the role of plectin in the development and dissemination of HCC. Using publicly available HCC sequencing data and biopsies from HCC patients we identify plectin as a novel HCC marker associated with a malignant phenotype and poor survival. To explore the role of plectin in hepatocarcinogenesis, we use a genetic mouse model with liver-specific plectin ablation (<italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic>). In this model, plectin deficiency suppresses tumor initiation and growth. We further demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-engineered human HCC cell lines with inactivated plectin display limited migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent proliferation which correlates with their reduced metastatic outgrowth in the lung. By comprehensive proteomic analysis, we show that plectin inactivation attenuates oncogenic FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/AKT signaling signatures. Finally, our work identifies the ruthenium-based plecstatin-1 (PST), as a candidate drug that can mimic the genetic ablation of plectin, thus providing a robust pre-clinical proof-of-concept for PST in the treatment of HCC. Our study implicates plectin as a potent driver of HCC, highlights its importance in metastatic spread, and points to potential novel treatment options.</p>

<title>Plectin levels are elevated in HCC and predict a poor prognosis</title>
<p>Using 17 distinct HCC patient datasets, we confirmed that <italic>plectin</italic> expression is consistently and significantly increased in HCC samples when compared to non-tumor (NT) liver tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) confirmed elevated <italic>plectin</italic> expression in HCC, irrespective of HCC etiology or gender (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-D). To assess whether high plectin expression is typical for a specific subpopulation of HCC patients, we created t-SNE plots and compared plectin expression patterns with those of molecular subclasses of Dr. Chanǵs and Dr. Boyault’s classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Although we observed local clusters of patients with higher or lower plectin expression levels, they did not seem to be associated with any of the largest clusters or subgroups (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). Strikingly, using higher tertile expression as the cut-off, higher <italic>plectin</italic> mRNA levels were associated with a significant decrease in recurrence-free survival (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). A similar trend was observed across 8 distinct HCC datasets (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F).</p>

<p>Consistent with expression analysis, quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy of 19 human HCC tissue sections revealed a significant increase of plectin fluorescence intensities in tumor (T) compared to adjacent non-tumor (NT) tissue, with plectin perimembraneous enrichment in tumor hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>; Figure 1—figure supplement 1G). Next, we compared plectin expression levels by immunoblotting in a panel of human HCC cell lines, which represent distinct stages of HCC development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Consistent with mRNA and immunofluorescence analyses, poorly differentiated mesenchymal-like HCC cell lines (characterized by low E-cadherin and high vimentin levels) displayed elevated plectin levels, coinciding with higher migration speed when compared to well-differentiated HCC cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D,E</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate our findings in a well-established chemical carcinogen murine HCC model, we analyzed plectin expression in hepatic tumors formed 46 weeks after diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection in C57BI/6J mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Both quantitative immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses indicated elevated plectin levels in T versus NT liver tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,G,H</xref>; Figure 1—figure supplement 1H). Moreover, enhanced plectin signal along hepatocyte membranes closely resembled the staining pattern found in patient HCC sections, suggesting reliable translation from the human setting. Together, these results show that elevated plectin is associated with HCC progression both in human patients and animal model and indicates robust prognostic potential for patient survival.</p>

<p>To address plectińs role in HCC at a cellular level, we genetically manipulated endogenous plectin in well-differentiated Huh7 and poorly differentiated SNU-475 human HCC cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Using the CRISPR/Cas-9 system we generated either knockouts (KO) or cells harboring endogenous plectin with deletion of the IF-binding domain (ΔIFBD) as functional knockouts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-D). Gene editing was complemented by treatment with organoruthenium-based compound PST that inactivates plectin function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Consistent with the murine model, plectin inactivation resulted in a reduced number of Huh7 and SNU-475 colonies in a soft agar colony formation assay, with PST treatment closely mimicking the effect of genetic targeting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Moreover, KO and ΔIFBD SNU-475 colonies were significantly smaller when compared to wild-type (WT) controls, with a similar trend observed for Huh7 cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). Collectively, these data demonstrate the inhibitory effect of plectin inactivation on HCC progression in adhesion-independent conditions.</p>
<p>To further assess whether plectin is required for human HCC progression, we investigated the growth of subcutaneous Huh7 xenografts in immunodeficient NSG mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>; Figure 2—figure supplement 1F). Cells with disabled plectin developed significantly smaller tumors when compared with untreated WT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>), mirroring the results of the colony forming assay. The percentage of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells on immunolabeled xenograft sections, however, did not differ between experimental conditions (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F). These results show the reduced tumorigenic potential of human HCC cells when plectin is disabled either by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene ablation or pharmacologically with PST. Hence, by combining <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches, we provide evidence that plectin promotes hepatocarcinogenesis.</p>

<p>Analysis of proteome differences between WT and PST-treated cells identified abundance changes (FDR &lt; 0.05; s0 = 0.01) in 1178 proteins and 290 phosphoproteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). A comparison of KO and PST signatures using IPA revealed an overlap (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). Consistently, the IPA annotation linked also PST signature to integrin- and cytoskeleton-related signaling pathways such as “ILK signaling”, “Integrin signaling”, “RhoA signaling”, and “Actin cytoskeleton signaling” (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).

<p>To independently confirm our MS findings, we performed extensive immunoblot analysis of WT, KO, ΔIFBD, and PST-treated Huh7 and SNU-475 cells with a focus on integrin-associated adhesome network (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>; Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). In agreement with our proteomic analyses, plectin inactivation resulted in considerable changes in expression levels of integrin adhesion receptors (integrins αV and β1) as well as other FA constituents (i.e. talin, vinculin, and paxillin). Moreover, immunoblotting revealed in cells with disabled plectin either generally altered expression (FAK, AKT, Erk1/2, ILK, and PI3K) and/or reduced phosphorylation (AKT, Erk1/2, and PI3K) of key effectors downstream of integrin-mediated adhesion. Although these alterations were not found systematically in both cell lines and condition (reflecting thus presumably their distinct differentiation grade and plectin inactivation efficacy), collectively these data confirmed plectin-dependent adhesome remodeling together with attenuation of oncogenic FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt pathways upon plectin inactivation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>

Moreover, we detected a reduction in F-actin fluorescence intensity in both Huh7 and SNU-475 KO cells, as well as a decrease of atomic force microscopy (AFM)-inferred cellular stiffness as a functional readout for a well-formed cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-G).</p>

<p>Given the extent of plectin-dependent adhesome remodeling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D,E</xref>; Figure 3—figure supplement 1C), we next assessed whether plectin inactivation affects the morphology and localization of FAs in vinculin-immunolabeled SNU-475 cells. Remarkably, while FAs of micropattern-seeded WT cells were mostly located at the cell periphery, FAs of plectin-disabled cells were frequently found within the cell interior (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,E</xref>). Moreover, plectin inactivation resulted in an overall reduced number of FAs, and the FAs that remained were larger and more elongated than in WT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F,G</xref>; Figure 4—figure supplement 1H,I). To test whether the changes in actin/FA configuration affected adhesion-transmitted forces, we performed traction force microscopy (TFM; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H,I</xref>). The smaller FAs found in WT cells transmitted significantly higher contractile energy than KO, ΔIFBD, and PST- treated cells, indicating that FAs in plectin-deficient cells were less functional than in WT.</p>
<p>Functional transmission of actomyosin-generated forces across FAs constitutes a prerequisite for cellular locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Therefore, we examined the effect of plectin inactivation on the migration of HCC cells. As anticipated, both Huh7 and SNU-475 cells exhibited a decrease in migration speed upon plectin targeting in the scratch wound healing assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A,B</xref>; Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). It is noteworthy that migrating plectin-disabled SNU-475 cells exhibited more cohesive, epithelial-like features while progressing collectively. By contrast, WT SNU-475 leader cells were more polarized and found to migrate into scratch areas more frequently than their plectin-deficient counterparts (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). Consistent with this observation, individually seeded SNU-475 cells less frequently assumed a polarized, mesenchymal-like shape upon plectin inactivation in both 2D and 3D environments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Moreover, plectin-inactivated SNU-475 cells exhibited a decrease in N- cadherin and vimentin levels when compared to WT counterparts (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C).</p>

<p>In addition to slower general migration, we also found epithelial growth factor (EGF)-guided migration potential of individual KO, ΔIFBD, and PST-treated cells to be significantly reduced compared to WT cells. Consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, plectin-disabled cells traversed less linear trajectories in both random and directed scenarios (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D,E</xref>; Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,E). To determine whether plectin is involved in migration-associated cellular shape dynamics, we further investigated protrusions of SNU-475 cells using morphodynamic contour analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Our analysis revealed a higher protrusion frequency of randomly migrating WT compared to plectin-disabled cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F), while no differences in protrusion orientation were observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-H</xref>). In sharp contrast, plectin ablation dramatically reduced the capacity of KO and ΔIFBD cells to form stable protrusions in the direction of chemotactic motion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-H</xref>), although only a marginal effect on the protrusivity was observed (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F). Collectively, these results show that plectin is essential for the proper cytoskeletal configuration of HCC cells and their cytoskeleton-linked FAs. Moreover, they provide evidence that aberrant cytoarchitecture of plectin-disabled cells accounts for the failure to effectively exert traction forces and actively reconfigure body shape, both of which are required for HCC cell migration.</p>

<p>To monitor plectin effects on shape dynamics in a 3D environment, we recorded WT and KO SNU-475 cells by time-lapse video microscopy in a matrigel invasion assay. Invading WT cells exhibited polarized protrusions followed by cell body displacement in the direction of the nascent protrusion (Video 1; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). By contrast, randomly oriented thinner protrusions of KO cells were often retracted shortly after formation. Markedly thinner and branched KO protrusions were confirmed by subsequent immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Similar to what we observed in the 2D assay, KO cells failed to invade in the direction of these transient protrusions (Video 1; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Hence, plectin-controlled cytoarchitecture facilitates both 2D and 3D HCC cell migration.</p>
<p>Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification of an HCC meta-cohort with clinically annotated tumors from HCC patients (n = 978) demonstrated that high plectin mRNA expression is associated with advanced TNM stages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). To elucidate the impact of plectin inactivation on HCC dissemination, we conducted the lung colonization assay using both Huh7 and SNU-475 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G-I</xref>; Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-E). To this end, we administered red firefly luciferase and GFP (RedFLuc-GFP)-expressing WT and KO cells intravenously (i.v.) in 5-week-old NSG mice. Whereas mice receiving WT Huh7 (but not SNU-475; data not shown) cells succumbed rapidly to disease, mice receiving KO cells exhibited prolonged survival (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). To relate survival rates to the lung metastatic load, we next monitored the HCC cell retention in the lungs using <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence imaging (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). Next, another experimental cohort was expanded for WT-injected mice which were administered PST two times a day for 5 weeks (WT+PST). Mice were sacrificed 5 weeks post-injection when the first luminescence-positive chest areas were detected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>) and cleared whole lung lobes were analyzed by lattice light sheet fluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). Although no macroscopic Huh7 nodules were visible, we found a prominent reduction in the number and volume of GFP-positive KO- and WT+PST-derived metastatic nodules. Thus, both CRISPR/Cas9-based and pharmacological plectin inactivation in HCC potently inhibits metastatic load in the lungs, identifying plectin as a potential target against tumor dissemination <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HCC represents a leading cause of cancer-related death, characterized by poor long-term prognosis, high postoperative recurrence, and a high rate of metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. As chemotherapy, surgical resection, radiation, and local ablation are not effective in a large group of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic strategies to target HCC. By combining comprehensive analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered HCC cell lines with (phospho)proteomics, mouse modeling as well as human patient data, we identified the plakin family member plectin as a novel HCC marker and druggable target upstream of FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/AKT signaling. Thus, our data link plectin, a cytolinker implicated in cytoskeletal tension and mechanotransduction with a major oncogenic signaling hub controlling growth and metastasis of HCC.</p>
<p>We began this work by assessing plectin expression in publicly available HCC patient datasets. Our meta-analyses revealed plectin transcript levels to be considerably elevated in HCC irrespective of etiology or gender, whereas previous findings in HCC were inconsistent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Notably, we found that patients with higher <italic>PLEC</italic> mRNA levels had significantly shorter recurrence-free survival times than those with lower <italic>PLEC</italic> mRNA levels. Strikingly, <italic>PLEC</italic> expression in publicly available datasets was significantly associated with gene signatures related to „cell survival and proliferation“, „angiogenesis“, and „hypoxia“ (Figure 7—figure supplement 2) indicating that the <italic>PLEC</italic> level was associated with more aggressive cancer traits in HCC patients. In addition, plectin expression levels were associated with TNM staging, underscoring plectińs prognostic value for HCC patient survival. Although HCC transcriptomes appears to differ from other cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, our findings are in line with higher <italic>PLEC</italic> expression in other cancer entities such as oral squamous cell carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, testicular cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, or pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and identify plectin as a specific marker for both early and advanced stages of HCC.</p>
<p>We and others have proposed that plectin plays a central role in tumor growth and dissemination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Here, using liver-specific <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, we show that plectin ablation in hepatocytes significantly reduced tumor burden in a model of DEN-induced HCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, which mimics fundamental aspects of human disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. These mice also showed decreased hepatocarcinogenesis in a powerful model of multifocal HCC formation following hydrodynamic delivery of Myc;sgTp53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. In this model, both genetic and PST-mediated pharmacological inactivation of plectin not only reduced the number of HCC tumors formed but ultimately resulted in significantly improved survival of <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> female mice. Complementing the data from both HCC models, we found that plectin inactivation resulted in the reduced tumorigenic potential of human HCC cells, as evidenced by reduced colony growth under adhesion-independent conditions or subcutaneous xenografts in immunodeficient NSG mice. While several approaches (such as genetic manipulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, PST treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> or blocking peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> and antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>) decreasing the levels of functional plectin also lead to limited xenograft growth, to our knowledge, this is the first study showing that plectin inactivation prevents tumor progression in well-established preclinical mouse models.</p>
<p>Our previous studies demonstrated that plectin inactivation abrogates physical crosstalk between actin and IF networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, leading to the redistribution of internal tension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and ultimately resulting in defects in cell adhesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, plectin-dependent cytoskeletal disruption and aberrant adhesions have been previously linked to compromised migration and invasion of many non-cancerous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> as well as cancerous cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, including HCC cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. In support of this concept, we report the collapse of actin and vimentin IF networks in Huh7 and SNU-475 cells with disabled plectin. Cytoskeletal disruption was accompanied by redistribution of misshapen FAs, which exerted reduced traction forces onto the underlying substrates. As anticipated, aberrant cytoarchitecture resulted in significantly slower motility of HCC cells in both 2D and 3D environments. Consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, plectin inactivation reduced metastatic outgrowth of HCC cells in the lung. Intriguingly, morphodynamic contour analysis revealed in these cells reduced capacity to form stable protrusions implicated in driving path finding and cellular locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Collectively, our data suggest that plectin is essential for spatiotemporal cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell shape stabilization, and effective transmission of traction forces, and place plectin-mediated cytoskeletal crosstalk at the center of the processes that control the metastatic cascade.</p>
<p>Plectin-mediated cytoskeletal crosstalk at FAs facilitates their essential features such as dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, adhesion strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, and mechanotransduction capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Loss of vimentin filament-FA linkage upon plectin deletion in highly migratory dermal fibroblasts was shown to uncouple the activation of FAK from actomyosin-generated tension and attenuate downstream effectors such as Src, Erk1/2, and p38<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Here we show that plectin-dependent perturbation of the cytoskeleton-FAs interplay in invasive SNU-475 HCC cells profoundly altered (phospho)proteomic signatures of cytoskeleton- and cell adhesion-annotated proteins, thereby modulating mechanosensitive integrin-associated signaling events. Importantly, our (phospho)proteomic and immunoblot analyses identified attenuated signaling along FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt axes as a consequence of plectin inactivation in both Huh7 and SNU-475 HCC cells. Plectińs control of cytoskeletal crosstalk and its interplay with pro-oncogenic signaling pathways thus emerges as a critical determinant of the initiation and progression of HCC. It is noteworthy that plectin-dependent effects on PI3K/Akt and FAK/Erk signaling were recently described for prostate cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> and head and neck squamous carcinoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, indicating that these observations have broader implications beyond liver cancer. Finally, we were able to translate our findings from HCC cell lines and mouse models to HCC patients. By mining data from a large human patient cohort, we found a positive correlation between plectin expression and FA-associated FAK, Erk, and PI3K/Akt pathway gene sets. Given the well-established oncogenic activation of these pathways in human cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, our study identifies a new set of potential therapeutic targets.</p>
<p>Current therapies for HCC rely on multikinase inhibitors (such as sorafenib) that provide only moderate survival benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> due to primary resistance and the plasticity of signaling networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Therefore, the most translationally impactful finding of this work is the ability of a small organoruthenium compound PST, a high-affinity plectin ligand, to effectivelly limit hepatocarcinogenesis in Myc;sgTp53-driven HCC mouse model as well as xenografted human HCCs, leading to the dampening of HCC burden. Using PST, we further report a marked effect on metastatic HCC outgrowth in the lung along with a reduction of the migratory potential of human HCC cells in 2D and 3D settings. Most notably, our animal models show improvement in local and metastatic survival rates. Similar to other ruthenium-based metallodrugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, PST was well-tolerated by mice and human cells, suggesting good potential for clinical utilization. We and others have previously demonstrated that PST treatment closely mimics phenotypes fostered by ablation of the plectin gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Consistently, PST-mediated inhibition of plectin attenuates FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt pathways in HCC cells with efficacy comparable to CRISPR/Cas-9-engineered functional (ΔIFBD) or full (KO) knockouts. However, despite high PST target selectivity for plectin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, our data do not rule out pleiotropic effects of PST in the liver and further studies will be required to investigate whether PST mode-of-action in HCC entails molecular mechanisms other than engaging prooncogenic signaling cascades.</p>

<title>Patient tissue samples</title>
<p>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human liver tissue specimens were prepared at the Department of Surgery of the University Hospital Mannheim. The cohort consisted of 21 patients diagnosed with HCC (for details, see Supplementary file 1). Tissue collection and analysis were performed in accordance with institutional review board guidelines (reference no. 2012-293N-MA), and written informed consent was obtained from all included patients.</p>

Immunodeficient NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice were purchased from the Czech Centre for Phenogenomics (BIOCEV – Institute of Molecular Genetics Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czechia)</p>
<p>Animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with regular access to chow and drinking water and 12 h light/12 h dark conditions. All animal studies were performed in accordance with European Directive 86/609/EEC and were approved by the Czech Central Commission for Animal Welfare. Age-matched littermate mice were used in all experiments. The details regarding animal treatments can be found in the following sections.</p>

<p>2-week-old <italic>Ple<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> mice received intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg diethylnitrosamine (DEN; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) diluted in PBS. Mice were monitored for tumor formation 30 and 42 weeks after the DEN injection by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tumor volumes were calculated from MRI images (for details see Magnetic resonance imaging section). Mice were sacrificed at 44 weeks post-injection, livers were dissected, and tumors were measured using a caliper.</p>

<title>Lung colonization assay</title>
<p>Huh7 and SNU-475 cell lines stably expressing Red Firefly Luciferase reporter and GFP were prepared by lentiviral transfection of LentiGlo<sup>TM</sup> pLenti-CMV-RedFluc-IRES-EGFP plasmid (LP-31, Targeting Systems, El Cajon, CA, USA) according to the manufactureŕs protocol. Next, 2×10<sup>6</sup> Huh7 or SNU-475 cells suspended in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich) were injected into the tail vein of 5-week-old NSG mice. The mice were monitored for survival analysis or monitored using bioluminescence imaging for the presence of lung metastasis after 5 weeks. Prior to imaging, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and injected intraperitoneally with D-luciferin potassium salt (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Ten to fifteen min after injection, luciferase activity was measured using LagoX (Spectral Instruments Imaging, Tuscon, AZ, USA).</p>

All animals were monitored daily, and animal experiments were performed in compliance with all relevant ethical regulations outlined in the animal permit. After mice were sacrificed, livers and lungs were visually inspected, excised, and photographed. Tumor samples were taken to obtain protein, and the remaining liver tissue was incubated in 4% PFA for at least 24 h for FFPE tissue preparation.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>All data mining with the exception of patient analysis, proteomics on mouse tissue samples, and proteomics of SNU-475 cell cultures (see details in corresponding sections), all graphs and statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). In the boxplots, the box margins represent the 25th and 75th percentile with the midline indicates the median. Whiskers reach the last data point. Data comparison of adjacent tumor and non-tumor tissue was performed using a paired <italic>t</italic>-test. Data comparison of individual experimental groups with the control group was performed using a two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test. Growth curves were analyzed using Two-way ANOVA. Survival curves were analyzed using the Mantel-Cox test. Data distributions were assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigated the role of plectin, a cytoskeletal crosslinker protein, in liver cancer formation and progression. Using the liver-specific Plectin knockout mouse model, the authors convincingly showed that PLECTIN is critical for hepatocarcinogenesis, as functional inhibition of plectin suppressed tumor formation in several models. They also provided evidence to show that inhibition of plectin inhibited HCC cell invasion and reduced metastatic outgrowth in the lung. Mechanistically, they suggested that plectin inhibition attenuated FAK, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors generated a liver-specific plectin knockout mouse model. By using DEN and sgP53/MYC models, the authors convincingly demonstrated an oncogenic role of PLECTIN in HCC development. plecstatin-1 (PST), as a plectin inhibitor, showed promising efficacy in inhibiting HCC growth, which provides a basis for potentially treating HCC using PST.</p>
<p>The MIR images for tracking tumor growth in animal models were compelling. The high-quality confocal images and related qualifications convincingly showed the impact of plectin functional inhibition on contractility and adhesions in HCC cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are primarily well supported by data. However, some claims were not fully supported by the data presented.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that plectin controls oncogenic FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt signaling in HCC cells, representing the mechanisms by which plectin promotes HCC formation and progression. However, the effect of plectin inactivation on these signaling was inconsistent in Huh7 and SNU-475 cells (Figure 3D), despite similar cell growth inhibition in both cell lines (Figure 2G). For example, pAKT and pERK were only reduced by plectin inhibition in SNU-475 cells but not in Huh7 cells. In addition, pFAK was not changed by plectin inhibition in both cells, and the ratio of pFAK/FAK was increased in both cells. Thus, it is hard to convince me that plectin promotes HCC formation and progression by regulating these signalings. Overall, the mechanistic studies in this manuscript lack sufficient depth.</p>
<p>The authors claimed that plectin inactivation inhibits HCC invasion and metastasis using in vitro and in vivo models. However, the results from in vivo models were not as compelling as the in vitro data. The lung colonization assay is not an ideal in vivo model for studying HCC metastasis and invasion, especially when plectin inhibition suppresses HCC cell growth and survival. Using an orthotopic model that can metastasize into the lung or spleen could be much more convincing for an essential claim. Also, in Figure 6H, histology images of lungs from this experiment need to be shown to understand plectin's effect on metastasis better. Figure 6G, it is unclear how many mice were used for this experiment. Did these mice die due to the tumor burdens in the lungs?</p>
<p>The whole paper used inhibition strategies to understand the function of plectin. However, the expression of plectin in Huh7 cells is low (Figure 1D). It might be more appropriate to overexpress plectin in this cell line or others with low plectin expression to examine the effect on HCC cell growth and migration.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Plectin is a cytolinker that associates with all three main components of the cytoskeleton and intercellular junctions and is essential for epithelial tissue integrity. Previous reports showed that PLEC regulates tumor growth and metastasis in different cancers. In this manuscript, the authors described PLEC as a target in the initiation and growth of HCC. They showed that inhibiting PLEC reduced tumorigenesis in different in vitro and in vivo HCC models, including in a xenograft model, DEN model, oncogene-induced HCC model, and a lung metastasis model. Mechanistically, the authors showed that inhibiting PLEC results in a disorganized cytoskeleton, deficiency in cell migration, and changes in relevant signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In general, the data are shown in multiple ways and support the main conclusion of the manuscript. The results add to the field by highlighting the importance of cellular mechanics in cancer progression.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The annotation of mouse numbers is confusing. In Figures 2A B D E F, it should be the same experiment, but the N numbers in A are 6 and 5. In E and F they are 8 and 3. Similarly, in Figure 2H, in the tumor size curve, the N values are 4,4,5,6. In the table, N values are 8,8,10,11 (the authors showed 8,7,8,7 tumors that formed in the picture).</p>
<p>(2) In Figure 3D and Figure S3C, the changes in most of the proteins/phosphorylation sites are not convincing/consistent. These data are not essential for the conclusion of the paper and WB is semi-quantitative. Maybe including more plots of the proteins from proteomic data could strengthen their detailed conclusions about the link between Plectin and the FAK, MAPK/Erk, PI3K/Akt pathways as shown in 3E.</p>
<p>(3) Figure S7A and B, The pictures do not show any tumor, which is different from Figure 7A and B (and from the quantification in S7A lower right). Is it just because male mice were used in Figure 7 and female mice were used in Figure S7? Is there literature supporting the sex difference for the Myc-sgP53 model?</p>
<p>(4) Figure 2F, S2A, PleΔAlb mice more frequently formed larger tumors, as reflected by overall tumor size increase. The interpretation of the authors is &quot;possibly implying reduced migration or increased cohesion of plectin-depleted cells&quot;. It is quite arbitrary to make this suggestion in the absence of substantial data or literature to support this theory.</p>
<p>(5) Mutation or KO PLEC has been shown to cause severe diseases in humans and mice, including skin blistering, muscular dystrophy, and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. Please elaborate on the potential side effects of targeting plectin to treat HCC.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Outla Z et al described the analysis of plectin in HCC pathogenesis. Specifically, it was found that elevated plectin levels in liver tumors, correlated with poor prognosis for HCC patients. Mechanistically, it showed that plectin-dependent disruption of cytoskeletal networks leads to the attenuation of oncogenic FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/AKT signals. Finally, the authors showed that plectin inhibitor plecstatin-1 (PST) is well-tolerated and capable of overcoming therapy resistance in HCC.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The studies of plectin are not entirely novel (Pubmed: 36613521). Nevertheless, the current manuscript provides a much more detailed mechanistic study and the results have translational implications. Additional strengths include convincing cell biology data, such as plectin regulates cytoskeletal networks, and HCC migration/invasion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Multiple major issues are noted, and the conclusion is not well supported by the data presented.</p>
<p>(1) The rationale for using Huh7 cells in the manuscript is not well explained as it has the lowest plectin expression levels.</p>
<p>(2) The KO cell experiments should be supplemented with overexpression experiments.</p>
<p>(3) There is significant concern that while ablation of Ple led to reduced tumor number, these mice had larger tumors. The data indicate that plectin may have distinct roles in HCC initiation versus progression. The data are not well explained and do not fully support that plectin promotes hepatocarcinogenesis.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 3 showed that plectin does not regulate p-FAK/FAK expression. Therefore, the statement that plectin regulates the FAK pathway is not valid. Furthermore, there are too many variables in turns of p-AKT and p-ERK expression, making the conclusion not well supported.</p>
<p>(5) The studies of plecstatin-1 in HCC should be expanded to a panel of human HCC cells with various plectin expression levels in turns of cell growth and cell migration. The IC50 values should be determined and correlate with plectin expression.</p>
<p>(6) One of the major issues is the mechanistic studies focusing on plectin regulating HCC migration/metastasis, whereas the in vivo mouse studies focus on HCC formation (Figures 3 and 7). These are distinct processes and should not be mixed.</p>
<p>(7) Figure 7B showed that Ple KO mice were treated with PST, but the data are not presented in the manuscript. Tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis rates should be analyzed as well.</p>
<p>(8) The status of FAK, AKT, and ERK pathway activation was not analyzed in mouse liver samples. In Figure 7D, most of the adjusted p-values are not significant.</p>
<p>(9) There is no evidence to support that PST is capable of overcoming therapy resistance in HCC. For example, no comparison with the current standard care was provided in the preclinical studies.</p>
