<title>Abstract</title><p>Sepsis causes millions of deaths per year worldwide and is a current global health priority declared by the WHO. Sepsis-related deaths are a result of dysregulated inflammatory immune responses indicating the need to develop strategies to target inflammation. An important mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that is released by inflamed host cells and tissues, and also by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP. Using genetic mutant strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>), we demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane. In addition, impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane notably contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, local effects of bacterial ATP were analysed using a transformed <italic>E. coli</italic> bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abrogating bacterial ATP release shows that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. In addition, bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles (OMV). ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulated expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity. This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Worldwide, 11 million sepsis-related deaths were reported 2017, which accounted for an estimated 19.7% of all global deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rudd et al., 2020</xref>). Given its high incidence and immense socio-economic burden, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared sepsis as a global health priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Reinhart et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an imbalanced host immune response to infection. Antibiotic treatment remains the main approach to treat sepsis; however, despite the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, lethality remains high. Immune-modulating strategies are an additional approach to antibiotics to curb excessive inflammation and to support an effective defense against the infectious agents. Until recently however, most trials inhibiting cytokine responses or toll-like receptors failed, indicating that alternative approaches for immunomodulation are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cao et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been shown that adenosine triphosphate (ATP), as soon as it is released into the extracellular space, critically modulates inflammatory and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Di Virgilio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eltzschig et al., 2012</xref>) by activating ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2Y receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Burnstock, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Junger, 2011</xref>). Also, such purinergic signaling critically alters immune responses during sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dosch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ledderose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Spari &amp; Beldi, 2020</xref>). In particular, we have described that the connexin-dependent release of ATP by macrophages initiates an autocrine loop of over-activation, resulting in altered local and systemic cytokine secretion, which exacerbates abdominal sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dosch et al., 2019</xref>). Such sepsis-promoting effects of host-derived extracellular ATP are secondary to inflammation initiated by bacterial pathogens.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been discovered that also bacteria release ATP into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mempin et al., 2013</xref>). Such ATP release might be a conserved mechanism of protection from host defense and precede host responses. ATP release has been shown for a variety of bacteria including the sepsis-associated <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (<italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>) from the Proteobacteria phylum or <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (<italic>E. faecalis</italic>) and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus)</italic> from the Firmicutes phylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Diekema et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hironaka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Iwase et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mempin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">MureÈan et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The mechanisms by which inflammatory and immune responses in the host are modulated by such released bacterial ATP have just begun to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Spari &amp; Beldi, 2020</xref>). In colonized compartments such as the intestine, it has been shown that ATP released by mutualistic bacteria modulates local cellular and secretory immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Atarashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Perruzza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Proietti et al., 2019a</xref>) and in the mouth, bacterial ATP release leads to biofilm dispersal and periodontitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ding &amp; Tan, 2016</xref>). However, the role of ATP released by bacteria invading non-colonized compartments, such as the abdominal cavity or the blood in the context of local and systemic infections, remains to be determined.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated if ATP released from bacteria influences the outcome of abdominal sepsis. We first isolated sepsis-associated bacteria and measured the amount of ATP they release. Second, we analysed the function of the inner bacterial membrane on ATP release over time in <italic>E. coli</italic> and in <italic>E. coli</italic> with mutations in integral respiratory chain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mempin et al., 2013</xref>). Third, the function of the outer bacterial membrane on ATP release during growth was assessed using porin mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alvarez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Choi &amp; Lee, 2019</xref>). Fourth, we investigated local effects of ATP in the abdominal cavity. Lastly, based on the finding that bacteria secrete outer membrane vesicles (OMV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schwechheimer &amp; Kuehn, 2015</xref>), we investigated systemic consequences of released bacterial ATP.</p>

<p>To assess ATP release of sepsis-associated bacteria, abdominal fluid of patients with abdominal sepsis was sampled and an-/aerobically incubated on LB agar plates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Twenty-five different colonies were randomly picked and analysed by whole 16S-rRNA sanger sequencing, which resulted in twelve different bacterial species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). From these, the four most clinically important sepsis-associated bacteria <italic>E. coli, K. pneumoniae</italic> (both gram<sup>neg</sup>), <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> (both gram<sup>pos</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Diekema et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">MureÈan et al., 2018</xref>) were further cultivated for experimental studies. We quantified released ATP over time (<xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>) using a luciferin-luciferase-based assay. A growth-dependent release of ATP was observed in all species, peaking during exponential growth phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Cumulative amount of released ATP was quantified using the area under the curve (AUC) of released ATP over time (AUC ATP). ATP release was detected across all assessed species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). To model these findings in mice, abdominal sepsis was induced using a standardized cecal ligation and puncture model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dosch et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure1E</xref>). Similar to human samples, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phyla were predominating (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure1B</xref>). In the mouse model, <italic>E. coli</italic> released notably more cumulative ATP compared to <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G-H</xref>). The bacterial species assessed in humans and mice (<italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>) differed on the strain level (sequences deposited, see data availability statement) confirming that ATP release is strain-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mempin et al., 2013</xref>). In summary, sepsis-associated bacteria release ATP in a growth-dependent and strain-specific manner. <italic>E. coli,</italic> which is one of the most frequent facultative pathogens in patients with abdominal sepsis, released the highest amount of ATP isolated from a standardized mouse model of abdominal sepsis.</p>

<title>Bacterial ATP release is dependent on ATP synthesis at the inner bacterial membrane and correlates with bacterial growth</title>
<p>After having demonstrated that sepsis-associated bacteria release ATP, we next questioned whether and how ATP release is dependent on ATP generation. ATP synthase and cytochrome oxidases, which are located in the inner bacterial membrane, are key components of ATP generation under aerobic conditions. Therefore, ATP release of the <italic>E. coli</italic> parental strain (PS) was compared to all available mutants of ATP synthase subunits (<italic>ÎatpA</italic>, <italic>ÎatpB</italic>, <italic>ÎatpC</italic>, <italic>ÎatpD</italic>, <italic>ÎatpE</italic>, <italic>ÎatpF</italic>, <italic>ÎatpH</italic>) and cytochrome <italic>bo<sub>3</sub></italic> oxidase subunits (<italic>ÎcyoA</italic>, <italic>ÎcyoB</italic>, <italic>ÎcyoC</italic>, <italic>ÎcyoD</italic>) from the Keio collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baba et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yamamoto et al., 2009</xref>). The use of different mutants allows to identify the most relevant subunits influencing ATP release. Also it allows to identify a possible correlation of bacterial ATP release with growth, which is a function of ATP generation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Galber et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ihssen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">IvanÄiÄ et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lundin, 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>Bacterial growth (OD<sub>600</sub>) and ATP release were measured over time and cumulative ATP release (AUC ATP) was assessed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We first noticed that mutations in subunits of ATP synthase, which is the key enzyme of ATP generation, were generally associated with significantly lower cumulative ATP release compared to mutations in cytochrome <italic>bo<sub>3</sub></italic> oxidase subunits (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, we suspected an interrelation between ATP generation and released ATP (see growth and ATP release curves in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We determined cumulative growth (AUC growth) in addition to cumulative ATP release and indeed, cumulative ATP release and cumulative growth were positively correlated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In summary, ATP release is directly dependent on ATP generation at the inner bacterial membrane. Mutations in subunits of bacterial ATP synthase have a higher impact on ATP generation, growth, and ATP release than mutations in subunits of cytochrome <italic>bo<sub>3</sub></italic> oxidase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Outer bacterial membrane integrity and bacterial death determine bacterial ATP release during growth</title>
<p>We next focused on the outer membrane by challenging its integrity while leaving ATP generation and the inner membrane intact. For that purpose, we used the <italic>E. coli</italic> porin mutants <italic>ÎompC</italic>, <italic>ÎompF</italic>, <italic>ÎlamB</italic> and <italic>ÎphoE</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baba et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yamamoto et al., 2009</xref>), which have been shown to suffer from impaired outer membrane integrity in varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Choi &amp; Lee, 2019</xref>). ATP release and growth were measured over time including <italic>E. coli</italic> PS as baseline and membrane destabilizing EDTA and stabilizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> as additional controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Leive, 1968</xref>). Cumulative ATP release (AUC ATP) from the porin mutants were notably different compared to the PS, being lowest in <italic>ÎompC</italic> and highest in <italic>ÎompF</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, the <italic>ÎompF</italic> mutant had also a very high peak of released ATP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We hypothesized that this is because of impaired membrane integrity, resulting in ATP release during growth and potentially bacterial death. Thus, we focused on the individual ATP peaks during growth, which were observed after 4h of culturing. There was a strong negative correlation between the individual peak of released ATP (marked by the red line in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) and growth at the same time point (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>We did not interfere with ATP generation at the inner membrane but deliberately challenged the outer membrane and tested therewith if destabilization of the outer membrane integrity is associated with bacterial death. Indeed, outer membrane integrity and bacterial death are significantly increased in <italic>ÎompF</italic> compared to <italic>ÎompC</italic> and the PS after 4h (ATP peak) of culturing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, F), akin to the amount of released ATP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). We conclude from these data that destabilization of the outer bacterial membrane (as observed with the <italic>ÎompF</italic> mutant), results in bacterial death that is associated with ATP release.</p>
<p>In summary, outer membrane integrity and finally bacterial death notably contribute to the amount of bacterial ATP release during growth.</p>

<title>Released bacterial ATP reduces neutrophil counts and impairs survival during abdominal sepsis</title>
<p>Next, we wanted to investigate the function of bacterial ATP release in vivo. To study this, we transformed the <italic>E. coli</italic> PS with an arabinose-inducible apyrase (PS+pAPY) and compared it to the PS transformed with the empty vector (PS+pEMPTY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Proietti et al., 2019b</xref>). In this model, ATP released by bacteria is hydrolyzed and consequently depleted by a periplasmic apyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Santapaola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Scribano et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, apyrase induction resulted in a significant reduction of ATP release in PS+pAPY, compared to PS+pEMPTY (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). To test the consequences in vivo, apyrase was induced by arabinose three hours before intraabdominal (i.a.) injection into wild type C57Bl/6 mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Thereby ATP release was abrogated in the bacteria cultures that were used for injection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In vivo, no difference in ATP levels were detected when ATP was measured directly in the abdominal fluid after four (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) and eight hours (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1C</xref>). This is not surprising given that ATP is rapidly hydrolysed by ectonucleotidases in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eltzschig et al., 2012</xref>). After both four (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref>) and eight hours (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1D-E</xref>), no differences in local or systemic bacterial counts were observed. Yet, despite similar bacterial counts, the survival was significantly higher in the absence of bacterial ATP (PS+pAPY) compared to ATP-generating controls (PS+pEMPTY) after i.a. injection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we asked how this difference in bacterial ATP release affects the immune system. Therefore, inflammatory cells in the abdominal cavity were characterized using flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). As expected, a disappearance reaction of large peritoneal macrophages (LPM) was observed after both, <italic>E. coli</italic> PS+pEMPTY and <italic>E. coli</italic> PS+pAPY i.a. injection compared to sham controls after four (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>) and eight hours (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ghosn et al., 2010</xref>). Such LPM disappearance following abdominal <italic>E. coli</italic> infection is a result of free-floating clots composed of LPMs and neutrophils and important for effective pathogen clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Salm et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Vega-PÃ©rez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zindel et al., 2021</xref>) but not dependent on ATP release according to our data. Interestingly, however, the number of small peritoneal macrophages (SPM) and CX3CR1<sup>pos</sup> monocytes was significantly reduced, whereas neutrophils were significantly increased almost up to 8 hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>, <xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1G</xref>) in bacterial ATP-depleted abdominal sepsis (PS+pAPY). This effect is potentially dependent on released bacterial ATP given that no differences in bacterial counts were observed (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and 4E, <xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1D-E</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, ATP released by bacteria suppresses abdominal inflammatory responses and worsened survival in a model of abdominal sepsis.</p>

<title>Establishing ATP-loaded OMV as a model system to assess the systemic relevance of bacterial ATP</title>
<p>ATP is rapidly metabolized in the extracellular space and therefore, the mode of action of released bacterial ATP is limited to the immediate cellular vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Junger, 2011</xref>). However, the outcome of sepsis is not only dependent on local but also on systemic responses to microorganisms. Therefore, we hypothesized that bacterial ATP has systemic effects as protected cargo in OMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alvarez et al., 2017</xref>). OMV are small (20-300nm) spherical particles that are released by both gram<sup>neg</sup> and gram<sup>pos</sup> bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schwechheimer &amp; Kuehn, 2015</xref>). In gram<sup>neg</sup> bacteria, they bulge off the outer membrane and disseminate throughout the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jang et al., 2015</xref>). They are equipped with typical bacterial surface features lacking the machinery for self-reproduction, and contain DNA, proteins, and metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baeza &amp; Mercade, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bitto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kulp &amp; Kuehn, 2010</xref>; E.-Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, OMV are suited as a systemic delivery system for bacterial ATP. Indeed, recently, ATP has been detected in OMV derived from pathogenic <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 and <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> AB41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">PÃ©rez-Cruz et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the potential of OMV as ATP carriers, we compared the OMV production from several hypervesiculation <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants (<italic>ÎmlaE</italic>, <italic>ÎmlaA</italic>, <italic>ÎrfaD</italic>, <italic>ÎdegP</italic>, <italic>ÎrodZ</italic>, <italic>ÎnlpI</italic>, <italic>ÎtolB</italic>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McBroom et al., 2006</xref>). The <italic>ÎnlpI</italic> and <italic>ÎtolB</italic> strains showed a 20- and 30-fold increase of OMVs when compared with the PS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). We then assessed ATP release and growth over time from <italic>ÎnlpI</italic>, <italic>ÎtolB</italic> and the PS, to identify their individual peak of ATP release, and isolated OMV at their individual peak of ATP release and after 24h (<xref rid="figs5_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref>). ATP was detected in OMV from all assessed strains at the individual peak of ATP release but only in minimal detectable levels after 24h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The <italic>ÎtolB</italic> OMV isolated after 24h were then used as ATP-depleted vehicles. Density gradient ultracentrifugation showed that most <italic>ÎtolB</italic> OMV were of similar density and protein composition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref rid="figs5_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1B</xref>). They were equipped with outer membrane ompF but not cytoplasmic ftsZ (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that they are outer membrane derived. In order to generate OMV with known and constant ATP concentrations, we used electroporation to load OMV with ATP while empty OMV (<italic>ÎtolB</italic> OMV harvested from 24h culture) served as ATP-depleted controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">LennaÃ¡rd et al., 2021</xref>).

<p>In the abdominal fluid, uptake of DiI-stained OMV by leucocytes was independent of ATP cargo (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref rid="figs6_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>) and all major cell populations with phagocytic ability (LPM, SPM, neutrophils) were highly positive for OMV (<xref rid="figs6_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). LPM dramatically decreased, whereas neutrophils increased in response to OMV when compared to sham controls (<xref rid="figs6_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Within one hour, the DiI-stained OMV were distributed throughout the body and mainly taken up by neutrophils, with remarkable differences between organs (<xref rid="figs6_3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 3A-B</xref>). The highest ratio of OMV<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils compared to all other OMV<sup>pos</sup> cells was observed in the lung in an ATP-independent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Intracellular fate of engulfed OMV is still a matter of discussion but one possibility is the degradation in the endolysosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bielaszewska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Juodeikis &amp; Carding, 2022</xref>). We therefore injected DiI-stained OMV i.a. to assess to which membrane compartment OMV co-localize. A strong co-localization with the endolysosomal compartment of pulmonary neutrophils was identified (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine what pathways OMV-derived bacterial ATP initiates in neutrophils after uptake into the endolysosomal compartment, pulmonary neutrophils were isolated (<xref rid="figs6_4" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 4</xref>) for RNA sequencing. Uptake of ATP-loaded OMV resulted in a significantly different transcriptional activity compared to empty OMV (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>): The strongest differences were found in lysosomal (LYSO) and neutrophil degranulation pathways (NDG) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref rid="figs6_5" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 5</xref>). In the lysosomal pathway, transcripts for proteins involved in autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Gabarap), endosome to lysosome transport (Hgsnat, Laptm5), or enzymatic cleavage (Capn1, Fuca1, Ctsb, Ctsd, Gba) were significantly higher expressed in response to ATP-loaded OMV when compared to empty OMV (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F-G</xref>). Furthermore, neutrophil degranulation was significantly increased in response to ATP-loaded OMV as indicated by increased expression of gene transcripts resulting in antibacterial activity (Lyz2, S100a8, Camp) or NETosis (Tlr2, Itgb2) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F and H</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, OMV are phagocytosed locally by major cell populations with phagocytic ability. Remotely, OMV were mainly taken up by neutrophils, where they co-localize with the endolysosomal compartment. Delivery of ATP by OMV resulted in an upregulation of lysosomal activation and neutrophil degranulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have demonstrated that ATP release is dependent on the respiratory chain located at the inner bacterial membrane. ATP synthase is most likely dominant compared to cytochrome <italic>bo<sub>3</sub></italic> oxidase because of its non-redundant function for ATP generation and bacterial growth. Mutations in one of the cytochrome <italic>bo<sub>3</sub></italic> oxidase subunits cyoA, cyoC or cyoD could be compensated by another subunit. This is supported by lower ATP release in the cyoB mutant, which harbors all three prosthetic groups of the cytochrome <italic>bo<sub>3</sub></italic> oxidase and is therefore indispensable for proper function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tsubaki et al., 2000</xref>). Alternatively, deficiency in the <italic>bo<sub>3</sub></italic>-type oxidase could be partially compensated by <italic>bd</italic>-type oxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Borisov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grauel et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Instability of the outer bacterial membrane as we have seen for the <italic>ÎompF</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Choi &amp; Lee, 2019</xref>) is associated with bacterial death and ATP release. It remains unclear whether loss of ATP results directly in bacterial death or bacterial death is the direct result of impaired outer bacterial membrane stability and ATP release is secondary to bacterial death. However, since the inner membrane and ATP generation remains intact and the periplasmic space is considered generally devoid of ATP, the latter seems more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kulp &amp; Kuehn, 2010</xref>). Previous studies used Sytox/PI staining and microscopy to identify bacterial death and did not identify bacterial death as a relevant source of extracellular ATP during exponential growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hironaka et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, we used flow cytometry, a quantitatively more sensitive method and our data demonstrated that impaired membrane integrity and bacterial death are critical for ATP release during growth. Despite low rates of bacterial death during exponential growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Koch, 1959</xref>), and a low ratio of dead to live bacteria, the high gradient between intra- and extracellular ATP (approximately 100 - 1000x higher) might be sufficient to explain the amount of released ATP measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Leduc &amp; Van Heijenoort, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mempin et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>ATP was detected within OMV and the concentration of ATP within OMV is sufficient to activate P2-type receptors in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Araujo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Junger, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, OMV are released in response to environmental stresses like infection and sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kulp &amp; Kuehn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Orench-Rivera &amp; Kuehn, 2016</xref>). ATP is likely to activate P2 receptors, which have been shown to be expressed in lysosomes, such as P2X1, P2X3 or P2X4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Qureshi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Robinson &amp; Murrell-Lagnado, 2013</xref>). OMV can therefore be considered as non-living bacteria-resembling highly inflammatory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kulp &amp; Kuehn, 2010</xref>) that effectively distribute ATP throughout the body to activate cells, such as neutrophils, initiating systemic inflammatory responses. Activation of neutrophils in response to ATP-loaded OMV resulted in upregulation of inflammatory, lysosomal, and neutrophil degranulation pathways as well as an upregulation of the apoptosis pathway and genes involved in NETosis by a hitherto unknown mechanism. These pathways explain in part the low neutrophil counts we observed in mice. Such remote degranulation in response to OMV is unlikely to control bacteria at the source of sepsis but rather harmful to host tissues increasing sepsis severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eichelberger &amp; Goldman, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The study has several limitations: Bacterial ATP release is strain specific (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mempin et al., 2013</xref>). As we focused on the laboratory BW25113 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, it remains to be elucidated if impaired outer membrane integrity and bacterial death are also of such importance in other gram<sup>neg</sup> or also gram<sup>pos</sup> bacteria. The approach to load OMV with ATP is rather artificial; it is, however, the only way to assure that ATP-loaded and empty OMV only differ in their ATP cargo. OMV have surface antigens and contain DNA, proteins and other metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kulp &amp; Kuehn, 2010</xref>), which are known to elicit inflammation as well. This was controlled using the same OMV as baseline vehicles.</p>
<p>Several open questions need to be addressed in future projects: It remains to be determined how OMV are physiologically loaded with ATP. Potentially, despite the lack of a transporter, ATP may similarly to eukaryotic cells leak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Yegutkin et al., 2006</xref>) across the inner membrane into the periplasmic space that lacks the enzymes for ATP generation. Different types of OMV have been described in recent years, for example outer-inner membrane vesicles (O-IMV) or explosive OMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Juodeikis &amp; Carding, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Takaki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Toyofuku et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Turnbull et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Turner et al., 2015</xref>), which are composed of outer membrane, inner membrane and cytoplasmic content. The mechanisms, how these types of OMV are generated, could explain that ATP is found within them. However, the <italic>ÎtolB</italic> mutant produces, unlike other tol mutants, only very few O-IMV (0.1%-2% of all OMV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">PÃ©rez-Cruz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Reimer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Takaki et al., 2020</xref>) and our Western blot analysis suggests that our OMV are primarily outer membrane derived. Future studies may address the ATP cargo of the different OMV subgroups.</p>
<p>OMV are promising diagnostic molecular biomarkers in gram<sup>neg</sup> sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Michel &amp; Gaborski, 2022</xref>) and it would be of relevance to compare OMV isolated from septic and control patients to assess possible differences in ATP cargo. Furthermore, it remains to be elucidated, which mechanisms lead to low local neutrophil counts. Since ATP is involved in cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Proietti et al., 2019b</xref>) as well as in chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Junger, 2011</xref>), increased cell death, impaired infiltration or a combination of both is possible.</p>
<p>This study reveals that ATP is released by bacteria during growth because of impaired membrane integrity and bacterial death. ATP is also being released via OMV and therefore acts locally (direct release) and systemically (via OMV). Bacterial ATP reduces neutrophil counts, activates the endolysosomal system and upregulates neutrophil degranulation, which together increase the severity of abdominal infection and early sepsis. These findings have the potential to lead to the development of novel treatments for abdominal sepsis, e.g. by in vitro generated OMV that modulate neutrophil function via delivery of inhibitors to intracellular purinergic receptors during sepsis.</p>

<p>To isolate bacteria from mice with abdominal sepsis, cecal ligation and puncture was performed as described elsewhere with some minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rittirsch et al., 2009</xref>). In brief, mice were anesthetized s.c. injecting (3Âµl/g body weight) a mixture of fentanyl (0.05mg/ml), dormicum (5mg/ml) and medetor (1mg/ml) and were then shaved and disinfected with Betadine. Mid-line laparotomy was performed (approx. 1 cm) and the cecum was exposed. The proximal 1/3 of the cecum was ligated with Vicryl 4-0 (Ethicon, cat# V1224H) and perforated with a 23 G needle. The cecum was returned to the abdominal cavity and the laparotomy was sutured continuously in two layers with prolene 6-0 (Ethicon, cat# MPP8697H). At the end, the antidote (naloxone (0.1mg/ml), revertor (5mg/ml), temgesic (0.3mg/ml)) was s.c. injected (9Âµl/g body weight). A semi-quantitative score sheet was used to predict animal postoperative well-being. Mice were evaluated every four hours according to the following criteria: appearance, level of consciousness, activity, response to stimulus, eye shape, respiratory rate and respiratory quality and analgesia was applied if necessary.

For survival analyses, a log-rank test was used. No one-tailed tests were used. No method was used to predetermine experimental sample sizes. A linear model and the correlation between ATP and OD<sub>600</sub> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> were computed using the R functions <italic>lm</italic> and <italic>cor.test</italic> with the following parameters:</p>
<p>stats::cor.test(<italic>data</italic>$<italic>variable</italic>ATP, <italic>data</italic>$<italic>variable</italic>growth, alternative = âtwo.sidedâ, method = âpearsonâ) summary(stats::lm(<italic>variable</italic>ATP â¼ <italic>variable</italic>growth, data = <italic>data</italic>))</p>
<p>P &lt; 0.05 (p == padj, when correction for multiple testing was necessary) was considered significant in all statistical analyses unless stated otherwise in the figure legend. Significant differences are in <italic>italic</italic>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Extracellular ATP represents a danger-associated molecular pattern associated to tissue damage and can act also in an autocrine fashion in macrophages to promote proinflammatory responses, as observed in a previous paper by the authors in abdominal sepsis. The present study addresses an important aspect possibly conditioning the outcome of sepsis that is the release of ATP by bacteria. The authors show that sepsis-associated bacteria do in fact release ATP in a growth dependent and strain-specific manner. However, whether this bacterial derived ATP play a role in the pathogenesis of abdominal sepsis has not been determined. To address this question, a number of mutant strains of E. coli has been used first to correlate bacterial ATP release with growth and then, with outer membrane integrity and bacterial death. By using E. coli transformants expressing the ATP-degrading enzyme apyrase in the periplasmic space, the paper nicely shows that abdominal sepsis by these transformants results in significantly improved survival. This effect was associated with a reduction of peritoneal macrophages and CX3CR1+ monocytes, and an increase in neutrophils. To extrapolate the function of bacterial ATP from the systemic response to microorganisms, the authors exploited bacterial OMVs either loaded or not with ATP to investigate the systemic effects devoid of living microorganisms. This approach showed that ATP-loaded OMVs induced degranulation of neutrophils after lysosomal uptake, suggesting that this mechanism could contribute to sepsis severity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A strong part of the study is the analysis of E. coli mutants to address different aspects of bacterial release of ATP that could be relevant during systemic dissemination of bacteria in the host.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As pointed out in the limitations of the study whether ATP-loaded OMVs provide a mechanistic proof of the pathogenetic role of bacteria-derived ATP independently of live microorganisms in sepsis is interesting but not definitively convincing. It could be useful to see whether degranulation of neutrophils is differentially induced by apyrase-expressing vs control E. coli transformants. Also, the increase of neutrophils in bacterial ATP-depleted abdominal sepsis, which has better outcomes than &quot;ATP-proficient&quot; sepsis, seems difficult to correlate to the hypothesized tissue damage induced by ATP delivered via non-infectious OMVs. Are the neutrophils counts affected by ATP delivered via OMVs? A comparison of cytokine profiles in the abdominal fluids of E. coli and OMV treated animals could be helpful in defining the different responses induced by OMV-delivered vs bacterial-released ATP. The analyses performed on OMV treated versus E. coli infected mice are not closely related and difficult to combine when trying to draw a hypothesis for bacterial ATP in sepsis. Also it was not clear why lung neutrophils were used for the RNAseq data generation and analysis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript &quot;Released Bacterial ATP Shapes Local and Systemic Inflammation during Abdominal Sepsis&quot;, Daniel Spari et al. explored the dual role of ATP in exacerbating sepsis, revealing that ATP from both host and bacteria significantly impacts immune responses and disease progression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study meticulously examines the complex relationship between ATP release and bacterial growth, membrane integrity, and how bacterial ATP potentially dampens inflammatory responses, thereby impairing survival in sepsis models. Additionally, this compelling paper implies a concept that bacterial OMVs act as vehicles for the systemic distribution of ATP, influencing neutrophil activity and exacerbating sepsis severity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The researchers extracted and cultivated abdominal fluid on LB agar plates, then randomly picked 25 colonies for analysis. However, they did not conduct 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing on the fluid itself. It is worth noting that the bacterial species present may vary depending on the individual patients. It would be beneficial if the authors could specify whether they've verified the existence of unculturable species capable of secreting high levels of Extracellular ATP.</p>
<p>(2) Do mice lacking commensal bacteria show a lack of extracellular ATP following cecal ligation puncture?</p>
<p>(3) The authors isolated various bacteria from abdominal fluid, encompassing both Gram-negative and Gram-positive types. Nevertheless, their emphasis appeared to be primarily on the Gram-negative E. coli. It would be beneficial to ascertain whether the mechanisms of Extracellular ATP release differ between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This is particularly relevant given that the Gram-positive bacterium E. faecalis, also isolated from the abdominal fluid, is recognized for its propensity to release substantial amounts of Extracellular ATP.</p>
<p>(4) The authors observed changes in the levels of LPM, SPM, and neutrophils in vivo. However, it remains uncertain whether the proliferation or migration of these cells is modulated or inhibited by ATP receptors like P2Y receptors. This aspect requires further investigation to establish a convincing connection.</p>
<p>(5) Additionally, is it possible that the observed in vivo changes could be triggered by bacterial components other than Extracellular ATP? In this research field, a comprehensive collection of inhibitors is available, so it is desirable to utilize them to demonstrate clearer results.</p>
<p>(6) Have the authors considered the role of host-derived Extracellular ATP in the context of inflammation?</p>
<p>(7) The authors mention that Extracellular ATP is rapidly hydrolyzed by ectonucleotases in vivo. Are the changes of immune cells within the peritoneal cavity caused by Extracellular ATP released from bacterial death or by OMVs?</p>
<p>(8) In the manuscript, the sample size (n) for the data consistently remains at 2. I would suggest expanding the sample size to enhance the robustness and rigor of the results.</p>

<p>We kindly thank the senior editor, the reviewing editor, and the esteemed reviewers for their invaluable insights in enhancing our manuscript. The assessment and feedback, particularly on the role of directly released bacterial ATP versus OMV-delivered bacterial ATP and its role on neutrophils, addressing study limitations, and discussing our models is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>The points you raised let us critically rethink our approach, our results, and our conclusions. Furthermore, it gave us the chance to elaborate on some critical aspects that you mentioned. With your help, we will make clarifications throughout the manuscript, and we will add the data about neutrophil numbers in the different organs (reviewer #1, weaknesses #3).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for raising several important points. In our study, we assessed local and systemic effects of released bacterial ATP. The consequences of local bacterial ATP release were assessed using an apyrase-expressing E. coli transformant. Locally, bacterial ATP resulted in a decrease in neutrophil numbers and we hypothesize that directly released bacterial ATP either leads to neutrophil death (e.g. via P2X7 receptor (Proietti et al., 2019)) or interferes with the recruitment of neutrophils (e.g. via P2Y receptors (Junger, 2011)).</p>
<p>The systemic consequences were assessed using ATP-loaded and empty OMV. We have shown that degranulation is induced by OMV-derived bacterial ATP. ATP-containing OMV are engulfed by neutrophils, reach its endolysosomal compartment and might activate purinergic receptors, which then lead to aberrant degranulation. This concept, that needs to be explored in future studies, is fundamentally different from classical purinergic signaling via directly released bacterial ATP into the extracellular space.</p>
<p>It is possible that neutrophil degranulation is also modulated by directly released bacterial ATP. We agree that this should be assessed in future studies. Also, the role of OMV-derived bacterial ATP should be assessed locally as well as the importance of directly released vs. OMV-mediated bacterial ATP dissected locally. Based on our measurements (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A and Figure 5C), we estimate that the effect of OMV-derived bacterial ATP might be much smaller than the effects of directly released bacterial ATP. Thus, direct ATP release might predominate locally. However, we fully agree that this has to be investigated in a future study to reconcile the different aspects of bacterial ATP signaling. A paragraph will be added to the manuscript, in which we discuss this particular issue.</p>

<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Also, the increase of neutrophils in bacterial ATP-depleted abdominal sepsis, which has better outcomes than &quot;ATP-proficient&quot; sepsis, seems difficult to correlate to the hypothesized tissue damage induced by ATP delivered via non-infectious OMVs.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully acknowledge the mentioned discrepancy. What we propose is that bacterial ATP exhibits different functions that are dependent on the release mechanism (see above). Locally, in the peritoneal cavity, neutrophil numbers are decreased by directly released bacterial ATP. Remotely, ATP is delivered via OMV and impacts on neutrophil function. We agree that, in particular, in the peritoneal cavity, both effects may play a role. However, the impact of directly released bacterial ATP seems to be dominant (see above).</p>
<p>We propose that neutrophils are decreased locally because of directly released bacterial ATP, which prevents efficient infection control and, therefore, impairs sepsis survival. In addition, these fewer neutrophils might even be dysregulated by the engulfment of bacterial ATP delivered via OMV, which leads to an upregulated and possibly aberrant degranulation process worsening local and remote tissue damage. We agree that in addition to neutrophil numbers, the function of local neutrophils should be assessed with and without the influence of OMV-delivered bacterial ATP. This could be done by RNA sequencing of primary neutrophils from the peritoneal cavity or neutrophil cell lines as well as degranulation assays.</p>

<list-item><p>Are the neutrophils counts affected by ATP delivered via OMVs?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is difficult to show in the peritoneal cavity where we have both, directly released bacterial ATP and OMV-derived bacterial ATP. We assessed such putative difference, however, for the systemic organs and the blood, where we did not find any differences in neutrophil numbers. We will include the figure in the revised manuscript as Figure 6-figure supplement 3C.</p>

<p>We fully agree that there are several open questions that remain to be elucidated, in particular, to differentiate the local role of directly released versus OMV-delivered bacterial ATP. In this study, we laid the foundation for future in vivo research to examine the specific role of bacterial ATP in sepsis. Such future research avenues might be to investigate the local effects of OMV-delivered bacterial ATP, and how neutrophil migration, apoptosis and degranulation are altered. We agree that exploration of the local secretory immune response and cytokine profiles are relevant to understand the different mechanisms of how bacterial ATP alters sepsis. However, such experiments should be ideally performed in systems where the source and the delivery of ATP can be modulated locally.</p>

<p>Thank you for this remark. We have chosen primary lung neutrophils for four reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Isolation of primary lung neutrophils allowed us to assess an in vivo response that would not have been possible with cell lines.</p>
<p>(2) The lung and the respiratory system are among the clinically most important organs affected during sepsis resulting in a significant cause of mortality.</p>
<p>(3) We show in Figure 6C that specifically in the lung, OMV are engulfed by neutrophils, which shows the relevance of the lung also in our study context.</p>
<p>(4) And finally, lung neutrophils were chosen to examine specifically distant and not local effects.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In their manuscript &quot;Released Bacterial ATP Shapes Local and Systemic Inflammation during Abdominal Sepsis&quot;, Daniel Spari et al. explored the dual role of ATP in exacerbating sepsis, revealing that ATP from both host and bacteria significantly impacts immune responses and disease progression.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The study meticulously examines the complex relationship between ATP release and bacterial growth, membrane integrity, and how bacterial ATP potentially dampens inflammatory responses, thereby impairing survival in sepsis models. Additionally, this compelling paper implies a concept that bacterial OMVs act as vehicles for the systemic distribution of ATP, influencing neutrophil activity and exacerbating sepsis severity.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The researchers extracted and cultivated abdominal fluid on LB agar plates, then randomly picked 25 colonies for analysis. However, they did not conduct 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing on the fluid itself. It is worth noting that the bacterial species present may vary depending on the individual patients. It would be beneficial if the authors could specify whether they've verified the existence of unculturable species capable of secreting high levels of Extracellular ATP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Most septic complications are caused by a limited spectrum of bacteria, belonging mainly either to the Firmicutes or the Proteobacteria phyla, including E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus or E. faecalis (Diekema et al., 2019; MureÈan et al., 2018). We validated this well documented existing evidence by randomly assessing 25 colonies. For the planned experiments, it was crucial to work with culturable bacteria; otherwise, ATP measurements, the modulation of ATP generation or loading of OMV would not have been possible. Using such culturable bacteria allowed us to describe mechanisms of ATP release.</p>
<p>We fully agree that hard-to-culture or unculturable bacteria might contribute significantly to septic complications. This, however, would need to be explored in future studies using extensive culturing methods (Cheng et al., 2022).</p>

<p>(2) Do mice lacking commensal bacteria show a lack of extracellular ATP following cecal ligation puncture?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>ATP is typically secreted by many cells of the host in active and passive manners in the case of any injury, including cecal ligation and puncture (Burnstock, 2016; Dosch et al., 2018; Eltzschig et al., 2012; Idzko et al., 2014). We hypothesize that bacterial ATP is a potential priming agent at early stages of sepsis, and indeed, at such early time points, a comparison of peritoneal ATP levels between germfree and colonized mice could support our hypothesis. Future studies addressing this question must, however, correct for the different immune responses between germ-free and colonized mice. This is of utmost importance, especially for the cecal ligation and puncture model, since the cecum of germ-free mice is extremely large, making such experiments hard to control.</p>

<p>(3) The authors isolated various bacteria from abdominal fluid, encompassing both Gram-negative and Gram-positive types. Nevertheless, their emphasis appeared to be primarily on the Gram-negative E. coli. It would be beneficial to ascertain whether the mechanisms of Extracellular ATP release differ between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This is particularly relevant given that the Gram-positive bacterium E. faecalis, also isolated from the abdominal fluid, is recognized for its propensity to release substantial amounts of Extracellular ATP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with this comment. In this paper, we used E. coli as our model organism to determine the principles of sepsis-associated bacterial ATP release and therefore focused on gram-negative bacteria. In addition to the direct, growth-dependent release, we found a relevant impact of OMV-delivered bacterial ATP. For this latter purpose, a gram-negative strain, in which OMV generation has been well described (Schwechheimer &amp; Kuehn, 2015), was chosen. Recently, gram-positive bacteria have been shown to secrete ATP and OMV as well (Briaud &amp; Carroll, 2020; Hironaka et al., 2013; Iwase et al., 2010). Given the fundamental differences in the structure of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria and the mechanisms of OMV generation and release, future studies are required to assess the relevance of directly released and OMV-delivered ATP in gram-positive bacteria.</p>

<p>(4) The authors observed changes in the levels of LPM, SPM, and neutrophils in vivo. However, it remains uncertain whether the proliferation or migration of these cells is modulated or inhibited by ATP receptors like P2Y receptors. This aspect requires further investigation to establish a convincing connection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with this comment. The decrease in LPM and the consequential predomination of SPM have been well described after inflammatory stimuli in the context of the macrophage disappearance reaction (Ghosn et al., 2010). Also, it has been shown that purinergic signaling modulates infiltration of neutrophils and can lead to cell death as a consequence of  P2Y and P2X receptor activation (Junger, 2011; Proietti et al., 2019). In our study, we propose that intracellular purinergic receptors contribute to neutrophil function during sepsis. After introducing the general principles and fundaments of bacterial ATP with our studies, we fully agree that additional experiments need to address downstream purinergic receptor activation. That, however, would go beyond the scope of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Additionally, is it possible that the observed in vivo changes could be triggered by bacterial components other than Extracellular ATP? In this research field, a comprehensive collection of inhibitors is available, so it is desirable to utilize them to demonstrate clearer results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This question is of utmost importance and defined the choice of our model and experimental approach. When we started the project, we used two different E. coli mutants that release low (ompC) and high (eaeH) amounts of ATP. However, the limitation of this approach is that these are different bacteria, which may also differ in the components they secrete or the surface proteins they express. We, therefore, decided against that approach. With the approach we finally used (same bacterium, just with and without ATP), we aimed to minimize the influence of non-ATP bacterial components.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Have the authors considered the role of host-derived Extracellular ATP in the context of inflammation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, the role of host-derived extracellular ATP in inflammation and sepsis is well-established with contradictory results (CsÃ³ka et al., 2015; Ledderose et al., 2016). This conflicting data was the rationale to test the relevance of bacterial ATP. We suggest that bacterial ATP is essential in the early phase of sepsis when bacteria invade the sterile compartment and before efficient host response, including the eukaryotic release of ATP, is established.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The authors mention that Extracellular ATP is rapidly hydrolyzed by ectonucleotases in vivo. Are the changes of immune cells within the peritoneal cavity caused by Extracellular ATP released from bacterial death or by OMVs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a relevant question that was also asked by reviewer #1, and we answered it in detail above (weaknesses comment #1 and #2). From our ATP measurements (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A and Figure 5C), we conclude that locally, the role of directly released bacterial ATP (extracellular) predominates over OMV-derived bacterial ATP. Furthermore, the mechanisms between directly released and OMV-derived bacterial ATP (within OMV, engulfed and transported to the endolysosomal compartment) are different, and especially extracellular ATP has been described to lead to apoptosis via P2X7 signaling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In the manuscript, the sample size (n) for the data consistently remains at 2. I would suggest expanding the sample size to enhance the robustness and rigor of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Two biological replicates (independent cultures) were only used for the bacteria cultures in Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3, which achieved similar results and the standard deviation remained very small, indicating its robustness. In the in vitro experiments in Figure 5 we used a sample size of 6 (three biological replicates measured in technical duplicates), since we saw bigger deviations in our measurements. For the in vivo experiments, we always used 5 or more animals in at least two independent experiments.</p>
