<title>Abstract</title><p>Transporter research primarily relies on the canonical substrates of well-established transporters. This approach has limitations when studying transporters for the low-abundant micromolecules, such as micronutrients, and may not reveal physiological functions of the transporters. While D-serine, a trace enantiomer of serine in the circulation, was discovered as an emerging biomarker of kidney function, its transport mechanisms in the periphery remain unknown. Here, using a multi-hierarchical approach from body fluids to molecules, combining multi-omics, cell-free synthetic biochemistry, and <italic>ex vivo</italic> transport analyses, we have identified two types of renal D-serine transport systems. We revealed that the small amino acid transporter ASCT2 serves as a D-serine transporter previously uncharacterized in the kidney and discovered D-serine as a noncanonical substrate of the sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (SMCTs). These two systems are physiologically complementary, but ASCT2 dominates the role in the pathological condition. Our findings not only shed light on renal D-serine transport, but also clarify the importance of non-canonical substrate transport. This study provides a framework for investigating multiple transport systems of various trace micromolecules under physiological conditions and in multifactorial diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Membrane transport proteins are key molecules to control the homeostasis of micromolecules. To date, over 450 solute carriers (SLCs), 40 ATP-binding cassettes (ABCs), 60 ATPase pumps, and 300 ion channels have been identified in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ranjan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">César-Razquin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Perland and Fredriksson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">The UniProt Consortium et al., 2021</xref>). Approximately 30% of membrane transport proteins remain uncharacterized. While some membrane transport proteins can be classified based on sequence similarities and transport substrates of well-studied family members, this approach is limited when it comes to discovering transporters for some micromolecules, such as micronutrients and their metabolites. Many of these micromolecules have not been extensively studied and do not fit into traditional nutrient types. Currently, the importance of micronutrients and gut microbiota-derived metabolites in health and disease has gained a high impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Shenkin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Vernocchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), yet their responsible transporters are not well understood. Understanding the absorption and reabsorption mechanisms of dietary micronutrients and gut microbiota-derived metabolites will provide a key molecular process for controlling their dynamics and molecular activities.</p>
<p>This study aims to establish an approach to investigate the physiological function and pathological significance of transporters, particularly transport systems for trace micromolecules. As a paradigm, we investigated renal transport systems for D-amino acids, micronutrients derived mostly from the diet and some from the gut microbiota. Amino acid transport systems have been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bröer, 2008a</xref>), but have focused on L-amino acids, which are macronutrients, leaving open the question of how D-amino acids are transported. We have developed two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography (2D-HPLC), which allows the segregation of L- and D-enantiomers in liquid biopsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Miyoshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hamase et al., 2010</xref>). The importance of D-amino acids in renal function has received increasing attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sasabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sasabe and Suzuki, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nakade et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hesaka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kimura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Okushima et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Iwata et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>). D-Serine in the body fluid was discovered as a promising biomarker for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to its clear association with kidney function in rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sasabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nakade et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hesaka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Okushima et al., 2021</xref>). Diseased-associated alterations in plasma and urinary D-/L-serine ratio suggest that renal D-serine transport systems are different and distinct from L-serine transport systems under physiological and pathological conditions. The transport of D-serine has long been found to take place at the proximal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kragh-Hansen and Sheikh, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sasabe and Suzuki, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Shimomura et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Silbernagl et al., 1999</xref>), yet the corresponding transporter has not been clearly elucidated.</p>
<p>D-Serine is found at submillimolar levels in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hashimoto et al., 1992</xref>), where it acts as an obligatory physiological co-agonist of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mothet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Basu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Papouin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wolosker, 2018</xref>). Extensive studies of D-serine in the brain show that D-serine is transported by four plasma membrane transporters: ASCT1 (SLC1A4), ASCT2 (SLC1A5), Asc-1 (SLC7A10), and SNAT1 (SLC38A1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rosenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Foster et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kaplan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bodner et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, D-serine is detected at low micromolar levels in the periphery, and little is known about its dynamics as well as transporting systems. Mammals acquire D-serine by biosynthesis via serine racemase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wolosker et al., 1999</xref>) and absorption from the diet and gut microbiota presumably via intestinal transport system(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sasabe and Suzuki, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nakade et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gonda et al., 2023</xref>). Similar to the renal epithelia, a D-serine transporter in the intestine is also unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we integrated multiple analytical methods for the different biological hierarchies. We applied 2D-HPLC to measure plasma and urinary enantiomers of 20 amino acids of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) mice, a model of AKI and AKI-to-CKD transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sasabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). Membrane proteomics of the renal proximal tubules of the IRI mouse models was performed to explore the key molecules responsible for the alterations of D- and L-amino acid transport. With bioinformatics, cell-based screening and cell-free transport analysis, we identified two types of D-serine transport systems in the kidney. Subsequently, <italic>ex vivo</italic> transport analyses from the normal kidney and the IRI model explained the transport mechanism of D-serine as a biomarker in kidney diseases.</p>

<title>Amino acid metabolomics in plasma and urine of the renal IRI model</title>
<p>To understand kidney-associated alteration of enantiomeric amino acids, we measured L- and D-isomers of 20 amino acids in the body fluids of the IRI model (Figure supplements 1-2). Dynamics of L- and D-enantiomers in the plasma were evaluated from the ratios of D-/L-enantiomers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Among amino acids, only the ratios of plasma D-/L-serine were increased in a time dependent-manner from 4 – 40 hours after the ischemia-reperfusion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>). The elevation of plasma D-/L-serine ratios at early time points (4h – 8h) was due to a sharp decrease of the L-isomer, while the rise of D-/L-serine ratios at late time points (20h – 40h) was a result of a continuous acceleration of the D-isomer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-D</xref>). The results of plasma D-serine were consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sasabe et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to D-serine, we detected certain amounts of D-alanine, D-proline and D-methionine in the plasma (Figure supplement 1A). However, their D-/L- enantiomeric ratios were uncorrelated to the pathological conditions (Figure supplement 1A). Our knowledge of traditional amino acid transport suggests that alanine, serine and proline share the same transport systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bröer, 2008a</xref>). The noticeably different profile of plasma D- and L-serine from those of alanine and proline led to the speculation that D-serine transport was possibly mediated by unique transport systems, different from those of D-alanine, D-proline, and the L-isomers. Moreover, such transport systems may be sensitive to the IRI conditions.</p>

<p>We measured the enantiomeric amino acid profiles from urine samples of the IRI model (Figure supplement 2). While plasma is a reliable resource of metabolite biomarkers, urine is a meaningful non-invasive diagnostic indicator of kidney function. More importantly, the analysis of urinary metabolites is indispensable for elucidating the unknown reabsorption systems of certain substances in the kidney. From our results, the ratios of urinary D-/L-serine were drastically decreased at early IRI (4h – 8h) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>). Similar tendencies of D-/L-amino acid ratios were observed in alanine, proline, asparagine, and histidine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-H</xref>). These urinary amino acid profiles indicated the impairment in both D- and L-amino acid reabsorption since the early injury. We hypothesized that transporters play a major role in the dynamics of D- and L-serine in the kidney with respect to changes in the D-/L-serine ratio during pathology.</p>

<title>Proteomics for membrane transport proteins from renal brush border membranes of the IRI model</title>
<p>We aimed to identify the corresponding molecules for the dynamics of D- and L-serine. To obtain the candidates, we performed proteomic analysis of renal brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) (the membrane fraction enriching apical membrane proteins of proximal tubular epithelia) from the IRI model. We analyzed the BBMVs from 4 – 8 hours after IRI, the times of rigorous shift of plasma and urinary D-/L-serine ratio (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, F</xref>). The proteomes of the IRI samples were calculated as ratios of the negative control group (sham), yielding two groups of comparative proteome data: 4h IRI/sham (4h) and 8h IRI/sham (8h). In total, 4,423 proteins were identified, of which 1,187 proteins (27% of the total detected proteins) were categorized as plasma membrane proteins and extracellular matrix proteins (Table supplement 1). We observed a significant increase of two well-known early AKI biomarkers: Ccn1 (Cyr61: matrix-associated heparin-binding protein; 4h IRI/sham = 41.4 folds; 8h IRI/sham = 29.9 folds) and Ngal (Lcn2: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin; 4h IRI/sham = 1.8 folds; 8h IRI/sham = 9.5 folds). This finding confirmed the reliability of our proteomics for molecular analysis of early AKI (Table supplement 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Marx et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>From the proteome, we detected 398 membrane transport proteins (325 transporters and 73 ion channels). Analysis of all membrane transport proteins by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed alterations of the biological function in <italic>Molecular Transport</italic>, which are categorized by the types of their canonical substrates (Table supplement 2). Transport of “all micromolecules” was shown to be drastically decreased from 4h IRI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>: Top). This decrease was due to the dramatic reduction of transport systems for heavy metals and organic compounds (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> shows membrane transport proteins corresponding to the annotation in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. This proteomic result unveiled the whole picture of the molecular targets of the injury. Furthermore, the results revealed the key membrane transport proteins behind AKI metabolite biomarkers. It is noted that some transporters were upregulated, suggesting the compensatory mechanism repair processes for cell survival from the injury (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Given insight into transporters in the proteome, we observed the elevation of mouse Slc1a5/Asct2, a known D-serine transporter in the brain, at both 4h and 8h IRI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>: Transport of Amino acids). Asct2 was previously detected in renal brush border membranes, but its precise localization and function in the kidney have not been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Avissar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Scalise et al., 2018</xref>). We then examined the localization of Asct2 in the kidney by using affinity-purified Asct2 antibodies that recognized its N-terminus (NT) or C-terminus (CT) (Figure supplement 3A). Asct2 was partially co-immunostained with both Sglt2 (Slc5a2; sodium/glucose cotransporter 2) and Agt1 (Slc7a13, aspartate/glutamate transporter 1), which are apical membrane markers for S1 + S2 and S3 segments, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nagamori et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ghezzi et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, Asct2 did not co-localize with Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, a basolateral membrane marker (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The results demonstrated that Asct2 is localized at the apical side in all segments of proximal tubules.</p>

<title>Screening of candidate molecules for D-serine transporters</title>
<p>While we have shown that ASCT2 is a D-serine transporter at the apical membranes of all proximal tubular segments, ASCT2 transports D-serine with high affinity (K<sub>m</sub> of 167 μM in oocyte system) but with weak stereoselectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Foster et al., 2016</xref>). These properties of ASCT2 differ from those of the reported D-serine transport in the kidney. First, D-serine transport systems in S1 + S2 segments are reported to be different from those in the S3 segments and the kinetics of both systems are in mM range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kragh-Hansen and Sheikh, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Silbernagl et al., 1999</xref>). Silbernagl et al. also suggested that ASCT2 is not (or not only) a D-serine transporter at S3 segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Silbernagl et al., 1999</xref>). Second, the plasma and urinary D-/L-serine profiles from CKD and AKI samples indicated the stereoselectivity of the transporter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sasabe and Suzuki, 2018</xref>). Third, ASCT2 recognizes serine, alanine, and proline, but our enantiomeric amino acid profile in plasma samples showed a distinct D-/L-ratio pattern of serine from alanine and proline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). All data suggest the existence of (an)other D-serine transporter(s).</p>
<p>To search for the D-serine transporters, we chose the ratios of mouse Asct2 as the cutoff values of our membrane proteomic data at both 4h and 8h IRI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Membrane transport proteins showing more alteration than Asct2 at both increased and decreased values were selected because some transporters are known to switch roles upon pathology. Further, we focused on the luminal transporters and omitted transporters that are reported to be located at basolateral membranes and organelles as the BBMVs are enriched apical membrane fractions. Membrane transport proteins that recognize only inorganic ions were also excluded. Finally, ten candidates were selected (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Slc36a1/Pat1 and Slc6a18/B<sup>0</sup>at3, the known small amino acid transporters, were included in the list, although their expressions only passed the cutoff at only one-time point (either 4h or 8h IRI). Slc5a12/Smct2 was also included because Smct1, another member of sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter (SMCT) family, was selected as a candidate. Smct2 has a comparable role with Smct1, but both transporters are localized at different segments of the proximal tubules.</p>

<p>To analyze the function of the candidate transporters, we selected HEK293 cell line for the screening method because of its high transfection efficiency. Similar to other several common cell lines, HEK293 cells express ASCT2 endogenously. However, we examined other possible D-serine transport systems in HEK293 cells, aiming to reduce the transport background. Proteomic analysis of the membrane fractions from HEK293 cells identified amino acid transporters as shown in Table supplement 3. Transport activity of D-serine in HEK293 cells showed Na<sup>+</sup> dependency and ASCT2-substrate mediated inhibition (L-Ser, L-Thr, and L-Met) (Figure supplement 3B-C). Ben-Cys (<italic>S</italic>-benzyl-L-cysteine) and GPNA (L-ψ-glutamyl-<italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide) inhibited D-serine transport in HEK293 cells similar to that of ASCT2-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bröer et al., 2016</xref>), but SLC38 inhibitor MeAIB (2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid) had no effect (Figure supplement 3C). These results indicated that ASCT2 is the main D-serine transporter in HEK293 cells.</p>
<p>Due to the absence of any ASCT2-specific inhibitor and the compensatory transport mechanism that occurred in the ASCT2-deletion condition (Figure supplement 3E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bröer et al., 2016</xref>), we avoided using the traditional cell-based transport assay for screening. Instead, we established a new screening method based on cell growth. Apart from the studies on D-serine biomarkers in kidney diseases, a previous study found that high concentrations (10 – 20 mM) of D-serine impaired the growth of a human proximal tubular cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Okada et al., 2017</xref>). We then tested whether high concentrations of D-serine affect HEK293 cell growth. Unlike L-serine which had no effect, D-serine reduced cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner with IC<sub>50</sub> of 17.4 ± 1.05 mM (Figure supplement 3D). In the ASCT2-knockdown cells, the growth inhibition by D-serine was attenuated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that D-serine suppressing cell growth was caused by ASCT2-mediated D-serine transport.</p>
<p>Based on this finding, we utilized cell growth determination assay as the screening method even without ASCT2 knockdown. HEK293 cells were transfected with human candidate genes. The transfected cells were treated with either 15 mM (near IC<sub>50</sub> concentration) or 25 mM (high concentration) D-serine for 2 days, and cell growth was determined. The positive control Asc-1 transfected cells showed a reduction in cell growth, confirming the effectiveness of this assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>). Among ten candidates, PAT1 (SLC36A1) and B<sup>0</sup>AT3 (SLC6A18) showed higher cell growth than the mock cells, suggesting that PAT1 and B<sup>0</sup>AT3 may reduce D-serine influx mediated by endogenous ASCT2. In contrast, SMCT1 (SLC5A8) and SMCT2 (SLC5A12) extended the growth suppression after treatment with both 15 and 25 mM D-serine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref> and supplement 4A-B). Thus, with the hypothesis that the candidate molecule influxes D-serine and brings about growth reduction, we selected both SMCT1 and SMCT2 for further analysis.</p>

<title>Characterization of D-serine transport in SMCTs</title>
<p>SMCTs are known to transport monocarboxylates such as lactate, propionate, and nicotinate in a Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ganapathy et al., 2008</xref>). To characterize D-serine transport in both SMCT1 and SMCT2, we generated Flp-In T-REx 293 cells stably expressing human SMCT1 (FlpInTR-SMCT1) and SMCT2 (FlpInTR-SMCT2). Expression of SMCTs in FlpInTR-SMCT1 and FlpInTR-SMCT2 was verified by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody to detect FLAG-tagged SMCTs (Figure supplement 5A). SMCT1 and SMCT2 expressions remained unchanged upon ASCT2 knockdown (Figure supplement 5A). The function of SMCTs was confirmed by their canonical substrate [<sup>14</sup>C]nicotinate transport in the SMCT1- and SMCT2-stable cells (Figure supplement 5B-C).</p>
<p>The transport functions of SMCTs are inhibited by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; e.g., ibuprofen and acetylsalicylate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Itagaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gopal et al., 2007</xref>). To verify the contribution of SMCTs to D-serine-reduced cell growth, we added ibuprofen to the growth assay. In contrast to mock, in which ibuprofen has no effect, the growth suppression by D-serine treatment was gradually attenuated by ibuprofen in both FlpInTR-SMCT1 and FlpInTR-SMCT2 cells, indicating that the cell growth suppression by D-serine treatment is the result of SMCT1 and SMCT2 functions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

We purified human SMCT1 by affinity column and reconstituted SMCT1-proteoliposome (SMCT1-PL) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

The amount of D-serine transport was slightly lower than lactate and propionate but higher than L-serine and the transport was inhibited by ibuprofen, confirming SMCT1-mediated D-serine transport (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Amino acid selectivity revealed that SMCT1 recognized both L- and D-serine over other small amino acids (L- and D-alanine), acidic amino acids (L- and D-glutamate), and large neutral amino acids (L- and D-tyrosine) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).

<title>ASCT2 and SMCTs contribute to D-serine transport in renal proximal tubular epithelia</title>
<p>We next examined the contributions of ASCT2 and SMCTs to D-serine reabsorption in the kidney using an <italic>ex vivo</italic> transport assay. ASCT2 is an antiporter, influx one amino acid with efflux of another, while SMCTs are symporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ganapathy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Scalise et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we measured D-serine transport in the presence or absence of L-Gln preloading and with or without ibuprofen to distinguish the functions of mouse Asct2 and Smcts. The enantiomeric amino acid profile showed D-serine concentrations of 4 – 10 μM in the plasma samples (Figure supplement 1) and 20 – 100 μM in the urine samples (Figure supplement 2). Accordingly, we tested 10 μM D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine transport in BBMVs derived from normal mice. In the non-preloading condition, D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine uptake in Na<sup>+</sup> dependence gradually but continuously increased and the uptake was remarkably inhibited by ibuprofen, suggesting that the transport was mainly attained from Smcts functions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). In L-Gln preloaded BBMVs, D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine uptake in Na<sup>+</sup>-dependence arose quickly and reached the saturated point at 1 – 2 min (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). The uptake at early time points (≤ 30 sec) was ibuprofen-insensitive but became partly ibuprofen-sensitive from 1 min to the stationary phase (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). These results indicate that the D-serine transport was mediated by both Asct2 and Smcts. At early time points, D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine was transported by Asct2, which occurred highly and rapidly. Meanwhile, Smcts functions (ibuprofen-sensitive) initiated later but had prolonged functions as seen in the non-preloading condition. Taken altogether, we suggested that, in the normal kidney where renal proximal tubular epithelial cells contain intracellular L-Gln, D-serine reabsorption is derived from combinational functions of both ibuprofen-sensitive (e.g. Smcts) and ibuprofen-insensitive (e.g. Asct2) transporters.</p>

<title>D-Serine transport in renal proximal tubular epithelia of IRI model</title>
<p>Under IRI conditions, we observed low urinary but high plasma levels of D-serine, suggesting high D-serine reabsorption (Figure supplements 1A, 2A). Our membrane proteomics revealed that Asct2 was increased while and Smct1 and Smct2 were decreased in both 4h and 8h IRI (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We then examined the functional contributions of Asct2 and Smcts on the D-serine reabsorption during the pathology. Similar to those of the normal BBMVs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-B</xref>), D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine transport in Sham operation showed ibuprofen-sensitive in non-preloading and partly ibuprofen-sensitive in L-Gln preloading conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>: Sham). D-[<sup>3</sup>H]Serine influx reduced sharply in the BBMVs of 4h IRI model, and the transport was ibuprofen-insensitive in both with and without L-Gln preloading (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>: 4h IRI). Likely, this feature was due to the slight increase of Asct2 and the dramatic decrease of Smcts as observed in the proteome data (Asct2: 4h IRI/sham = 1.29 fold, Smct1: 4h IRI/sham = 0.59 fold; Smct2: 4h IRI/sham = 0.86 fold; Table supplement 1). We verified that BBMVs from all conditions contain functional proteins by measuring L-[<sup>3</sup>H]aspartate transport, which represented the function of Slc1a1/Eaac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kanai and Hediger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bailey et al., 2011</xref>).

These results could be explained by the continuing increase of Asct2 and decrease of Smcts as revealed by our proteomics (Asct2: 8h IRI/sham = 1.64 fold; Smct1: 8h IRI/sham = 0.62 fold; Smct2: 8h IRI/sham = 0.78 fold) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Table supplement 1). The slight increase in D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine transport in non-preloaded 8h IRI BBMVs may be due to an unknown transporter (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>: No preload). Our amino acid profiling showed that the amount of plasma and urinary L-Gln were not largely altered during 4h – 8h IRI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>), suggesting that renal epithelial cells maintain intracellular L-Gln. Most likely, the high reabsorption of D-serine during IRI resulted from the increase of Asct2, despite the decreases of Smct1 and Smct2.</p>
<p>For comparison with our proteome data, we analyzed the mRNA expressions of Asct2, Smct1, and Smct2 in proximal tubule clusters at the early IRI from the open-source snRNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kirita et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with our proteome data, Smct1 and Smct2 mRNA expressions were dramatically decreased, whereas Asct2 was increased since the early IRI (Figure supplement 7). The correlation of proteomics and transcriptomics suggested that the protein alterations of Asct2 and Smcts during the pathology emerged from transcriptional mechanisms rather than post-translational protein processing or protein degradation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we presented an approach to investigate the transport systems for micronutrients and metabolites under physiological conditions and in multifactorial diseases. We selected AKI as a model study because AKI is known to target renal proximal epithelia and disrupt absorption/reabsorption systems that are the results of cooperative functions of multiple transporters. We utilized amino acid metabolomics to reveal a unique feature of the enantiomeric dynamics of serine in the AKI and analyzed membrane proteomes to obtain the D-serine transporter candidates. We then applied cell-based and cell-free transport assays to identify two D-serine transport systems; one was ASCT2 and the other consisted of unanticipated SMCTs (SMCT1 and SMCT2). Using <italic>ex vivo</italic> analysis of apical membrane-enriched renal proximal tubules, we showed that both transport systems contributed comparably to D-serine handling in the normal kidney, but ASCT2 became dominant in AKI, leading to the increase of D-serine in the blood. The alteration of two transport systems explained the dynamics of D-serine and suggested the transport mechanism behind the D-serine biomarker.</p>
<p>Several studies have reported the non-canonical substrates of membrane transport proteins, such as the recognition between amino acids, carboxylates and amines among SLCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Metzner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Matsuo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schweikhard and Ziegler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). Serine consists of a hydroxypropionic acid and an amino group at the α-carbon. Possibly, the hydroxypropionic acid on serine is the main part to interact with SMCTs because hydroxypropionic acid shares similar moieties to lactic acid and propionic acid which are the high-affinity substrates of SMCTs. The apparent K<sub>m</sub> of D-serine transport in SMCT1 is 3.39 mM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), which is within the range of known SMCT1 substrates (0.07 – 6.5 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ganapathy et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that SMCT1 accepts D-serine in the same manner as other monocarboxylate substrates. Inhibition of D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine transport by non-radioisotope labeled D-serine in SMCT2 was less effective than in SMCT1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Together with the previous report that SMCT2 had lower inhibition affinities for nicotinate, lactate and butyrate than SMCT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Srinivas et al., 2005</xref>), we suggest that SMCT2 recognizes D-serine with lower affinity than SMCT1.</p>
<p>Kinetics analysis of D-serine transport revealed the high affinity by ASCT2 (K<sub>m</sub> 167 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Foster et al., 2016</xref>) and low affinity by SMCT1 (K<sub>m</sub> 3.39 mM; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Besides transport affinity, the expression level is another important factor in evaluating the transport capacity. Regarding chromatogram intensities in the proteomics data, we found that the intensities of Smct1 (2.9 x 10<sup>9</sup> AU) and Smct2 (1.6 x 10<sup>8</sup> AU) were remarkably higher than Asct2 (1.5 x 10<sup>7</sup> AU) in the control mice (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>: abundance in Sham). Although it is not accurate to compare intensities between different proteins in a mass spectrometry analysis, the comparison may roughly reflect the protein amounts. Together with our proteome data, this observation is consistent with the snRNA-seq result (Figure supplement 7: Controls), suggesting that Asct2 is only expressed in minor cell populations, while Smct1 and Smct2 expressions are high and ubiquitous in the normal conditions. Thus, we proposed that ASCT2 transports D-serine with low capacity due to its low expression level, while SMCTs have high transport capacity due to their abundance. Consequently, both ASCT2 and SMCTs are likely to contribute to D-serine reabsorption in the normal kidney as seen in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> assay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>Several pieces of evidence support SMCT1 at S3 segment and SMCT2 at S1 + S2 segments on renal D-serine handling. First, our enantiomeric amino acid profile from the IRI model, which agrees with the previous reports in CKD patients and AKI animal models, suggested the existence of a stereoselective transport system for serine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hesaka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kimura et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sasabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sasabe and Suzuki, 2018</xref>). The system seems distinct from the known classical small amino acid transport systems and ASCT2. Second, previous studies indicated renal D-serine transport takes place at the proximal tubules by the distinct transport systems between S1 + S2 and S3 segments. Both systems exhibited the characteristics of Na<sup>+</sup> dependency, electrogenicity, low affinity (mM range), and partial stereoselectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kragh-Hansen and Sheikh, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Shimomura et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Silbernagl et al., 1999</xref>). These properties of the D-serine transport suit well to SMCTs and convince us of the contribution of SMCTs to renal D-serine transport in addition to ASCT2. Moreover, continuous administration of high doses of D-serine induces nephrotoxicity at the S3 segment of proximal tubules in normal animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Silbernagl et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Morehead et al., 1945</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hasegawa et al., 2019</xref>). It is most likely that the D-serine-induced proximal tubular damage is partly due to the absorption of D-serine by SMCTs, in particular by SMCT1 at the S3 segment. It is noted that SMCT2 is reported as a protein indicator for the kidney repair during the injury. Prolonged SMCT2 down-expression indicates the failed repair of proximal tubular cells in IRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kirita et al., 2020</xref>). The significance of SMCT2, in turn, supports the merit of D-serine usage in AKI and CKD diagnosis.</p>
<p>Combining all the results, we propose the model of D-serine transport systems in renal proximal tubules (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). In the normal kidneys, the expression levels of SMCT2 at S1 + S2 segments and SMCT1 at S3 segment are high, whereas ASCT2 is low. Both SMCTs and ASCT2 are involved in D-serine reabsorption. Nonetheless, the net reabsorption levels appear to be relatively low due to the low affinities of SMCTs. It is likely that reabsorption at the S3 segment is dominated by SMCT1 function. The reabsorbed D-serine in proximal tubular cells is degraded into OH-pyruvate by D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), thereby maintaining the low plasma D-serine but high urinary D-serine (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>: Normal). In pathological conditions such as AKI and CKD, the expression levels of SMCT1 and SMCT2 decrease dramatically while ASCT2 increases. The high affinity and ubiquitous expression of ASCT2 suggest the increased D-serine reabsorption in all proximal tubular segments. Together with the genetic inactivation of DAAO during the pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sasabe et al., 2014</xref>), the excess reabsorbed D-serine may lead to a high plasma D-serine level (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>: IRI).</p>

<caption><title>Proposed model of D-serine transport systems in renal proximal tubules</title>
<p>The model summarizes the contributions of ASCT2, SMCT1, and SMCT2 to D-serine transport in renal proximal tubules. Left: the physiological conditions (Normal kidney). SMCT2 at S1 + S2 segments and SMCT1 at segment S3 have high expression levels, whereas the expression of ASCT2 is low. The higher D-serine affinity of SMCT1 compared to SMCT2 supports that the D-serine reabsorption tends to be exceeded at the S3 segment. Right: the pathological conditions (IRI model). expressions of SMCTs decrease while that of ASCT2 increases. ASCT2 expresses ubiquitously and exhibits high D-serine affinity. Blue arrows anticipate total D-serine fluxes in each proximal tubular segment.</p></caption>

<p>Enantiomeric profiles of serine showed low plasma D/L-serine ratios in the normal control but high D/L-serine ratios in IRI regardless of the weak stereoselectivity of ASCT2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). This data suggested the different renal handling between D-serine and the L-serine. L-Serine reabsorption has been reported to be mediated by B<sup>0</sup>AT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Singer et al., 2009</xref>), and we showed SMCTs-mediated D-serine reabsorption in this study. Thus, we propose that the low plasma D/L-serine ratio in the normal kidney is due to the high L-serine reabsorption by B<sup>0</sup>AT3, together with the DAAO function that degrades D-serine in the cells. Our enantiomeric amino acid profile detected low plasma L-serine and high urinary L-serine in IRI (Figure supplements 1B, 2B) and the proteomics revealed B<sup>0</sup>AT3 decrease (4h IRI/sham = 0.56 fold; 8h IRI/sham = 0.65 fold; Table S1). It is possible that low L-serine reabsorption in IRI is a result of B<sup>0</sup>AT3 reduction.</p>
<p>In proteomics, some transporters including ASCT2 were found to be increased in the AKI conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), yet the mechanism behind this change is still unclear. snRNA-seq study revealed that the cell clusters in all proximal tubular segments during early AKI were drastically different from the healthy kidney suggesting that the new distinct cell clusters in AKI were <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized for the repair process, as early AKI is a reversible condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kirita et al., 2020</xref>). ASCT2 was found to be only one type of small amino acid transporter which was increased during AKI conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). ASCT2 was reported to be highly expressed in proliferative cells and stem cells and played a key role in the regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and glutamine-mediated metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Scalise et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Formisano and Van Winkle, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kandasamy et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we postulate that ASCT2 is a nascent transporter to provide small amino acids and glutamine for cell growth, as a molecular mechanism in <italic>de novo</italic> cellular synthesis for the recovery processes.</p>
<p>Besides ASCT2 and SMCTs, other transporters may contribute to D-serine handling in the kidney. Influxes of D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine in the Na<sup>+</sup>-free condition of the normal mouse BBMVs accounted for ∼ 30% of total uptake (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-B</xref>). These are results of the experimental background of non-specific accumulation of radiotracers and probably also Na<sup>+</sup>-independent transporter(s). In BBMVs from 8h IRI model, D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine uptake without preloading suggested the existence of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent transporters during the injury. In the D-serine transporter screening, we found that PAT1 and B<sup>0</sup>AT3 attenuated D-serine-mediated growth inhibition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>). PAT1 is reported to transport D-serine in the transfected cell and oocyte models while the recognition of D-serine by B<sup>0</sup>AT3 is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boll et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). PAT1, a low-affinity proton-coupled amino acid transporter, was found at both sub-apical membranes at the S1 segment and inside of the epithelia (The Human Protein Atlas: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org">https://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>; updated on Dec 7<sup>th</sup>, 2022) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sagné et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Vanslambrouck et al., 2010</xref>). It is suggested that PAT1 is less active at the apical membrane where the luminal pH is neutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Miyauchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bröer, 2008b</xref>). However, a future experiment is required to address the significance of PAT1 on D-serine transport in pathological conditions where the pH homeostasis could be disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nakanishi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bouchard and Mehta, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Imenez Silva and Mohebbi, 2022</xref>). Despite the D-serine transport systems at the apical side, other transport systems at the basolateral side are also necessary to complete the picture of the D-serine transport systems in renal proximal tubules.</p>
<p>Transport of a micromolecule is contributed by multiple transporters that orchestrate together to maintain homeostasis and to control transport compensation in an aberrant condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bröer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wiriyasermkul et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gauthier-Coles et al., 2021</xref>). The molecular characteristics and physiological functions of transporters are largely dependent on their microenvironments, such as electrochemical gradients and the presence of other transporters for coordinating functions. In our proteomic analysis, a high population of membrane transport proteins was obtained in the dataset by applying urea treatment to the membrane preparation process (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Table supplement 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kongpracha et al., 2022</xref>). By integrating data focused on specific targets, such as transporters or amino acids, from the protein molecule level to the metabolome or proteome, we were able to reveal the subtle changes in the body and identify the causes of those small changes. This integrative and multi-hierarchical approach, emphasizing the coordinate functions of multiple transporters, holds the potential for investigating the dynamics of a broad range of micromolecules under diverse or intricate conditions within any tissues or organs.</p>

<p>HEK293 and Flp-In T-Rex 293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % (v/v) FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin G, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (P/S), and routinely maintained at 37 °C, 5 % CO<sub>2</sub> and humidity. For transfection experiments, the cells were seeded in antibiotic-free media for one day prior to transfection to obtain approximately 40% confluence. DNA transient transfection and ASCT2-siRNA (ID#s12916; Ambion) transfection were performed by using Lipofectamine 3000 following the manufacturer’s protocol. The ratio of DNA : P3000 : Lipofectamine 3000 is 1.0 µg : 2.0 µL : 1.5 µL. The ratio of siRNA : Lipofectamine 3000 is 10 pmol : 1 µL. The cells were further maintained in the same media for two days prior to the assays.</p>
<p>Flp-In T-REx 293 stably expressing SMCT1 (FlpInTR-SMCT1) and SMCT2 (FlpInTR-SMCT2) were generated by co-transfection of pOG44 and pcDNA5-SMCT1 or pcDNA5-SMCT2 and subsequently cultured in the media containing 5 mg/L blasticidin and 150 mg/L hygromycin B for positive clone selection. Mock cells were generated in the same way using the empty plasmid. Expressions of SMCT1 in FlpInTR-SMCT1 and SMCT2 in FlpInTR-SMCT2 were induced by adding 1 mg/L doxycycline hyclate (Dox; Tet-ON system) at one day after seeding. The cells were further cultured for two days prior to performing experiments.</p>
<p>Wild-type and <italic>ASCT2</italic>-knockout HAP1 cells (Human near-haploid cell line; Horizon Discovery) were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 10 % (v/v) FBS, P/S, and routinely maintained at 37 °C, 5 % CO<sub>2</sub> and humidity.</p>
<p>Expi293F cells were cultured in Expi293 Expression medium at 37 °C, 8 % CO<sub>2</sub>, and humidity. To express SMCT1 transiently, the cells were transfected with pCMV14-SMCT1 using PEI MAX pH 6.9 (MW 40,000; Polysciences) and cultured for two days.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry and proteome data analysis</title>
<p>Proteomics of mouse BBMVs was analyzed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kongpracha et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Uetsuka et al., 2015</xref>). After preparing urea-washed BBMVs, the samples were fractionated into four fractions by SDB-XC StageTips and desalted by C18-StageTips. Mass spectrometry was performed using the Q Exactive (Thermo) coupled with nano-Advance UHPLC (Michrom Bioresources). The UHPLC apparatus was equipped with a trap column (L-column ODS, 0.3 x 5 mm, CERI) and a C18 packed tip column (0.1 x 125 mm; Nikkyo Technos). Raw data from four fractions were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo) and Mascot 2.6.2 (Matrix Science). Data from four fractions were combined and searched for identified proteins from the UniProt mouse database (released in March 2019). The maximum number of missed cleavages, precursor mass tolerance, and fragment mass tolerance were set to 3, 10 ppm and 0.01 Da, respectively. The carbamidomethylation Cys was set as a fixed modification. Oxidation of Met and deamidation of Asn and Gln were set as variable modifications. A filter (false discovery rate &lt; 1%) was applied to the resulting data. For each mouse sample, the analysis was conducted twice and the average was used. One data set was composed of 3 samples from each operation condition (n = 3). Statistical analyses were determined using Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo). Statistical differences and p-values were determined using the unpaired Student <italic>t</italic> test. Data represented the median ± SEM (Table S1).</p>
<p>Mass spectrometry of HEK293 cells was analyzed from crude membrane fractions. Membrane fractions from HEK293 cells were prepared from 3-day cultured cells as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nagamori et al., 2016b</xref>). Membrane proteins were enriched by the Urea Wash method, and tryptic peptides were subject for analysis as described above.</p>
<p>Proteome of BBMVs from mouse kidneys after ischemia operation for 4 (4h) or 8 hours (8h) was normalized to that of sham operation. The identified proteins were then subjected to annotate the biological functions by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen). Molecules from the dataset that met the cutoff of the Ingenuity Knowledge Base were considered for the analysis. A right-tailed Fisher’s Exact Test was used to calculate the p-value determining the probability (z-scores) of the biological function. Protein localization in kidney segments was evaluated based on related literature and The Human Protein Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org">http://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>: updated Dec 7<sup>th</sup>, 2022).</p>

<title>Effect of D-serine on cell growth</title>
<p>HEK293 cells were seeded into 96-well-plate at 10,000 cells/well. Transient transfection was performed 12 hours after seeding followed by L- or D-serine treatment at 12 hours after that. In the case of FlpInTR-stable cell lines, if needed, ASCT2 siRNA was transfected 12 hours after seeding. Dox was added one day after seeding followed by treatment with L- or D-serine (in the presence or absence of ibuprofen as indicated) 10 hours after adding Dox. The cells were further maintained for two days. Cell growth was examined by XTT assay. In one reaction, 50 μL of 1 mg/mL XTT (2,3-Bis-(2-Methoxy-4-Nitro-5-Sulfophenyl)-2<italic>H</italic>-Tetrazolium-5-Carboxanilide) (Biotium) was mixed with 5 μL of 1.5 mg/mL phenazine methosulfate. The mixture was applied to the cells and incubated for 4 hours at 37 °C in the cell culture incubator. Cell viability was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm. Cell growth in serine treatment samples was compared to the control (without serine treatment). For transporter screening, the growth of the transfected cells at a specific D-serine concentration was compared to that of Mock after normalization with no treatment.</p>

<title>Transport assay in cultured cells</title>
<p>Transport assay in cells was performed as described previously with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wiriyasermkul et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, for D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine transport in HEK293 cells, the cells were seeded into poly-D-lysine-coated 24-well plates at 1.2 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well and cultured for three days. Unless indicated elsewhere, uptake of 20 µM (100 Ci/mol) or 100 µM (10 Ci/mol) D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine was measured in PBS pH 7.4 at 37 °C at the indicated time points. After termination of the assay, the cells were lysed. An aliquot was subjected to measure protein concentration, and the remaining lysate was mixed with Optiphase HiSafe 3 (PerkinElmer). The radioactivity was monitored using a β-scintillation counter (LSC-8000, Hitachi). In the transport assay with or without Na<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>-HBSS, or Na<sup>+</sup>-free HBSS (choline-Cl substitution) were used instead of PBS.</p>
<p>Transport assay in FlpInTR-stable cell lines was performed in a similar way to HEK293 cells. After cell seeding for one day, SMCT1 and SMCT2 expression were induced by adding Dox for two days. For the ASCT2 knockdown experiment, ASCT2-siRNA was transfected 12 hours prior to Dox induction. The time course of 100 µM D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine transport (10 Ci/mol) was measured 37 °C for 5 – 20 min. Inhibition assay was performed by adding the inhibitors at the same time with D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine substrate. Kinetics of D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine transport were examined by the uptake of D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine at the concentration of 0.5 – 8 mM (0.125 – 2 Ci/mol) for 10 min at 37 °C.</p>
<p>Transport of D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine in wild-type and <italic>ASCT2</italic>-knockout HAP1 was performed in a similar way to HEK293 and FlpInTR-stable cells but without the process of transfection.</p>

<title>SMCT1 purification, proteoliposome reconstitution, and transport assay</title>
<p>Human SMCT1 was purified from SMCT1-expressing Expi293F cells. Membrane fraction and purification processes were performed as previously described with small modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nagamori et al., 2016a</xref>). First, cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The crude membrane fraction was derived from sonication and ultracentrifugation (sonication method). Membrane proteins were extracted from the crude membrane fraction with 2% (w/v) DDM and ultracentrifugation. SMCT1 was purified by anti-FLAG M2 affinity column. Unbound proteins were washed out by 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.05% (w/v) DDM. Then SMCT1 was eluted by 3xFLAG peptide in the washing buffer. Purified SMCT1 was concentrated by Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters 30K (Millipore).</p>
<p>The reconstitution of proteoliposomes was performed as described with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). The purified SMCT1 was reconstituted in liposomes (made from 5:1 (w/w) of type II-S PC : brain total lipid) at a protein-to-lipid ratio of 1:100 (w/w) in 20 mM MOPS-Tris pH 7.0 and 100 mM KCl.</p>
<p>Transport assay in proteoliposomes was conducted by the rapid filtration method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Uptake reaction was conducted by dilution of 1 μg SMCT1 proteoliposomes in 100 μL uptake buffer (20 mM MOPS-Tris pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl for Na<sup>+</sup>-buffer or KCl for Na<sup>+</sup>-free buffer, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) containing radioisotope-labeled substrates. The reaction was incubated at 25 °C for an indicated time. The radioisotope-labeled substrates were used as follows: 5 Ci/mol for [<sup>14</sup>C]uric acid, L-[<sup>14</sup>C]tyrosine and D-[<sup>14</sup>C]tyrosine; 10 Ci/mol for DL-[<sup>3</sup>H]lactic acid, L-[<sup>3</sup>H]alanine, D-[<sup>3</sup>H]alanine, L-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine, D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine, L-[<sup>3</sup>H]glutamic acid and D-[<sup>3</sup>H]glutamic acid; and 20 Ci/mol for [<sup>3</sup>H]propionic acid. In the inhibition assay, 1 mM ibuprofen was applied at the same time with the radioisotope-labeled substrates. Kinetics of nicotinate transport were measured for 3 min using 0.01 – 2 mM [<sup>14</sup>C]nicotinate (0.2 – 50 Ci/mol) in Na<sup>+</sup>-containing buffer, and then subtracted from the uptake in Na<sup>+</sup>-free buffer.</p>

<title>Transport assay in mouse BBMVs</title>
<p>Both left and right kidneys from eight weeks old male normal control (Japan SLC; Sankyo Labo Service) or IRI model (sham, 4h IRI, and 8h IRI) were taken out after PBS perfusion and frozen until use. After mincing and homogenizing the frozen kidneys in the buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM mannitol, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitor cocktail, the BBMVs were prepared as described in the above section but using magnesium instead of calcium for BBMV precipitation. The pellet of BBMVs was resuspended in the suspension buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mM mannitol, and 100 mM KCl). In the L-glutamine preloading experiment, the BBMVs were incubated with 4 mM L-glutamine (L-Gln) or only buffer (no preload) on ice for 3 hours. External buffers were then removed by centrifugation at 21,000 ×<italic>g</italic> for 20 min and the BBMVs were resuspended in the suspension buffer.</p>
<p>Transport assay was performed by rapid filtration. Prior to initiating the reaction, 5 µM valinomycin was added to the BBMV samples. Transport assay was examined by diluting 100 µg BBMVs in 100 μL of the uptake buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl for Na<sup>+</sup> condition or KCl for Na<sup>+</sup>-free condition, 50 mM mannitol and 5 µM valinomycin) containing radioisotope substrates, 10 μM D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine (100 Ci/mol) or 10 μM L-[<sup>3</sup>H]aspartic acid (100 Ci/mol), as described in the figures. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C at an indicated time, then terminated by the addition of ice-cold buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6 and 200 mM mannitol and filtered through 0.45 µm nitrocellulose filter (Millipore), followed by washing with the same buffer once. The membranes were soaked in Clear-sol I (Nacalai Tesque), and the radioactivity on the membrane was monitored. For the inhibition experiments, the tested inhibitors were added into the D-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine substrate solution at the same time.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence staining of mouse kidneys</title>
<p>The 8 weeks old male C57BL/6J mice (Japan SLC) were anesthetized and fixed by anterograde perfusion via the aorta with 4% w/v paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The kidneys were dissected, post-fixed in the same buffer for two days, and cryoprotected in 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % w/v sucrose. Frozen kidney sections were cut at 7 µm thickness in a cryostat (Leica) and mounted on MAS-coated glass slides (Matsunami). The sections were placed in antigen retrieval buffer (10 mM citrate and 10 mM sodium Citrate), autoclaved at 121 ℃ for 5 min and washed by TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1 % v/v Tween 20). Immunostaining was done by serial incubation with each antibody as below.</p>
<p>For Asct2 and Sglt2 co-immunostaining, the samples were incubated with 3 % hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 min, washed with TBS, and incubated in Blocking One Histo (Nacalai tesque) for 15 min. The samples were then incubated with mouse anti-SGLT2 antibody diluted in immunoreaction enhancer B solution (Can Get Signal immunostain, TOYOBO) overnight at 4 °C. Signal was enhanced by Alexa Fluor 568 Tyramide SuperBoost (TSA) kit, goat anti-mouse IgG, following the manufacturer’s instruction (Thermo). The antibodies were then stripped by citrate/acetate-based buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.3% w/v SDS at 95 °C for 10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Buchwalow et al., 2018</xref>), washed by TBS, and incubated with Blocking One Histo. Asct2 staining was done as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nagamori et al., 2016a</xref>). Briefly, the samples were incubated with rabbit anti-Asct2(NT) antibody diluted in immunoreaction enhancer A solution (Can Get Signal immunostain) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBS-T, the specimens were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG.</p>
<p>For Asct2 and Agt1 co-immunostaining, signals of both antibodies were enhanced by TSA kit. First, the specimens were incubated with rabbit anti-Agt1(G) antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nagamori et al., 2016a</xref>) overnight at 4 °C followed by Alexa Fluor 568 TSA kit with goat anti-rabbit. The antibodies were then stripped. The specimens were incubated with rabbit anti-Asct2(NT) overnight at 4 °C and then repeated the steps of TSA kit using Alexa Fluor 488, goat anti-rabbit.</p>
<p>Staining of Asct2 and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase was performed without TSA enhancement. After blocking by Blocking One Histo, the samples were incubated with rabbit anti-Asct2(NT) antibody diluted in immunoreaction enhancer A solution overnight. The samples were washed with TBS-T, incubated with Alexa Fluor488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and washed again. Non-specific staining was blocked by Blocking One Histo and the specimens were then incubated with mouse anti-Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase antibody diluted in immunoreaction enhancer B solution overnight at 4 °C. The specimens were washed with TBS-T and incubated with Alexa Fluor568-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Smct1 and Sglt2 were co-stained. After blocking by Blocking One Histo, the samples were incubated with rabbit anti-Smct1 antibody and mouse anti-SGLT2 diluted in immunoreaction enhancer B solution overnight at 4 °C. The specimens were washed with TBS-T and incubated with Alexa Fluor488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor568-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Prior to the co-staining of Smct1 and Agt1, anti-Agt1 antibody was conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 dye via succinimidyl ester reaction. The antibody was adjusted to pH 8.3 and mixed with Alexa Fluor 568 NHS Ester (Thermo) for 2 hours. The reaction was stopped by incubation with 1 M ethanolamine for 1 hour. The unconjugated dye was removed by size exclusion using Bio-Spin P-30 gel columns (Bio-rad) equilibrated in PBS pH 7.4. For Smct1 and Agt1 co-staining, after the blocking step, the samples were firstly stained with rabbit anti-Smct1 antibody diluted in immunoreaction enhancer A solution. Signal was enhanced by Alexa Fluor 488 TSA kit with goat anti-rabbit IgG. Subsequently, the specimen was washed with TBS-T and non-specific staining was blocked by Blocking One Histo. The samples were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-Smct1 antibody diluted in Blocking One Histo overnight at 4 °C.</p>
<p>All specimens were washed with TBS-T and mounted with Fluoromount (Diagnostic Biosystems). Imaging was detected using a KEYENCE BZ-X710 microscope. Images were color-adjusted using ImageJ ver. 1.51 (NIH).

<title>Analysis of Smcts and Asct2 from the open-sourced dataset of single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of the IRI model</title>
<p>The dataset of snRNA-seq used is created from the mice after ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and published by Kirita et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kirita et al., 2020</xref>). The snRNA-seq dataset (GSE139107), which has already processed by zUMIs and SoupX, was downloaded from GEO, a public functional genomics data repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barrett et al., 2012</xref>). The dataset revealed percentage of mitochondrial UMI counts of each cell (calculated by <italic>PercentageFeatureSet</italic> function of Seurat) to be &lt; 0.01 % in more than 94% cells in each cluster. From the “GSE139107_MouseIRI.metadata”, we annotated the expression of Smct1, Smct2 and Asct2 in proximal tubule segments 1 – 3 (S1, S2, and S3) at the early stages of IRI (4 and 12 hours) compared to the control mice. Downstream analyses including normalization, scaling and visualization were performed by Seurat v3.2, an R package designed for Quality Control, analysis and exploration of single-cell RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). After selecting the cells in S1, S2, and S3 from the datasets (control, 4-hour IRI, and 12-hour IRI), we merged the data of the cells in the same cluster. The data were then calculated as log-normalized values by <italic>NormalizeData</italic> function and scaled by <italic>ScaleData</italic> function of Seurat. Visualization of the expression data was performed using Seurat plug-in of R software and ggplot2 plug-in of R software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wickham, 2010</xref>).

<p>Most amino acids are stereoisomers in the L-enantiomer, but natural D-serine has also been detected in mammals and its levels shown to be connected to a number of different pathologies. Here, the authors convincingly show that D-serine is transported in the kidney by the neutral amino acid transporter ASCT2 and as a non-canonical substrate for the sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter SMCTs. Although both transport D-serine, this important study further shows in a mouse model for acute kidney injury that ASCT2 has the dominant role.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The paper combines proteomics, animal models, ex vivo transport analyses, and in vitro transport assays using purified components. The exhaustive methods employed provide compelling evidence that both transporters can translocate D-serine in the kidney.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>
In the model for acute kidney injury, the SMCTs proteins were not showing a significant change in expression levels and were rather analysed based on other, circumstantial evidence. Although its clear SMCTs can transport D-serine its physiological role is less obvious compared to ASCT2.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript &quot;A multi-hierarchical approach reveals D-1 serine as a hidden substrate of sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporters&quot; by Wiriyasermkul et al. is a resubmission of a manuscript, which focused first on the proteomic analysis of apical membrane isolated from mouse kidney with early Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury (IRI), a well-known acute kidney injury (AKI) model. In the second part, the transport of D-serine by Asct2, Smct1, and Smct2 has been characterized in detail in different model systems, such as transfected cells and proteoliposomes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
A major problem with the first submission was the explanation of the link between the two parts of the manuscript: it was not very clear why the focus on Asct2, Smct1, and Smct2 was a consequence of the proteomic analysis. In the present version of the manuscript, the authors have focused on the expression of membrane transporters in the proteome analysis, thus making the reason for studying Asct2, Smct1, and Smct2 transporters more clear. In addition, the authors used 2D-HPLC to measure plasma and urinary enantiomers of 20 amino acids in plasma and urine samples from sham and Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury (IRI) mice. The results of this analysis demonstrated the value of D-serine as a potential marker of renal injury. These changes have greatly improved the manuscript and made it more convincing.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The main objective of this work has been to delve into the mechanisms underlying the increment of D-serine in serum, as a marker of renal injury.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
With a multi-hierarchical approach, the work shows that Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in the kidney causes a specific increment in renal reabsorption of D-serine that, at least in part, is due to the increased expression of the apical transporter ASCT2. In this way, the authors revealed that SMCT1 also transports D-serine.</p>
<p>The manuscript also supports that increased expression of ASCT2, even together with the parallel decreased expression of SMCT1, in renal proximal tubules underlies the increased reabsorption of D-serine responsible for the increment of this enantiomer in serum in a murine model of Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Remains to be clarified whether ASCT2 has substantial stereospecificity in favor of D- versus L-serine to sustain a ~10-fold decrease in the ratio D-serine/L-serine in the urine of mice under Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury (IRI).</p>
<p>
It is not clear how the increment in the expression of ASCT2, in parallel with the decreased expression of SMCT1, results in increased renal reabsorption of D-serine in IRI.</p>
