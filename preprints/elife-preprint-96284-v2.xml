<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cells react to stress by triggering response pathways, leading to extensive alterations in the transcriptome to restore cellular homeostasis. The role of RNA metabolism in shaping the cellular response to stress is vital, yet the global changes in RNA stability under these conditions remain unclear. In this work, we employ direct RNA sequencing with nanopores, enhanced by 5’ end adaptor ligation, to comprehensively interrogate the human transcriptome at single-molecule and nucleotide resolution. By developing a statistical framework to identify robust RNA length variations in nanopore data, we find that cellular stress induces prevalent 5’ end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy. Unlike typical RNA decay models in normal conditions, we show that stress-induced RNA decay is dependent on XRN1 but does not depend on deadenylation or decapping. We observed that RNAs undergoing decay are predominantly enriched in the stress granule transcriptome while inhibition of stress granule formation via genetic ablation of G3BP1 and G3BP2 rescues RNA length. Our findings reveal RNA decay as a key determinant of RNA metabolism upon cellular stress and dependent on stress-granule formation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells respond to stress by triggering extensive transcriptome remodeling to restore cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Galluzzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Payea et al., 2023</xref>). Cellular stress responses have been under intense study as the capacity of cells to activate adaptive pathways deteriorates with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Derisbourg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Haigis and Yankner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maragkakis et al., 2023</xref>) and has been associated with many diseases, particularly age-related neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Beckman and Ames, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Stadtman and Berlett, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The response to different stressors converges at the induction of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), a common adaptive molecular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Harding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>) that induces phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) to inhibit translation initiation and decrease global protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hinnebusch, 1994</xref>). In turn, mRNAs exiting the translational pool get localized in stress granules (SGs), membraneless organelles that are formed upon stress when translation of mRNAs gets arrested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Panas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>). SGs comprise several different types of biomolecules, particularly mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, but their precise functions in mRNA storage or decay are not yet fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson and Kedersha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marcelo et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Short- and long-read sequencing following tagging of RNA 5’ ends has revealed that RNA content in cells is a mix of intact RNA molecules and RNA decay intermediates that exist in a transient, partially degraded state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>, <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>). However much less is known about the global transcriptome-wide state of RNA under stress and whether stress leads to RNA decay or stabilization. Evidence have been found in both directions with stress having been associated with mRNA stabilization in a translation-dependent and independent way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gowrishankar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hilgers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Horvathova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kharel et al., 2023</xref>). On the other hand, in yeast, ribosomal and other RNA binding proteins, which under certain physiological conditions contact mRNAs to facilitate translation, show diminished mRNA association under heat shock stress and decreased mRNA abundance mediated by the 5′-3′ exoribonuclease Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bresson et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, under oxidative stress, deletion of Xrn1 can lead to accumulation of oxidized RNAs bearing nucleotide adducts such as 8-oxoguanosine (8-oxoG), in turn inhibiting translation and triggering No-Go decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yan et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we globally profile the integrity of individual RNA molecules in human cells under stress by full-length direct RNA sequencing with nanopores. We develop a new computational framework for statistical interrogation of RNA decay at single molecule and nucleotide resolution. We find that upon cellular stress, RNAs globally exhibit marked shortening at their 5′ end. This stress-induced decay is mediated by XRN1, but is not dependent on prior deadenylation or decapping, as classical models would posit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Passmore and Coller, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, we find that the decaying RNA molecules are preferentially enriched in the SG transcriptome. Prevention of SG formation by ablation of cells for G3BP1 and G3BP2 rescues RNA length upon stress, suggesting SG formation as a required step for stress-induced RNA decay. Our results identify 5’ RNA decay as a hallmark of cellular stress response that defines the transcriptome and that is dependent on stress-granule formation.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Stress induces widespread decay at the 5’ end of RNAs</title>
<p>To explore the state of RNA under stress, we treated HeLa cells with sodium arsenite (0.5 mM) for 60 minutes to induce oxidative stress. We verified the formation of SGs and increased eIF2α phosphorylation (discussed in subsequent sections) and monitored cell viability up to 4 hours after treatment with no major change observed (<bold>Sup. Fig. 1a</bold>). We collected arsenite-treated and untreated cells and performed direct RNA-Seq with the TERA-Seq protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Direct RNA-Seq profiles RNA at single molecule resolution without cDNA conversion or PCR amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Workman et al., 2019</xref>) while TERA-Seq additionally incorporates unique adapters that are ligated to the 5’ phosphorylated end of individual RNA molecules. These adapters are then sequenced along with the native RNA sequence. Nanopore-based direct RNA sequencing proceeds in the 3’ to 5’ direction thus the inclusion, and subsequent computational identification of an adapter, at the 5’ end of a read acts as internal control ensuring an RNA molecule has been sequenced in its entirety. Notably, TERA-Seq does not biochemically select for ligated molecules, thus the resultant sequencing datasets comprise both ligated and non-ligated molecules. Ligated molecules can be computationally recognized and separated to be analyzed jointly or independently to non-ligated reads. Samples were prepared in biological triplicates and sequenced on a MinION device, yielding approximately 2 million long reads per library (<bold>Sup. Table 1</bold>). Replicates displayed high expression correlation and high alignment efficiency to the human genome <bold>(Sup. Fig. 1b, Sup. Table 1)</bold>. Consistent with oxidative stress induction, differential gene expression analysis identified several stress response genes being upregulated in arsenite while gene ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed expected associations to cellular response to stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref><bold>, Sup. Fig 1c, Sup. Table 3)</bold>. These results show that our long-read data reproducibly captured the expression status of the transcriptome upon oxidative stress.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, quantification of read lengths in stressed and unstressed cells revealed a significant difference in read lengths with RNAs from oxidatively stressed cells being significantly shorter than from unstressed cells by an average of 115.3 nucleotides (Mann–Whitney: p-value &lt; 10<sup>−123</sup>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). To test this finding for individual transcripts (“transcript” hereafter refers to the annotated loci of a gene isoform), we calculated a metric for transcript length corresponding to the average length of reads of each transcript. We again found that RNAs from stressed cells were globally shorter than in unstressed cells, independent of both transcript differential expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>) and coding potential (<bold>Sup. Fig. 1d-e</bold>). To exclude potential library preparation artifacts or failure to capture long transcripts by the sequencing device, we repeated the analysis by computationally selecting only reads with ligated 5′ adaptors, ensuring RNA molecules were fully sequenced. The subset of 5′ adaptor-ligated reads confirmed our findings and again showed global RNA shortening upon oxidative stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Since both ligated and non-ligated reads showed comparable results, all reads were used in subsequent analysis to increase sequencing depth, unless otherwise mentioned.</p>
<p>To test whether the observed stress-induced RNA shortening was independent of preexisting steady-state fragmentation levels, we performed analyses in a length-normalized space (meta-length) that represents read length as a percent of annotated transcript length. We calculated normalized meta-length by splitting each annotated transcript in 20 equal bins, assigning the mapped read ends into individual bins, and defining the transcript meta-length as the difference of the 5’ and 3’ end bins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Our data showed a consistent reduction of transcript meta-length upon oxidative stress, independent of steady-state unstressed fragmentation levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref><bold>, Sup. Fig. 1f</bold>). This finding remained consistent when only selecting reads with an identified poly(A) tail (<bold>Sup. Fig. 1g</bold>).</p>
<p>To exclude potential confounding effects of arsenite itself, we further tested oxidative stress induction with 0.3 mM hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for 2 hours followed by TERA-Seq. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress also resulted in significant transcript shortening (Mann–Whitney: p-value &lt; 10<sup>−96</sup>), similar to that observed with arsenite, indicating that oxidative stress results in RNA shortening irrespective of inducer (<bold>Sup. Fig. 1h</bold>). To explore whether RNA shortening is unique to oxidative stress we re-examined publicly available direct RNA-Seq data for human K562 cells that were subjected to heat shock at 42°C for 60 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Maier et al., 2020</xref>). Our results showed that heat-shocked cells also had significantly shorter RNAs compared to unstressed cells (Mann–Whitney: p-value &lt; 10<sup>−76</sup>), again independently of differential expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref><bold>, Sup. Fig. 1i, j</bold>). Additionally, we also observed RNA shortening in mouse embryonic fibroblasts 3T3 cells treated with sodium arsenite, suggesting an evolutionary conserved process (<bold>Sup. Fig. 1k, l)</bold>.</p>
<p>To identify transcripts with statistically significant RNA length changes, we developed NanopLen, a tool that uses linear mixed models, and modeled the library as a random effect to adjust for variation across replicates. To test the model, we simulated sequencing data over varying RNA shortening proportions and expression counts. The simulated data showed that the model accurately predicted the true length difference for each tested shortening proportion and had a well-controlled false positive rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). As expected, NanopLen reported lower significance for smaller length differences while higher expression counts resulted in higher statistical power on simulated data. We subsequently employed NanopLen to compare unstressed and arsenite-treated cells and identified 2730 significantly shortened transcripts (p-value &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref><bold>, Sup. Table 4)</bold>. Gene Ontology analysis of these most highly shortened transcripts showed processes relevant to RNA catabolism, translation initiation, and protein localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>

<p>The presence of a poly(A) tail is required for direct RNA-Seq. Therefore, we anticipated that our method would only be able to capture fragmentation occurring at the 5’ end of RNAs. As expected, significantly shortened transcripts showed that their 3’ templated end was almost identical in oxidative stress and unstressed conditions whereas the corresponding 5’ end was heterogenous (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref><bold>, Sup. Fig. 2a)</bold>. Quantification at the transcriptome-wide level further confirmed this observation (Mann Whitney p-value &lt; 10<sup>−256</sup>, <bold>Sup. Fig. 2b</bold>). To validate our sequencing results, we performed RT-qPCR analysis using pairs of primers targeting regions along each transcript. We found that arsenite-treated cells had substantially reduced amplification from primer pairs closer to the 5’ end of the transcript than near the 3’ end, compared to control cells <bold>(Sup. Fig. 2c)</bold>. We reasoned that RNA shortening at the 5’ end should also be reflected in short-read RNA-Seq as reduction in read coverage at the 5’ end of RNAs. We thus re-analyzed data from HEK293 cells treated with a battery of stressors i.e. 42 °C heat shock for 1 h; 0.6 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 2 h and 300 µM NaAsO<sub>2</sub> for 2 h followed by short-read RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Watkins et al., 2022</xref>). Our analysis showed that, compared to unstressed, all stress conditions resulted in significantly reduced read coverage at the 5’ end (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref><bold>, Sup. Fig. 2d</bold>).</p>
<p>Finally, we considered the possibility that selection of alternative transcription start sites (TSSs) downstream of annotated TSSs could be contributing to RNA shortening. We have previously established that positions with high read density upstream of coding sequences in TERA-Seq, accurately represent TSSs matching those defined by CAGE-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>). We used this method to independently calculate TSSs in stress and unstressed conditions. Our results showed non-significant changes between conditions (Mann–Whitney: p-value = 0.35) with no preference towards shorter or longer transcripts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>) indicating that the observed shortening is not affected by TSS selection. Collectively, our results, while not excluding 3’ end decay for molecules not sequenced due to lack of poly(A) tails, provide strong evidence for stress-induced decay occurring at the 5’ end of RNA molecules that harbor poly(A) tails.</p>

<title>Stress-induced RNA decay is XRN1-mediated but independent of deadenylation</title>
<p>XRN1 is the primary 5’ to 3’ exonuclease in cells, and thus a likely candidate for mediating 5’ transcript shortening upon stress following decapping or endonucleolytic fragmentation. We hypothesized that in the absence of XRN1, RNAs would be stabilized, and their observed length would be restored. Silencing of XRN1 with siRNAs (siXRN1) resulted in substantial reduction of protein level compared to non-targeted control (siCTRL) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref><bold>, Sup. Fig. 3a</bold>). We subsequently performed TERA-Seq for siCTRL- and siXRN1-transfected cells in the presence or absence of oxidative stress. Our results showed that while arsenite and unstressed siCTRL cells had the highest transcript length difference (Mann-Whitney, p-value &lt; 10<sup>−307</sup>), silencing of XRN1 largely abolished this difference (Mann-Whitney, p-value = 0.18) and brought transcript lengths in line with unstressed cells with XRN1 silenced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Similar results were observed for REL5-ligated transcripts, with XRN1 silencing showing an even stronger effect, suggesting that stress-induced decay depends on XRN1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). While silencing of <italic>XRN1</italic> might be expected to have a general effect on RNA length, our results showed that RNA length rescue was predominant and specific for the previously identified stress-induced significantly shortened RNAs identified by our NanopLen analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). These results strongly implicate XRN1 to transcript shortening during stress.</p>

<p>Under traditional decay models, deadenylation is considered the first and rate-limiting step prior to decapping and subsequent exonucleolytic action from the 5’-end via XRN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Borbolis and Syntichaki, 2022</xref>; Łabno et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mugridge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Passmore and Coller, 2021</xref>). However, the molecules we sequence and find shortened still have a poly(A), as it is required for dRNA-Seq. This argued that removal of the poly(A) tail was not necessary for stress-induced 5’ end shortening. To systematically assess the role of deadenylation and decapping, we first downregulated the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex by expressing a GFP-fused catalytically inactive form of the CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 8 (NOT8* D40A, E42A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chang et al., 2019</xref>) in HeLa cells, followed by arsenite treatment and dRNA-Seq. Expression of the dominant negative NOT8* form was confirmed by epifluorescence (<bold>Sup. Fig. 3b)</bold> and resulted in an expected increase in poly(A) tail length compared to control GFP cells (<bold>Sup. Fig. 3c</bold>). As hypothesized, our results identified significant 5’ shortening upon stress following expression of the dominant negative NOT8* (Mann-Whitney, p-value &lt; 10<sup>−299</sup>), suggesting that deadenylation by the CCR4-NOT complex was indeed not required for stress-induced 5’ RNA decay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p>
<p>These results raised the possibility that decapping may also not be required for stress-induced decay. To test this, we expressed a GFP-fused catalytically inactive form of the mRNA-decapping enzyme 2 (DCP2), DCP2* E148Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Loh et al., 2013</xref>) in HeLa cells followed by dRNA-Seq. Expression of DCP2* was confirmed by epifluorescence, though it was less pronounced than that of NOT8* (<bold>Sup. Fig. 3b</bold>). Interestingly, transcripts from DCP2*-expressing cells presented a similar significant (Mann-Whitney, p-value &lt; 10<sup>−127</sup>) 5’ shortening upon oxidative stress as GFP control cells, suggesting that the canonical decapping pathway is also not necessary for stress-induced RNA decay, and thus likely involves an endonucleolytic cleavage event (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). In conclusion, our results show that stress-induced RNA decay is mediated by XRN1 but is independent of prior deadenylation or decapping.</p>

<title>Restoring ribosome density inhibits stress-induced RNA decay</title>
<p>The yeast Xrn1 has previously been associated with the decay of oxidized RNAs via the No-Go decay pathway following ribosome stalling at nucleotide adducts, particularly 8-oxoguanosine (8-OxoG), and endonucleolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). We reasoned that if endonucleolytic cleavage induced by 8-OxoG was the major contributor to transcript shortening during oxidative stress, then an increase in guanine prevalence should be expected at the vicinity of 5’ ends of sequenced RNAs upon stress. However, our data did not support this explanation, as no G-nucleotide enrichment difference between arsenite and unstressed conditions was observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Similarly, no difference was observed upon XRN1 silencing (<bold>Sup. Fig. 4a</bold>).

<p>To identify gene features that could be driving stress-induced RNA decay, we tested whether the annotated nucleotide content and transcript length were predictive of transcripts prone to stress-induced 5’ shortening. Our results showed a significant association with the annotated length, coding sequence length and GC content, both being significantly lower for significantly shortened transcripts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b-d</xref>) and only a minor association with the 5’ and 3’ UTR length <bold>(Sup. Fig. 4b-c</bold>). Since the coding sequence is the primary region of ribosome occupancy, we tested whether pre-stress ribosome density could be defining 5’ shortening using publicly available ribosome profiling data from unstressed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Our analysis found no association between ribosome density per RNA and stress-induced shortening (<bold>Sup. Fig. 4d, e</bold>) indicating that the pre-stress ribosome levels on RNAs are not linked to RNA decay under stress.</p>
<p>Rather, another possibility could be that stress-induced RNA decay is associated with the rate at which RNAs leave the translation pool following inhibition of translation initiation upon stress. To test the role of translation initiation inhibition and ribosome run-off upon stress on stress-induced decay, we treated cells with the ISR Inhibitor (ISRIB) that bypasses the effect of eIF2α phosphorylation and facilitates translation initiation under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rabouw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>).

<p>Polysome fractionation following ISRIB addition showed a clear reduction of the monosome fraction, indicating partial recovery of translation initiation, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). We then performed TERA-Seq on ISRIB-treated and control cells in the presence or absence of arsenite. Our results showed that compared to cells treated with arsenite only, ISRIB treatment resulted in a significant shift of RNA length towards longer molecules (Mann-Whitney, p-value &lt; 10<sup>−156</sup>) essentially restoring transcript length to the level observed in unstressed cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). Importantly, previously identified significantly shortened transcripts showed the greatest recovery of their length compared to non-significant ones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). To test whether this could be simply attributed to a possible length imbalance between up- and down-regulated genes, we again plotted the average transcript length stratified by the differential expression status. Our data show that the observed shift in length is independent of differential expression status (<bold>Sup. Fig. 5a, b</bold>). These results indicated that stress-induced RNA decay is associated with RNAs leaving the translation pool following translation initiation inhibition upon stress.</p>
<p>As an alternative to ISRIB which modulates translation initiation, we also treated cells with cycloheximide to interrogate the dynamics of ribosome elongation and to prevent ribosome run-off. Cycloheximide blocks elongation and thus traps ribosomes on RNAs along with translation factors in polysomes, thus decreasing SG formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jayabalan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kedersha and Anderson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Takahashi et al., 2013</xref>). We confirmed that treatment with cycloheximide also reduced the monosome fraction, although to a lower degree than ISRIB (<bold>Sup. Fig. 5c</bold>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, cycloheximide treatment also inhibited RNA decay, particularly for the most significantly shortened RNAs largely rescuing their length (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g-i</xref>). We again did not observe any association between the shift in length and differential expression <bold>(Sup. Fig. 5d, e)</bold>.</p>
<p>Combined, our results indicate translation initiation inhibition and the exit of mRNAs from the translational pool as a critical step towards stress-induced decay.</p>

<title>Inhibition of stress-granule formation in cells devoid of G3BP1/2 rescues RNA decay</title>
<p>During stress, ribosome run-off and the exit of RNAs from the translation pool is accompanied by the formation of SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>). To test whether transcripts subject to stress-induced decay associate with SGs, we used publicly available data representing genes enriched in the SG transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Khong et al., 2017</xref>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Khong et al., 2017</xref>), we found that SG-enriched genes were generally significantly longer, particularly in their coding and 3’ UTR sequences, (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref><bold>, Sup. Fig. 6a</bold>) and less expressed than SG-depleted ones (<bold>Sup. </bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). However, differential gene length analysis showed a significant difference in gene shortening dependent on SG enrichment status. Specifically, SG-enriched genes were found to be shortened at a significantly higher level upon oxidative stress than SG-depleted or non-localized RNAs for both HeLa and U-2 OS cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b, c</xref><bold>, Sup. Fig. 6c, d</bold>). Consistent with stress-induced gene shortening being associated with SG enrichment, SG-enriched RNAs harbored lower GC content (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>), similar to significantly shortened transcripts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). To test whether the observed enrichment of shortened genes is specific to the SGs, we also tested for association with processing bodies (P-bodies), membrane-less organelles enriched in de-capping factors and exoribonucleases that are essential for RNA decay under normal, non-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brothers et al., 2023</xref>). We re-analyzed previously published data from HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Matheny et al., 2019</xref>), but in contrast to SGs, we found no association between P-body localization and gene lengths (<bold>Sup. Fig. 6e</bold>). We also did not find an association between P-body localization and RNA shortening, which however could be a result of comparing different cell lines (<bold>Sup. Fig. 6f</bold>). Our data show that shortened RNAs exhibit similar properties to SG-enriched transcripts and are preferentially enriched in the SG transcriptome.</p>

<p>To test the role of stress granules in stress-induced RNA decay, we employed control (WT) U-2 OS and U-2 OS cells genetically ablated for both G3BP1 and G3BP2 (ΔΔG3BP1/2) via CRISPR/Cas9 (gift from Paul Anderson lab) previously developed and characterized in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kedersha et al., 2016</xref>). ΔΔG3BP1/2 cells inhibit SG condensation in response to arsenite and other stressors. Treatment of WT U-2 OS cells with arsenite showed a highly significant and global shortening of RNA upon stress (Mann-Whitney, p-value &lt; 10<sup>−307</sup>) in stark contrast to ΔΔG3BP1/2 cells that showed substantially less shortening (Mann-Whitney, p-value &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref><bold>, Sup. Fig. 6g, h</bold>). Further comparison of ΔΔG3BP1/2 and WT U-2 OS showed that inhibition of G3BP1/2-mediated SG formation rescued RNA length to the level of unstressed WT cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref><bold>, Sup. Fig. 6i, j</bold>). These results indicate that G3BP1/2-mediated SG formation is required for stress-induced RNA decay. Alternatively, SGs could be protective of shortened RNAs that otherwise would be rapidly eliminated from cells. Under this assumption stress-shortened RNAs identified in WT cells would be expected to be depleted in ΔΔG3BP1/2 cells during stress. Comparison of differentially expressed transcripts upon arsenite treatment in ΔΔG3BP1/2 cells showed no association with WT shortening indicating that in the absence of SGs these RNAs are not rapidly eliminated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bley et al., 2015</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cellular response to stress is critical for cell recovery or induction of apoptosis if stress cannot be resolved. Recent works have delineated many of the biochemical pathways involved in stress responses. However, the full-length state of RNA under cellular stress remains incompletely characterized. In this work, we used TERA-Seq, a protocol that involves the ligation of unique adaptors at the 5’ end of RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>) to address a key limitation in nanopore direct RNA sequencing – the inability to consistently capture the 5’ end of sequenced RNA molecules. By sequencing RNA molecules end-to-end, we show that stress triggers decay at the 5′ end of RNAs. Interestingly our results show that stress-induced 5’ end decay leaves “scars” that can also be identified in traditional short-read RNA-Seq as decreased read density at the 5’ end of transcripts.</p>
<p>Our findings highlight XRN1 as an essential component for stress-induced decay, in the absence of which RNA length is largely rescued. However, contrary to the traditional decay model, evaluation of the shortened RNAs did not reveal a dependency on deadenylation or decapping. Instead, our data point towards endonucleolytic cleavage as the most likely mechanism for the initial cut on RNA, either creating a 5’P, serving as a direct substrate to XRN1, or a 5’OH, subsequently phosphorylated to become a substrate for XRN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Navickas et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Our analysis showing that transcript shortening is suppressed by treatments that increase ribosome occupancy (ISRIB and cycloheximide) also suggests that this putative endonucleolytic cut is not due to No-Go decay or a related ribosome quality control pathway, since these decay mechanisms are guided to cleavage sites by a stalled ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Doma and Parker, 2006</xref>). However, it is currently unknown whether a mechanistic link exists with other co-translational decay pathways, such as ribothrypsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ibrahim et al., 2018</xref>), that also initiate by endonucleolysis. More studies will be needed to dissect the exact molecular events involved in this mechanism. Recent studies have found sporadic fragments of 3' UTRs as products of No-Go decay occurring at sites of translation termination in oxidative stress, development and brain aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sudmant et al., 2018</xref>). While most stress-induced decay fragments are longer than 3' UTRs and are not confined to translation termination sites, it is possible that some shorter fragments could also be contributing to an accumulation of 3' UTRs under these conditions.</p>
<p>Interestingly we find that short coding sequences and low GC content are features of transcripts that are subject to stress-induced decay, which argues there may be a component of structural stability to the specificity of 5’ end shortening. The GC content appears to also be a determinant for RNA recruitment to SGs and, as also confirmed in our study, primarily for GC-poor RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Khong et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with these observations, our data show that the SG transcriptome is significantly enriched for stress-induced shortened RNAs. In fact, our results show that the formation of the SGs is required and indispensable for stress-induced decay as genetic ablation of G3BP1/2 rescues RNA length to the level of non-stressed controls. Inhibition of the ISR to re-initiate translation and dissolve SGs also curtails stress-induced RNA decay, further supporting a critical role for SG formation in stress-induced RNA decay perhaps through tethering with P-bodies that are dynamically linked with SGs under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Moon et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The primary function of ISR activation during stress is to inhibit translation initiation and preserve energy for cell recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). While the physiological role of stress-induced RNA decay is currently unknown, it is intriguing to hypothesize that it evolved as a mechanism to further reduce translational load during stress. Endonucleolytic cleavage and removal of RNA 5’ ends could provide an orthogonal strategy to dial down translation, offering several benefits: rapid elimination of translation initiation sites, degradation of non-essential RNAs, release of ribosomes for stress response translation, and energy conservation. Future studies to test these hypotheses will be required, especially considering the emerging significance of SGs and RNA metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ferrucci et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ripin and Parker, 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>MTS assay</title>
<p>MTS assay was performed using CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) (Promega, Cat # G3582). HeLa cells (5 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells per well) were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated in humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C for 24 hours. Following arsenite treatment, the cell viability was examined using MTS assay (100 µl of DMEM and 20 µl MTS incubated for indicated time points) for 10 minutes and incubated in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 °C protected from light. Finally, the plate was subjected to shaking for 15 min followed by an optical density measurement (OD) at 590 nm using 1420 Multilabel Counter (Perkin Elmer, VICTOR<sup>3</sup>V). The viable cells in arsenite treated samples were reported as the percentage of viable cells in control (untreated) samples.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Cells were washed with cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation 5 min at 4 °C 300 <italic>x g</italic>. Whole cell lysates were prepared by adding 1 volume of SDS lysis buffer (60 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Cat # 11836153001) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Roche, Cat # 10837091001). The lysate was passed 10 times through a 25-gauge needle, heated at 95°C for 20 minutes and cleared by centrifugation at 16,500 <italic>x g</italic> for 10 minutes. Protein concentrations were measured using the Qubit protein assay (Invitrogen, Cat # Q33211). 25 µg of proteins was separated on NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen, Cat #NP0321BOX) and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Cat # IPVH00010). After blocking in TBS-T 5% milk for 2 hours, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed 3 times 5 min in TBS-T and incubated for 2 hours with secondary antibodies. Signals were developed using Chemiluminescence (Azure Biosystems, Cat # AC2204) and acquired on a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad). For studies of eIF2α phosphorylation (eIF2α-P), the lysis buffer was supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma, Cat # Cocktail 2 - P5726 and Cocktail 3-P0044) and 5% BSA was used instead of milk for blocking. Antibodies are listed in Sup. Table 2.</p>

<title>Polysome profiling</title>
<p>The polysome profiling was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Panda et al., 2017</xref>) with modifications. Briefly, HeLa cells (80-85% confluency) cultured in 100 mm dishes were treated with 500 µM sodium arsenite, 200 nM ISRIB or 25 µg/ml cycloheximide as indicated. DMSO was used as a control. Immediately before harvesting, cells were treated with 100 µg/ml cycloheximide for 10 minutes. After one wash with ice-cold PBS containing 100 µg/ml cycloheximide, 500 µL of polysome extraction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1mM DTT, 1 X HALT Protease, 1.0% Triton x-100, and 100 µg/ml cycloheximide) was added directly to the plate and lysates were harvested by scraping. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 <italic>x g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto the 10-50% sucrose gradient followed by high-speed centrifugation (260,800 <italic>x g</italic> for 90 minutes at 4°C). Using a density gradient fractionation system monitored by UV absorbance detector (A254), 12 fractions were collected.</p>

<title>Nanopore sequencing data processing</title>
<p>Nanopore sequencing data were basecalled using Guppy (v3.4.5). The 5′ adaptors were identified and removed using cutadapt (v2.8). Reads were first aligned against ribosomal sequences obtained from SILVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Quast et al., 2013</xref>). Non-ribosomal reads were subsequently mapped against the human genome hg38 using minimap2 (version 2.17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li, 2018</xref>) and parameters -a -x splice -k 12 -u b -p 1 --secondary=yes.

<title>Differential gene expression and Gene Ontology</title>
<p>Transcript counts were quantified from the transcriptome alignments as the total number of reads aligning on each transcript. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Love et al., 2014</xref>). EnhancedVolcano (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kevinblighe/EnhancedVolcano">https://github.com/kevinblighe/EnhancedVolcano</ext-link>) was used for visualization.

<title>Ribosome profiling data</title>
<p>Ribosome profiling sequencing data were downloaded from GEO GSM2100595 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Adaptors were removed using cutadapt (version 2.8) and reads were aligned to the human genome using STAR (2.5.3a). Further processing to calculate counts per transcript was performed with in-house scripts using pysam (v0.15.4) and counts were converted to reads per kilobase of transcript per million (RPKM).</p>

<title>Meta-length calculation</title>
<p>For calculating the bin (meta) lengths, we divided the transcripts into 20 equal bins [0, 19]. Reads were assigned to each of these bins based on the corresponding location of their ends. The binned-(meta-) length is calculated as the difference of the binned 3’ end over the binned 5’ end.</p>

<title>Transcription start site identification</title>
<p>Transcription start site identification was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, all reads from all replicates were combined and the distribution of read 5’ ends within the 5’ UTR was quantified. The TSS was selected as the position with the highest read density withing the 5’ UTR with minimum 5 supporting reads.</p>

<title>NanopLen</title>
<p>NanopLen reads a file of read lengths with library identifiers and gene or transcript identifiers, and a metadata file describing the experimental design. The latter includes the library identifiers and the corresponding condition for each library. The software supports three models: t-test, Wilcoxon, and linear mixed model (LMM). In the t-test and LMM options, the user can also supply a customized model to use extra variables in the metadata. In this work we have used the LMM to adjust for putative batch effects across libraries. Given a vector Y of read lengths associated with a gene/transcript, the t-test is functionally equivalent to a linear regression model. The model also supports optional read-specific extra covariates but are not used in this work:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="555629v3_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Similarly, the LMM models Y using the condition as fixed effect and the library identifier as a random effect.
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="555629v3_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>lib</italic> is the random effect of each library. By adding the random effect, the analysis is more robust against potential false positives from library variation and prevents deeper libraries from dominating the effect size. A Wald test is used to test for significance of <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>cond</italic></sub>. The Wilcoxon test option is restricted to only testing the condition variable and cannot adjust for additional variables. Each gene/transcript is assigned a statistic corresponding to the test used and a p-value. p-values are adjusted for multiple testing using the Bonferroni-Hochberg method.</p>
<p>To test NanopLen models, transcript length data with known shortening rates were simulated. Each simulation was parameterized with a “true” transcript length, a read count as a proxy for transcript expression, and a shortening proportion. The database of known human genic lengths from Ensembl (release 91) was used and the median was selected as “true” length. Since the simulated variance is in proportion of the true length, using any length will result in similar results so we do not simulate additional true lengths. Expression counts were simulated, ranging from 10 to 200 reads per transcripts to capture the dynamic expression range particularly towards small read depth. Varying shortening percentages were simulated from 50 to 100% of the true length with the 100% corresponding to the null simulation of no-change.</p>
<p>Given the parameters, the simulated lengths were generated based on the mixed model in NanopLen, with the number of sampled lengths being the selected expression counts. The library random effect was simulated as if imitating a fluctuation with standard deviation of 10% of the true length, and the global error having a standard deviation of 20% of the expected length mean. As with the real experiment, six libraries of three control and three condition were simulated, with 1000 genes per scenario. Using the LMM option with the logscale option selected, the resulting log2FCs and p-values were calculated.</p>

<title>IGV read density plots</title>
<p>Transcripts that were identified as significantly shortened at a false discovery rate of 0.05 by NanopLen, had at least 50 supporting reads in both conditions and had a difference of 200 nt in length were selected. From the list of 32 transcripts, 3 were randomly selected (<italic>ASCC3, HNRNPM</italic> and <italic>DSG2</italic>) for visualization. Libraries were randomly downsampled to maximum 50 reads per window and the libraries were overlayed in Affinity Designer. All reads were used, irrespective of adaptor ligation status.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study describes mRNA shortening during cellular stress and interestingly observes that this shortening is dependent on localization in stress granules. Surprisingly, this mRNA shortening does not appear to require the shortening of poly A tails. These are novel, paradigm-shifting findings, using cutting-edge technologies and <bold>convincing</bold> data, that should be of broad interest to the RNA community and beyond.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors employed direct RNA sequencing with nanopores, enhanced by 5' end adaptor ligation, to comprehensively interrogate the human transcriptome at single-molecule and nucleotide resolution. They conclude that cellular stress induces prevalent 5' end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy. Contrary to the literature, they found that, unlike typical RNA decay models in normal conditions, stress-induced RNA decay is dependent on XRN1 but does not depend on the removal of the poly(A) tail. The findings presented are interesting and the authors fully established these paradigm-shifting findings using cutting-edge technologies.</p>

<p>The work by Dar et al. examines RNA metabolism under cellular stress, focusing on stress-granule-dependent RNA decay. It employs direct RNA sequencing with a Nanopore-based method, revealing that cellular stress induces prevalent 5' end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy but is independent of the shortening of the poly(A) tail. This decay, however, is dependent on XRN1 and enriched in the stress granule transcriptome. Notably, inhibiting stress granule formation in G3BP1/2-null cells restores the RNA length to the same level as wild-type. It suppresses stress-induced decay, identifying RNA decay as a critical determinant of RNA metabolism during cellular stress and highlighting its dependence on stress-granule formation. This is an exciting and novel discovery utilizing innovative sequencing methods to studying mRNA decay.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors employed direct RNA sequencing with nanopores, enhanced by 5' end adaptor ligation, to comprehensively interrogate the human transcriptome at singlemolecule and nucleotide resolution. They conclude that cellular stress induces prevalent 5' end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy. Contrary to the literature, they found that, unlike typical RNA decay models in normal conditions, stress-induced RNA decay is dependent on XRN1 but does not depend on the removal of the poly(A) tail. The findings presented are interesting but a substantial amount of work is needed to fully establish these paradigm-shifting findings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>These are paradigm-shifting observations using cutting-edge technologies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions do not appear to be fully supported by the data presented.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In the manuscript &quot;Full-length direct RNA sequencing uncovers stress-granule dependent RNA decay upon cellular stress&quot;, Dar, Malla, and colleagues use direct RNA sequencing on nanopores to characterize the transcriptome after arsenite and oxidative stress. They observe a population of transcripts that are shortened during stress. The authors hypothesize that this shortening is mediated by the 5'-3' exonuclease XRN1, as XRN1 knockdown results in longer transcripts. Interestingly, the authors do not observe a polyA-tail shortening, which is typically thought to precede decapping and XRN1-mediated transcript decay. Finally, the authors use G3BP1 knockout cells to demonstrate that stress granule formation is required for the observed transcript shortening.</p>
<p>The manuscript contains intriguing findings of interest to the mRNA decay community. That said, it appears that the authors at times overinterpret the data they get from a handful of direct RNA sequencing experiments. To bolster some of the statements additional experiments might be desirable.</p>
<p>A selection of comments:</p>
<p>(1) Considering that the authors compare the effects of stress, stress granule formation, and XRN1 loss on transcriptome profiles, it would be desirable to use a single-cell system (and validated in a few more). Most of the direct RNAseq is performed in HeLa cells, but the experiments showing that stress granule formation is required come from U2OS cells, while short RNAseq data showing loss of coverage on mRNA 5'ends is reanalyzed from HEK293 cells. It may be plausible that the same pathways operate in all those cells, but it is not rigorously demonstrated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that performing all experiments in a single cell system would be desirable. Presently, our core findings on 5’ RNA shortening are all performed in HeLa cells: the identification of 5’ RNA shortening, the reliance of shortening through XRN1 silencing, suppression of shortening by translation inhibition, and now the relationship between 5’ shortening and deadenylation/decapping through experiments described further below. Our use of other cell lines is primarily to show that 5’ shortening is a general phenomenon, and we have now done this for U20S cells, HEK293 cells, and primary 3T3 cells from mouse.</p>
<p>Regarding stress granule formation, we are unfortunately restricted by the lack of available wellcharacterized resources. The DDG3BP1/2 U2OS is a well characterized cell line that has been extensively used for stress granule-related experiments. We have therefore opted to use it and performed experiments to verify both the occurrence of stress-induced RNA shortening as well as the rescue in the absence of stress granules. The reproducibility and breadth of the cell lines used in our analysis makes us confident on the generality of our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) An interesting finding of the manuscript is that polyA tail shortening is not observed prior to transcript shortening. The authors would need to demonstrate that their approach is capable of detecting shortened polyA tails. Using polyA purified RNA to look at the status of polyA tail length may not be ideal (as avidity to oligodT beads may increase with polyA tail length and therefore the authors bias themselves to longer tails anyway). At the very least, the use of positive controls would be desirable; e.g. knockdown of CCR4/NOT.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. Previous studies, using in vitro transcribed RNA molecules, have shown that direct RNA sequencing can capture and quantify poly(A) tails of varying lengths (Krause et al. 2019). Specifically, a range of 10 to 150 nt has been tested and a high concordance between known and dRNA-Seq determined values was observed. Both tailfindR and nanopolish (used in this work) showed high poly(A) tail estimation accuracy.</p>
<p>Regardless, we agree with the reviewer that our method depends on poly(A) tail capture and thus may be incomplete for fully quantifying poly(A) length changes. We therefore opted to replace these data and instead follow this and other reviewers’ suggestions and perform experiments following knockdown of CCR4/NOT using cells expressing a catalytically inactive CNOT8 (CNOT8*) dominant negative mutant (Chang et al. 2019). Our new data show that stress-induced 5’ end decay is indeed not dependent on prior removal of the poly(A) tail. Specifically, we find that transcript shortening is still observed upon oxidative stress in cells expressing CNOT8* compared to control cells. We present these new results in Fig. 3 and Sup. Fig 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors use a strategy of ligating an adapter to 5' phosphorylated RNA (presumably the breakdown fragments) to be able to distinguish true mRNA fragments from artifacts of abortive nanopore sequencing. This is a fantastic approach to curating a clean dataset. Unfortunately, the authors don't appear to go through with discarding fragments that are not adapter-ligated (presumably to increase the depth of analysis; they do offer Figure 1e that shows similar changes in transcript length for fragments with adapter, compared to Figure 1d). It would be good to know how many reads in total had the adapter. Furthermore, it would be good to know what percentage of reads without adapters are products of abortive sequencing. What percentage of reads had 5'OH ends (could be answered by ligating a different adapter to kinasetreated transcripts). More read curation would also be desirable when building the metagene analysis - why do the authors include every 3'end of sequenced reads (their RNA purification scheme requires a polyA tail, so non-polyadenylated fragments are recovered in a nonquantitative manner and should be discarded).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating our approach. The reviewer is correct that we do not discard reads that are not adapter-ligated. As the reviewer correctly mentions this is to increase the sequencing depth. We have found that the ligation efficiency is very low, ~1-2 % of total reads (now in Sup. Table. 1), across all libraries, and so the percentage of REL5-ligated reads does not directly infer the total amount of non-artifactual 5’ ends. Instead, we use these REL5ligated reads as a subset of our data for which we have extremely high confidence in the true 5’end. Our results show that non-ligated reads display the same length distribution as ligated ones, and that the results are reproducible regardless of read selection (e.g. Fig. 1c, e, Sup. Fig. 1k, l, Fig. 3b, c). This strong concordance between REL5-ligated and non-ligated reads suggests that our conclusions on 5’ end shortening are not substantially influenced by abortive sequencing or other artefactual creation of 5’ shortening. We have modified the text to clarify these points and have added plots using only ligated molecules for relevant figures that this was not previously done (Sup. Fig 1l, 3c)</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that non-polyadenylated reads could be discarded from metagene analysis and we have performed this change in the revised version. Our conclusions following removal of non-polyadenylated reads remain unchanged (Sup. Fig. 1g).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors should come to a clear conclusion about what &quot;transcript shortening&quot; means. Is it exonucleolytic shortening from the 5'end? They cannot say much about the 3'ends anyway (see above). Or are we talking about endonucleolytic cuts leaving 5'P that then can be attached by XRN1 (again, what is the ratio of 5'P and 5'OH fragments; also, what is the ratio of shortened to full-length RNA)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have performed additional experiments to investigate the role of deadenylation and decapping by expressing dominant negative forms of the NOT8 deadenylase (NOT8*) and DCP2 decapping (DCP2*) enzyme in HeLa cells. Our results show that neither expression of NOT8* nor DCP2* can inhibit stress-induced transcript shortening following arsenite treatment (Fig. 3e-f). These new data suggest that neither deadenylation nor decapping are required for stress-induced RNA decay. Instead, our data are more compatible with endonucleolytic cleavage as the most likely mechanism for stressinduced RNA decay. We have incorporated these results in the text and present them in Fig. 3 and Sup. Fig. 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors should clearly explain how they think the transcript shortening comes about. They claim it does not need polyA shortening, but then do not explain where the XRN1 substrate comes from. Does their effect require decapping? Or endonucleolytic attacks?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please also refer to our answer to the previous comment (#4). Collectively, our results from a) the dominant negative expression of NOT8* and DCP2* that show no effect on stress-induced shortening and b) the rescue of transcript length upon translation initiation inhibition, indicate a potential endonucleolytic mechanism as a mediator of stress-induced RNA decay. However, we believe that extensive, further studies currently beyond the scope of this work, will be required to discover the nuclease and to dissect the exact molecular mechanisms that define the 5' ends of mRNAs upon stress-induced decay. We now discuss these points in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) XRN1 KD results in lengthened transcripts. That is not surprising as XRN1 is an exonuclease - and XRN1 does not merely rescue arsenite stress-mediated transcript shortening, but results in a dramatic transcript lengthening.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an intriguing point. Additional analysis of data has showed that in fact, in unstressed cells, XRN1 KD leads to modestly significant reduction in overall transcript length (Fig. 3b, c). This could possibly be the result of an accumulation of intermediate cleavage products normally expected to be degraded by XRN1 as previously described (Pelechano, Wei, and Steinmetz 2015; Ibrahim et al. 2018).</p>
<p>Instead, we find that under stress, XRN1 KD shows an almost identical transcript length distribution to unstressed cells and significantly higher than siCTRL stressed cells (Fig. 3b, c). These results indicate that in the absence of XRN1, stress-induced decay is largely abolished. As the reviewer correctly points out, this seems to affect the majority of RNAs which we believe is evidence of the general lack of specificity in the mechanism. Nevertheless, we find that transcripts that are the primary substrates to stress-induced shortening are substantially more lengthened than all other transcripts (Fig. 3e). This indicates that transcripts primarily affected by stress-induced decay are also lengthened the most in the absence of XRN1 and at an even higher level than expected by general XRN1 KD effects.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The work by Dar et al. examines RNA metabolism under cellular stress, focusing on stressgranule-dependent RNA decay. It employs direct RNA sequencing with a Nanopore-based method, revealing that cellular stress induces prevalent 5' end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy but is independent of the shortening of the poly(A) tail. This decay, however, is dependent on XRN1 and enriched in the stress granule transcriptome. Notably, inhibiting stress granule formation in G3BP1/2-null cells restores the RNA length to the same level as wild-type. It suppresses stress-induced decay, identifying RNA decay as a critical determinant of RNA metabolism during cellular stress and highlighting its dependence on stress-granule formation.</p>
<p>This is an exciting and novel discovery. I am not an expert in sequencing technologies or sequencing data analysis, so I will limit my comments purely to biology and not technical points. The PI is a leader in applying innovative sequencing methods to studying mRNA decay.</p>
<p>One aspect that appeared overlooked is that poly(A) tail shortening per se does lead to decapping. It is shortening below a certain threshold of 8-10 As that triggers decapping. Therefore, I found the conclusion that poly(A) tail shortening is not required for stress-induced decay to be somewhat premature. For a robust test of this hypothesis, the authors should consider performing their analysis in conditions where CNOT7/8 is knocked down with siRNA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. We have now performed experiments in cells expressing a well characterized catalytically inactive dominant negative NOT8 isoform (NOT8*) (Chang et al.</p>
<p>2019). Our new data show that stress-induced decay still occurs in cells expressing NOT8*.</p>
<p>These results confirm our findings that stress-induced decay does not require deadenylation. We present these new results in Fig. 3 and Sup. Fig. 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly, as XRN1 requires decapping to take place, it necessitates the experiment where a dominant-negative DCP2 mutant is over-expressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and have performed this experiment as requested. Expression of a dominant negative DCP2 (DCP2*) isoform (Loh, Jonas, and Izaurralde 2013) in HeLa cells showed that decapping is also not required for stress-induced decay. We present these new results in Fig. 3 and Sup. Fig. 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Are G3BP1/2 stress granules required for stress-induced decay or simply sites for storage? This part seems unclear. A very worthwhile test here would be to assess in XRN1-null background.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. Our data show that stress-induced decay is not observed in DDG3BP1/2 U2OS cells, unable to form stress granules (Fig. 6). This result suggests that G3BP1/2 SGs are either a) required for 5’ RNA shortening or b) preserve partially fragmented RNAs that would otherwise be rapidly degraded. We find the second option unlikely for two reasons. First, even if the fragments were rapidly degraded, we would still expect to find evidence of their presence in our data. However, Fig. 6f shows that the length distribution of DDG3BP1/2 U2OS cells, with and without arsenite, are almost identical, thus arguing against the presence of such a pool of rapidly degrading RNAs. Second, if these RNAs were protected by SGs, then they would be expected to be downregulated in the absence of SGs in DDG3BP1/2 U2OS cells treated with arsenite. Our results contradict this hypothesis as no association is found between the level of downregulation in arsenite-treated DDG3BP1/2 U2OS cells and the observed stress-induced fragmentation in WT. Collectively our results point towards G3BP1/2 stress granules being required for stress-induced decay. We have expanded on these points in the manuscript to clarify.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, the authors speculate that the mechanism of stress-induced decay may have evolved to relieve translational load during stress. But why degrade the 5' end when removing the cap may be sufficient? This returns to the question of assessing the role of decapping in this mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises a very interesting point. Our new results, following expression of dominant negative DCP2, show that stress-induced decay does not require decapping. It is therefore plausible that a stress-induced co-translational mechanism cleaves mRNAs endonucleolyticaly to reduce the translational load. Such a mechanism would have many functional benefits as it would acutely reduce the translational load, degrade non-essential RNAs, preserve energy and release ribosomes for translation of the stress response program. We have expanded the discussion to mention these points.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>As you can see from the comments, although the reviewers appreciate the novelty of your findings, there was a consensus opinion from all reviewers that the authors overinterpreted their data, since they only have one assay and did not fully analyze it, as laid out in one of the reviewer's critiques. Some orthogonal validation of the &quot;groundbreaking&quot; claims is necessary. Examination of the effects of upstream events in 5'-to-3' decay, namely deadenylation, and decapping, would be necessary for a better understanding of the phenomena the authors describe. Many tools and approaches for studying this are described well in the literature (CNOT7-KD, dominant negative DCP2 E148Q, XRN1-null cell lines), so it is well within the authors' reach. Overall, while some of the evidence presented is novel and solid, for some of the claims there is only incomplete evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers and the editor for their comments and suggestions. We have performed several additional experiments to further support our conclusions. We have notably investigated the role of deadenylation and decapping in the stress-induced decay by expressing dominant negative NOT8 and DCP2, respectively, as suggested. Our results show that neither deadenylation nor decapping is necessary for stress-induced transcript shortening, suggesting an endonucleolytic event. We believe that these additional experiments strengthen the main conclusions of our work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The experiments were conducted in two unrelated cell lines, HeLa and U2OS. The authors should determine if the 5'end RNA decay in response to stress is also observed in normal human cells such as normal human diploid fibroblasts. Furthermore, it would be important to know if this mechanism is conserved between human and mouse cells. This can be tested in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have now also performed experiments in the mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH 3T3 cell line. Our new results confirm that stress-induced 5’ end RNA decay is also observed in this primary cell line and is conserved between human and mouse (Sup. Fig. 1k, I).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors state that they monitored cell viability up to 24 hours after Arsenite treatment, but the data is shown up to 240 min (Suppl. 1a). Also, the Y-axis label of this Figure is &quot;Active cells (%)&quot;. This should be changed to &quot;Live cells (%)&quot; if this is what they are referring to.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for identifying this mistake. Cell viability was monitored up to 4 hours after arsenite treatment. We have corrected the text and modified the figure according to the reviewer’s suggestion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Based on direct Nanopore-based RNA-seq the authors surprisingly found that RNAs in oxidative stress were globally shorter than unstressed cells. Since Nanopore-based RNA-seq will not detect RNAs that lack a poly A-tail, are they not missing out on RNAs that have already started getting degraded due to the loss of a poly A-tail? Also, I am not sure if they used a spikein control which would be critical to claim global changes in RNA expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that our strategy does not capture RNA molecules without a poly(A) tail. Nevertheless, our data do identify shortening upon stress at the 5’ end of RNAs that include poly(A) tails. We considered this as direct evidence that decay at the 5’ end does not require prior removal of the poly(A) tail. Otherwise, these molecules would not have been captured and observed. Indeed, our newly added data from cells expressing a well characterized catalytically inactive dominant negative NOT8 isoform (Chang et al. 2019) show that stress-induced decay occurs even upon silencing of the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex. We present these results in Fig. 3 and Sup. Fig 3.</p>
<p>We would like to clarify that in our results we did not use a spike-in control and thus refrain from claiming global changes in RNA expression. Instead, we compare relative ratios of groups of molecules within libraries that are internally normalized, we perform correlative comparisons that are invariant to normalization and we perform differential gene expression using established normalization schemes such as DESeq2 (Love, Huber, and Anders 2014).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Many graphs are confusing and inconsistent. For example, samples for Nanopore RNA-seq were prepared in triplicates. Biological or technical? The schematic in Figure 1a shows ISRIB but it appears from Figure 4 onwards. It is missing in the Figure 1 results and the Figure legend. The X-axis labels of many graphs are confusing. For example, Supplementary Figure 1d, 1e, 1g and 1h. It says transcript length but are these nucleotides? P-values are missing from many of these graphs. For some graphs, the authors compared Unstressed vs Arsenite (Figure 1), but in other panels they state No Ars vs 0.5 mM Ars (Fig. 3a) or Control vs Ars (Figure 5c). Likewise, in Figure 1b, Expression change (log2) is unstressed vs Arsenite or Arsenite vs unstressed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer identifying these inconsistencies in the presentation of our results. The replicates for nanopore RNA-seq experiments were biological. We have now clarified this point in the text. Furthermore, we have removed “ISRIB” from Fig. 1a to avoid any confusion. We have also made our labelling across all figures more consistent using ‘unstressed’ for NO arsenite treatment vs “arsenite” or ‘+ Ars’ for arsenite treatment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors transfected cells with siCTRL or siXRN1 using electroporation and treated the cells 72 hours after transfection. Since XRN1 is an essential gene, it would be important to determine the viability of cells 72 hours after transfection. Along these lines, in Figure 3b, it would be important to determine the effect of XRN1 knockdown in unstressed cells. Currently, there are only 3 comparisons in Figure 3b - unstressed, siCTRL + Ars and siXRN1 + Ars, and this is insufficient to conclude the effects of XRN1 knockdown in the presence of Arsenite.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have updated Fig. 3b and the text to show the requested conditions: siCTRL and siXRN1 with and without arsenite. While XRN2 is an essential gene for many organisms, XRN1 is not essential in mammalian cells and no increased cell death has been reported for XRN1-KO or –KD cells (Brothers et al. 2023). We have also tested different concentration (up to 40 nM) of siRNA and monitored the cells up to five days after transfection without observing any cell toxicity, as previously reported.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) More broadly, the whole study is somewhat descriptive. The biological effect of 5'end mRNA shortening on gene expression is unclear. There is no data indicating how these changes in RNA lengths impact protein expression. Global quantitative proteomics would be critical to determine this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. To address this concern we have performed additional experiments using cells expressing catalytically inactive forms of NOT8 (Chang et al. 2019) and DCP2 (Loh, Jonas, and Izaurralde 2013) to inhibit deadenylation and decapping.</p>
<p>These experiments provide additional mechanistic details for 5’ shortening and suggest endonucleolytic cleavage as a critical step (Fig. 3 and Sup. Fig. 3). We agree that it would be interesting to study the fate of these shortened transcripts notably regarding translation. However, given the complexity of the expected proteome changes also following global translation arrest under stress (Harding et al., 2003; Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016), we think that this work is beyond the scope of this manuscript and will be the subject of future studies.</p>

<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>(1) Some of the affected RNAs can be validated in HeLa and other cell lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have performed RT-qPCR on 3 different mRNAs that present 5’ shortening upon oxidative stress using different primers located along the mRNA. We hypothesized that the closer the primer set is located to the 5’ end, the less abundant the corresponding region would be for arsenite-treated compared to untreated cells. Our results show indeed that the measured level of these mRNAs depends on the location of the primer sets used for the qPCR, the closer to the 5’end it is, the less abundant the mRNA is upon oxidative stress compared to control cells. We present these data as well as a schematic representing the positions of the primers in Sup. Fig. 2d.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors should check whether XRN1 also co-localizes in SGs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have performed immunofluorescence on U2OS and HeLa upon oxidative stress and did not observe a co-localization of XRN1 with TIA-1, a marker of stress granules (see below). These results are consistent with (Kedersha et al. 2005) that have shown that XRN1 mainly co-localizes to processing bodies and are very weakly detectable in SGs in DU145 cells. We think that this result is beyond the scope of this study and thus decided to only include it for the reviewers.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Our results show that our XRN1 KD specifically rescues the length of the most shortened mRNAs (Fig. 3e). This is a highly specific effect that makes us confident it is not mediated by non-specific siRNA binding; thus, we do not consider it necessary to repeat the experiment.</p>
