<title>Abstract</title><p>The role of beta band activity in cortico-basal ganglia interactions during motor control has been studied extensively in resting-state and for simple movements, such as button pressing. However, little is known about how beta oscillations change and interact in more complex situations involving rapid changes of movement in various contexts.</p>
<p>To close this knowledge gap, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and local field potential recordings from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinson’s disease patients to study beta dynamics during initiation, stopping, and rapid reversal of rotational movements. The action prompts were manipulated to be predictable vs. unpredictable.</p>
<p>We observed movement-related beta suppression at motor sequence start, and a beta rebound after motor sequence stop in STN power, motor cortical power, and STN-cortex coherence. Despite involving a brief stop of movement, no clear rebound was observed during reversals of turning direction. On the cortical level, beta power decreased bilaterally following reversals, but more so in the hemisphere ipsilateral to movement, due to a floor effect on the contralateral side. In the STN, power modulations varied across patients, with patients revealing brief increases or decreases of high-beta power. Importantly, cue predictability affected these modulations. Event-related changes of STN-cortex beta coherence were generally stronger in the unpredictable than in the predictable condition.</p>
<p>In summary, this study reveals the influence of movement context on beta oscillations in basal ganglia-cortex loops when humans change ongoing movements according to external cues. We find that movement scenarios requiring higher levels of caution involve enhanced modulations of subthalamo-cortical beta synchronization. Further, our results confirm that beta oscillations reflect the start and end of motor sequences better than movement changes within a sequence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Beta oscillations within cortical sensorimotor areas and the basal ganglia have been proposed to play a role in movement initiation, termination, and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aron &amp; Poldrack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jurkiewicz, Gaetz, Bostan, &amp; Cheyne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">J. R. Wessel, 2020</xref>). Altered beta band activity has been strongly linked to motor impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD), demonstrating its relevance to proper motor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cassidy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tinkhauser et al., 2017</xref>). The beta rhythm is often interpreted as reflecting the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Engel &amp; Fries, 2010</xref>), that is, active maintenance or stabilization of current motor or cognitive output to attenuate alternatives and distractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Espenhahn, de Berker, van Wijk, Rossiter, &amp; Ward, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fischer et al., 2019</xref>). The basal ganglia keep cortex under inhibitory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bonnevie &amp; Zaghloul, 2018</xref>) which, similarly to releasing a break in a car, must be removed to change the current motor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alegre et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Starting and stopping of movement have mostly been studied with variations of the Stop Signal Task and the Go/No-Go Task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alegre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aron &amp; Poldrack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ray et al., 2012</xref>) that require participants to perform simple, ballistic movements and inhibit them occasionally. Shortly before and during movement, beta oscillations are suppressed (beta suppression), reflecting a task-related active state of the motor network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jurkiewicz et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, beta power transiently increases above baseline levels after movement termination (beta rebound) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fonken et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ray et al., 2012</xref>), indicating inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Salmelin, Hämäläinen, Kajola, &amp; Hari, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Schmidt &amp; Berke, 2017</xref>) and motor adaptation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Struber, Baumont, Barraud, Nougier, &amp; Cignetti, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, whether these modulations are causally involved in motor control is still under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pfurtscheller, Neuper, Brunner, &amp; da Silva, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Toledo, Manzano, Barela, &amp; Kohn, 2016</xref>). Inhibitory processes have been associated with increased beta power or reduced suppression thereof in prefrontal cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Swann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wagner, Wessel, Ghahremani, &amp; Aron, 2018</xref>), and in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bastin et al., 2014</xref>), with some studies reporting correlations with inhibitory success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">W. Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Besides playing a critical role in stopping movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mosher, Mamelak, Malekmohammadi, Pouratian, &amp; Rutishauser, 2021</xref>), the STN seems to be involved in delaying or pausing movement until sufficient evidence in favor of a motor program has accumulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ray et al., 2012</xref>). Recent evidence demonstrated that the STN is recruited by the prefrontal cortex via the hyperdirect pathway to implement its pausing function (W. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lofredi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oswal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">J. R. Wessel, Waller, &amp; Greenlee, 2019</xref>). However, the role of cortico-subcortical beta synchronization in coordinating movements that are already ongoing remains elusive.</p>
<p>Communication between STN and cortex might become particularly important in tasks involving cognitive factors, such as anticipation. STN beta power has been found to index task complexity and behavioral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Oswal et al., 2013</xref>), proactive inhibition and planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benis et al., 2014</xref>), non-motor decision making, and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zavala, Jang, &amp; Zaghloul, 2017</xref>), and cue evaluation with respect to behavioral goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Oswal, Litvak, Sauleau, &amp; Brown, 2012</xref>). Yet, the extent to which modulation of beta oscillations in basal-ganglia cortex networks depends on expectation remains unknown.</p>
<p>In the present study, we address these research gaps with a paradigm that involves a rotational movement performed in a continuous fashion with occasional rapid changes in movement direction (reversals), as well as movement initiations and terminations. Accounting for the relevance of basal ganglia-cortical loops in motor control, we recorded cortical and STN oscillatory activity simultaneously in PD patients who had undergone implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes the day before. Patients performed the rotational movements according to visual instructions which were manipulated such that their identity and time of appearance was either predictable or unpredictable. With this design, we aimed 1) to investigate the dynamics of STN and STN-cortex beta synchronization during movement reversal compared to those of starting and stopping and 2) to assess the effect of the temporal predictability of movement instructions on the coordination of beta synchronization for starting, stopping, and reversing.</p>

<title>Effect of predictability on behavior</title>
<p>Patients turned a wheel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) with their index finger at their preferred speed and were prompted by visual cues to start, reverse, or stop rotational movement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) while we simultaneously measured MEG and STN local field potentials (LFPs). We considered an average of 60.1 (SD = 14.8) predictable start trials, 59.3 (SD = 17.8) unpredictable start trials, 59.9 (SD = 14.2) predictable reversal trials, 58.6 (SD = 15.5) unpredictable reversal trials, 61.3 (SD = 15.3) predictable stop trials and 60.2 (SD = 17.4) unpredictable stop trials per patient for analysis. To assess whether the predictability of movement prompts had an effect on behavior, we analyzed its effect on movement speed and reaction times. Angular speed changes in start, reversal, and stop trials were similar in the predictable and the unpredictable condition when the data was aligned to action onset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>cond</sub>(1,19) = 0.039, <italic>p</italic><sub>cond</sub> = 0.846; see <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary File 1</xref> for the complete results of the ANOVA). Aligning trials to cue onsets revealed that starting and stopping occurred slightly later in the unpredictable condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). This was reflected by a main effect of <italic>condition</italic> (<italic>F</italic><sub>cond</sub>(1,19) = 7.425, <italic>p</italic><sub>cond</sub> = 0.013) and a <italic>condition*movement type</italic> interaction effect (<italic>F</italic><sub>cond*mov</sub>(2,18) = 5.347, <italic>p</italic><sub>cond*mov</sub> = 0.015) on reaction times. Post-hoc <italic>t</italic>-tests revealed that reaction times to predictable start cues (<italic>M</italic> = .757, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.154) and stop cues (<italic>M</italic> = .824, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.202) were significantly shorter than reaction times to unpredictable start (<italic>M</italic> = .840, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.160) and stop (<italic>M</italic> = .889, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.233) cues (start: <italic>t</italic> = -3.469, one-sided <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, stop: <italic>t</italic> = -2.213, one-sided <italic>p</italic> = 0.020). Thus, starting and stopping were not performed at different speeds across conditions, but were initialized earlier in the predictable condition.</p>

<title>Modulations of spectral power associated with starting and stopping</title>
<p>In order to assess whether beta power modulations associated with reversals were distinct from beta suppression and rebound (research aim 1), we centered the trials on movement initiation, reversal, and termination, respectively, and assessed beta power dynamics. Besides the STN, this was done for two motor cortical regions of interest (ROIs): primary motor cortex (M1, hand knob region) and medial sensorimotor cortex (MSMC). This choice was based on the strongest movement-related modulations of beta power and coherence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, see Regions of interest in the Methods section for further detail). For comparison, we also present group average time-frequency spectra for the gamma frequency band.</p>

<p>As expected, starting to turn the wheel was associated with a prominent beta suppression (contralateral STN: <italic>t</italic><sub>clustersum</sub> = -2128.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; ipsilateral STN: <italic>t</italic><sub>clustersum</sub> = -2062.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; contralateral M1: <italic>t</italic><sub>clustersum</sub> = -8434.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, ipsilateral M1: <italic>t</italic><sub>clustersum</sub> = -8199.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), whereas stopping resulted in a beta rebound (contralateral STN: <italic>t</italic><sub>clustersum</sub> = 2843.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; ipsilateral STN: <italic>t</italic><sub>clustersum</sub> = 1488.8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003; contralateral M1: <italic>t</italic><sub>clustersum</sub> = 5958.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, ipsilateral M1: <italic>t</italic><sub>clustersum</sub> = 3834.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in both motor cortex and STN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). The beta suppression occurred bilaterally while the beta rebound was more lateralized to the hemisphere contralateral to movement, as corroborated by a statistical analysis of the lateralization index (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary File 2</xref>). Power changes in MSMC were generally similar to those in M1. Significant increases in gamma power at movement start were only observed in the contralateral STN (<italic>t</italic><sub>clustersum</sub> = 2216.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). At movement stop, there was a decrease in gamma power in contralateral STN (<italic>t</italic><sub>clustersum</sub> = -734.8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.016, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) and contralateral M1 (<italic>t</italic><sub>clustersum</sub> = -1447.4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). However, changes in gamma power were overall much smaller in magnitude compared to the beta suppression and rebound.</p>

<title>Modulation of STN spectral power associated with reversals</title>
<p>Modulations of beta oscillations associated with reversals of movement direction were of particular interest to this study (research aim 1). When reversing, one first needs to stop the ongoing movement before accelerating again in the opposite direction. Stopping is followed by the beta rebound whereas starting is preceded by beta suppression. To the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the neural signals underlying acceleration that immediately follows stopping. In the STN, reversals were associated with a brief modulation of beta power, which was weak when averaged across patients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Reversal-related beta power modulations of individual patients were variable. Some patients revealed brief increases whereas others showed decreases of STN beta power upon reaching the turning point (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Reversal-related increases of beta power differed from the beta rebound, as occurring after termination of the movement sequence, with respect to amplitude and spectral content, often lacking the low-beta component of the beta rebound (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). These findings demonstrate distinct processing of brief pauses of action vs. a complete halt of action.</p>

<title>Modulation of cortical beta power associated with reversals</title>
<p>With respect to cortical beta power dynamics during reversals (research aim 1), we observed that reversals were associated with a brief suppression of alpha and beta power in motor cortex, particularly in M1 (contralateral M1: <italic>t</italic><sub>clustersum</sub> = -1492.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; ipsilateral M1: <italic>t</italic><sub>clustersum</sub> = -3326.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). The suppression occurred after the turning point had been reached (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) and was stronger in the hemisphere ipsilateral to movement, as demonstrated by a significant <italic>ROI*movement</italic> interaction effect on baseline-corrected beta power (<italic>F</italic><sub>ROI*movement</sub>(10,9) = 5.711, <italic>p</italic><sub>ROI*modulation</sub> = 0.008, refer to <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary File 3</xref> for the full results of the ANOVA). Post-hoc <italic>t</italic>-tests confirmed that beta power was at a lower level in ipsilateral M1 (<italic>M</italic> = -0.47, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.33) compared to contralateral M1 (<italic>M</italic> = -0.21, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.23) during reversal of movement direction (<italic>t</italic> = 4.454, one-sided <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>To test whether the ipsilateral lateralization was related to pre-event baseline (i.e., pre-reversal, pre-start, and pre-stop) levels, we re-computed the modulations using a whole recording average baseline (power averaged over all time points and movement types), thereby omitting the pre-vs. post-event contrast. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> illustrates that movement-related power modulations were generally stronger in the hemisphere contralateral to movement, with the exception of acceleration, which was associated with bilateral suppression of beta power (compare the bilateral beta power suppression at <italic>post-start</italic> and <italic>post-reversal</italic> to the contralateral beta power modulations in all other plots). The second before reversing, beta-power was at an intermediate level in the hemisphere ipsilateral to movement (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Thus, we observed a suppression relative to the pre-event baseline (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a-b</xref>). In the contralateral hemisphere, in contrast, beta power could not be suppressed much further because it was already close to floor level prior to reversing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). The lack of a pre-reversal increase of beta power is remarkable, because the second prior to reversing contained the deacceleration of the moving hand, which does not appear to involve an increase of beta power in primary motor cortex.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates that initiating, reversing, and stopping a continuous movement involves modulation of local and long-range beta synchronization in basal ganglia-cortex loops. Accelerating, stopping briefly, and coming to a complete halt have distinct and region-specific effects on beta oscillations in the motor system. These effects are context-dependent, with modulations of subcortico-cortical coupling intensifying when the upcoming movement instructions cannot be anticipated.</p>

<title>The dynamics of STN-cortex coherence</title>
<p>Simultaneous measurements of subthalamic and cortical oscillations in a comparably complex motor task allowed us to study the context-dependent dynamics of STN-cortex coupling. STN-M1 and STN-MSMC beta coherence decreased at movement initiation and increased after movement termination, while gamma coherence increased at movement start, corresponding to similar power changes in STN and motor cortex. A pre-movement suppression of beta coherence has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cassidy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Talakoub et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">van Wijk et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, increases in gamma coherence have been found for the performance of ballistic movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alegre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Litvak et al., 2012</xref>). Stopping a planned movement has been found to be linked with reduced suppression of beta coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alegre et al., 2013</xref>), but a post-movement increase of coherence has thus far only been described for ballistic movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). Considering the timing of the increase observed here, the STN’s role in movement inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ray et al., 2012</xref>) and the fact that frontal and prefrontal cortical areas are believed to drive subthalamic beta activity via the hyperdirect pathway (W. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oswal et al., 2021</xref>), it seems plausible that the increase of beta coherence reflects feedback of sensorimotor cortex to the STN in the course of post-movement processing.</p>

<title>STN-cortex coherence and beta suppression are modulated by predictability</title>
<p>In the present paradigm, patients were presented with cues that were either temporally predictable or unpredictable. We found that unpredictable movement prompts were associated with stronger modulations of STN-cortex beta coherence, likely reflecting the patients adopting a more cautious approach, paying greater attention to instructive cues. Enhanced STN-cortex synchronization might thus indicate the recruitment of additional neural resources, which might have allowed patients to maintain the same movement speed in both conditions.</p>
<p>The notion of beta oscillations reflecting motor and cognitive processes such as action selection, clearing, and error-monitoring has gained growing support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fonken et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Turner &amp; Desmurget, 2010</xref>). Purely cognitive inhibition processes, such as inhibition of thoughts, have been found to be associated with prefrontal beta power modulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Castiglione, Wagner, Anderson, &amp; Aron, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>). Further, the STN has been suggested to implement its <italic>hold your horses</italic> function, reflected by beta-band synchronization, in situations of cognitive conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brittain et al., 2012</xref>). Simultaneous measurements of MEG and STN LFPs revealed that STN-cortex beta coherence increases after conflict cues in an expanded judgement task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Patai et al., 2022</xref>). Though the present paradigm did not involve any conflict as such, the context of unpredictable movement instructions possibly engaged similar cognitive processes in response to surprise/uncertainty.</p>
<p>With respect to power, we observed reduced beta suppression in the unpredictable condition at movement start, likely demonstrating a lower level of motor preparation. This finding aligns with MEG research that found reduced beta suppression with enhanced uncertainty in a motor task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tzagarakis, Ince, Leuthold, &amp; Pellizzer, 2010</xref>), and findings from an EEG study that demonstrated reduced beta suppression in response to an unpredictable sequence of rhythmic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alegre et al., 2003</xref>). Although previous research has reported modulations of the beta rebound by cognitive factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fischer, Tan, Pogosyan, &amp; Brown, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tan, Wade, &amp; Brown, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zavala et al., 2018</xref>), we did not find an effect of predictability on the beta power rebound here.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Acceleration involves the recruitment of ipsilateral M1</title>
<p>As expected, we found sustained beta suppression at movement start and a strong beta power rebound at movement stop in STN, M1, and MSMC. During reversals, beta power was suppressed briefly in M1, particularly in the ipsilateral hemisphere where beta was not fully desynchronized prior to reversing. In contrast, the contralateral hemisphere revealed a floor effect: the ongoing movement resulted in more persistent beta power suppression that was only slightly intensified when reversing. Bilateral modulation of beta power, as reported during reversals, was otherwise observed during the initiation of movement, but not during ongoing movement or after movement termination, suggesting that the recruitment of ipsilateral M1 may be selective to acceleration.</p>
<p>Our findings are consistent with prior studies that have demonstrated a bilateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alegre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zaepffel, Trachel, Kilavik, &amp; Brochier, 2013</xref>) and spatially diffuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jurkiewicz et al., 2006</xref>) beta suppression, and more focal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jurkiewicz et al., 2006</xref>) and predominantly contralateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Espenhahn et al., 2017</xref>) topography of the beta rebound. Further, past research has posited a role of ipsilateral motor cortex in motor control and preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jurkiewicz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Olson et al., 2022</xref>). Beta suppression in the ipsilateral hemisphere has been found to be related to increased corticospinal excitability, to facilitate finger movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rau, Plewnia, Hummel, &amp; Gerloff, 2003</xref>), and to have a role in higher order cortical processing of fine motor programs (R. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen, Gerloff, Hallett, &amp; Cohen, 1997</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Brief pauses and complete stops have distinct effects on beta oscillations</title>
<p>We did not find evidence of a beta rebound following the short pause of movement during reversals in motor cortex. Instead, we observed a transient broadband beta power suppression in cortex, which was likely related to re-acceleration in the opposite direction. In contrast, the STN exhibited increases of high beta power in some patients, compatible with post-processing of the brief pause of movement occurring during reversals. On an observational level, the spectral patterns of these increases did not entirely match the individual stop-related beta pattern, lacking the low-beta component of the beta rebound. Thus, STN low-beta oscillations might not re-emerge when stopping briefly within a movement sequence, corroborating a dissociation of low-and high-beta oscillations, as proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chandramouli, Iliana, &amp; Krishna, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oswal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Patai et al., 2022</xref>). Given that the beta rebound has been reported to slow reaction times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Muralidharan &amp; Aron, 2021</xref>) and to reduce corticospinal excitability (J. R. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wessel et al., 2016</xref>), and that beta power must decrease for movement to start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Heinrichs-Graham &amp; Wilson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Khanna &amp; Carmena, 2017</xref>), it is likely that at least the low-beta portion of the beta rebound needs to be avoided during changes of ongoing action because it would slow down re-acceleration otherwise.</p>
<p>In agreement with the current findings, previous research assessing STN-and cortical beta activity reported no beta rebound around the time a movement changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alegre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">London et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Oswal et al., 2016</xref>), except for one study, which did report a cortical beta rebound between two successive movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Muralidharan &amp; Aron, 2021</xref>). It should be noted, however, that the pauses were ∼1 to 2 s long. In our study, the beta rebound occurred only at the end of the movement sequence, when patients were already in the process of stopping and movement had already slowed. This picture emerged irrespective of whether power dynamics were analyzed in a movement-or cue-aligned fashion (see <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>). A causal role of the beta rebound in stopping is therefore implausible. More likely, the rebound serves as a post-movement feedback signal reflecting task-dependent contextual information used to either confirm or update motor plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alegre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cao &amp; Hu, 2016</xref>). Alternatively, it might indicate the clear-out of the entire motor program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>With respect to gamma activity, we observed increases in power at movement start in the contralateral STN and decreases in power at movement termination in contralateral STN and M1. While movement-related increases in gamma power are an established finding in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Litvak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lofredi et al., 2018</xref>), there appears to be no consensus on its functional role during movement stopping. Previous studies using auditory stop signals reported STN gamma power increases in response to stop signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ray et al., 2012</xref>). When assessed within a brief critical window between the stop signal and the average time of the upcoming finger tap, gamma power even correlated with stopping success, i.e. gamma was stronger when the downward movement was stopped earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, another study using visual stop signals reported decreased STN gamma power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alegre et al., 2013</xref>). We are unaware of studies that have assessed gamma power changes when stopping a continuous movement in response to visual cues and therefore provide first evidence for a decrease in this scenario, although we cannot rule out that focusing on different DBS contacts, or using auditory stop signals and shorter event-locked analyses windows might produce different results.</p>

<title>Limitations and future directions</title>
<p>In humans, invasive measurements of neuronal activity are only possible in patients undergoing surgery. While patients likely presented with pathologically changed oscillatory activity, we suggest that our approach at least approximates healthy brain functioning as patients were on their usual dopaminergic medication. Dopaminergic medication has been demonstrated to normalize power within the STN and globus pallidus internus, as well as STN-globus pallidus internus and STN-cortex coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hirschmann et al., 2013</xref>). Transferring our approach to patients with different disorders, e.g. dystonia or essential tremor, or examining healthy participants solely at the cortical level, could contribute to elucidating whether the synchronization dynamics reported here are indeed independent of PD.</p>
<p>Due to the diversity of modulations across patients, we cannot provide a general description of how the STN responds to reversals. The diversity may result from the fact that the exact recording site varied across patients, although all recording contacts were located in the dorsolateral STN. Further, stop-processes, mediated by the hyperdirect and the indirect pathway as well as cortico-striatal go-processes may emerge in the basal ganglia close in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Muralidharan, Aron, &amp; Schmidt, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Schmidt &amp; Berke, 2017</xref>), potentially overlapping. The sub-populations processing these signals in the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Isoda &amp; Hikosaka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Schmidt &amp; Berke, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schmidt, Leventhal, Mallet, Chen, &amp; Berke, 2013</xref>) might not be resolvable with macro-electrode LFP recordings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, we have revealed distinct local and long-range synchronization dynamics of motor cortex and STN during changes of ongoing action in different movement contexts. We found that stopping briefly in the course of changing movement direction and terminating a movement sequence have distinct oscillatory profiles. Moreover, movement scenarios that do not permit movement preparation and require higher levels of caution appear to involve enhanced levels of subthalamo-cortical beta synchronization, highlighting that long-range beta coherence plays an important role in coordinating movements in response to unpredictable events.</p>

DBS surgery was performed in two steps, and the measurements took place in between the implantation of the electrodes and the implantation of the pulse generator. Prior to participating, all patients provided their written informed consent in agreement with the declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf. The medication schedule was not changed for this experiment (Med ON state). Three participants were excluded from the analyses, two of whom were physically unable to perform the paradigm. The data of the third patient were contaminated by excessive artifacts.</p>

<title>Recordings</title>
<p>Measurements took place the day after the implantation of DBS electrodes. Externalization of leads allowed us to measure LFPs from the STN in combination with MEG. For LFP recordings, we used a mastoid reference and re-referenced the signals using a bipolar montage post-measurement. MEG signals were acquired simultaneously, using a 306-channel whole-head MEG system (VectorView, MEGIN). Muscle and ocular activity were monitored via electromyography (EMG) and vertical and horizontal electrooculography (EOG), respectively. EMG surface electrodes were placed on patients’ right and left forearms, referenced to the muscle tendons at the wrist. We first recorded 5 minutes of resting-state data, followed by the motor task, which lasted for about 32 minutes in total. During the task, patients were required to turn a wheel clockwise or counterclockwise, according to visual instructions presented on a screen in front of them.</p>

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>Patients were seated in the MEG scanner in a magnetically shielded room with a turning device (‘wheel’, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) placed on a table in front of them. The wheel (diameter = 14 cm, height = 6.5 cm) could be turned into both directions and had indentations, allowing comfortable placement of one index finger for turning. An MEG-compatible plastic fiber optic position sensor system (MR430 Series ZapFREE Fiber Optic Absolute Encoder System, MICRONER INC., Camarillo, CA, USA) was used to measure wheel turning. The absolute angular position was continuously measured and updated at a frequency of 1.2 kHz. Given its design, the sensing system did not introduce any magnetic interference.</p>
<p>Movement prompts were presented on a screen. The visual stimuli consisted of two curved arrows pointing either clockwise or counterclockwise, respectively, and a stop sign with white font on a red background (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Patients were instructed to turn the wheel with their index finger following the direction of the arrows and to stop when a stop cue appeared. We did not impose requirements on turning speed or body side, so that patients could use their less affected hand and adjust the speed to their individual motor capabilities.</p>
<p>The experiment was conducted in two distinct blocks, where stimuli differed in their order and timing of presentation. In the predictable condition, trials consisted of a blue arrow cueing the patients to start turning clockwise, followed by a cue to change the turning direction after 4 s, and a stop cue after another 4 s. Each trial was followed by a pause lasting for 4 s. The condition was termed <italic>predictable</italic>, as the fixed timing and the fixed order of cues allowed patients to easily predict and prepare what they had to do next and when. In the unpredictable condition, the start cue was either clockwise or counterclockwise and was followed by 0, 1, or 2 reversals before the stop cue appeared. Each alternative occurred equally often (33%: go, stop; 33%: go, reverse, stop; 33%: go, reverse, reverse, stop; clockwise and counterclockwise start directions were balanced). Additionally, the intervals between the visual stimuli were unpredictable (ranging between 4-7 s), with 50% of all inter-stimulus intervals kept at 4 s, as in the predictable condition. Hence, patients could not foresee the sequence and the timing of instructions, calling for a more cautious/attentive monitoring of cues.</p>
<p>We recorded two blocks per condition, with 36 trials each, in a pseudo-randomized fashion. To enhance compliance, we split each block in half, allowing for a short break, and also offered breaks between blocks.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using MATLAB R2019b (The Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) and the toolbox FieldTrip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Oostenveld, Fries, Maris, &amp; Schoffelen, 2011</xref>). For statistical testing, we used IBM SPSS Statistics 28 (IBM Corporation, Somers, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6e">
<title>Preprocessing</title>
<p>The data were visually inspected to identify and tag noisy channels and subsequently cleaned using temporal Signal Space Separation to remove artifacts originating from outside the MEG sensor array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Taulu &amp; Simola, 2006</xref>). Then, the data were downsampled to 500 Hz. We applied a high-pass finite impulse response filter with a cut-off frequency of 1 Hz to remove low-frequency drifts and screened the data for remaining artifacts.</p>
<p>We used custom MATLAB-scripts for semi-automated detection of movement start, reversal and stop in the wheel data. This was achieved by applying an event-specific combination of amplitude and duration thresholds to the first temporal derivative of the rotation angle measurements of the wheel. To ensure that events were correctly marked, all events were visually inspected and manually corrected if needed. Then, we epoched MEG and LFP data with respect to the behavioral events. Trials were centered around movement events of interest, i.e., start, stop, and reversal of movement and encompassed 4 s. Movement-aligned angular speed was calculated within those time-windows and averaged over trials. Reaction times to cues were defined as the time from cue presentation until movement.</p>

<title>LFP channel selection</title>
<p>The positions of DBS electrodes were localized with the MATLAB toolbox Lead-DBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Neudorfer et al., 2023</xref>) using the patients’ pre-operative T1-and T2-weighted MRIs (Magnetom Trio MRI scanner, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and postoperative CT scans (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). In order to select one LFP channel for each patient and hemisphere, we identified the bipolar LFP channel with the strongest beta suppression and beta rebound, as previous research has demonstrated the presence of these modulations in the dorsolateral motor STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benis et al., 2014</xref>; J. R. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wessel et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the source of subthalamic beta oscillations has been localized to the dorsal STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tamir et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6g">
<title>Regions of interest</title>
<p>Similarly, we selected cortical regions of interest (ROIs) by localizing the strongest event-related modulations of beta power/beta coherence. For source localization, we first co-registered the pre-operative T1-weighted MRI scans to the MEG coordinate system. Using the segmented MRIs, we prepared forward models based on single-shell realistic head models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nolte, 2003</xref>). Beamformer grids, specifying the position of sources, covered the entire brain and were aligned to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Subsequently, we applied <italic>Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gross et al., 2001</xref>) to beta-band LFP-MEG cross-spectral densities pooled across predictability conditions. Next, we computed contrasts between post-event (0 to 2 s) and pre-event (-2 to 0 s) beta power/coherence and averaged the absolute changes across patients and events (moment start, reversal, and stop). This served to identify the regions with the strongest change in general, irrespective of sign, event, and predictability condition.</p>
<p>The strongest beta power modulations localized to the hand knob area of primary motor cortex (M1; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) and the strongest changes in STN-cortex beta coherence to medial sensorimotor cortex (MSMC; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Thus, we focused our analysis on bilateral STN, M1 and MSMC. For time-frequency analysis, we represented each cortical ROI by the grid point of strongest modulation and its six nearest neighbors and extracted a time-series for each grid point, using a linearly constrained minimum variance spatial filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Van Veen &amp; Buckley, 1988</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6h">
<title>Time-frequency analyses</title>
<p>While our main focus was the beta band, we also included other frequencies in our time-frequency analyses to get a more complete picture of power coherence changes. Specifically, we considered the frequency ranges 5 to 45 Hz and 55 to 90 Hz, omitting the 50 Hz line noise artifact, and the time range from -1.6 to 1.6 s with respect to the movement event. Fourier spectra were computed using a multi-taper approach (4 Slepian tapers for the low frequency range and 7 Slepian tapers for the high frequency range), a window size of 800 ms and a step size of 50 ms. Using the Fourier coefficients, we computed power and STN-cortex across-trial coherence for each time-frequency bin.</p>
<p>For illustration, we applied baseline-correction, using the mean of the pre-event time window (-1.6 to 0 s) as baseline. In case of power, we expressed changes with respect to baseline in decibel. In case of coherence, we subtracted the baseline values. Time-frequency spectra of cortical sources were averaged over neighboring grid points belonging to the same ROI.</p>

<sec id="s6i">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Repeated measures analyses of (co)variance (rmANCOVA), implemented in SPSS, were our main tool for statistical analysis. This approach provides a comprehensive, multi-factorial analysis, but requires pre-selection of brain areas (see Regions of Interest), a frequency range and a time range of interest (see Power and coherence). The dependent variable was either the event-related change in power or coherence or the hemispheric lateralization of the event-related power change (see Lateralization). The main independent variable of interest was <italic>predictability</italic>. <italic>Brain area</italic> and <italic>movement type</italic> were also included as factors due to their clear effects on power and coherence, but their main effects are not reported in the main paper. They can be found in the Supplementary Material. Because Mauchly’s test indicated violations of the sphericity assumption we report results from the multivariate test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rasch, Friese, Hofmann, &amp; Neumann, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The rmANCOVAs were complemented by cluster-based permutation tests for detecting significant power/coherence modulations relative to baseline. These tests are mono-factorial, but have the advantage of not requiring any preselection of time or frequency ranges while providing correction for multiple comparisons. The cluster-defining and the cluster significance threshold was set to 0.05 (two-sided test). The cluster statistic was the sum of <italic>t</italic>-values within a cluster. We performed 1000 permutations per test.</p>

<title>Power and coherence</title>
<p>To assess the effect of predictability on power, we conducted a repeated measures ANCOVA testing the influence of the factors <italic>movement</italic> (start, stop, reversal), <italic>predictability</italic> (predictable, unpredictable) and <italic>brain area</italic> (STN, M1, MSMC, ipsilateral and contralateral to the moving hand), as well as interactions between these factors, on the event-related modulation of beta power. Here, modulation refers to the difference between post-event (0 -1.6 s) and pre-event (-1.6 - 0) beta power in decibel (dB). A similar rmANCOVA was computed for event-related modulations of STN-cortex beta coherence. In this case, we considered the difference between pre- and post-event coherence. Here, the factor <italic>brain area</italic> contained of the following pairs: contralateral M1-contralateral STN, contralateral MSMC-contralateral STN, ipsilateral M1-ipsilateral STN, ipsilateral MSMC-ipsilateral STN, with the terms ipsilateral and contralateral referring to the moving hand. Because beta power is known to correlate with movement speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lisi &amp; Morimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lofredi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pogosyan, Gaynor, Eusebio, &amp; Brown, 2009</xref>), we added turning speed, averaged over trials and timepoints, as a covariate.</p>

<sec id="s6k">
<title>Lateralization</title>
<p>We compared the beta power suppression and the beta power rebound with respect to their hemispheric lateralization, using a rmANOVA with the factors <italic>brain area</italic> (STN, M1, MSMC), <italic>predictability</italic> (predictable, unpredictable) and <italic>modulation type</italic> (beta suppression, beta rebound). Lateralization was quantified by the lateralization index, defined as the difference between contralateral and ipsilateral power, normalized by power summed over both hemispheres.</p>

<sec id="s6l">
<title>Behavior</title>
<p>To assess whether the predictability of movement prompts had an effect on the patients’ performance in the task, we performed a rmANOVA with the factors <italic>predictability</italic> (predictable, unpredictable), <italic>movement</italic> (start, stop, reversal) and their interaction on reaction times and movement-aligned wheel turning speed, averaged over trials and time points, respectively. Epochs without movement (pre-start and post-stop) were disregarded in this analysis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Winkler et al. present brain activity patterns related to complex motor behaviour by combining whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) with subthalamic local field potential (LFP) recordings from people with Parkinson's disease. The motor task involved repetitive circular movements with stops or reversals associated with either predictable or unpredictable cues. Beta and gamma frequency oscillations are described, and the authors found complex interactions between recording sites and task conditions. For example, they observed stronger modulation of connectivity in unpredictable conditions. Moreover, STN power varied across patients during reversals, which differed from stopping movements. The authors conclude that cortex-STN beta modulation is sensitive to movement context, with potential relevance for movement redirection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study employs a unique methodology, leveraging the rare opportunity to simultaneously record both invasive and non-invasive brain activity to explore oscillatory networks.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is difficult to interpret the role of the STN in the context of reversals because no consistent activity pattern emerged.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study examines the role of beta oscillations in motor control, particularly during rapid changes in movement direction among patients with Parkinson's disease. The researchers utilized magnetoencephalography (MEG) and local field potential (LFP) recordings from the subthalamic nucleus to investigate variations in beta band activity within the cortex and STN during the initiation, cessation, and reversal of movements, as well as the impact of external cue predictability on these dynamics. The primary finding indicates that beta oscillations more effectively signify the start and end of motor sequences than transitions within those sequences. The article is well-written, clear, and concise.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of a continuous motion paradigm with rapid reversals extends the understanding of beta oscillations in motor control beyond simple tasks. It offers a comprehensive perspective on subthalamo-cortical interactions by combining MEG and LFP.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The small and clinically diverse sample size may limit the robustness and generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the limited exploration of causal mechanisms reduces the depth of its conclusions and focusing solely on Parkinson's disease patients might restrict the applicability of the results to broader populations.</p>
<p>(2) The small sample size and variability in clinical characteristics among patients may limit the robustness of the study's conclusions. It would be beneficial for the authors to acknowledge this limitation and propose strategies for addressing it in future research. Additionally, incorporating patient-specific factors as covariates in the ANOVA could help mitigate the confounding effects of heterogeneity.</p>
<p>(3) The author may consider using standardized statistics, such as effect size, that would provide a clearer picture of the observed effect magnitude and improve comparability.</p>
<p>(4) Although the study identifies revelance between beta activity and motor events, it lacks causal analysis and discussion of potential causal mechanisms. Given the valuable datasets collected, exploring or discussing causal mechanisms would enhance the depth of the study.</p>
<p>(5) The study cohort focused on senior adults, who may exhibit age-related cortical responses during movement planning in neural mechanisms. These aspects were not discussed in the study.</p>
<p>(6) Including a control group of patients with other movement disorders who also undergo DBS surgery would be beneficial. Because we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed findings are specific to PD or can be generalized. Additionally, the current title and the article, which are oriented toward understanding human motor control, may not be appropriate.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study highlights how the initiation, reversal, and cessation of movements are linked to changes in beta synchronization within the basal ganglia-cortex loops. It was observed that different movement phases, such as starting, stopping briefly, and stopping completely, affect beta oscillations in the motor system.</p>
<p>It was found that unpredictable cues lead to stronger changes in STN-cortex beta coherence. Additionally, specific patterns of beta and gamma oscillations related to different movement actions and contexts were observed. Stopping movements was associated with a lack of the expected beta rebound during brief pauses within a movement sequence.</p>
<p>Overall, the results underline the complex and context-dependent nature of motor-control and emphasize the role of beta oscillations in managing movement according to changing external cues.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper is very well written, clear, and appears methodologically sound.</p>
<p>Although the use of continuous movement (turning) with reversals is more naturalistic than many previous button push paradigms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The generalizability of the findings is somewhat curtailed by the fact that this was performed peri-operatively during the period of the microlesion effect. Given the availability of sensing-enabled DBS devices now and HD-EEG, does MEG offer a significant enough gain in spatial localizability to offset the fact that it has to be done shortly postoperatively with externalized leads, with an attendant stun effect? Specifically, for paradigms that are not asking very spatially localized questions as a primary hypothesis?</p>
<p>Further investigation of the gamma signal seems warranted, even though it has a slightly lower proportional change in amplitude in beta. Given that the changes in gamma here are relatively wide band, this could represent a marker of neural firing that could be interestingly contrasted against the rhythm account presented.</p>
