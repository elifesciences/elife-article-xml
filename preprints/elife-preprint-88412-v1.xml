<title>Abstract</title><p>Synaptic heterogeneity is a hallmark of complex nervous systems that enables reliable and responsive communication in neural circuits. In this study, we investigated the contributions of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) to synaptic heterogeneity at two closely related <italic>Drosophila</italic> glutamatergic motor neurons, one low-and one high-P<sub>r</sub>. We find that VGCC levels are highly predictive of heterogeneous release probability among individual active zones (AZs) of low-or high-P<sub>r</sub> inputs, but not between neuronal subtypes. Underlying organizational differences in the AZ cytomatrix, VGCC composition, and a more compact arrangement of VGCCs alter the relationship between VGCC levels and P<sub>r</sub> at AZs of low-vs. high-P<sub>r</sub> inputs, explaining this apparent paradox. We further find that the CAST/ELKS AZ scaffolding protein Bruchpilot differentially regulates VGCC levels at low-and high-P<sub>r</sub> AZs following acute glutamate receptor inhibition, indicating that synapse-specific organization also impacts adaptive plasticity. These findings reveal intersecting levels of molecular and spatial diversity with context-specific effects on heterogeneity in synaptic strength and plasticity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability of neural circuits to effectively detect and dynamically respond to a broad range of inputs depends on a diversity of neuronal subtypes communicating through synapses with distinct properties. Neurotransmission occurs at specialized membranes called active zones (AZs) where action potentials drive the opening of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion and neurotransmitter release. Neurotransmitter release properties are determined locally at individual synapses and vary considerably both between neuronal subtypes and within homogeneous populations of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ariel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Atwood and Karunanithi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Branco and Staras, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hatt and Smith, 1976</xref>). In fact, functional imaging studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> demonstrate that even single neurons forming synapses with the same postsynaptic partner display heterogeneous synaptic strength among individual AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Guerrero et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Melom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Peled and Isacoff, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Presynaptic strength is defined as the likelihood of neurotransmitter release following an action potential (probability of release, P<sub>r</sub>). This stochastic process is determined by the number of functional SV release sites and their individual probability of vesicle release. The probability of SV release is highly dependent on transient increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at vesicular sensors. Accordingly, SV release sites and VGCCs are key substrates for synaptic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akbergenova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aldahabi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fedchyshyn and Wang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fekete et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gratz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Holderith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Laghaei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Newman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rebola et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Reddy-Alla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sauvola et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>). Numerous studies have demonstrated that VGCC levels correlate highly with P<sub>r</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akbergenova <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gratz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Holderith <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nakamura <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Sheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Paradoxically, this is not always the case. For example, a recent study investigated two cerebellar synaptic subtypes, one high-P<sub>r</sub> formed by stellate cells and one low-P<sub>r</sub> formed by granule cells, and found higher VGCC levels at low-P<sub>r</sub> granule synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rebola <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). This finding highlights the importance of synaptic context in understanding the role of VGCC levels in determining P<sub>r</sub> at distinct synapses. Since VGCCs in closer proximity to release sites are expected to have a greater impact on vesicular release probability than those positioned farther away, the spatial coupling of VGCCs and SVs at AZs is a critical determinant of P<sub>r</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Eggermann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fedchyshyn and Wang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nakamura <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rebola <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Indeed, at high-P<sub>r</sub> stellate synapses, a ‘perimeter release’ AZ organization places VGCCs ∼40nm closer to SVs than at low-P<sub>r</sub> granular synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rebola <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). How these distinct topographies are set remains unknown.</p>
<p>To better understand the context-dependent contributions of VGCCs to heterogeneous neurotransmitter release properties, we sought a system where we could investigate the relationship between VGCCs and P<sub>r</sub> at two closely related neurons that form synapses with distinct release probabilities. <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles are innervated by two glutamatergic motor neurons, one tonic and one phasic, that form type Ib and type Is synapses, respectively. Type Ib synapses have relatively low P<sub>r</sub> and facilitate, whereas type Is synapses have higher P<sub>r</sub> and depress in response to high-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aponte-Santiago et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Lnenicka and Keshishian, 2000</xref>). In this study, we investigated how VGCC number, organization, and subunit composition contribute to synaptic heterogeneity at low-P<sub>r</sub> type Ib and high-P<sub>r</sub> type Is inputs. We find that individual synapses formed by both low-and high-P<sub>r</sub> inputs exhibit heterogeneous release properties that can be predicted by VGCC levels alone. However, VGCC levels do not correspond to differences in P<sub>r</sub> between the two inputs due to underlying molecular and organizational differences that alter the relationship between VGCC levels and P<sub>r</sub> at AZs of low-vs. high-P<sub>r</sub> inputs. These findings reveal intersecting levels of molecular and spatial diversity that combine to generate extensive synaptic heterogeneity.</p>

<title>VGCC levels predict P<sub>r</sub> within, but not between, synaptic subtypes</title>
<p>To investigate the relationship between VGCC levels and neurotransmitter release properties at functionally distinct synapses, we took advantage of the two motor neuron subtypes with low and high release probabilities that innervate most <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aponte-Santiago and Littleton, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kurdyak et al., 1994</xref>). These glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) contain hundreds of individual synapses that are accessible to single AZ functional imaging using genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Cacophony (Cac) is the sole Ca<sub>v</sub>2 pore-forming subunit and is the VGCC responsible for triggering synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Macleod et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Peng and Wu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Smith et al., 1996</xref>). To simultaneously monitor neurotransmitter release and VGCC levels, we swapped the N-terminal sfGFP tag in our well-characterized <italic>cac<sup>sfGFP-N</sup></italic>line for a Td-Tomato tag (<italic>cac<sup>Td-Tomato-N</sup></italic>). We have previously incorporated a number of protein tags at this site without disrupting function and confirm below that a larger tandem tag does not impair synaptic function (See <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1A-F</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ghelani et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gratz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>)). We then expressed postsynaptically targeted GCaMP6f (SynapGCaMP6f; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Newman et al., 2017</xref>)), which reports Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through glutamate receptors in response to neurotransmitter release in <italic>Cac<sup>Td-Tomato-N</sup></italic> animals. We and others have previously shown that Cac levels are highly predictive of P<sub>r</sub> at individual type Ib AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akbergenova <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gratz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). To determine if VGCC levels are similarly predictive at high-P<sub>r</sub> type Is AZs, we measured Cac<sup>Td-Tomato-N</sup> fluorescence intensity and monitored neurotransmitter release in response to 0.2-Hz stimulus at individual synapses. To enable direct comparisons between the two synaptic subtypes, we simultaneously imaged type Ib and type Is synapses at NMJ 6/7 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We quantified the number of times a vesicle was released over 120 stimuli to determine single-synapse P<sub>r</sub>, and found that, as expected, type Is synapses exhibited significant heterogeneity and higher average P<sub>r</sub> than type Ib synapses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, C; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Newman <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>)). Consistent with their higher P<sub>r</sub>, type Is connections contain relatively fewer low-P<sub>r</sub> AZs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1D</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jetti et al., 2023</xref>)). We next investigated the correlation between P<sub>r</sub> and VGCC levels and found that at type Is inputs, single-AZ Cac intensity positively correlates with P<sub>r</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>; REFS). We also observe a strong positive correlation between VGCC levels and P<sub>r</sub> at type Ib inputs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), consistent with our and others’ prior findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akbergenova <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gratz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Newman <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>A simple prediction of the observation that VGCC levels correlate highly with P<sub>r</sub> at individual AZs of both low-and high-P<sub>r</sub> inputs is that, when comparing between them, Cac levels will be higher at type Is inputs than type Ib. We analyzed Cac<sup>sfGFP-N</sup> levels at individual AZs of type Ib and Is motor neurons and found that average Cac levels are the same at type Ib and Is AZs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>, H). Cac levels are also similarly distributed across active zones of the two inputs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1I</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that the relationship between VGCC levels and P<sub>r</sub> differs between the two inputs. Consistently, when we compare the relationship between Cac levels and P<sub>r</sub> at the type Ib and Is inputs from our correlative functional imaging data, we find that the slopes of the best-fit lines are significantly different (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). Across type Is active zones, a similar range of VGCC levels supports a broader range of release probabilities. Thus, VGCCs can predict P<sub>r</sub> within synaptic subtypes, but not between active zones of different synaptic subtypes, providing a framework for understanding seemingly contradictory findings on the role of VGCCs in determining P<sub>r</sub>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>VGCC clusters are more compact at AZs of high-P<sub>r</sub> type Is inputs</title>
<p>To understand how spatial differences might alter the relationship between VGCC levels and P<sub>r</sub> at low-P<sub>r</sub> type Ib and high-P<sub>r</sub> type Is AZs, we turned to 3D dSTORM single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). An individual VGCC complex is estimated to be ∼10 nm in diameter with the most common immunolabeling techniques adding significantly to their size and creating a linkage error of ∼20 nm between the target molecule and fluorescent reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Früh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Thomas, 2000</xref>). For following VGCC dynamics using single-particle tracking via photoactivation localization microscopy (sptPALM), we recently incorporated mEOS4b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Paez-Segala et al., 2015</xref>) at the N-terminus of Cac, achieving a linkage error of less of than 5 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ghelani <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). To gain more flexibility in labeling Cac without adding to the linkage error, we swapped the mEOS tag for a similarly sized HaloTag (<italic>cac<sup>HaloTag-N</sup></italic>). As expected, these flies are fully viable and Cac<sup>HaloTag-N</sup> exhibits normal localization to AZs, where Brp is arranged in a ring that surrounds a puncta of VGCCs in superresolution optical reassignment images (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ghelani <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gratz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>)). HaloTag, which covalently binds synthetic ligands, is 3.3 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Los et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Yazaki et al., 2019</xref>), yielding a linkage error well under 5 nm.</p>

<p>Cac<sup>HaloTag-N</sup> larvae were stained with JaneliaFluor646 HaloTag ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to distinguish between type Ib and Is branches and enable simultaneous imaging of the two synaptic subtypes innervating NMJ 6/7. We then used density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) analysis to identify Cac clusters at type Ib and Is AZs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D,E</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ehmann et al., 2014</xref>)). We find that the average size of Cac<sup>HaloTag-N</sup> clusters is similar at low-and high-P<sub>r</sub> AZs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), with mean diameters of approximately 102 nm and 105 nm, respectively. This is similar to the Cac<sup>mEOS4b-N</sup> type Ib cluster size observed by sptPALM imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ghelani <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). In agreement with our confocal level data, the number of localizations per cluster was similar at low-and high-P<sub>r</sub> AZs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). We then calculated the average Cac density per AZ, and found that VGCCs are significantly more densely organized at high-P<sub>r</sub> type Is AZs than low-P<sub>r</sub> type Ib AZs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>, I). Greater AZ density at type Is AZs is consistent with recent SMLM studies using antibodies to label Cac or Brp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mrestani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Newman <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) and a recent electrophysiological analysis of VGCC-SV coupling that revealed significantly tighter coupling at type Is synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">He et al., 2022</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that more compact organization of VGCCs increases their proximity to SVs and contributes to the steeper relationship between VGCC levels and P<sub>r</sub> at high-P<sub>r</sub> type Is AZs.</p>

<title>Differences in Bruchpilot levels and function at low-and high-P<sub>r</sub> inputs</title>
<p>To understand how these nanoscale differences in VGCC organization might be established, we investigated the AZ scaffolding protein Bruchpilot (Brp). Brp/CAST/ELKs family proteins function as central organizers of both VGCCs and SV release sites at developing synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hallermann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Held et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66a">McDonald <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Radulovic et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>We simultaneously imaged type Ib and Is inputs and found lower Brp levels at type Is AZs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, B). Since Cac levels are similar at the two synaptic subtypes, lower Brp levels result in a significantly higher Cac:Brp ratio at type Is synapses, which we hypothesize promotes compact organization of VGCCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). In contrast, we and others have previously shown that Brp levels positively correlate with P<sub>r</sub> among AZs of low-P<sub>r</sub> type Is inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gratz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Muhammad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Newman <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Peled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Reddy-Alla <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Consistently, Brp and Cac levels strongly correlate at type Ib AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gratz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) and we observe a similarly strong correlation across individual type Is AZs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Thus, like VGCCs, Brp levels contribute in distinct ways to synaptic heterogeneity within vs. between low-and high-P<sub>r</sub> synaptic subtypes depending on input-specific AZ organization.</p>

<p>At low-P<sub>r</sub> type Ib AZs, Brp is a critical regulator of PHP-induced accumulation of proteins associated with SV priming and release, specifically Unc13A and Syntaxin-1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bohme <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). At type Ib AZs, PhTx also induces a Brp-dependent increase in Cac density and decrease in channel mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ghelani <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Notably, Brp itself is more densely organized during PHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ghelani <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) and at high-P<sub>r</sub> type Is AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mrestani <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Since baseline accumulation of VGCCs depends less on Brp at high-P<sub>r</sub> type Is AZs, we investigated the role of Brp in promoting dynamic increases in VGCC levels at type Ib and Is AZs by treating <italic>cac<sup>sfGFP-N</sup>; brp<sup>-/-</sup></italic> larvae with PhTx followed by quantification of Cac<sup>sfGFP-N</sup> levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, F). We find that PhTx failed to induce accumulation of Cac at either type Ib or Is AZs in <italic>brp<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants, demonstrating a shared requirement for Brp in regulating VGCC dynamics at low-and high-P<sub>r</sub> AZs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). Notably, in contrast to no change at type Ib AZs, Cac<sup>sfGFP-N</sup> levels are significantly decreased at type Is AZs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>), revealing subtype-specific roles for Brp during the dynamic reorganization of VGCCs at low-and high-P<sub>r</sub> AZs. Consistently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ghelani et al.

Together, these findings suggest potentiating synapses must coordinate the accumulation of new VGCCs with the stabilization of existing channels, and that meeting this challenge is more dependent upon Brp at high-P<sub>r</sub> AZs.</p>

<title>Endogenous tagging of VGCC auxiliary subunits reveals distinct synaptic expression patterns</title>
<p>In addition to spatial organization, functional differences in the VGCCs localized at low-and high-P<sub>r</sub> AZs may contribute to differences in the relationship between channel levels and P<sub>r</sub>. Consistent with this possibility, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is reported to be ∼2x higher at type Is AZs and neurotransmitter release saturates at lower external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations than type Ib AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">He <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the pore-forming α subunits, VGCCs comprise auxiliary α2δ and β subunits that regulate forward channel trafficking, membrane insertion, and function (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Campiglio and Flucher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dolphin and Lee, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Weiss and Zamponi, 2017</xref>)). β subunits interact with pore-forming α subunits intracellularly, whereas GPI-anchored α2δ subunits are largely extracellular. In addition to their interaction with α subunits, α2δs have been shown to interact with a growing number of extracellular proteins to promote synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bauer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dolphin, 2018</xref>).

Auxiliary subunits are both spatially and temporally regulated, and broadly able to interact with α subunits. Thus, the subunit composition of channel complexes is a potential source of significant diversity in both the spatial and functional regulation of VGCCs.</p>

To explore potential differences in VGCC subunit composition at type Ib and Is synapses, we used CRISPR gene editing to incorporate endogenous V5 tags at the N-termini of Stj and Stolid and C-terminus of Ca-β, and confirmed that the incorporation of the peptide tag did not impair neurotransmission (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-E</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bruckner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Gratz et al., 2014</xref>).

Similar to Cac, Ca-β<sup>V5-C</sup> is highly enriched in the mushroom bodies of the larval brain.

<title>Stj/α2δ-3 levels are lower at AZs of high-P<sub>r</sub> type Is inputs</title>
<p>To investigate Caβ<sup>V5-C</sup> and Stj<sup>V5-N</sup> localization at type Ib and Is AZs, we used superresolution optical reassignment microscopy. Both subunits localize to AZs labeled with Cac or the CAST/ELKS AZ cytomatrix protein Brp (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, B). We observe Brp rings surrounding puncta of VGCCs, including the Ca-β<sup>V5-C</sup> and, based on its colocalization with Cac, Stj<sup>V5-N</sup> subunits (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, B; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fouquet et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kittel <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>)). Their tight colocalization at AZs suggest that the three subunits associate as a complex and predict that Ca-β<sup>V5-C</sup> and Stj<sup>V5-N</sup> levels, like Cac, will be similar at the two synapses. To compare subunit levels at low-and high-P<sub>r</sub> AZs, we simultaneously imaged type Ib and Is inputs using confocal microscopy and measured fluorescence intensity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, D). As predicted, we found that Ca-β<sup>V5-C</sup> levels are similar at type Ib and Is AZs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). In contrast, Stj<sup>V5-N</sup> fluorescence levels are significantly lower at higher-P<sub>r</sub> type Is AZs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Thus, while Cac and Ca-β are present in similar ratios at both synaptic subtypes, surprisingly, the same is not true of Stj/α2δ-3 with high-P<sub>r</sub> type Is AZs exhibiting a greater Cac:Stj ratio. This unexpected finding is consistent with studies of mammalian subunits indicating that in contrast to β subunits, α2δ interactions with α subunits may be transient, leading to a pool of VGCCs lacking α2δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Muller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Voigt et al., 2016</xref>). Our results suggest this pool is present <italic>in vivo</italic> and larger at high-P<sub>r</sub> type-Is inputs.</p>
<p>To further investigate the contribution of Stj to synaptic heterogeneity, we analyzed the relationship between Cac and Stj levels at individual AZs of type Is inputs. Stj<sup>V5-N</sup> and Cac<sup>sfGFP-N</sup> levels are highly positively correlated at type Is AZs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). We observe the same relationship between Stj<sup>V5-N</sup> and Cac<sup>sfGFP-N</sup> levels at type Ib AZs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). Because P<sub>r</sub> is highly positively correlated with Cac levels within synaptic subtypes, this indicates that Stj levels are also positively correlated with P<sub>r</sub> within, but not between, synaptic subtypes. Together, these findings reveal context-specific contributions of VGCC levels and composition to synaptic heterogeneity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Complex nervous system function depends on communication at synapses with heterogeneous properties. We have investigated the contributions of VGCC levels, organization, and subunit composition to synaptic heterogeneity at two closely related excitatory neurons that form synapses with distinct neurotransmitter release properties. This approach revealed that while VGCC levels alone are predictive of the strength of individual synapses within neuronal subtypes, underlying differences in spatial and molecular organization alter the relationship between channel levels and release probability at synapses formed by distinct neuronal subtypes. This provides a framework for understanding how multiple levels of molecular and organizational diversity intersect to generate extensive synaptic heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Investigations at diverse synapses using approaches ranging from cell-attached patch recordings to freeze-fracture immuno-electron microscopy to correlative functional imaging have revealed a strong positive correlation between VGCC number and P<sub>r</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akbergenova <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gratz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Holderith <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nakamura <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Sheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). While this conclusion corresponds neatly with the dependence of neurotransmitter release on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, counterintuitively, there is a disconnect between VGCC levels and P<sub>r</sub> at some synapses. Although VGCC number positively correlates with P<sub>r</sub> at the immature calyx of Held, the mature calyx contains fewer VGCCs despite higher P<sub>r</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fedchyshyn and Wang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Sheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wang and Augustine, 2014</xref>). Similarly, in the cerebellum, inhibitory stellate neurons form high-P<sub>r</sub> synapses with lower VGCC levels than low-P<sub>r</sub> synapses formed by excitatory granular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rebola <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Adding to these paradoxical examples, VGCC levels positively correlate with P<sub>r</sub> among the heterogeneous synapses formed by either low-P<sub>r</sub> type Ib or high-P<sub>r</sub> type Is motor neurons, but overall VGCC levels are are similar at type Ib and Is inputs despite a 2-3-fold difference in P<sub>r</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Lu <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Newman <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, correlative functional imaging confirms that the same number of channels can support greater release at these high-P<sub>r</sub> AZs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This difference is likely due, at least in part, to distinct spatial organization at type Is AZs. Cac clusters are denser at high-P<sub>r</sub> AZs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Brp, which organizes both VGCCs and SVs, is also more densely organized at type Is synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mrestani <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), consistent with an overall more compact organization of high-P<sub>r</sub> AZs. A straightforward prediction is that a more compact AZ organization will decrease the distance between VGCCs and SVs. Indeed, a recent electrophysiological study using new tools for genetically isolating type Ib and Is inputs demonstrated that neurotransmitter release at denser type Is synapses is less impacted by the slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator EGTA than type Ib synapses, indicating tighter VGCC-SV coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">He <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). More densely organized VGCCs at the mature vs. developing calyx of Held also exhibit greater coupling with SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fedchyshyn and Wang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fekete <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nakamura <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Sheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Similarly, high-P<sub>r</sub> stellate synapses have greater functional coupling attributable to their more compact topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rebola <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that more compact AZs may be a general organizing principle of high-P<sub>r</sub> synapses. We propose that underlying organizational differences between low-and high-P<sub>r</sub> synaptic subtypes combine with molecular diversity within each subtype to generate still greater synaptic heterogeneity. This explains our observation that VGCC levels, as well as Brp and Stj levels, predict P<sub>r</sub> within, but not between, synaptic subtypes, as well as the seemingly paradoxical findings that VGCC levels do not always correlate with P<sub>r</sub>.</p>
<p>Brp/CAST/ELKS AZ cytomatrix proteins are central regulators of synapse organization across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dai <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dong <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hallermann <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Held <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kittel <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66a">McDonald <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Radulovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Brp interacts with a large number of AZ proteins to promote Cac clustering at AZs, organize SVs, and recruit Unc13A, which defines SV release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bohme et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Fulterer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ghelani <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, type Is AZs, which in addition to increased Brp density also have lower Brp levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and fewer release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">He <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mrestani <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Given Brp’s myriad interactions, it is not difficult to envision its compaction bringing VGCCs and SVs in closer proximity and leading to higher P<sub>r</sub> independent of the overall number of release sites and Cac levels. Consistent with this model, Brp density increases during PHP, extending the positive relationship between AZ density and P<sub>r</sub> to dynamic changes in release properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mrestani <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). This denser Brp scaffold also promotes PhTx-induced increases in Cac levels and density along with the addition and reorganization of release sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bohme <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dannhauser et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ghelani <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). While Brp clearly plays a central role in AZ organization and reorganization, we find that type Ib and Is synapses have distinct requirements for Brp during synapse formation and homeostatic potentiation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Synapse-specific roles for Brp are supported by a recent functional imaging study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) and studies of ELKS at mammalian inhibitory and excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Held <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>), and suggest that Brp acts in parallel with or downstream of other factors that establish neuron-specific differences. A recent single-cell transcriptomic study of type Ib and Is motor neurons provides an unbiased starting point for identifying candidate regulators of organizational differences at low-and high-P<sub>r</sub> AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). A number of cytoskeletal and motor-related proteins, regulators of proteostasis, and post-translational modifying enzymes/pathway components – all of which could potentially contribute to establishing the observed molecular and/or spatial differences – are differentially expressed in either type Ib or Is motor neurons</p>
<p>The VGCC complex itself provides an additional potential mechanism for diversifying synapses. Both β and α2δ subunits can influence the membrane localization and function of VGCCs. In addition to the ability to mix and match subunits, many of the genes encoding VGCC subunits across species are extensively alternatively spliced to generate functional diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lipscombe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lipscombe and Lopez Soto, 2019</xref>) – an area of great interest for further investigation. Because both β and α2δ subunits are generally considered positive regulators of channel trafficking and function, we were surprised to find that Stj/α2δ-3 levels are lower at high-P<sub>r</sub> AZs (Figs. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Since AZ levels of α subunit Cac are similar at the two synaptic subtypes, lower levels of Stj at type Is synapses indicates a difference in α:α2δ-3 stoichiometry. The stoichiometry of α:α2δ appears to vary. While some studies observe a tight association between the two subunits, a single-molecule tracking study of mammalian VGCCs found that α2δ subunits have a relatively low affinity for α subunits, resulting in a population of α subunits not associated with an α2δ subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cassidy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Voigt <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Consistently, whereas α and β subunits were isolated at near equimolar ratios following affinity purification of Ca<sub>v</sub>2 channels, molar levels of α2δ were a surprising 90% lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Muller <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Our findings suggest there is a pool of VGCCs lacking an α2δ subunit at endogenous synapses, and further suggest that this pool is greater at high-P<sub>r</sub> type Is AZs. Stj is both required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dickman <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Kurshan <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Ly <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) and rate limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cunningham et al., 2022</xref>) for Cac accumulation at AZs. Stj does not appear to function in the stabilization of channels at the AZ membrane, but rather at an upstream step in the progression from ER to plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cunningham <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). An upstream role may explain how Cac levels are similar at type Is AZs despite lower Stj levels. Tools for following Stj dynamics in developing neurons will help clarify its precise role in Cac delivery. How might a higher α:α2δ-3 ratio result in higher P<sub>r</sub>? A number of recent studies raise intriguing possibilities. While the correspondence of <italic>Drosophila</italic> α2δ subunits to specific mammalian counterparts is somewhat murky, Stj appears to be most closely related to α2δ-3. Strikingly, α2δ-3 inhibits activity at excitatory synapses of mature, but not immature, rat hippocampal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bikbaev et al., 2020</xref>), raising the possibility that Stj’s role may shift during synapse maturation. Further, binding of the cell adhesion molecule Neurexin-1α specifically inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 channels containing α2δ-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Tong et al., 2017</xref>), which, if similar at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ, would result in greater inhibition of channel function at type Ib AZs and contribute to the observed difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Elucidating the many intersecting mechanisms underlying synaptic heterogeneity and how these differences are maintained or modulated during different forms of plasticity is a challenging and important goal for the field going forward.</p>

<p>Functional imaging was performed on a Nikon A1R resonant scanning confocal mounted on a FN1 microscope using a Nikon Apo LWD 25x 1.1 NA objective and a Mad City Labs piezo drive nosepiece. Dissections and data collection were performed as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gratz et al., 2019</xref>. Briefly, <italic>Cac<sup>Td-Tomato-N</sup></italic>; <italic>Mhc-</italic>GCaMP6f male 3rd instar larvae were dissected in HL3 containing 0.2mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 25mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> with motor axons severed and the larval brain removed. Larval filets were placed in HL3 containing 1.5mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 25mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> for recording. Nerves were suctioned into 1.5mm pipettes and stimulus amplitude was adjusted to recruit both type Ib and type Is input. Motor terminals from segments A2-4 at NMJ 6/7 were imaged for Cac<sup>Td-Tomato-N</sup> levels first using a galvanometer scanner, then a resonant scanner to collect GCaMP6f events in a single focal plane continuously for 120 stimulations at a 0.2 Hz stimulation frequency.</p>
<p>Z-stacks and movies were loaded into Nikon Elements Software (NIS) where movies were motion corrected, background subtracted, and denoised. Change in fluorescence (ΔF) movies were then created by subtracting the average of the previous 10 frames from each frame. A substack of only stimulation frames was further processed using a gaussian filter followed by BrightSpots detection to identify the location of each postsynaptic event using the Nikon GA3 module. Cac<sup>Td-Tomato-N</sup> fluorescence intensity levels and coordinate locations were measured for 531 AZs for type Ib and 365 AZs for type Is terminals across 6 animals. X-Y coordinate positions of fluorescent signals from GCaMP6f postsynaptic events were aligned to Cac<sup>Td-Tomato-N</sup> puncta locations and each post synaptic event assigned to a Cac puncta using nearest neighbor analysis. Postsynaptic events that did not map within 960 nm of a Cac<sup>Td-</sup> <sup>Tomato-N</sup> punctum were discarded from the analysis. Pearson’s correlation was used to determine the correlation between P<sub>r</sub> and Cac levels normalized to average to account for variability between imaging sessions. Cac intensity-P<sub>r</sub> heat maps were generated using Python matplotlib and seaborn plotting packages.</p>

<title>STORM imaging and analysis</title>
<p>STORM imaging was performed on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 3D NSTORM with an Andor iXon Ultra camera, Nikon LUN-F 405/488/640 nm lasers, and a Nikon 100x 1.49 NA objective. STORM buffer (10mM MEA (pH 8.0), 3 U/mL pyranose oxidase, and 90 U/mL catalase, 10% (w/v) glucose, 10 mM sodium chloride, and 50 mM Tris hydrochloride) was made fresh each imaging day and pH adjusted to between 7.0-8.0 using acetic acid. Cac<sup>HaloTag-N</sup> NMJs were labeled as detailed in <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref> and immediately imaged for HRP in 488 channel to identify type Ib and type Is terminals. Cac<sup>HaloTag-N</sup> was then imaged using the 640 nm laser line at 33 Hz for 5000 frames. 405 nm laser power was gradually increased over the course of imaging to compensate for run-down of blinking rates. A back aperture camera was used to ensure beam focus and position for each imaging session to ensure high signal to noise. Data were binned with a CCD minimum threshold of 100 and drift correction was applied using the NIS Software STORM package. ROIs of single boutons were drawn in NIS using HRP in the 488 nm channel followed by a DBSCAN analysis with criteria of 10 molecules within 50 nm to determine clusters. Positional coordinates of localizations within clusters from DBSCAN were exported from NIS and run through a Python script published with this manuscript. Using the implementation developed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mrestani et al., 2021</xref> as a starting point, we wrote custom code to use the alpha shapes component of the CGAL package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cgal.org">https://www.cgal.org</ext-link>), via a python wrapper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cgal">https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cgal</ext-link>), to measure the area of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters, the number of localizations, and calculate cluster density. To achieve an average lateral localization accuracy of ∼30 nm, all localizations with &gt;50 nm localization accuracy were removed prior to analysis. Using this custom code, Cac<sup>HaloTag-N</sup> area was analyzed using an alpha value of 0.015, which controls the complexity of cluster boundaries (not restricted to be convex).</p>

<title>Confocal imaging and analysis</title>
<p>For quantitative AZ analysis, larvae stained in the same dish were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ni A1R+ confocal microscope using an Apo TIRF 60x 1.49 NA oil-immersion objective for larval NMJs. NMJs containing both type Is and type Ib branches from muscles 6/7 in segments A2-4 were collected. ROIs were drawn using HRP staining to differentiate between type Ib and type Is branches. To analyze individual AZs, Nikon Elements Software was used to process images using Gaussian and rolling ball filters and analyze fluorescence intensity levels for individual puncta. When experimental design allowed, Brp fluorescence signal was used to create a binary mask to aid in the identification of AZ ROIs for analysis. Otherwise, binary masks were created based on the fluorescence signal of the channel analyzed. Confocal fluorescence intensity level data are reported as the sum fluorescence intensity per AZ averaged over individual NMJs. For <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, larvae were stained separately and imaged using a Nikon Plan-Apo 20x 0.75 NA objective (ventral ganglia) or Apo TIRF 60x 1.49 NA oil-immersion objective (NMJs).</p>
<p>Superresolution optical reassignment images were obtained on a Nikon CSU-W1 SoRa (Spinning Disk Super Resolution by Optical Pixel Reassignment) with a Photometrics Prime BSI sCMOS camera and a 60x 1.49 NA oil-immersion objective.

<p>Current-clamp recordings were performed as previously described (Bruckner, 2017). Male third-instar larvae were dissected in HL3 (70 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3, 115 mM sucrose, 5 mM trehalose, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) with 0.25 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Recordings were performed in HL3 at the external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration indicated. Sharp borosilicate electrodes filled with 3 M KCl were used to record from muscle 6 of abdominal segments A3 and A4. Recordings were conducted on a Nikon FN1 microscope using a 40x 0.80 NA water-dipping objective and acquired using an Axoclamp 900A amplifier, Digidata 1550B acquisition system, and pClamp 11.0.3 software (Molecular Devices).</p>
<p>For each cell with an initial resting potential between −60 and −80 mV and input resistance ≥5 MΩ, mean miniature excitatory junctional potentials (mEJPs) were collected for 1 minute in the absence of stimulation and analyzed using Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft). EJPs were generated by applying a stimulus to severed segmental nerves at a frequency of 0.2 Hz using an isolated pulse stimulator 2100 (A-M Systems). Stimulus amplitude was adjusted to consistently elicit compound responses from both type Ib and Is motor neurons. At least 25 consecutive EJPs were recorded for each cell and analyzed in pClamp to obtain mean amplitude. Quantal content was calculated for each recording as mean EJP amplitude divided by mean mEJP amplitude.</p>

<p>Calcium channels are key regulators of synaptic strength and plasticity, yet how these channels are differentially utilized to enable synaptic diversity is not clear. In this manuscript, the authors use new endogenous tagging of the Drosophila CaV2 channel Cac and three auxiliary subunits to investigate distinct calcium channel functions at two motor neuron subtypes at the fly NMJ, Is and Ib. Although it is clear from previous studies that Pr is higher at Is over Ib, it is not clear why. The authors confirm these differences using postsynaptic calcium imaging combined with post-hoc Cac-TdTomato imaging. Then, through a series of confocal and super resolution imaging studies, the authors describe differences in calcium channel and active zone structure between Is and Ib motor neuron terminals, and the role of Brp and homeostatic plasticity in regulating channel abundance. Finally, the authors show that while the CaBeta subunit is present at similar levels at Is and Ib active zones, there is an interesting reduction in Stj at Is active zones. The authors conclude that these differences in active zone structure and architecture contribute to the generation of the observed heterogeneity in synaptic strength.</p>
<p>Overall the manuscript is well written, and the successful generation of the new endogenous Cac tags (Td-Tomato, Halo) and CaBeta, stj, and stolid genes with V5 tags will be powerful reagents for the field to enable new studies on calcium channels in synaptic structure, function, and plasticity. There are also some interesting, though not entirely unexpected, findings regarding how Brp and homeostatic plasticity modulate calcium channel abundance. However, a major concern is that the conclusions about how &quot;molecular and organization diversity generate functional synaptic heterogeneity&quot; are not really supported by the data presented in this study. In particular, the key fact that frames this study is that Cac levels are similar at Ib and Is active zones, but that Pr is higher at Is over Ib (which was previously known). While Pr can be influenced by myriad processes, the authors should have first assessed presynaptic calcium influx - if they had, they would have better framed the key questions in this study. As the authors reference from previous studies, calcium influx is at least two-fold higher per active zone at Is over Ib, and the authors likely know that this difference is more than sufficient to explain the difference in Pr at Is over Ib. Hence, there is no reason to invoke differences in &quot;molecular and organization diversity&quot; to explain the difference in Pr, and the authors offer no data to support that the differences in active zone structure at Is vs Ib are necessary for the differences in Pr. Indeed, the real question the authors should have investigated is why there are such differences in presynaptic calcium influx at Is over Ib despite having similar levels/abundance of Cac. This seems the real question, and is all that is needed to explain the Pr differences shown in Fig. 1. The other changes in active zone structure and organization at Is vs Ib may very well contribute to additional differences in Pr, but the authors have not shown this in the present study, and rely on other studies (such as calcium-SV coupling at Is vs Ib) to support an argument that is not necessitated by their data. At the end of this manuscript, the authors have found an interesting possibility that Stj levels are reduced at Is vs Ib, that might perhaps contribute to the difference in calcium influx. However, at present this remains speculative.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors have generated powerful reagents for the field to study calcium channels and how they are regulated, but draw conclusions about active zone structure and organization contributing to functional heterogeneity that are not strongly supported by the data presented.</p>

<p>The authors aim to investigate how voltage-gated calcium channel number, organization, and subunit composition lead to changes in synaptic activity at tonic and phasic motor neuron terminals, or type Is and Ib motor neurons in Drosophila. These neuron subtypes generate widely different physiological outputs, and many investigations have sought to understand the molecular underpinnings responsible for these differences. Additionally, these authors explore not only static differences that exist during the third-instar larval stage of development but also use a pharmacological approach to induce homeostatic plasticity to explore how these neuronal subtypes dynamically change the structural composition and organization of key synaptic proteins contributing to physiological plasticity. The Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is glutamatergic, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain, so these findings not only expand our understanding of the molecular and physiological mechanisms responsible for differences in motor neuron subtype activity but also contribute to our understanding of how the human brain and nervous system functions.</p>
<p>The authors employ state-of-the-art tools and techniques such as single-molecule localization microscopy 3D STORM and create several novel transgenic animals using CRISPR to expand the molecular tools available for exploration of synaptic biology that will be of wide interest to the field. Additionally, the authors use a robust set of experimental approaches from active zone level resolution functional imaging from live preparations to electrophysiology and immunohistochemical analyses to explore and test their hypotheses. All data appear to be robustly acquired and analyzed using appropriate methodology. The authors make important advancements to our understanding of how the different motor neuron subtypes, phasic and tonic-like, exhibit widely varying electrical output despite the neuromuscular junctions having similar ultrastructural composition in the proteins of interest, voltage gated calcium channel cacophony (cac) and the scaffold protein Bruchpilot (brp). The authors reveal the ratio of brp:cac appears to be a critical determinant of release probability (Pr), and in particular, the packing density of VGCCs and availability of brp. Importantly, the authors demonstrate a brp-dependent increase in VGCC density following acute philanthotoxin perfusion (glutamate receptor inhibitor). This VGCC increase appears to be largely responsible for the presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) observable at the Drosophila NMJ. Lastly, the authors created several novel CRISPR-tagged transgenic lines to visualize the spatial localization of VGCC subunits in Drosophila. Two of these lines, CaBV5-C and stjV5-N, express in motor neurons and in the nervous system, localize at the NMJ, and most strikingly, strongly correlate with Pr at tonic and phasic-like terminals.</p>
<p>The few limitations in this study could be addressed with some commentary, a few minor follow-up analyses, or experiments. The authors use a postsynaptically expressed calcium indicator (mhc-Gal4&gt;UAS -GCaMP) to calculate Pr, yet do not explore the contribution that glutamate receptors, or other postsynaptic contributors (e.g. components of the postsynaptic density, PSD) may contribute. A previous publication exploring tonic vs phasic-like activity at the drosophila NMJ revealed a dynamic role for GluRII (Aponte-Santiago et al, 2020). Could the speed of GluR accumulation account for differences between neuron subtypes?</p>
<p>The observation that calcium channel density and brp:cac ratio as a critical determinant of Pr is an important one. However, it is surprising that this was not observed in previous investigations of cac intensity (of which there are many). Is this purely a technical limitation of other investigations, or are other possibilities feasible? Additionally, regarding VGCC-SV coupling, the authors conclude that this packing density increases their proximity to SVs and contributes to the steeper relationship between VGCCs and Pr at phasic type Is. Is it possible that brp or other AZ components could account for these differences. The authors possess the tools to address this directly by labeling vesicles with JanellaFluor646; a stronger signal should be present at Is boutons. Additionally, many different studies have used transmission electron microscopy to explore SVs location to AZs (t-bars) at the Drosophila NMJ.</p>
<p>In reference to the contradictory observations that VGCC intensity does not always correlate with, or determine Pr. Previous investigations have also observed other AZ proteins or interactors (e.g. synaptotagmin mutants) critically control release, even when the correlation between cac and release remains constant while Pr dramatically precipitates.</p>
<p>To confirm the observations that lower brp levels results in a significantly higher cac:brp ratio at phasic-like synapses by organizing VGCCs; this argument could be made stronger by analyzing their existing data. By selecting a population of AZs in Ib boutons that endogenously express normal cac and lower brp levels, the Pr from these should be higher than those from within that population, but comparable to Is Pr. I believe the authors should also be able to correlate the cac:brp ratio with Pr from their data set generally; to determine if a strong correlation exists beyond their observation for cac correlation.</p>
<p>For the philanthotoxin induced changes in cac and brp localization underlying PHP, why do the authors not show cac accumulation after PhTx on live dissected preparations (i.e. in real time)? This also be an excellent opportunity to validate their brp:cac theory. Do the authors observe a dynamic change in brp:cac after 1, or 5 minutes; do Is boutons potentiate stronger due to proportional increases in cac and brp? Also regarding PhTx-induced PHP, their observations that stj and α2δ-3are more abundant at Is synapses, suggests that they may also play a role in PhTx induced changes in cac. If either/both are overexpressed during PhTx, brp should increase while cac remains constant. These accessory proteins may determine cac incorporation at AZs.</p>
<p>
Taken together this study generates important data-driven, conceptional, and theoretical advancements in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of different motor neurons, and our understanding of synaptic biology generally. The data are robust, thoroughly analyzed, appropriately depicted. This study not only generates novel findings but also generated novel molecular tools which will aid future investigations and investigators progress in this field.</p>

<p>[...] Overall the manuscript is well written, and the successful generation of the new endogenous Cac tags (Td-Tomato, Halo) and CaBeta, stj, and stolid genes with V5 tags will be powerful reagents for the field to enable new studies on calcium channels in synaptic structure, function, and plasticity. There are also some interesting, though not entirely unexpected, findings regarding how Brp and homeostatic plasticity modulate calcium channel abundance. However, a major concern is that the conclusions about how &quot;molecular and organization diversity generate functional synaptic heterogeneity&quot; are not really supported by the data presented in this study. In particular, the key fact that frames this study is that Cac levels are similar at Ib and Is active zones, but that Pr is higher at Is over Ib (which was previously known). While Pr can be influenced by myriad processes, the authors should have first assessed presynaptic calcium influx - if they had, they would have better framed the key questions in this study. As the authors reference from previous studies, calcium influx is at least two-fold higher per active zone at Is over Ib, and the authors likely know that this difference is more than sufficient to explain the difference in Pr at Is over Ib. Hence, there is no reason to invoke differences in &quot;molecular and organization diversity&quot; to explain the difference in Pr, and the authors offer no data to support that the differences in active zone structure at Is vs Ib are necessary for the differences in Pr. Indeed, the real question the authors should have investigated is why there are such differences in presynaptic calcium influx at Is over Ib despite having similar levels/abundance of Cac. This seems the real question, and is all that is needed to explain the Pr differences shown in Fig. 1. The other changes in active zone structure and organization at Is vs Ib may very well contribute to additional differences in Pr, but the authors have not shown this in the present study, and rely on other studies (such as calcium-SV coupling at Is vs Ib) to support an argument that is not necessitated by their data. At the end of this manuscript, the authors have found an interesting possibility that Stj levels are reduced at Is vs Ib, that might perhaps contribute to the difference in calcium influx. However, at present this remains speculative.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors have generated powerful reagents for the field to study calcium channels and how they are regulated, but draw conclusions about active zone structure and organization contributing to functional heterogeneity that are not strongly supported by the data presented.</p>

<p>Reviewer 1 raises an interesting question that we agree will form the basis of important studies. Here, we set out to address a different question, which we will work to better frame. While we and others had previously found a strong correlation between calcium channel abundance and synaptic release probability (Pr (Akbergenova et al., 2018; Gratz et al., 2019; Holderith et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2015; Sheng et al., 2012)), more recent studies found that calcium channel abundance does not necessarily predict synaptic strength (Aldahabi et al., 2022; Rebola et al., 2019). Our study explores this paradox and presents findings that provide an explanation: calcium channel abundance predicts Pr among individual synapses of either low-Pr type-Ib or high-Pr type-Is inputs where modulating channel number tunes synaptic strength, but does not predict Pr between the two inputs, indicating an inputspecific role for calcium channel abundance in promoting synaptic strength. Thus, we propose that calcium channel abundance predictably modulates synaptic strength among individual synapses of a single input or synapse subtype, which share similar molecular and spatial organization, but not between distinct inputs where the underlying organization of active zones differs. Consistently, in the mouse, calcium channel abundance correlates strongly with release probability specifically when assessed among homogeneous populations of connections (Aldahabi et al., 2022; Holderith et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2015; Rebola et al., 2019; Sheng et al., 2012).</p>
<p>As Reviewer 1 notes, the two-fold difference in calcium influx at type-Is synapses is certainly an important difference underlying three-fold higher Pr. However, growing evidence indicates that calcium influx alone, like calcium channel abundance, does not reliably predict synaptic strength between inputs. For example, Rebola et al. (2019) compared cerebellar synapses formed by granule and stellate cells and found that lower Pr granule synapses exhibit both higher calcium channel abundance and calcium influx. In another example, Aldahabi et al. (2023) demonstrate that even when calcium influx is greater at high-Pr synapses, it does not necessarily explain differences in synaptic strength between inputs. Studying excitatory hippocampal CA1 synapses onto distinct interneuronal targets, they found that raising calcium entry at low-Pr inputs to high-Pr synapse levels is not sufficient to increase synaptic strength to high-Pr synapse levels. Similarly, at the Drosophila NMJ, the finding that type-Ib synapses exhibit loose calcium channel-synaptic vesicle coupling whereas type-Is synapses exhibit tight coupling suggests factors beyond calcium influx also contribute to differences in Pr between the two inputs (He et al., 2023). Consistently, a two-fold increase in external calcium does not induce a three-fold increase in release at low-Pr type-Ib synapses (He et al., 2023). Thus, upon finding that calcium channel abundance is similar at type-Ib and -Is synapses, we focused on identifying differences beyond calcium channel abundance and calcium influx that might contribute their distinct synaptic strengths. We agree that these studies, ours included, cannot definitively determine the contribution of identified organizational differences to distinct release probabilities because it is not currently possible to specifically alter subsynaptic organization, and will ensure that our language is tempered accordingly. However, in addition to the studies cited above and our findings, recent work demonstrating that homeostatic potentiation of neurotransmitter release is accompanied by greater spatial compaction of multiple active zone proteins (Dannhauser et al., 2022; Mrestani et al., 2021) and decreased calcium channel mobility (Ghelani et al., 2023) provide support for the interpretation that subsynaptic organization is a key parameter for modulating Pr.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors aim to investigate how voltage-gated calcium channel number, organization, and subunit composition lead to changes in synaptic activity at tonic and phasic motor neuron terminals, or type Is and Ib motor neurons in Drosophila. These neuron subtypes generate widely different physiological outputs, and many investigations have sought to understand the molecular underpinnings responsible for these differences. Additionally, these authors explore not only static differences that exist during the third-instar larval stage of development but also use a pharmacological approach to induce homeostatic plasticity to explore how these neuronal subtypes dynamically change the structural composition and organization of key synaptic proteins contributing to physiological plasticity. The Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is glutamatergic, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain, so these findings not only expand our understanding of the molecular and physiological mechanisms responsible for differences in motor neuron subtype activity but also contribute to our understanding of how the human brain and nervous system functions.</p>
<p>The authors employ state-of-the-art tools and techniques such as single-molecule localization microscopy 3D STORM and create several novel transgenic animals using CRISPR to expand the molecular tools available for exploration of synaptic biology that will be of wide interest to the field. Additionally, the authors use a robust set of experimental approaches from active zone level resolution functional imaging from live preparations to electrophysiology and immunohistochemical analyses to explore and test their hypotheses. All data appear to be robustly acquired and analyzed using appropriate methodology. The authors make important advancements to our understanding of how the different motor neuron subtypes, phasic and tonic-like, exhibit widely varying electrical output despite the neuromuscular junctions having similar ultrastructural composition in the proteins of interest, voltage gated calcium channel cacophony (cac) and the scaffold protein Bruchpilot (brp). The authors reveal the ratio of brp:cac appears to be a critical determinant of release probability (Pr), and in particular, the packing density of VGCCs and availability of brp. Importantly, the authors demonstrate a brp-dependent increase in VGCC density following acute philanthotoxin perfusion (glutamate receptor inhibitor). This VGCC increase appears to be largely responsible for the presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) observable at the Drosophila NMJ. Lastly, the authors created several novel CRISPRtagged transgenic lines to visualize the spatial localization of VGCC subunits in Drosophila. Two of these lines, CaBV5-C and stjV5-N, express in motor neurons and in the nervous system, localize at the NMJ, and most strikingly, strongly correlate with Pr at tonic and phasic-like terminals.</p>
<p>1. The few limitations in this study could be addressed with some commentary, a few minor follow-up analyses, or experiments. The authors use a postsynaptically expressed calcium indicator (mhcGal4&gt;UAS -GCaMP) to calculate Pr, yet do not explore the contribution that glutamate receptors, or other postsynaptic contributors (e.g. components of the postsynaptic density, PSD) may contribute. A previous publication exploring tonic vs phasic-like activity at the drosophila NMJ revealed a dynamic role for GluRII (Aponte-Santiago et al, 2020). Could the speed of GluR accumulation account for differences between neuron subtypes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did observe that GCaMP signals are higher at type Is synapses, where synapses tend to form later but GluRs accumulate more rapidly upon innervation (Aponte-Santiago et al., 2020). However, because we are using our GCaMP indicator as a plus/minus readout of synaptic vesicle release at mature synapses, we do not expect differences in GluR accumulation to have a significant effect on our measures. Consistently, the difference in Pr we observe between type-Ib and -Is inputs (Fig. 1C) is similar to that previously reported (He et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2016; Newman et al., 2022).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The observation that calcium channel density and brp:cac ratio as a critical determinant of Pr is an important one. However, it is surprising that this was not observed in previous investigations of cac intensity (of which there are many). Is this purely a technical limitation of other investigations, or are other possibilities feasible? Additionally, regarding VGCC-SV coupling, the authors conclude that this packing density increases their proximity to SVs and contributes to the steeper relationship between VGCCs and Pr at phasic type Is. Is it possible that brp or other AZ components could account for these differences. The authors possess the tools to address this directly by labeling vesicles with JanellaFluor646; a stronger signal should be present at Is boutons. Additionally, many different studies have used transmission electron microscopy to explore SVs location to AZs (t-bars) at the Drosophila NMJ.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To date, the molecular underpinnings of heterogeneity in synaptic strength have primarily been investigated among individual type-Ib synapses. However, a recent study investigating differences between type-Ib and -Is synapses also found that the Cac:Brp ratio is higher at type-Is synapses (He et al., 2023).</p>
<p>At this point, we do not know which active zone components are responsible for the organizational (Figs. 1, 2) and coupling (now demonstrated by He et al., 2023) differences between type-Ib and -Is synapses or what establishes the differences in active zone protein levels we observe (Figs. 3,6), although Brp likely plays a local role. We find that Brp is required for dynamically regulating calcium channel levels during homeostatic plasticity and plays distinct roles at type-Ib and -Is synapses (Figs. 3, 4). Brp regulates a number of proteins critical for the distribution of docked synaptic vesicles near T bars of type Ib active zones, including Unc13 (Bohme et al., 2016). Extending these studies to type-Is synapses will be of great interest.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In reference to the contradictory observations that VGCC intensity does not always correlate with, or determine Pr. Previous investigations have also observed other AZ proteins or interactors (e.g. synaptotagmin mutants) critically control release, even when the correlation between cac and release remains constant while Pr dramatically precipitates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important point as a number of molecular and organizational differences between high- and low-Pr synapses certainly contribute to baseline functional differences. The other proteins we (Figs. 3,6) and others (Dannhauser et al., 2022; Ehmann et al., 2014; He et al., 2023; Jetti et al., 2023; Mrestani et al., 2021; Newman et al., 2022) have investigated are less abundant and/or more densely organized at type-Is synapses. Investigating additional active zone proteins, including synaptic proteins, and determining how these factors combine to yield increased synaptic strength are important next steps.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. To confirm the observations that lower brp levels results in a significantly higher cac:brp ratio at phasic-like synapses by organizing VGCCs; this argument could be made stronger by analyzing their existing data. By selecting a population of AZs in Ib boutons that endogenously express normal cac and lower brp levels, the Pr from these should be higher than those from within that population, but comparable to Is Pr. I believe the authors should also be able to correlate the cac:brp ratio with Pr from their data set generally; to determine if a strong correlation exists beyond their observation for cac correlation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not have simultaneous measures of Pr and Cac and Brp abundance. However, our findings suggest that distinct Cac:Brp ratios at type Ib and Is inputs reflect underlying organizational differences that contribute to distinct release probabilities between the two synaptic subtypes. In contrast, within either synaptic subtype, release probability is positively correlated with both Cac and Brp levels. Thus, the mechanisms driving functional differences between synaptic subtypes are distinct from those driving functional heterogeneity within a subtype, so we do not expect Cac:Brp ratio to correlate with Pr among individual type-Ib synapses. We will work to clarify this point in the revised text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. For the philanthotoxin induced changes in cac and brp localization underlying PHP, why do the authors not show cac accumulation after PhTx on live dissected preparations (i.e. in real time)? This also be an excellent opportunity to validate their brp:cac theory. Do the authors observe a dynamic change in brp:cac after 1, or 5 minutes; do Is boutons potentiate stronger due to proportional increases in cac and brp? Also regarding PhTx-induced PHP, their observations that stj and α2δ-3 are more abundant at Is synapses, suggests that they may also play a role in PhTx induced changes in cac. If either/both are overexpressed during PhTx, brp should increase while cac remains constant. These accessory proteins may determine cac incorporation at AZs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we have previously followed Cac accumulation in live dissected preparations and found that levels increase proportionally across individual synapses (Gratz et al., 2019), we did not attempt to repeat these challenging experiments at smaller type-Is synapses. We will reanalyze our data to investigate Cac:Brp ratio at individual active zones post PhTx. However, as noted above, we do not expect changes in the Cac:Brp ratio to correlate with Pr among individual synapses of single inputs as this measure reflects organization differences between inputs and PhTx induces an increase in the abundance of both proteins at both inputs.</p>
<p>Determining the effect of PhTx on Stj levels at type-Ib and -Is active zones is an excellent idea and might provide insight into how lower Stj levels correlate with higher Pr at type-Is synapses. While prior studies have demonstrated critical roles for Stj in regulating Cac accumulation during development and in promoting presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (Cunningham et al., 2022; Dickman et al., 2008; Kurshan et al., 2009; Ly  et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2016), its regulation during PHP has not been investigated.</p>

<p>Taken together this study generates important data-driven, conceptional, and theoretical advancements in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of different motor neurons, and our understanding of synaptic biology generally. The data are robust, thoroughly analyzed, appropriately depicted. This study not only generates novel findings but also generated novel molecular tools which will aid future investigations and investigators progress in this field.</p>
