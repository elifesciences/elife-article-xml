<title>Abstract</title>
<p>During thymic development, most γδ T cells acquire innate-like characteristics that are critical for their function in tumor surveillance, infectious disease, and tissue repair. The mechanisms, however, that regulate γδ T cell developmental programming remain unclear. Recently, we demonstrated that the SLAM-SAP signaling pathway regulates the development and function of multiple innate-like γδ T cell subsets. Here, we used a single-cell proteogenomics approach to identify SAP-dependent developmental checkpoints and to define the SAP-dependent γδ TCR repertoire. SAP deficiency resulted in both a significant loss of an immature <italic>Gzma</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Blk<sup>+</sup>Etv5<sup>+</sup>Tox2<sup>+</sup></italic> γδT17 precursor population, and a significant increase in <italic>Cd4<sup>+</sup>Cd8<sup>+</sup> Rorc<sup>+</sup>Ptcra<sup>+</sup>Rag1<sup>+</sup></italic> thymic γδ T cells. SAP-dependent diversion of embryonic day 17 thymic γδ T cell clonotypes into the αβ T cell developmental pathway was associated with a decreased frequency of mature clonotypes in neonatal thymus, and an altered γδ TCR repertoire in the periphery. Finally, we identify TRGV4/TRAV13-4(DV7)-expressing T cells as a novel, SAP-dependent Vγ4 γδT1 subset. Together, the data suggest that SAP-dependent γδ/αβ T cell lineage commitment regulates γδ T cell developmental programming and shapes the γδ TCR repertoire.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Like αβ T cells, γδ T cells can be broadly grouped into innate-like IFN-γ-producing γδT1, IL-4-producing γδT2, or IL-17-producing γδT17 subsets that are programmed during thymic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, or inducible subsets that differentiate in the periphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The innate-like γδ T cells are unconventional T cells that are highly enriched in mucosal tissues such as the skin, gut, and lung and that play critical roles in the host response to pathogens, in tumor surveillance, and in autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The mechanisms, however, that determine whether a developing γδ T cell acquires an innate-like phenotype during thymic development remain unclear.</p>
<p>A significant body of data supports a model in which weak or strong TCR signal strength might contribute to the development of innate-like γδT17 (weak signal) and γδT1 (strong signal) subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, and a strong TCR signal has been suggested to be necessary for the development of the IFN-γ and IL-4 producing γδNKT cell subset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, there is also evidence of a TCR-independent model in which pre-existing hard-wired transcriptional programs regulate the development of some innate-like γδΤ17 subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and accumulating data suggest that γδT17 programming is associated with the use of distinct signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>SLAM family receptors comprise a family of nine receptors, SLAMF1 (SLAM; CD150), SLAMF2 (CD48), SLAMF3 (Ly9; CD229), SLAMF4 (2B4; CD244), SLAMF5 (CD84), SLAMF6 (Ly108; CD352), SLAMF7 (CRACC; CD319), SLAMF8 (BLAME), and SLAMF9 (SF2001; CD84H), that are expressed primarily on hematopoietic cells and which play diverse roles in immune development and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Most SLAM family receptors interact in a homophilic manner, the exception to this rule being SLAMF4 which serves as the ligand for SLAMF2. SLAM family receptor signals can be both activating or inhibitory, depending on the recruitment of the cytosolic signaling adapter proteins SAP and EAT-2, and inhibitory SHP-1, SHP-2, or SHIP phosphatases to immunoreceptor tyrosine switch motifs in the SLAM family receptor cytoplasmic domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Although SLAM/SAP signaling has long been known to play a role in innate-like NKT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and γδNKT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> cell development, recent findings from multiple groups demonstrating that this pathway is also involved in the development of innate-like γδT1, γδT17<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and innate-like MAIT cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> indicates that SLAM/SAP signaling plays a fundamental role in the development of a majority of the innate-like T cell lineages.</p>
<p>In this study, we set out to define the stage of thymic development during which SAP mediates its effect on γδ T cell developmental programming and to define SAP-dependent changes in the γδ T cells transcriptional program during their development. Finally, since SAP-dependent innate-like T cell subsets are often characterized by highly restricted TCRs (e.g., Vγ1<sup>+</sup>/Vδ6.3<sup>+</sup> γδNKT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>), we wished to identify whether specific TCR clonotypes were also associated with SAP-dependent γδT1 and γδT17 T cells. Therefore, we utilized a single-cell proteogenomics approach with V(D)J profiling that allowed us to simultaneously compare cell surface protein expression, gene expression, and TCR clonotypes between B6 and B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> γδ T cells from embryonic, neonatal, and adult thymus, as well as from peripheral lung γδ T cells. Collectively, these data provide a comprehensive map of the SAP-dependent γδ T cell subsets and their developmental checkpoints in perinatal and adult thymus.</p>

<title>SLAM family receptor expression marks transcriptionally distinct developmental stages among E17 γδ T cells</title>
<p>γδT17 developmental programming is thought to occur primarily during embryonic/neonatal thymic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and is tightly linked to the expression of discrete TCR gamma and delta pairings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. To identify the specific developmental stages of thymic development during which SLAM/SAP signaling pathway exerts its effects, we employed a single-cell RNAseq approach coupled with feature barcoding (i.e., CITEseq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>) and V(D)J profiling to compare embryonic day 17 (E17) B6 and B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> thymic γδ T cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). FACS-sorted thymic γδ T cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref></bold>) from individual embryos (n = 4 B6 and 4 B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice) were identified using hashtags, and Vg1<sup>+</sup> and Vg4<sup>+</sup> gd T cells were identified using barcoded antibodies (ADTs). To help define the developmental trajectories of the E17 gd T cells, we also stained cells with barcoded antibodies specific for CD24, CD73, CD44, and CD45RB which define distinct developmental pathways of γδT17 and γδT1 cells in the thymus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, as well as for SLAMF1 and SLAMF6. After data filtering and QC, we verified that clusters were evenly distributed among the biological replicates (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref></bold>). The resulting dataset represented a total of 5278 thymic γδ T cells from B6 (n = 2597) and B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> (n = 2681) γδ T cells. Data were visualized using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and a graph-based clustering approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>First, we annotated the B6 dataset using a combination of cell surface protein expression, gene expression, and TCR clonotype sequence. This analysis revealed 11 B6 E17 γδ T cell clusters, mostly distributed between two major branches (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). We observed the presence of CD24<sup>low</sup>73<sup>low</sup>44<sup>high</sup>45RB<sup>low</sup>SLAMF1<sup>pos</sup> (c8) and CD24<sup>low</sup>73<sup>high</sup>44<sup>high</sup>45RB<sup>high</sup>SLAMF6<sup>low/pos</sup> (c0, c9) clusters, consistent with mature γδT17 phenotype and γδT1 phenotypes, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>).</bold> In support of this annotation, the c8 cluster was enriched in <italic>Il17a</italic>, <italic>Il17f, Il23r, Rorc</italic>, and TRGV6/TRDV4 (IMGT nomenclature; encoding Vγ6/Vδ1) transcripts with limited CDR3 diversity, while the c0/c9 cluster was enriched in <italic>Ifng</italic>, <italic>Tbx21, Klrd1</italic>, <italic>Il2rb, Xcl1,</italic> and TRGV5/TRDV4 (encoding Vγ5/Vδ1) transcripts also with little to no diversity (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1D – F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>, Suppl. Tables 1 and 2</bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, we noted that the c0/c9 cluster was highly enriched in <italic>Cd244a</italic> (<italic>Slamf4</italic>), and was also enriched in transcripts from another SLAM family member, <italic>Slamf7</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1D - E</xref></bold>). Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that SLAMF7 was expressed primarily on mature γδ T cells and that its expression was mostly confined to γδ T cells expressing the canonical CD44<sup>+</sup>CD45RB<sup>+</sup> markers of γδT1 cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref></bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We identified a small CD24<sup>low/int</sup>73<sup>high</sup>44<sup>high</sup>45RB<sup>pos</sup> c3 cluster characterized by enrichment in <italic>Cd200</italic> (whose expression is upregulated upon TCR ligation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>), <italic>Il2rb, Nr4a1, Cd244a</italic>, <italic>Xcl1,</italic> and <italic>Tnfrsf9</italic> (encoding 4-1bb receptor). A high frequency of invariant TRGV5/TRDV4 clonotypes and decreased TCR clonotype diversity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>, Suppl. Table 2)</bold> suggested that c3 represented an immature γδT1 population. The CD24<sup>low/pos</sup>CD73<sup>low/pos</sup>44<sup>low/pos</sup>CD45RB<sup>low/pos</sup> c4 cluster was enriched in <italic>Ms4a4b and Ms4a6b (</italic>encoding CD20 homologues that modulate T cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>), <italic>S1pr1</italic>, <italic>Il6ra, Cd8a, Cd8b1,</italic> and <italic>Ccr9,</italic> suggesting that the c4 cluster represents the previously described emigrating thymic <italic>Ccr9</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>S1pr1</italic><sup>+</sup> γδ T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref></bold>). Consistent with the c4 cluster representing naïve emigrating thymic γδ T cells, the diversity of the c4 TCR clonotypes was the highest among the CD24<sup>low/int</sup> (c0/c9, c8, c3) clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>).</bold></p>
<p>We identified several immature CD24<sup>high</sup>CD73<sup>neg</sup> ADT clusters (c1, c2, c7, c5, c6, and c10) that also expressed SLAMF1 and/or SLAMF6 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Fig 1</xref></bold>). The c1 and c2 clusters were enriched in γδT17-associated genes such as <italic>Blk, Maf, Sox13, Ccr2, Tcf12, and Rorc</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, as well as <italic>Sh2d1a</italic> (encoding SAP) and <italic>Ccr9</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, Suppl. Table 1)</bold>. Within these two clusters, the CD44<sup>low/pos</sup>CD45RB<sup>low</sup> c2 cluster was especially enriched in genes previously implicated in γδ T cell development such as <italic>Etv5, Tox, Sox4, Tcf7</italic>, <italic>Zbtb16</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, <italic>Igfbp4</italic> and <italic>Igf1r</italic> which were recently implicated in Th17 differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, <italic>Tnfsf11</italic> (RANKL) which regulates Aire<sup>+</sup> mTEC development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, as well as <italic>Themis</italic> and <italic>Tox2</italic> <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>)</bold>. A high level of <italic>Gzma</italic> expression identified c2 as the previously described <italic>Gzma</italic><sup>+</sup> γδ T cell subset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Interestingly, although enriched in genes associated with a γδT17 signature, the c2 cluster was also enriched in γδT2-associated <italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Il4</italic> transcripts (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D – E</xref>, Suppl. Table 1</bold>). The CD44<sup>low/pos</sup>CD45RB<sup>neg</sup> c1 cluster, in contrast, exhibited significantly higher levels of <italic>Il17a, Il17f, Rorc</italic>, <italic>Maf</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, as well as <italic>Ifngr1,</italic> consistent with the c1 cluster representing immature γδT17 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> – E, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Analysis of the c1 and c2 TCR transcripts revealed that the c2 cluster was notably enriched in TRGV4-expressing cells and that 87% of Vγ4 T cells utilized just 3 TRDV chains (50% TRDV5, 24% TRDV2-2, and 12% TRAV13-4/DV7) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, Suppl. Table 2</bold>). Clonotype analysis revealed a high frequency of semi-invariant TRGV4/TRDV5 and TRGV4/TRDV2-2 clonotypes previously associated with γδT17<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>, Suppl. Table 2</bold>). In contrast, the c1 cluster possessed comparatively fewer of these TRGV4 clonotypes, and was enriched in TRGV6, TRGV5, and TRGV1 paired with TRDV4 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>, Suppl. Table 2)</bold>. Indeed, we noted that the Vγ1 repertoire, which is diverse in adult tissues, was dominated by TRGV1/TRDV4 clonotypes (35% of all TRGV1) in E17 thymus, and just two closely related semi-invariant TRGV1/TRDV4 clonotypes comprised 17.4% of all TRGV1. The location of these clonotypes in the immature γδT17-related clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>)</bold> suggested that they represent the dominant IL-17-producing Vγ1 clonotypes at E17, which we verified using flow cytometry (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Suppl.

<p>Since the IL-4-producing Vγ1/Vδ6.3 γδNKT cell subset has been shown to develop in fetal thymus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, we asked whether the <italic>Il4</italic>-enriched γδ T cells in cluster 2 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>) were immature Vγ1 γδNKT cells with previously identified canonical Vδ6.3 sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Interestingly, while we did identify a small number of Vγ1 T cells with these canonical sequences (encoded by TRAV15-1/DV6-1 or TRAV15N-1) in our dataset, these were not present in the <italic>Il4</italic>-enriched c2 cluster.</p>
<p>The CD44<sup>pos</sup>CD45RB<sup>pos</sup> c5 cluster was enriched in <italic>Il2ra</italic>, <italic>Scin, Bex6, Cd5, Slamf6, Cd28, Hivep3</italic>, and cell-cycle/metabolism genes, consistent with γδ T cells that have recently developed from DN2/DN3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Within the c5 and c7 clusters, we noted that while there was expression of γδT17-associated genes such as <italic>Blk, Maf, Sox13,</italic> and <italic>Etv5</italic>, there was relatively little <italic>Rorc</italic> expression. <italic>Rorc</italic> expression became apparent in the c2 cluster (<italic>Rorc<sup>low</sup></italic>) and was significantly increased in the c1 cluster (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>)</bold>. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed BLK and PLZF expression in CD25<sup>high</sup> E17 Vγ4 T cells, while RORγt expression was primarily observed in the CD25<sup>neg</sup> population, suggesting that BLK is expressed soon after γδ T cell selection, followed by RORγt (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Suppl.

These data were consistent with MAF-directed expression of <italic>Rorc</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> and suggested a c5 – c7 – c2 – c10 / c1 – c8 γδT17 developmental trajectory, which was supported by trajectory inference analysis <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>).</bold></p>
<p>Finally, analysis of the CD24<sup>high</sup>73<sup>neg</sup>44<sup>neg</sup>45RB<sup>int</sup>SLAMF1<sup>pos</sup>SLAMF6<sup>pos</sup> c6 population revealed that it was highly enriched in <italic>Cd8a, Cd8b1, Cd4, Rag1, Rag2, Ptcra, Arpp21, and Dgkeos,</italic> consistent with cells developing along the αβ T cell lineage <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1E</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl.

<p>Since trajectory inference analysis suggested a strong relationship between the <italic>Il2ra<sup>+</sup></italic> c5 and c6 clusters (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref></bold>), we conducted differential gene expression analysis between the c5 and c6 from B6 mice. Interestingly, we found that the c6 cluster was highly enriched in <italic>Rorc,</italic> suggestive of a γδT17 phenotype, but was mostly lacking in the expression of <italic>Maf, Blk, Ccr2</italic>, and other canonical γδT17-associated transcripts (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl.

Indeed, flow cytometric analysis of E17 TCRβ<sup>neg</sup>TCRδ<sup>pos</sup> γδ T cells confirmed that CD4CD8 DP γδ T cells exhibited an immature CD44<sup>low</sup>CD25<sup>low</sup>MAF<sup>neg</sup>BLK<sup>neg</sup>RORγt<sup>pos</sup> phenotype (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Suppl.

<title>SAP regulates γδ T cell clonotype diversion into both the γδT17 and the αβ T cell developmental pathways</title>
<p>To identify SAP-dependent developmental checkpoints, we next compared the hashtag-separated B6 and B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> E17 γδ T cell datasets. A comparison of the cluster frequencies between B6 and B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> γδ T cells revealed significantly decreased frequencies of the CD24<sup>high</sup>73<sup>neg</sup>44<sup>int</sup>45RB<sup>int</sup>SLAMF1<sup>pos</sup>SLAMF6<sup>pos</sup> c2 and c1 clusters in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice, and a striking increase in the frequency of the CD24<sup>high</sup>73<sup>neg</sup>44<sup>neg</sup>45RB<sup>neg</sup>SLAMF1<sup>high</sup>SLAMF6<sup>high</sup> c6 cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>)</bold>. A comparison of differentially expressed genes among the immature (c1, c2, c7, c5, c6, and c10) clusters using pseudobulk analysis revealed 234 differentially expressed genes with a p<sub>adj</sub> threshold &lt; 0.005 and log<sub>2</sub> fold change greater than 0.5, with 148 genes exhibiting decreased expression in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> γδ T cells, and 86 genes exhibiting increased expression (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, Suppl.

Consistent with the decreased frequencies of the c1/c2 clusters in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice, a significant fraction of the differentially expressed genes that were down-regulated in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice reflected γδT17-associated genes (e.g., <italic>Maf, Blk, Ccr2, Sox13, Etv5, etc.</italic>) that were present in the c2 and c1 clusters, as well as a number of c1/c2-enriched genes (e.g., <italic>Cpa3, Tox2, Pdcd1, Tmem121, Bex6</italic>, and <italic>Scin</italic>) whose importance in γδ T cell development is unclear (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>, Suppl.

<p>Next, we asked whether these SAP-dependent alterations in γδ T cell development were associated with any changes in the TCR repertoire. A comparison of all γδ TCR clonotypes between E17 B6 and B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> γδ T cells revealed no significant changes in overall clonotype frequency (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>). However, a closer examination of TCR repertoire revealed significant changes in the distribution of specific TCR clonotypes. For example, within the TRGV4 repertoire, which represents the dominant TCR among immature clusters at E17, we observed a significant decrease in TRGV4/TRDV5 clonotypes in the c2 cluster and a concomitant increase of these clonotypes in the c6 cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). Among the TRGV4 clonotypes, this appeared to be specific to the TRDV5 clonotypes, as we observed no significant differences c2 and c6 frequencies among TRGV4/TRDV2-2 and TRDV7 clonotypes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). We did note, however, a significant increase in the TRGV4/TRDV7 clonotypes in the <italic>Il2ra<sup>+</sup></italic> c5 cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). Within the TRGV1 repertoire, we noted a significant increase in TRGV1/TRDV4 clonotypes within the c6 cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). Together, these data suggested that SAP operated at an early stage of γδ T cell development during or soon after the down-regulation of <italic>Il2ra,</italic> and that it positively regulated entry into the γδT17 pathway at the c5/c7 to c2 transition, while at the same time inhibiting entry into the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> αβ T cell-like c6 cluster. The net result of these changes appeared to be that specific TCR clonotypes such as TRGV4/TRDV5 were diverted from the γδT17 pathway into the αβ T cell-like pathway.</p>

<title>SAP deficiency is associated with increased numbers of immature CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>RORγt<sup>+</sup> thymic γδ T cells</title>
<p>Next, we independently evaluated these observations using flow cytometry.

We also noted that in addition to its effect on the numbers of immature thymic γδT17, SAP deficiency resulted in the reduced expression levels of some of these markers, most notably BLK (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>), a finding that was consistent with the decreased number of <italic>Blk</italic> transcripts observed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.

<p>A comparison of B6 and B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> neonatal gd T cells revealed multiple SAP-dependent changes in clustering. Among the immature γδ T cells, we observed a decreased frequency of the immature CD24<sup>high</sup>73<sup>neg</sup>SLAMF1<sup>pos</sup>SLAMF6<sup>pos</sup> c1 cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref></bold>) that was enriched in <italic>Blk, Etv5, Sox13, Rorc,</italic> and <italic>Maf</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Suppl. Fig. 6</xref></bold>), suggesting it was analogous to the SAP-dependent c2 cluster in E17 γδ T cells. Similar to our observations in E17 γδ T cells, flow cytometric analysis confirmed both a decrease in BLK<sup>pos</sup>RORγt<sup>pos</sup> and BLK<sup>pos</sup>RORγt<sup>neg</sup> γδ T cell populations, as well as a decreased level of BLK expression (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-F</xref></bold>). In addition, we observed an increased frequency of immature CD24<sup>high</sup>73<sup>neg</sup>SLAMF1<sup>pos</sup>SLAMF6<sup>pos</sup> cluster with characteristics of αβ T cells (c14) in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> D9 thymic γδ T cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Suppl. Fig. 6</xref></bold>). While this increase did not reach the level of significance, presumably due to the very low number of c14 cells in the dataset, flow cytometric analysis revealed a significant increase in immature CD24<sup>pos</sup>73<sup>neg</sup>BLK<sup>neg</sup>RORgt<sup>pos</sup> gd T cells, a phenotype consistent with gd T cells that have been diverted to the ab developmental pathway (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref></bold>). Last, we observed an increased frequency of immature CD24<sup>pos</sup>73<sup>low/pos</sup> SLAMF1<sup>pos</sup>SLAMF6<sup>pos</sup> <italic>S1pr1</italic>-enriched c4 and c5 clusters, but not the closely related <italic>Cd200</italic>- enriched c10 cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</bold> While we did confirm an increased number CD200<sup>neg</sup>S1pr1<sup>pos</sup> γδ T cells in neonatal thymus by flow cytometry, this increase was relatively small and its significance is unclear <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Suppl. Fig. 7</xref>).</bold> Independent confirmation of these SAP-dependent changes in neonatal γδ T cell gene expression was obtained by conducting bulk RNAseq analysis of FACSs-sorted CD24<sup>high</sup> neonatal thymic γδ T cells from B6 and B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<bold>Suppl. Table 4</bold>).</p>
<p>Among the mature neonatal γδ T cells, we observed a decreased frequency of the CD24<sup>low</sup>73<sup>neg</sup>SLAMF1<sup>pos</sup>F6<sup>low</sup> γδT17 c6 cluster which was consistent with our previous observation of decreased IL-17 production in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> neonatal γδ T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we observed a striking loss of the CD24<sup>low</sup>73<sup>high</sup>SLAMF1<sup>low</sup>F6<sup>high</sup>F7<sup>neg</sup> γδT2 c13 cluster in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice, as well as a decreased frequency of the mature CD24<sup>low</sup>73<sup>high</sup>SLAMF1<sup>low</sup>F6<sup>low</sup>F7<sup>high</sup> γδT1 c8 cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A - D</xref></bold>). These findings were consistent with a SAP-dependent loss of both the IL-4- and IFN-γ-producing γδNKT as well as non-γδNKT γδT1 cells (discussed further below). Unfortunately, while we were able to define mature SAP-dependent γδNKT subsets, we found no evidence of immature γδNKT cells in our dataset, suggesting that they develop during a brief developmental window between E17 and D9 after birth.</p>
<p>A comparison of B6 adult thymic γδ T cells between B6 and B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice recapitulated many of our observations of the neonatal thymus, although to a somewhat lesser degree. For example, we observed a small but significant decrease in the frequency of the CD24<sup>high</sup>CD73<sup>low</sup> adult thymic c1 and c2 clusters in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice that was coupled with an increased frequency of the CD24<sup>pos</sup>CD73<sup>+/-</sup> c0 cluster <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Suppl. Fig. 8</xref>)</bold>. Like the SAP-dependent E17 c2 and D9 c1 clusters, the adult thymus c1 and c2 clusters were enriched in γδT17-associated <italic>Blk, Etv5, Sox13</italic>, <italic>Maf,</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> (mostly in c2) indicating that SAP regulates this γδ T cell thymic developmental checkpoint at all ages. Likewise, the adult thymus c0 cluster that was increased in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice was enriched in <italic>Ms4a4b, Ms4a6b, Dgka, Klf2,</italic> and <italic>S1pr1</italic> similar to the neonatal c4 and c5 clusters whose frequencies were increased in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> γδ T cells. Just as we observed in neonatal thymic γδ T cells, we noted a near complete loss of mature γδNKT cells (<italic>Zbtb16, Icos</italic>, and <italic>Il4</italic>-enriched γδT2 c8 cells and <italic>Tbx21, Slamf7</italic>, and <italic>Il2rb-</italic>enriched γδT1 c11 cells) as well as a decreased frequency of mature non-γδNKT γδT1 c10 cluster cells in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> adult thymus (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Suppl. Fig. 8</xref></bold>). Unlike the E17 and neonatal thymic datasets, however, the frequency of γδ T cells with an αβ T cell-like signature in the adult thymic γδ T cell dataset was minimal. Collectively, these data supported the presence of multiple SAP-dependent developmental checkpoints during neonatal and adult γδ T cell development—a reduction in the CD24<sup>pos</sup>CD73<sup>neg</sup> SLAMF1<sup>+</sup>SLAMF6<sup>+</sup> cluster enriched in γδT17 development-associated transcripts, an increased frequency of immature <italic>S1pr1</italic>-enriched γδ T cells, and decreased frequencies of both γδNKT cells (γδT1 and γδT2) as well as non-γδNKT γδT1 cells.</p>

<title>SAP shapes the thymic γδ TCR repertoire</title>
<p>Given our observation of altered γδ TCR clonotype distribution among E17 γδ T cells and the substantial changes in clustering we observed in SAP-deficient mice, we were next interested in determining the effect of SAP deficiency on the neonatal and adult γδ TCR repertoires. A comparison of frequencies of the top 100 TCR clonotypes between B6 and B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice revealed significant changes in the overall frequency of several TRGV1 and TRGV4 clonotypes (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>). Consistent with a SAP-dependent loss of γδNKT, we observed a profound loss of TRGV1 clonotypes utilizing the canonical TRAV15N-1 and TRAV15-1/TRDV6-1 γδNKT cell TCRs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). Loss of these clonotypes was directly tied to the significant decrease of the γδT1 c8 and γδT2 c13 clusters, in which nearly all these clonotypes resided.</p>
<p>Within the B6 γδT2 c13 cluster the vast majority (∼86%) of TCR sequences were highly restricted canonical γδNKT cell clonotypes <bold>(Suppl. Table 2</bold>) and nearly all of these clonotypes were also present in the γδT1 c8 cluster consistent with the ability of γδNKT cells to produce both IFN-γ and IL-4. In contrast, while the B6 γδT1 c8 cluster contained a large proportion of canonical γδNKT cell clonotypes (∼46% of c8 TCRs), it also contained TCRs with a diverse pool of clonotypes that utilized TRGV1 (∼70% of c8 TCRs), TRGV4, TRGV5, TRGV6, and TRGV7 and were present only in the c8 γδT1 cluster. Therefore, in neonates, the thymic γδT1 population is a mixture of γδNKT and “non-γδNKT” γδT1 clonotypes, and each of these clonotype pools is diminished in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice. As noted above, these findings were largely reproduced in the adult thymus where the γδNKT clonotypes associated with the c8 and c11 clusters were virtually absent in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice, and where the diverse pool of γδT1 c10 clonotypes was significantly diminished (<bold>Suppl. Table 2)</bold>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a closer examination of the neonatal thymic TRGV4 clonotypes revealed a significant decrease in the frequencies of γδT17-associated clonotypes with a germline-encoded TRDV5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>), some of which were identical to those that were redistributed to the αβ T cell-like c6 cluster in E17 γδ T cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>)</bold>. When these clonotypes were mapped to their D9 clusters, we noted a significant decrease in the frequency of TRGV4/TRDV5 clonotypes in the mature γδT17 c6 cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref></bold>). We note that while we observed a trend toward an increased frequency of TRGV4/TRDV5 and TRGV4/TRDV2 clonotypes in the <italic>S1pr1</italic><sup>+</sup> c4/c5 clusters, analysis of these sequences revealed that they largely exhibited diverse CDR3 rather than the restricted CDR3 observed in the γδT17 c6 cluster (<bold>Suppl. Table 2</bold>). Taken together, these data indicate that the TCR clonotypes of immature embryonic day 17 γδ T cells that were redirected to the αβ T cell pathway in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice, were underrepresented among the mature B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> neonatal γδ T cells.</p>

<title>Restricted TCR repertoire in innate-like γδT1 as well as γδT17 in the periphery</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated that SAP-deficiency results in a significant impairment in γδ T cell function in the periphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Specifically, we observed that γδ T cell IL-17 production is impaired in the lungs of young mice, but that this had largely corrected itself as the mouse reached maturity. In contrast, we observed that both Vγ1 and Vγ4 IFN-γ production were significantly impaired in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> adult lung and spleen. To better understand how SAP-dependent alterations in thymic development ultimately affected the peripheral γδ T cell compartment, we compared B6 and B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> lungs using single-cell RNAseq with V(D)J profiling.</p>
<p>Our initial annotation of the B6 lung γδ T cell transcriptome revealed the presence of 11 clusters of the lung γδ T cells that we annotated based on cluster-specific gene expression and TRGV and TRDV usage (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). Based on their expression of signature cytokines and transcription factors, we identified 2 γδT17 clusters (c1 and c4), 4 γδT1 clusters (c2, c3, c7, and c9), 1 γδTNKT-like cluster (c10) with very few cells, as well as a <italic>Cd24</italic>-enriched cluster (c5)(<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>, Suppl. Table 5</bold>). Consistent with previous observations, we noted that the c1 and c4 γδT17 clusters were enriched in <italic>Slamf1</italic> and that the c2/c3/c7/c9 γδT1 clusters were enriched in <italic>Slamf7</italic> and <italic>Slamf6</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). Indeed, flow cytometric analysis revealed that SLAMF7 expression was restricted to the innate-like lung CD44<sup>+</sup>CD45RB<sup>+</sup> γδT1 cell population, and that γδT1 cells are SLAMF1<sup>-</sup>F6<sup>+</sup>F7<sup>+</sup>, while the CD44<sup>+</sup>CD45RB<sup>-</sup> γδT17 subsets are SLAMF1<sup>+</sup>F6<sup>-</sup>F7<sup>-</sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref></bold>). Further annotation using V(D)J profiling revealed that the c1 cluster corresponded to Vγ4 γδT17 (primarily TRGV4/TRDV5 and TRGV4/TRDV2-2) while the c4 cluster corresponded to lung Vγ6 (TRGV6/TRDV4) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>, Suppl.

The c10 cluster was enriched in <italic>Zbtb16</italic>, <italic>Il4</italic>, and <italic>Icos</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-C</xref></bold>) as well as TRGV1/TRAV15N-1 and TRGV1/TRDV6 sequences (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref></bold>, <bold>Suppl. Table 6</bold>) consistent with γδNKT cells. We did note, however, that the TRAV15N-1 and TRDV6 sequences in the c10 cluster were, for the most part, non-canonical γδNKT cell clonotypes, suggesting a degree of flexibility in the TRAV15N-1 and TRDV6 CDR3 sequences that can be utilized by γδNKT cells.</p>

<p>Interestingly, while the γδT1 c2/c3/c7/c9 clusters contained primarily Vγ1 and Vγ4 T cells as expected, we noted that Vγ4 γδT1 cells exhibited a striking preference in the usage of TRAV13-4(DV7), and that TRGV4/TRDV7 pairings accounted for 80% of all Vγ4 clonotypes in the γδT1 clusters <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>, Suppl. Table 6</bold>). Analysis of the γδT1 TRAV13-4/DV7 CDR3 sequences revealed a high level of diversity that showed no evidence of clonal expansions (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref></bold>). This was in contrast to the highly restricted Vγ6 repertoire in the c4 γδT17 cluster, as well as the restricted Vγ4 repertoire in the c2 γδT17 cluster that was dominated by semi-invariant TRDV5 and TRDV2-2 sequences (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref></bold>). As no Vδ7-specific antibody was available, we independently confirmed this observation using single-cell PCR to assess the lung Vγ4 CDR3δ sequences from 13 individual mice. These data demonstrated that, other than TRDV2-2 and TRDV5, TRDV7 is the only other TCR delta chain used at an appreciable frequency by Vγ4 T cells in the B6 mouse lung and that it exhibits significant diversity in its CDR3 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Suppl. Fig. 9</xref></bold>). Vγ1 γδT1 cells, in contrast, exhibited a more mild pairing preference where 44% of the γδT1 clonotypes utilized TRAV15N-1, TRAV15-1/DV6-1, or TRAV15D-2/DV6D-2 and 13% utilized TRAV13-4/DV7 (<bold>Suppl. Table 6</bold>). Together these data formed a comprehensive map of B6 lung γδ T cell transcriptomes and revealed that lung innate-like γδT1, like γδT17 and γδNKT, are all characterized by preferential TCR γ- and δ-chain pairings. This was especially notable for Vγ4 and our data suggested that Vγ4 γδT1 exhibited a distinct preference for the utilization of TRAV13-4(DV7) chains with diverse CDR3.</p>

<p>Next, we assessed the effect of SAP deficiency on the lung γδ TCR repertoire by comparing B6 and B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> lung γδ T cells (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref></bold>). Consistent with our previous observation that lung γδ T cell IFN-γ production is decreased in SAP-deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, we observed a decrease in the frequency of the γδT1 c2, c3, and c7 clusters (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref></bold>).

<p>In addition to the decrease in lung γδT1, we also noted a loss of the c10 γδT2 cluster consistent with the enrichment in SAP-dependent γδNKT TCRs in this cluster, and we observed an increased frequency of the Vγ4 γδT17 c1 cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref></bold>). Given our previous observation of a SAP-dependent decrease in lung γδ T cell IL-17 production in young, but not adult mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and our findings here of SAP-dependent alterations in γδT17 clonotypes, we were interested in determining whether the adult lung γδT17 repertoire was altered in SAP-deficient mice. Indeed, a comparison of the lung Vγ4 c1 γδT17 CDR3 sequences between B6 and B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice revealed significant alterations in the γδT17 c1 cluster TCR repertoire. Specifically, we noted a decreased frequency of TRGV4 chains that exhibited a germline-encoded CDR3γ (CSYGYSS) and an increased frequency of TRGV4 chains with a CDR3γ exhibiting evidence of N/P additions (CSYG(X)YSS). These changes were associated with a significant shift in the usage of TRDV2-2 CDR3δ sequence usage (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref></bold>) and an altered c1 TCR clonotype frequency in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref></bold>). Although the number of germline-encoded invariant TRGV4/TRDV5 clone (clonotype 1 in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) was diminished in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> lung γδ T cells (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>, Suppl. Table 6</bold>), the low numbers of cells available for analysis precluded us from making strong conclusions regarding the loss of any one particular clonotype. Taken together, these data suggest that Vγ4 γδT1 preferentially utilize the TRAV13-4(DV7) chain in the lung and that the SAP-dependent decrease in peripheral γδ T cell IFN-γ production is not due to dysregulated cytokine production, but rather due to a specific loss of innate-like γδT1 subsets. This finding, together with our finding that the adult lung γδT17 TCR repertoire is altered in SAP-deficient mice suggests that SLAM/SAP signaling plays a role in shaping the γδ TCR repertoire.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A common denominator in most innate-like T cell developmental programming is a dependence on the SLAM/SAP signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. In the γδ T cell lineage, SAP plays a critical role in the development of IFN-γ and IL-4-producing γδNKT cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, as well as in γδT1 and γδT17<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, but exactly when during γδ T cell development SAP functions, and how it exerts these effects is unknown. Here, we provide evidence that SAP mediates its effects on immature, uncommitted thymic γδ T cells and that it works to simultaneously promote progression through the γδT17 developmental pathway while inhibiting the diversion of γδ T cells into the αβ T cell pathway. The redirection of γδ T cell clonotypes into the αβ T cell pathway at E17 is associated with a decreased frequency of these mature clonotypes in neonatal thymus, and an altered γδT17 TCR repertoire in the periphery. Finally, we identify Vγ4/Vδ7 T cells as a novel, SAP-dependent IFN-γ-producing Vγ4 γδT1 subset.</p>
<p>The developmental pathway(s) that gives rise to γδ T cell functional subsets remains unclear. γδ T cells develop at the DN2/DN3 stage after receiving a sufficiently strong γδTCR-mediated signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Within the continuum of signals that can drive γδ T cell development, it is the relatively weaker TCR signals that promote γδT17 programming while the stronger TCR signals foster γδNKT and γδT1 programming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Despite considerable effort, the precise thymic developmental stages at which γδ T cell lineage diversification occurs remains unclear. Recent studies examining this issue have demonstrated that effector programming can occur at a CD44<sup>neg</sup>CD45RB<sup>neg</sup> stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and that c-Maf-directed γδT17 programming occurs at a CD45RB<sup>low</sup> stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In addition, by altering TCR signal strength in a transgenic model, Chen et al., defined a <italic>Ccr9</italic>-enriched cluster as a point of effector lineage diversification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Our findings here suggest that SAP influences γδT17 developmental programming during the immature uncommitted CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD73<sup>neg</sup> stage, either during or soon after <italic>Il2ra (</italic>CD25) downregulation. The SAP-dependent c2 cluster we define here was highly enriched in numerous genes (e.g., <italic>Sox13</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup><italic>, Blk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup><italic>, Maf</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup><italic>, Etv5</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup><italic>, Sh2d1a</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>) previously associated with γδT17 development as well as <italic>Ccr9</italic>, and the cell surface phenotype of c2 γδ T cells is SLAMF1<sup>pos</sup>SLAMF6<sup>pos</sup>CD44<sup>low/high</sup>CD45RB<sup>low</sup>. Altogether, these data suggest that the SAP-dependent c2 cluster is identical to these previously defined developmental checkpoints. Given that these previous studies have demonstrated that this developmental checkpoint is influenced by TCR signaling, it is interesting to note that SLAM/SAP signaling has previously been demonstrated to foster semi-invariant NKT cell differentiation through its ability to regulate TCR signal strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To that end, we noted that in addition to a decrease in the number of immature γδ T cells expressing BLK, the expression level of BLK was decreased in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> γδ T cells. BLK is a member of the Src tyrosine kinase family whose members also include LCK and FYN. All three of these kinases have been implicated in γδ T cell development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> and BLK has been shown to promote γδT17 development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Thus, it’s possible that decreased BLK expression could contribute to the impaired γδT17 development observed in SAP-deficient mice. In addition, since SAP has been shown to regulate conventional αβ T cell differentiation through its ability to interact with FYN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, it’s possible that SAP interacts with one or all of these Src kinase family members to exert its effects. Whether SAP works to regulate TCR signal strength during γδ T cell development, or whether it exerts its effects through a TCR-independent mechanism is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our finding that, in addition to regulating the frequency of the c2 cluster, SAP inhibits the number of γδ T cells that enter the αβ T cell developmental pathway, is reminiscent of previous work using transgenic TCR models demonstrating that a reduction of TCR signal strength results in a redirection of γδ T cells to the αβ T cell lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> In addition, Fahl et al. recently demonstrated that both entry into the γδ T cell lineage as well as γδ T cell effector programming involved repression of TCF1 expression by TCR-driven increases in <italic>Id3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Consistent with these results, we found that <italic>Tcf7</italic> (encoding TCF1) transcript levels were highest in the αβ T cell-like c6 cluster, and we note that <italic>Tcf7</italic> transcripts levels were noticeably higher in the <italic>Il2ra</italic>-enriched post-selection c5 cluster in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> γδ T cells. <italic>Id3</italic> expression, however, did not appear to be altered in SAP-deficient mice. Whether SAP-mediated signals could alter γδ T cell <italic>Tcf7</italic> expression through a TCR-independent mechanism remains an open question. Indeed, recent evidence that some DN1 thymocytes possess a SOX13<sup>hi</sup> IL-17-like phenotype and that Vγ4 γδT17 arise from DN1 precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> indicates the existence of such a TCR-independent developmental programming stage. It may be possible, therefore that SLAM/SAP-mediated signals could regulate the number and/or fitness of these DN1 precursors prior to the expression of TCR.</p>
<p>While our data indicate that SAP regulates the diversion of at least some TCR clonotypes into the αβ TCR pathway, the fate of those cells is unclear. Certainly, the fact that the clonotypes that were diverted to the αβ T cell pathway in E17 thymus are under-represented in the mature D9 thymus γδT17 clusters suggests that this diversion has significant consequences on the γδ T cell receptor repertoire, but whether these diverted γδ T cells contribute to the αβ T cell compartment is unclear. Recently, a population of hybrid αβ-γδ T cells was described in both mouse and human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> that responds to peptide/MHC stimulation like conventional αβ T cells, as well as to IL-1 and IL-23 which induce both IFN-γ and IL-17 production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. In the mouse, at least some of these cells are Vγ4/Vδ5, Vγ4/Vδ4, or Vγ4Vδ7 and are present in the embryonic thymus, raising the possibility that γδ T cells diverted to the αβ T cell pathway in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice contribute to this αβ-γδ T cell population. While we have not observed a significant increase in the overall numbers of αβ-γδ T cells in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> thymus (not shown), a direct comparison of B6 and B6.SAP<sup>−/−</sup> αβ-γδ TCRs may be necessary to see such an effect.</p>
<p>Our previous observations that SAP deletion did not completely abolish the development of IL-17- and IFN-γ producing γδ T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> suggested the possibility that SAP may be critical for the development of additional γδ T cell clonotypes other than the Vγ1Vδ6.3 subset. Therefore, we compared the SAP-dependent and SAP-independent γδTCR repertoires using paired TCR clonotype analysis, which allowed us to track clonotype fate during development. Our findings not only confirmed previous results demonstrating highly restricted γδT17<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, and γδNKT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> TCR repertoires, they also revealed that the vast majority of Vγ4 γδT1 subsets in the periphery preferentially utilize TRGV4/TRAV13-4(DV7) clonotypes, thereby further highlighting the strong links between γδ T cell function and the utilization of specific TCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The reason for this preferential TRDV usage in Vγ4/Vδ7 γδT1 is unclear. While the TRAV13-4(DV7) CDR3 sequences were diverse and did not suggest evidence of clonal expansion, it may be possible that TRDV-encoded sequence motifs could be required to interact with a ligand, similar to the way that TRGV-encoded sequences mediate recognition of butyrophilins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Exactly when during development SAP exerts its effects on Vγ4/Vδ7 T cells is still somewhat unclear. We found comparatively low numbers of TRGV4/TRDV7 γδ T cells in embryonic, neonatal, or adult thymus, and those that were identified were generally found in the immature clusters. The increased frequency in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup> E17 thymus of TRGV4/TRDV7 γδ T cells in the <italic>Il2ra</italic><sup>+</sup> c5 cluster coupled with their decreased frequency in the emigrating <italic>S1pr1</italic><sup>+</sup> c4 cluster suggests a model where SAP promotes progression through the early stages of development through thymic egress. SAP deficiency, therefore, could result in lower Vγ4/Vδ7 output. However, this model is at odds with our finding that the frequency of <italic>S1pr1</italic><sup>+</sup> clusters in neonatal thymus is increased in B6.SAP<sup>-/-</sup>, and that these clusters contained increased numbers of TRGV4/TRDV7 γδ T cells. A possible explanation could be found in a previous report demonstrating that a Vγ4/Vδ7 subset increases in frequency in the periphery of B6 mice over time and undergoes extrathymic expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Our finding here that that the Vγ4/Vδ7 T cells represent a SAP-dependent innate-like γδT1 subset raise the possibility that SAP regulates the homeostatic expansion of this subset. subset after it leaves the thymus. The mechanism, however, through which SAP is regulating the number of the Vγ4/Vδ7 subset remains unclear as we have so far observed no evidence of changes in homeostatic proliferation or apoptosis of these cells in the lungs.</p>
<p>We previously demonstrated that the SAP-dependent dependent impairment in γδT17 function in the neonatal periphery largely corrects itself as mice mature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. This suggested the possibility that SAP-dependent γδT17 clonotypes originating in the embryonic thymus were being replaced over time by SAP-independent γδT17 clonotypes. Although our data certainly point to a SAP-dependent decrease in a germline-encoded Vγ4/Vδ5 clonotype in neonatal thymus, the low numbers of this clonotype in the lung makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions in the periphery. Still, we did observe a role for SAP in shaping the peripheral γδT17 repertoire, as we noted we noted a decreased frequency of germline-encoded TRGV4 sequences (so-called “GYSS”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>) coupled with an increased frequency of TRGV4 sequences with more diverse CDR3 (“GXYSS”) in the periphery. Although the potential significance of this change on γδ T cell function is unclear, it does support a model in which SAP regulates γδT17 developmental programming during embryonic thymic development, where the low expression of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase results in a high frequency of germline-encoded V-J junctions.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings reveal the presence of multiple SAP-dependent developmental checkpoint during the very early stages of γδ T cell development in the thymus, indicating a more complex role for this signaling pathway in γδ T cell developmental programming than previously appreciated. Indeed, our data indicate that SAP functions to regulate entry into the γδ and αβ T cell developmental pathways, and we make the striking observation that nearly all Vγ4 γδT1 cells in the periphery preferentially use Vδ7 chains and that it is a decrease in the Vγ4/Vδ7 subset that, in part, underlies the SAP-dependent decrease in γδ T cell IFN-γ production. Whether SAP regulates these phenotypes through regulation of TCR signal strength or additional pathways remains an open question. Taken together, the data presented here suggest a key role for the SLAM/SAP signaling pathway in generating and/or maintaining the innate-like phenotype in the γδ T cell lineage.</p>

<p>Analysis of gene expression, surface protein expression, and TCR V(D)J repertoire was performed using the 10X Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ V(D)J with feature barcoding kit (version 1.1). To sort cells for scRNAseq, thymocytes were stained with anti-TCRδ-PE (GL3) antibody and enriched using anti-PE MicroBeads kit (Miltenyi Biotec). The exception was E17 thymus which did not undergo TCRδ enrichment.

<p>The plate-based based γδ TCR repertoire analysis of single-cell sorted Vγ4 cells involved adult lungs from 8-10 weeks old B6 male (n=7) and female mice (n=6). Lung Vγ4 TCR sequences were obtained using a protocol modified from Wei <italic>et al.</italic>, (2015)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Briefly, lung cell suspensions were prepared as described above. After washing, cells were resuspended in Fc-Block (BioLegend) containing PBS/2% FCS buffer, and stained with anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-CD11c (N418), anti-CD19 (1D3), anti-CD45 (30-F11), anti-TCRδ (GL3) and anti-Vγ4 (UC3-10A6) from for 30 min at 4°C in PBS. Fixable Viability Dye eFluor™ 780 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY) was used to identify dead cells. Single-cell sorting of lung Vγ4<sup>+</sup>TCRδ<sup>+</sup> from a CD11b<sup>-</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup>CD19<sup>-</sup>TCRβ<sup>-</sup> population of CD45<sup>+</sup> live lymphocytes were performed using a FACS Aria III cell sorter (BD Bioscience). Cells were sorted directly into 12.5 μl (per well) of OneStep RT-PCR Buffer mix (QIAGEN) in a 96-well PCR plate (one cell/well).</p>
<p>TCR sequences were then amplified and barcoded according to (Wei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015). Briefly, the first two nested PCR reactions involved primer-specific amplification of gamma and delta TCR sequences. In both the first and second PCR reactions, the final concentration of each V-region primer is 0.36μM, and each C-region primer is 0.6μM. The first RT-PCR step was performed using the following cycling conditions: 50°C for 30 min; 95°C for 5 min; 25 cycles of [94°C for 30 sec; 62°C for 1min; 72°C for1 min]; 72°C for 7 min; 4°C. Next, 1 μl of the first round PCR product was used as a template for the second nested PCR reaction using HotStartTaq Master Mix Kit (QIAGEN). The cycling conditions for the second PCR reaction were 95°C for 5 min; 25 cycles of [94°C for 30 sec; 64°C for 1min; 72°C for1 min]; 72°C for 7 min; 4°C. In the third PCR reaction, 1 μl of second round PCR product as the template in a new 14 μl reaction using HotStartTaq Master Mix Kit (QIAGEN). Each well was barcoded. The final concentration of 5’ and 3’ barcoding primers was 0.05μM each and paired-end primers were 0.5μM each. The cycling conditions for the third PCR reaction were 95°C for 5 min; 36 cycles of [94°C for 30 sec; 62°C for 1min; 72°C for1 min]; 72°C for 7 min; 4°C. The γ and δ chain products were run on 1.2% agarose gel separately and purified using the Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit according to kit instructions. The final products were then analyzed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Finally, the γ and δ TCR products were mixed in equal concentration and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform using the Illumina MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (500-cycles).</p>
<p>The paired-end TCR sequencing reads were analyzed using a custom software pipeline capable of de-multiplexing barcoded sequences to individual cells. The resulting de-multiplexed reads were then analyzed by MiGMAP software, which identifies CDR3 sequences using the IgBlast 1.4.0 (NCBI) V(D)J mapping tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. The single-cell TCR V(D)J profiling data were then visualized using custom R scripts.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for the statistical analysis of data. Unpaired Student t-tests, one-way ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA were used where appropriate. Tests were considered significant when p-values were less than 0.05. Error bars represent standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors advance their previous findings on the role of the SLAM-SAP signaling pathway in the development and function of multiple innate-like gamma-delta T-cell subsets. Using a high throughput single-cell proteogenomics approach, the authors uncover SAP-dependent developmental checkpoints, and the role of SAP signaling in regulating the diversion of γδ T cells into the αβ T cell developmental pathway. Finally, the authors define TRGV4/TRAV13-4(DV7)-expressing T cells as a novel, SAP-dependent Vγ4 γδT1 subset.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study furthers our understanding of the importance and complexity of the SLAM-SAP signaling pathway not only in the development of innate-like γδ T cells but also in how it potentially balances the γδ/αβ T cell lineage commitment. Additionally, this study reveals the role of SAP-dependent events in the generation of γδ TCR repertoire.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the study are supported by well-thought-out experiments and compelling data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses in the study were identified.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mistri et al explore the role of SLAM-SAP signaling in the developmental programming of innate-like gd T cell subsets. Using proteo-genomics, they determined that abrogation of SLAM-SAP signaling altered that programming, reducing some IL-17-producing subsets, including a novel Vγ4 γδT1 subset, and diverting gdTCR-expressing precursors to the ab fate. Altogether, this is a very thorough, thoughtfully interpreted study that adds significantly to our understanding of the contribution of the SLAM-SAP pathway to lineage specification. A particularly interesting element is the role of SLAM-SAP in preventing gd17 progenitors from switching fates and adopting the ab fate.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind in assessing the ultimate fate of the &quot;ab wannabe cells&quot; is that mechanisms exist to silence the gd TCR as cells differentiate to the DP stage and so their presence as diverted DP cells may not be evident by staining for gdTCR expression - and will only be evident transcriptomically.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an exceedingly well-designed and thorough study that significantly enriches our understanding of gd T cell development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are no major weaknesses identified by this reviewer.</p>
