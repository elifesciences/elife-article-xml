<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Insufficient insulin secretion to meet metabolic demand results in diabetes. The intracellular flux of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into β-cells triggers insulin release. Since genetics strongly influences variation in islet secretory responses, we surveyed islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in eight genetically diverse mouse strains. We found high strain variation in response to four conditions: 1) 8 mM glucose; 2) 8 mM glucose plus amino acids; 3) 8 mM glucose, amino acids, plus 10 nM GIP; and 4) 2 mM glucose. These stimuli interrogate β-cell function, α-cell to β-cell signaling, and incretin responses. We then correlated components of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> waveforms to islet protein abundances in the same strains used for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements. To focus on proteins relevant to human islet function, we identified human orthologues of correlated mouse proteins that are proximal to glycemic-associated SNPs in human GWAS. Several orthologues have previously been shown to regulate insulin secretion (e.g. ABCC8, PCSK1, and GCK), supporting our mouse-to-human integration as a discovery platform. By integrating these data, we nominated novel regulators of islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and insulin secretion with potential relevance for human islet function. We also provide a resource for identifying appropriate mouse strains in which to study these regulators.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The majority of gene loci responsible for the genetic variation in type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility affect the function of endocrine cells of pancreatic islets, primarily β-cells (1, 2). Variation in β-cell mass and function places boundaries on their capacity to respond to acute and chronic demands for insulin, such as those of overnutrition and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Therefore, metabolic challenges are useful in genetic screens because they expose phenotypes that would otherwise remain silent.</p>
<p>The large collection of inbred mouse strains provides us with a wide repertoire of genetic and phenotype diversity, comparable to that of the entire human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Yet, most mouse studies have been confined to a small number of highly inbred strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). It is becoming widely appreciated that gene deletions, nutritional interventions, and drug effects vary widely among mouse strains as they do in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Thus, characterization of the basis for this high level of phenotype variation is a path to gain deeper insights into the pathophysiology and genetics of a wide range of physiological processes.</p>
<p>The pancreatic β-cell is a nutrient sensor. In response to particular nutrient stimuli (e.g. glucose, amino acids), the β-cells generate ATP and close ATP-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>ATP</sub>), resulting in plasma membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). This leads to an oscillatory influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, triggering insulin secretion. The process of secreting insulin and re-compartmentalizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions consumes ATP, and the drop in the ATP/ADP ratio reopens K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, repolarizing the membrane, and closing membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Consequently, oscillations in metabolism, insulin secretion, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are intrinsically linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), and the capacity to maintain functional Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling has been suggested to be critical for islet compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we utilized the extraordinary genetic and phenotypic diversity represented in the eight founder mouse strains (which we subsequently refer to as founders) used to generate the Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred mouse panel and the Diversity Outbred (DO) stock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). These strains capture most of the genetic diversity of all inbred mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). While studies of these mice have provided significant insight into genetic regulators of islet function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), determining the appropriate model system for evaluating genes of interest is often difficult as most deletion models are made in only a small number of strains such as the C57BL/6J.</p>
<p>We explored the diversity of nutrient-evoked islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses across the eight founder mouse strains, uncovering a remarkable diversity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Our prior proteomics studies showed that the protein abundance from islets of the founder mouse strains is also highly diverse, as is their insulin secretory response to different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). By correlating the strain and sex variation in protein abundance with the variation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, we identified a small number of islet proteins that are highly correlated with islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. The human orthologues of many of these proteins are encoded by genes with nearby SNPs linked to glycemic traits (e.g., fasting blood glucose, see <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold> for terms) in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). By integrating these data, we nominated novel regulators of islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and insulin secretion with potential relevance for human islet function. We also provide a resource that integrates proteomic and Ca<sup>2+</sup> data for identifying appropriate mouse strains in which to study these regulators.</p>

<title>Genetics exerts a strong influence on islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics</title>
<p>Glucose metabolism, β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux, and insulin secretion are pulsatile, and have been found to oscillate in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Because they are interconnected, understanding the factors governing oscillation patterns can inform about the mechanisms that regulate insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). To explore the influence of genetic background on Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, we measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> in islets of the eight CC founder strains, that together harbor as much genetic diversity as humans: A/J, C57BL/6J (B6), 129S1/SvlmJ (129), NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), NZO/HILtJ (NZO), CAST/EiJ (CAST), PWK/PhJ (PWK), and WSB/EiJ (WSB).</p>
<p>All mice were maintained on a Western-style diet (WD) high in fat and sucrose for 16 weeks, prior to isolating their islets for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging with Fura Red, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive fluorescent dye (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). We measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in response to four conditions: 1) 8 mM glucose (8G); 2) 8 mM glucose + 2 mM glutamine, 0.5 mM leucine, and 1.5 mM alanine (8G/QLA); 3) 8G/QLA + 10 nM glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (8G/QLA/GIP); and 4) 2 mM glucose (2G) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). There was a high degree of similarity between three of the five classical strains (A/J, B6, 129), which were dominated by slow oscillations (period 2-10 minutes) in 8G and 8G/QLA/GIP, and had relatively fewer islets reach plateau (continuous peak activity without oscillation) in 8G/QLA. Likewise, the wild-derived strains (CAST, WSB, and PWK) closely matched one another, while differing from the classic strains. The wild-derived mouse islets were dominated by fast oscillations (period &lt;2 minutes) in 8G, resulting in plateaus for 8G/QLA and 8G/QLA/GIP.</p>

The islets were then imaged on a confocal microscope using Fura Red dye under conditions of 8 mM glucose; 8 mM glucose + 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.5 mM L-leucine, and 1.25 mM L-alanine (QLA); 8 mM glucose + QLA + 10 nM GIP; and 2 mM glucose. <bold>(B)</bold> Representative Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces for male mice (n = 3-8 mice per strain, and 15-83 islets per mouse), with the transitions between solution conditions indicated by dashed lines.

<p>Two strains stood out from the others. Islets from NOD mice showed characteristics from both the wild-derived and classic strains; slow oscillations in 8G and a sustained plateau in response to 8G/AA and 8G/QLA/GIP with fast oscillations superimposed. The NZO mice also differed from the other classic strains, likely because they were all diabetic (blood glucose &gt;250 mg/dL). Their islets were minimally responsive to 8G, but did respond with a strong pulse in 8G/QLA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> remained elevated in 8G/QLA/GIP.</p>
<p>Many of the strain differences seen in the male mice were maintained in the females (<bold>Supplemental Figure 1A</bold>). The classic strains were once again highly similar to one another, as were the wild-derived strains. Furthermore, the NZO females, of which all but one were diabetic, mirrored the behavior of the male islets. One interesting observation that emerged from the female islets is that the NOD females displayed a greater variation in their Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations than the NOD males (<bold>Supplemental Figure 2</bold>). Some of the islets maintained slow oscillations throughout the various conditions, while some demonstrated fast oscillations and plateaued like the wild-derived strains. Yet others appeared strikingly similar to the islets from diabetic NZO mice, despite none of the NOD mice being diabetic. Finally, the one non-diabetic female NZO displayed oscillatory behavior comparable to that of the other classic strains, with clear, slow oscillations (<bold>Supplemental Figure 1B</bold>).</p>

<title>Dissecting islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics</title>
<p>An understanding of the mechanisms regulating insulin secretion, including the roles of specific metabolic pathways, ion channels, and hormones, has been derived from the shape and frequency of islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). To elucidate strain differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, we focused on six parameters of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> waveform (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>): 1) silent duration (the electrically-silent “triggering” phase, also known as “Mito<sub>Cat</sub>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), which culminates in K<sub>ATP</sub> closure and membrane depolarization), 2) peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> (the top of each oscillation); 3) active duration (the length of time for each Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation measured at half of the peak height, also known the oxidative “secretory” phase, or “Mito<sub>Ox</sub>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>); 4) pulse duration (active duration plus extra time for Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion), 5) period (the length of time between two peaks, and the sum of silent duration and active duration); 6) plateau fraction (the active duration divided by the period, or the fraction of time spent in the active “secretory” phase). We also assessed the spectral density for every islet to extract additional information from complex oscillations where multiple components were visible (<bold>Supplemental Figure 3A</bold>). We analyzed each trace to determine the top two frequencies contributing to the trace (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> component frequencies, <bold>Supplemental Figure 3B</bold>) and their respective contributions (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> component amplitudes). Because certain features, such as metabolically-driven (slow) and electrically-driven (fast) oscillations have characteristic frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), extracting the top two frequencies may highlight additional information beyond that previously collected.</p>

<caption><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave breakdown reveals mechanisms underlying Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> In the example B6 female Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave, the islet oscillations can change in their average peak and average baseline in response to different nutrients. Additionally, shifts in wave shape (green box) can be broken down into changes in time between peaks (period), the time in the active phase (active duration, A<sub>D</sub>), and the length of the oscillation (pulse duration, P<sub>D</sub>). From these, the relative time in active phase, or plateau-fraction (P<sub>F</sub>), and the time the islet is inactive between oscillations (silent duration, S<sub>D</sub>) can be calculated. Each parameter can be changed by different underlying mechanisms. <bold>(B)</bold> For islets that plateaued, as in the example islet in 8/QLA, they were assigned a plateau-fraction of one and a period of zero. For islets that ceased to oscillate, such as the example islet in 2 mM glucose, they were assigned a plateau-fraction of zero and a period of the time of measurement (40 minutes). <bold>(C)</bold> For trace 1 (left), which has a longer period (red bars) than trace 2 (right), but the same active duration (blue bars), the silent duration is greater and consequently the P<sub>F</sub> is shorter, in contrast to the trace in (<bold>A</bold>) where the P<sub>F</sub> increases between 8mM and 8/QLA are largely due to increases in A<sub>D</sub>. <bold>(D)</bold> Changes in specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave parameters can reflect different mechanisms in β-cells. For example, changing K<sub>ATP</sub> activity pharmacologically (upper panels) predominantly increases P<sub>F</sub> by altering S<sub>D</sub>, whereas increasing glucose concentrations by elevating glucose or activating GK cause significant alterations in both A<sub>D</sub> and S<sub>D</sub> to increase P<sub>F</sub>.

<p>A representative Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamic from a female B6 islet is illustrated in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>. The transition from 8G to 8G/QLA resulted in an increased active duration, yielding a longer period and increased plateau fraction. For an islet that plateaued at the peak, as seen in 8G/QLA (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>), we computed a plateau-fraction of one, an active and pulse duration of 40 minutes (the measurement time), and a period of zero minutes. An islet that returned to baseline and ceased to oscillate, as seen in 2 mM glucose (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>), was determined to have a plateau-fraction, active duration, and pulse duration of zero, and a period of 40 minutes. Dissecting the strain-dependence of these key parameters of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations is important for identifying underlying mechanisms, as illustrated in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>. While both traces have a similar active duration (blue bars), trace 1 has a longer period (red bars), resulting in an increased silent duration and a decreased plateau-fraction.</p>
<p>Examples of pathways altering specific components of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations have previously been established (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). For example, when K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are pharmacologically closed with tolbutamide, the silent duration is shortened, resulting in increased frequency without a change in pulse shape (upper panel). The addition of glucose leads to increased glucose metabolism and glucokinase (GK) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). The resulting rise in ATP inhibits K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) and is used as a substrate for additional processes that affect Ca<sup>2+</sup>, such as SERCA pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Thus, glucose alters both the active and silent durations, resulting in a change in both frequency and shape of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (lower panel).</p>

<p>To identify parameters of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics most strongly correlated to insulin secretion, we computed the correlation between the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation parameters and insulin secretion in similar conditions (8G, 8G/QLA, basal) for the same sexes and strains (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplemental Figure 4</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Consistent with our observations from the perifusion data in the WSB and 129 islets, we found that average Ca<sup>2+</sup> was not strongly correlated to insulin secretion. Other metrics, such as active duration in 8G, and the silent durations in 8G/QLA, were more highly correlated to insulin secretion. Meanwhile, the 1<sup>st</sup> component frequency in 8G from the spectral density analysis was highly correlated with <italic>decreased</italic> insulin secretion. These metrics were also the most highly correlated with multiple clinical measures in the founder mice, particularly plasma insulin (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, Supplemental Figure 5</bold>), for which silent duration in 8G/QLA/GIP had the strongest correlations.</p>
<p>Several parameters of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillatory waveform showed strong strain and sex effects. For example, basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (average Ca<sup>2+</sup> in 2G, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>) was relatively consistent among the strains, except NZO where it was highest in islets from male mice. For the overall pulse duration (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>), the NZO mice were once again the highest, followed by CAST and WSB. A noticeable sex-effect was measured for the CAST mice, where male mice had a longer pulse duration than the female mice. The 1<sup>st</sup> component frequency (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>) is driven by the differences observed in the wild-derived strains, for which CAST has the highest frequency, followed by PWK and WSB. Finally, the trend for a sex effect in the classic strains on the silent duration (at 8G, 8G/QLA, and 8G/QLA/GIP) is absent in the NZO and wild-derived mice with the former having greater silent duration in males and the latter frequently having islets plateau in response to these stimuli. These data demonstrate that genetics has a profound influence on key parameters of islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations.</p>

<title>Calcium oscillatory parameters correlate strongly to the abundance of specific islet proteins</title>
<p>To explore relationships between Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and islet proteins, we took advantage of our whole islet proteomic survey from the eight founder strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). To identify proteins that may underly the strain-differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, we computed the correlation between islet protein abundance and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics across all mice used in our study (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplemental Figure 6</bold>). Our previous survey of islet proteomics included both sexes for all strains, except NZO males, resulting in a quantitative measure of 4054 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold> illustrates a heatmap of the correlation between islet proteins and several parameters of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Unsupervised clustering was used to show that groups of proteins showed strong positive or negative correlation to a given Ca<sup>2+</sup> parameter, yielding distinct correlation architecture. For example, proteins highly correlated to the 8G 1<sup>st</sup> component frequency, tended to also be strongly anticorrelated to the silent duration conditions, which were very similar to one another. The active and pulse durations for 8G had nearly identical correlation structure. Additionally, the conditions with the fewest highly correlated proteins were the average Ca<sup>2+</sup> measures for 8G, 8G/QLA, and 8G/QLA/GIP, and the structure for these was largely inverted from the active duration conditions. Finally, despite the differences in the overall correlations between the different metrics, there were proteins that did overlap (e.g. the block of proteins with high correlation to both 8G A<sub>D</sub> and 8G/QLA S<sub>D</sub>) suggesting that while there were clusters of distinct proteins/pathways for any given metric some proteins may modify more than one metric.</p>

Strains with high abundance (AJ, for example (yellow arrow)) would be ideal models for inhibition or knockout, whereas CAST mice (green arrow) could be a comparison strain for validating the role of the protein, as they express much less GALNS. Users can also query for the proteins or calcium parameters and see their correlation to the other proteins and/or calcium parameters (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>).

Finally, we used GIP to interrogate the islet incretin responses and the cAMP amplification pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), before returning to a low glucose concentration that enabled us to establish baseline Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels.</p>
<p>The variation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to these conditions can be better understood by examining the multitude of pathways regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. As mentioned previously, altering ionic pathways involved in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup>, such as K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, has a very different effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations compared to altering glycolysis. It is important to further dissect these pathways, as changing specific components of glucose metabolism can elicit different effects. For example, activating glucokinase (GK, which is rate limiting for glycolysis) and activating pyruvate kinase (PK, an ATP-generating enzyme which directly controls K<sub>ATP</sub> channel closure in the final step of glycolysis) both reduce the silent phase duration by accelerating K<sub>ATP</sub> channel closure. GK and PK activation also alter the active duration and the plateau fraction, however they do so in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Activating GK increases the active duration and oscillation period, while activating PK decreases those same parameters via Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP reduce silent duration and oscillation period, most likely due to their ability to activate Epac2 and sensitize K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to ATP-dependent closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Thus, PK and GLP1 have a common target (i.e. K<sub>ATP</sub>), and therefore a similar effect on silent duration. These examples illustrate the benefit of analyzing multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> parameters for understanding pathways of interest.</p>
<p>The importance of analyzing a variety of Ca<sup>2+</sup> parameters is further supported by the insulin secretion measurements in the male WSB and 129 mice. While average Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a common metric used to predict insulin secretion, relying on only this metric would suggest that the two strains secrete insulin similarly. However, the WSB mice secreted significantly more insulin in 8G, 8G/QLA, and 8G/QLA/GIP (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). Based on our correlation analysis between Ca<sup>2+</sup> parameters and insulin secretion across each sex and strain, active duration, and pulse duration in 8G more accurately predicted insulin secretion and may be highly informative when used with other data (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). This is similar to results published by some other groups, suggesting that average Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not correlate well with insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>).</p>

<title>Strains segregate by their phylogenetic origins</title>
<p>Notably, several of the strains appeared to cluster together with similar responses. One such group is composed of three classical strains (A/J, B6, and 129), which had similar waveforms that were dominated by slow oscillations. These differed from a second group containing the wild-derived strains (CAST, WSB, and PWK) which closely matched one another and were dominated by faster oscillations. The classic strains have been highly inbred (&gt;150+ generations) and descend from related common ancestors, the “fancy mice.” They also have extremely low genetic diversity, with 97% of their genomes explained by fewer than 10 haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). By contrast, wild-derived strains are each independent in their parental origin, inbred for far fewer generations than the classic strains (20 vs. &gt;150), and include significant contributions from other subspecies of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> than the predominant subspecies (<italic>M. m. domesticus</italic>) in the traditional strains, particularly CAST (<italic>M. m. castaneous)</italic> and PWK (<italic>M. m. musculus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). It is thus unsurprising that the two primary Ca<sup>2+</sup> response clusters were composed of the classic and wild-derived strains. Multiple loci have already been linked to islet dysfunction and differential metabolic homeostasis in the classic strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Our work here highlights the promise in using wild-derived strains to unmask previously underappreciated islet phenomena, something we and others have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>).</p>
<p>While considered one of the classic strains, the NOD mice differed from the two primary clusters noted above. They displayed a combination of features from both groups and had a high degree of inter-islet variability, especially the female mice. NOD share common ancestors with the Swiss-Webster mice, which do not share parental origin with the other classic strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) and also display a “mixed” phenotype consisting of islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in response to glucose, with both slow and fast components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, while all NOD were normoglycemic, a heterogeneous response was observed in islets from female, but not male, NOD mice. Female NOD mice are known to develop islet immune infiltration and subsequent autoimmune diabetes whereas males are largely protected from this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Male NOD islets were largely consistent in their Ca<sup>2+</sup> waveforms. In the females, however, a high degree of heterogeneity in responses was observed across the female’s islets (<bold>Supplemental Figure 2</bold>). For any NOD female, some islets resembled those from NOD males in their clear oscillations, others largely lacked oscillatory behavior other than a strong pulse in response to 8G/QLA, and still others had an intermediate response. These observations may reflect varying degrees of dysfunction in the NOD female islets as the mice progress to diabetes, though we cannot say whether this results from variation in beta-cell intrinsic defects or islet immune infiltration.</p>
<p>The NZO mice also varied from the two clusters previously discussed. Male, and all but one of the female NZO mice were diabetic. Islets from diabetic mice had reduced amplitude and oscillatory behavior, other than a single pulse in 8G/QLA. This pattern is similar to the patterns observed in many of the NOD female islets. On the other hand, islets of the one non-diabetic female NZO mouse demonstrated clear, slow oscillations (<bold>Supplemental Figure 1B</bold>), which was surprising given reports of low K<sub>ATP</sub> abundance due to <italic>Abcc8</italic> mutations in the NZO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) and the strong role of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in regulating islet Ca<sup>2+</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). While not of the same lineage as the NOD, the NZO do exhibit some autoimmune infiltration in the pancreas, and the marked difference between the non-diabetic and diabetic NZOs, along with the variation in female NOD islet responses, further suggests that intra-islet variability for the NOD mice may be the result of disease progression.</p>
<p>Understanding the genetic variation driving islet responses in the founders may be informative beyond these specific strains. Screens in the DO mice and similar outbred populations can track SNPs associated with trait variation to their parental inbred strain of origin. Our previous genetic screen for drivers of islet function observed that many of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) appearing for <italic>ex vivo</italic> islet traits had effects driven by the SNPs from the wild-derived strains as opposed to the traditional inbred groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The QTL mediated by <italic>Zfp148</italic>, which drives Ca<sup>2+</sup> and insulin secretion phenotypes in β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), also had strong strain effects from wild-derived strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies of islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> have largely been confined to a handful of strains, and many studies by individual labs tend to use the strains linked with their projects. While this does include a few outbred stocks (e.g. NMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), CD-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>)), direct comparisons of these to the traditional inbred lines are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), and studies of specific genes often use traditional inbred lines as wild-derived lines do not respond as well to the conventional assistive reproductive technologies required for genome editing and transgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>).</p>
<p>One study, comparing the outbred (NMRI) stock to the C57BL6/J and C57BL/6N strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), found that the NMRI displayed significantly lower frequencies than the C57 lines, particularly in physiological glucose ranges and had similar active periods. While highly informative, there were important differences between these studies and our studies here. Of note, the studies were done in acute slice culture, in only one sex, and the frequencies detected did not resemble the (at least for the C57 lines) the slow oscillations observed in isolated islets from these inbred strains (e.g. <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>)).</p>

<title>Mouse-to-human integration nominates novel islet drivers</title>
<p>One limitation of our current study is that the association between islet proteins and Ca<sup>2+</sup> waveforms is correlative and therefore cannot distinguish proteins that are causal for the differences in islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> between strains from proteins that change because of these differences. One approach to discriminate cause from effect, and establish the relevance to humans, is to identify whether genes encoding human orthologues of these proteins are associated with glycemic traits in human GWAS. SNPs for glycemic traits (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>), particularly those involving insulin, suggest that alterations in these proteins may impart disease risk, which is less likely for proteins that do not play critical regulatory roles. Thus, filtering our candidates for glycemic trait associations in human GWAS, while not definitive, suggests a likely causal role for these proteins in mediating differences in islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> and insulin secretion among the different mice. Integrating human GWAS data with the proteins most correlated to Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics nominated ∼650 protein candidates, of which approximately a third have been previously shown to have roles in islet biology. These include well established drivers of insulin secretion; e.g. SUR1, GLUT2, and GNAS. Other previously unknown candidates show promise for validation, as they are already targets of small molecule compounds (e.g. ACP1 and others, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>)), are secreted (e.g. COBLL1 and others, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>)), or have been knocked out in mice, resulting in metabolic phenotypes (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>)).</p>

<title>Exploiting strain and sex-dependent differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics for model system selection</title>
<p>In addition to the candidate regulators with potential relevance to human islet biology, we provide a user-friendly interface to our data where users can determine whether their gene of interest has a potential regulatory role in islets. Multiple inferences regarding the roles of specific pathways are possible via analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), and our protein correlation data provides a resource to identify which parameter most closely correlates to a number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> traits. Additionally, it highlights strain/sex outliers for a given trait or gene product, which can be used to select which strain/sex is best to explore that gene’s role (e.g. <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></bold>). Newer technologies in reproductive assistance, transgenesis, and gene editing, together with more accurate genome sequencing and single mutations conferring docility, are quickly making utilization of the wild-derived mice more practical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>). As many of the QTL identified in DO-based studies often have strong driver SNPs from the wild-derived strains, a further understanding of which experimental questions might be best addressed by use of these strains will be important.</p>
<p>We have previously provided user-friendly web interfaces that allow searches of gene expression as a function of diet (WD vs chow, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>)) and background (e.g. BTBR and B6, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>)), correlation and QTL scans in F2 intercrosses of these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>), and where these may align with QTL in our DO studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Many of our candidates are strongly altered by diet and have strong correlations in the F2 data for certain clinical traits including insulin and glycemic parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). Here, we provide the correlation data for islet proteins against multiple parameters describing islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses between strains (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.j0zpc86jc">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.j0zpc86jc</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://data-viz.it.wisc.edu/FounderCalciumStudy/">https://data-viz.it.wisc.edu/FounderCalciumStudy/</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/byandell/FounderCalciumStudy">https://github.com/byandell/FounderCalciumStudy</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rstudio.it.wisc.edu/FounderCalciumStudy">https://rstudio.it.wisc.edu/FounderCalciumStudy</ext-link>).

Prior to loading the chambers were perfused with the initial imaging solution (8 mM glucose in imaging medium). Islets were then loaded into these dishes. The imaging chamber was placed on a 37°C– heated microscope stage (Tokai Hit TIZ) of a Nikon A1R-Si+ confocal microscope. All solution reservoirs were kept in a 37°C water bath. Solutions were perfused through the chamber at 0.25 mL/min, with constant flow controlled by a Fluigent MCFS-EZ and M-switch valve assembly (Fluigent). The scope was integrated with a Nikon Eclipse-Ti Inverted scope and equipped with a Nikon CFI Apochromat Lambda D 10x/0.45 objective (Nikon Instruments), fluorescence spectral detector, and multiple laser lines (Nikon LU-NV laser unit; 405, 440, 488, 514, 561, 640nm).

<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1) <bold>calcium</bold>: calcium parameters &amp; spectral density data, with stimulatory secretion conditions</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>2) <bold>protein</bold>: islet proteomic measurements</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3) <bold>basal</bold>: average calcium in 2mM glucose</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The <bold>calcium</bold> data have three stimulatory conditions (8G, 8G/QLA, and 8G/QLA/GIP) that are displayed together for each calcium parameter. The proteomic data (<bold>protein</bold>) are displayed for each identified peptide. In rare cases of multiple peptides per gene, both gene symbol and peptide identifier (PP number) are included (e.g. Pkm_PP_1521 for the M1 isoform of the protein PKM). Desired proteins can be selected simultaneously with desired calcium parameters for correlation analysis and paired display by both datasets. The <bold>basal</bold> elements retained from the <bold>calcium</bold> data include the Average Calcium measurement for 2mM glucose. Proteomic data were log10-transformed. All traits were transformed into normal scores, keeping the sample mean and variance the same.</p>
<p>Scatter plots display data across sex and calcium conditions. When plotting calcium against protein or basal traits, means by strain and sex are used, as the two experiments used different mice. Correlation of selected traits with all other traits in the resource use Pearson correlation on pairwise-complete data. The user can order traits by their significance or by their correlation to other selected traits.</p>
<p>Statistical modeling terms include strain, sex, and the strain:sex interaction, plus additional terms for comparing calcium condition with respect to strain and sex. Users can view volcano plots displaying deviation of term effects, measured as the standard deviation (SD = square root of mean square error) divided by the raw SD for that trait, against their significance (p-value after adjusting for all other model terms, presented on -log10 scale). In addition to the terms, a composite “signal” captures the combined effect of terms strain:condition + strain:condition:sex using a general F test computation.</p>
<p>All data handling and web app construction for the resource was performed using R scripts in publicly available GitHub repositories, with specifics for the calcium study at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/byandell/FounderCalciumStudy">https://github.com/byandell/FounderCalciumStudy</ext-link> and the general purpose analysis and web deployment package at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/byandell/foundr">https://github.com/byandell/foundr</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>For the islet perifusion insulin measurements, statistics were determined in GraphPad Prism. Fractional secretion area-under-the-curve (AUC) was determined using Prism and differences in AUCs analyzed using post-tests following 2-way ANOVA for the indicated trace segments. Islet total insulins between strains were compared using a two-tailed Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction.</p>

<p>The authors provide a <bold>fundamental</bold> resource, detailing genetic variation of nutrient-responsive islet calcium regulation in mice through the lens of proteomics. The evidence for the mechanisms identified using this resource is <bold>compelling</bold> and strongly supported by integration with results from genome-wide association studies in humans. The construction of a streamlined and searchable web interface for the data maximizes their accessibility and utilization by the community.</p>

<p>This paper looks at nutrient-responsive Ca++ flux in islet cells of eight genetically diverse mouse strains. The investigators correlate Ca++ flux with insulin secretory capacity, demonstrating that calcium parameters in response to different nutrients are a better predictor of insulin secretory capacity than average calcium. They also correlate Ca++ flux with previously collected islet protein abundance followed by integration with human genome-wide association studies. This integration allows them to identify a sub-set of proteins that are both relevant to human islet function and that may play a causal role in regulating islet Ca++ oscillations. All data have been deposited in a searchable public database. There are many strengths to this paper. To my knowledge, this is the first work to assess the genetics of nutrient-responsive Ca++ flux in islets. Given the importance of Ca++ for beta cell insulin secretion, this work is of high importance. Investigators also use the founders of two powerful genetic mouse models: the diversity outbred and collaborative, opening up several avenues of future research into the genetics of Ca++ flux. By looking at multiple parameters of Ca++ flux, investigators are able to start to understand which parameters may be driving low or high insulin secretion. Integration with protein abundance and human GWAS has allowed identification of proteins with known roles in insulin secretory capacity, as well as several novel regulators, again opening up several avenues of future research. Finally, the public database is likely to be useful to multiple investigators interested in following up specific protein targets or in conducting future genetic studies. I found only minor weaknesses in this paper, mainly regarding clarity in certain areas. One specific area to be improved is Figure 4A, B where in addition to the heat maps, it would be useful to see regression plots that show the differences per sex and strain for the insulin secretion vs Ca++ parameters.</p>

<p>This is an interesting paper from a reputable group in the field of islet physiology. The authors have provided the results from extensive studies, which will contribute to the knowledge of islet dysfunction and diabetes pathophysiology. One major critique is that the authors studied &quot;the human orthologues of the correlated mouse proteins that are proximal to the glycemia-associated SNPs in human GWAS&quot;. This implies two assumptions - (1) human and mouse proteins do not differ in terms of islet physiology and calcium signaling; (2) the proteins proximal to the SNPs are the causal factors for functional differences, though the SNPs could affect protein/gene function distant from the SNPs.</p>
