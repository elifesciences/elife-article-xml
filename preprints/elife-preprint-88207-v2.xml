<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As the main constituent of the terrestrial plant biomass, lignocellulose represents a huge reservoir of fixed carbon and a renewable resource for bioproducts and energy that is essential for human usages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Meents et al., 2018</xref>). Lignocellulose biomass enclosed mainly within secondary cell wall (SCW) reinforces vessels for long-distance transport and provides physical properties to fibers allowing upright growth of the plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Meents et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Scheller and Ulvskov, 2010</xref>). SCWs are composite material made of high molecular weight biopolymers, including cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, as well as cell wall proteins whose composition and structure can differ markedly between dicots and monocots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Scheller and Ulvskov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yokoyama and Nishitani, 2004</xref>). Cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane by the cellulose synthase complex and is composed of linear chains of β-(1–4) glucans that aggregate to form highly crystalline cellulose microfibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Scheller and Ulvskov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yokoyama and Nishitani, 2004</xref>). Xylans, the main hemicellulosic polysaccharides in SCW, are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus by a complex biosynthetic machinery and comprise a group of polysaccharides that share a common backbone of β-(1,4)-linked xylose (Xyl) units, but differs by the presence of side chains, whose nature is dependent on tissues and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Scheller and Ulvskov, 2010</xref>). In particular, glucuronoxylan, the dominant xylan in the SCW of dicots, is notably substituted at <italic>O</italic>-2 position with α-D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) or (4-O-methyl)-α-D-glucuronic acid (MeGlcA) groups, and with O-acetyl moieties at C-2 or C-3 positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Scheller and Ulvskov, 2010</xref>). By interacting with the cellulose and lignin, xylans contribute to the strengthening of the SCW, and are considered to be one of the main factors contributing to the biomass recalcitrance to enzymatic hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yokoyama and Nishitani, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, lignin polymers are made up of H, G, and S units which are the results of the oxidation and the polymerisation of the <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl, coniferyl and Synapyl alcohols, respectively. These monomers, also called monolignols are synthesized on the ER surface/cytoplasm prior to transportation to the cell wall. Lignins confer stiffness, strength and hydrophobicity to the SCW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Scheller and Ulvskov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yokoyama and Nishitani, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>The metabolic load imposed by the coordinated production of SCW biopolymers emphasizes the importance for plants of having a precise control over temporal and spatial expression of the corresponding SCW biosynthetic genes. Based on founding studies performed in the Arabidopsis model, it is generally recognized that the SCW synthesis is primarily controlled at a transcriptional level by a multilayer and interconnected network of transcription factors/TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Taylor-Teeples et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Key players of this regulatory network are related NAC (NAM-ATAF1/2-CUC) and MYB-type TFs that induce, in a redundant and combinatorial manner, the expression of SCW biosynthetic genes by binding their promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Taylor-Teeples et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, a family of Class III homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-ZIPIII) TFs, whose members control several aspects of Arabidopsis development, was also shown to interact with SCW regulatory network, contributing to xylem cell specification and SCW synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Taylor-Teeples et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Although this transcriptional level of control can gain complexity in perennial plants, functional orthologs of the main regulators were identified in many different species, suggesting that SCW deposition proceeds via a conserved mechanism in all vascular plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Myburg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhong and Ye, 2014</xref>). During the last decade, engineering the SCW regulatory network to deposit modified lignin and/or improve polysaccharide composition became a promising strategy to optimize biomass processability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sibout et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Whitehead et al., 2018</xref>). However, despite huge progresses in understanding the regulation of SCW synthesis, the engineering of SCW regulatory network to improve biomass yield and digestibility has proven difficult and often impairs plant growth because of altered vascular tissue development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bonawitz and Chapple, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Downstream of transcriptional regulations by TFs, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression across all kingdoms of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). However, although a large cohort of RBPs exists in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Reichel et al., 2016</xref>), there is little information about RBP-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of SCW biosynthetic genes. So far, only few microRNAs (miRNAs) families have been implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes involved in both regulatory and enzymatic aspects of SCW biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, miR165/166 were shown to target HD-ZIPIII transcriptional regulators, having a direct impact on the transcriptional network associated with SCW biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). In the other hand, miRNA397/857/408 were shown to affect lignin content <italic>via</italic> the targeting of laccase/LAC genes, which control lignin polymerization from monolignols precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, two related tandem CCCH zinc-finger proteins, which exhibit both DNA and RNA binding abilities, have been proposed to modulate SCW formation by regulating the expression of genes associated with cell wall metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chai et al., 2015</xref>). Despite these mounting evidences, our current knowledge of the role of post-transcriptional regulators in SCW synthesis is still very limited.</p>
<p>In this work, we report that two RRM-domain containing RNA-binding proteins homologous to the animal translational regulator Musashi, Musashi-like2/MSIL2 and Musashi-like4/MSIL4, function redundantly to control various aspects of development, including the stiffness of the inflorescence stem in Arabidopsis. We show that RRM-dependent RNA-binding activity is essential for MSIL2/4 functions <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that MSIL2/4 interactomes are similar, being enriched in proteins involved in 3’-UTR binding and translational regulation. MSIL2/4 mutations alter the formation of SCW in the interfascicular fiber cells, leading to a reduction in lignin deposition, and a change in the decoration pattern of glucuronoxylan that is associated with an increase of 4-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of GlcA substituent. In accordance, quantitative mass-spectrometry-based protein analysis reveals an overaccumulation of glucuronoxylan biosynthetic machinery, including the GlucuronoXylan Methyltransferase3/GXM3, in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant stem. We show that MSIL4 immunoprecipitates GXM3 mRNA in vivo, likely regulating its expression at a translational level. Our results demonstrate that MSILs regulate SCW synthesis in interfascicular fiber cells and point to a novel aspect of SCW regulation linking translational repression to regulation of SCW biosynthesis genes.</p>

<title>Musashi-like MSIL2/4 proteins redundantly control specific Arabidopsis development processes</title>
<p>While many studies have implicated the MSIs in the control of gene expression during cellular proliferation, cell fate determination and cancer in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fox et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kudinov et al., 2017</xref>), little is known about the presence and activity of MSI-type proteins in plants. In this work, we describe an RNA-binding protein family in Arabidopsis, whose members hereafter named as <italic>MUSASHI-Like1</italic> to <italic>4/MSIL1-4</italic>, share both sequence, domain organization, and model-based structural similarities with animal MSIs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Arabidopsis indeed harbors a clade of seven <italic>MSIL</italic>-type genes with a prominent sub-clade harboring the <italic>MSIL1-4</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, a neighboring sub-clade contains two genes, <italic>RBGD2</italic> and <italic>RGBD4</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), that encode for heat-inducible RBPs implicated in the response to heat stress in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>). MSIL1-4 proteins share a common domain architecture consisting of two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) that are followed by a poorly conserved, intrinsically unstructured, carboxy-terminal region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and Figure1-figure supplement 1A). The survey of the gene expression ARAPORT11 databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://araport.org/">https://araport.org/</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fgcz-pep2pro.uzh.ch">http://fgcz-pep2pro.uzh.ch</ext-link>) revealed that the <italic>MSIL1-4</italic> genes are widely expressed in Arabidopsis, with <italic>MSIL1</italic> showing the lowest levels of expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Database searches further indicated that <italic>MSIL</italic> orthologs are widely distributed in land plants, from bryophytes to angiosperms (Figure1-figure supplement 1B). To gain a mechanistic understanding of MSIL function in Arabidopsis, we determined the subcellular localization of these proteins by performing fluorescence microscopy on GFP-tagged versions of MSIL2 and MSIL4 (MSIL2G and MSIL4G). Both proteins showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in root cells of stable Arabidopsis transgenic plants that contrasts with the nucleus and cytoplasmic distributions of the free GFP protein control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>To further investigate the function of the MSILs in Arabidopsis, we raised specific antibodies against non-conserved regions of MSIL1-4 and characterized T-DNA insertion <italic>msil</italic> mutant lines that lack full-length <italic>MSIL</italic> mRNA and MSIL proteins as judged by RT-PCR and western blot experiments, respectively (Figure1-figure supplement 2A-C). However, none of the four characterized single <italic>msil</italic> mutants showed any obvious phenotype (Figure1-figure supplement 3A and data not shown). To assess the potential functional redundancy between <italic>MSIL</italic> genes, we crossed the single <italic>msil</italic> mutants together and characterized the six possible double mutant combinations (Figure1-figure supplement 3A). Only the <italic>msil2</italic>-1/<italic>msil4</italic>-1 (<italic>msil2/4</italic>) double mutant showed discernable developmental abnormal phenotypes, including enlarged and curled leaves, early leaf senescence and a pendant inflorescence stem (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E and F</xref> and Figure1-figure supplement 3A-C). To assess whether MSIL1 and MSIL3 also contribute to Arabidopsis development in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> double mutant background, we generated a <italic>msil1</italic>-1/<italic>msil2</italic>-1/<italic>msil3-</italic>1/<italic>msil4</italic>-1 (<italic>msil1/2/3/4</italic>) quadruple mutant that shows no particular or aggravated developmental phenotypes with respect to the <italic>msil2/4</italic> double mutant (Figure1-figure supplement 3A-C). To test the functional redundancy of MSIL2 and MSIL4 proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, we transformed the <italic>msil2/4</italic> double mutant with constructs coding either for a Flag/HA-tagged version of MSIL2 (MSIL2F) or MSIL4 (MSIL4F), and selected two independent transgenic plants expressing similar and near physiological levels of the tagged protein, as evaluated by western blot using our home-made antibodies (Figure1-Figure supplement 3D). The ectopic expression of either MSIL2F or MSIL4F proteins was able to rescue all the phenotypes associated with the MSIL2/4 defect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E and F</xref> and Figure1-Figure supplement 3E). This confirms that MSIL2F and MSIL4F are functional proteins and more importantly that MSIL2 and MSIL4 redundantly control various aspects of development in Arabidopsis.</p>

<p>Many of the proteins present in the MSIL2/4 interactome, such as PABs, PUMs, UBP1 are involved in translation regulation and are targeted to stress granule (SGs) components, a membraneless cytoplasmic organelle that formed consecutive to the global inhibition of translation caused by heat-stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chantarachot and Bailey-Serres, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Scutenaire et al., 2018</xref>).

<title>MSIL2/4 proteins regulate the molecular architecture of SCW in Arabidopsis fibers</title>
<p>Pendant stem inflorescence is a common phenotypic trait of Arabidopsis mutants defective in SCW biosynthesis, that results from a lack of mechanical support and rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mitsuda et al., 2007</xref>). Given the current lack of knowledge of the role of post-transcriptional mechanisms in the control of SCW biosynthesis in plants, we henceforth focused our analysis on the pendant stem phenotype of the <italic>msil2/4</italic> double mutant. Survey of the Arabidopsis inflorescence stem tissue-specific transcriptome database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shi et al., 2021</xref>) indicated that the <italic>MSIL2/4</italic> genes are highly expressed in the SCW-forming interfascicular fiber (<italic>if</italic>) and xylem vessel (<italic>xy</italic>) cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Toluidine blue O staining and microscopic analysis of Col-0 and <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant stem cross-sections revealed no major changes in the architecture of both the interfascicular and xylary fibers in the mutant stem. Notably, xylem cells deformation or collapse, which are a characteristic of mutants deficient in SCW synthesis, were not observed in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). However, the examination of the cell wall thickness in cross sections of stems revealed that the interfascicular fiber cells display a significantly thinner SCW in <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). UV autofluorescence and phloroglucinol staining of the Col-0, <italic>msil2/4</italic>, <italic>msil2/4</italic>+<italic>MSIL2</italic>F1 and <italic>msil2/4</italic>+<italic>MSIL4</italic>F1 stem sections revealed a reduced lignin signal in the interfascicular fibers of the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant compared to Col-0 or complemented plants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and Figure 4-figure supplement 1A). In agreement with these observations, a significant decrease of 30% in AcBr lignin content was observed in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant compared to the Col-0 control plants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Despite a tendency to decrease, the difference of lignin content was not significant in the complemented lines <italic>msil2/4</italic>+<italic>MSIL2</italic>F1 and <italic>msil2/4</italic>+<italic>MSIL4</italic>F1 compared to Col-0 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). To further investigate potential changes in the lignin structure and composition in the Col-0 and <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant, we evaluated the impact of MSIL2/4 deficiency on lignin composition by thioacidolysis, a degradation method allowing the determination of the relative amounts of H, G and S lignin units linked by beta-O-4 linkages. Total monomer yield did not significantly differ between the Col-0 and the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant (Figure 4-figure supplement 1B), suggesting that the structure of the lignin polymer is not significantly affected in the mutant. Further examination of β-glucan composition using the fluorescent dye calcofluor white (Hert and Schnepf, 1980) revealed an increased staining in the interfascicular fiber cells of <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant, supporting changes in the composition/accessibility of cellulose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref> and Figure 4-figure supplement 1C).</p>

<p>To extend this analysis, we then subjected purified Col-0 and <italic>msil2/4</italic> SCW materials to Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alonso-Simón et al., 2011</xref>). PLS-DA analyses performed on FT-IR absorbance data clearly separated <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant lines from Col-0 plants, using the first two components (explaining 74% and 10% of total variability, respectively) (Figure 4-figure supplement 1D, left panel). The large-scale chemotyping of CW composition in stem by FTIR spectroscopy suggested that not only lignin deposition was impaired in <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutants but also polysaccharides composition (Figure 4-figure supplement 1D, right panel; Supplementary file 2). The lowest absorbance values in <italic>msil2/4</italic> lines were observed in the region 1800-1500cm<sup>-1</sup>, mostly associated to the absorbance of lignin related compounds. On the contrary, a higher absorbance was detected in <italic>msil2/4</italic> samples within 1050-900 cm<sup>-1</sup> region, mostly associated to polysaccharides compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alonso-Simón et al., 2011</xref>). Because the optimal interaction between the SCW lignin and polysaccharide polymers is believed to contribute to SCW recalcitrance, we used saccharification as a proxy to compare cell wall sugars accessibility between Col-0, <italic>msil2/4</italic> and complemented mutant lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). A higher amount of reducing sugars from native cell wall (without pre-treatment/-Tr) was released using <italic>msil2/4</italic> samples compared to Col-0 samples. After cell wall loosening using alkali pre-treatment/+Tr, an even more important amounts of sugars (+5%) was released from double mutants CW enzymatic digestion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).

<title>The accumulation and activity of the glucuronoxylan decoration machinery are mis-regulated in <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant</title>
<p>To elucidate the impact of the MSIL2/4 on the expression of SCW-related biosynthesis genes in the Arabidopsis inflorescence stem, we performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) on both wild-type and <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant backgrounds. In total, we found 234 genes to be significantly differentially regulated (DEG) in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant background (with stringent thresholds having a logarithm of fold change &gt;1.5 or &lt;-1.5 and false discovery rate (FDR ≤ 0.05), including 156 up-regulated and 78 down-regulated mRNAs (Figure 5-figure supplement 1A, and Supplementary file 3). Interestingly, genes encoding regulatory or enzymatic components of the SCW biosynthesis pathway were absent from the DEG list, and their expression was not significant changed in <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant (Figure 5-figure supplement 1A). Gene Ontology analysis of DEGs revealed significantly enriched signaling pathways (FDR ≤0.05) involved in plant defense or responses to biotic and abiotic stresses (Figure 5-figure supplement 1B), encoding products that are preferentially targeted to the extracellular region and the cell wall (Figure 5-figure supplement 1C).</p>
<p>The low representation of SCW biosynthesis genes in the DEG list suggests that MSIL2/4 could regulate the SCW formation at a post-transcriptional/translational level, a hallmark of MSI function in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fox et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kudinov et al., 2017</xref>). To investigate proteome-level changes that could potentially occur upon MSIL2/4 mutations, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of Col-0 and <italic>msil2/4</italic> inflorescence stems using MS-based quantitative proteomics, and represented ≈4300 reliably identified and quantified proteins in a volcano plot according to their statistical p-value and their relative difference of abundance. This analysis revealed 267 proteins with significant abundances in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant versus Col-0 inflorescence stems (fold change ≥2, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR &lt; 1%), including 156 up-regulated, and 111 down-regulated proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and Supplementary file 4). While no specific GO terms were enriched in the set of down-regulated proteins, the inspection of the up-regulated proteins revealed a strong enrichment in enzymes involved in the glucuronoxylan biosynthetic pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and B</xref>, and Supplementary file 4). Notably, the upregulated glucuronoxylan-related proteins included glycosyltransferases required for the xylan backbone synthesis (IRX9/10/14), as well as enzymes involved in its substitution (ESK1, GUX1, and GXM3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Scheller and Ulvskov, 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>).

<p>The outcomes of our histological and proteomic analyses suggest potential variations in polysaccharide content and/or composition in the SCW of <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant. To address this point, we carried out monosaccharide composition analysis on either unpretreated (-Tr) or acid-pretreated (+Tr) WT and <italic>msil2/4</italic> stem cell walls. The levels of glucose (Glc) and xylose (Xyl), which are the building blocks of cellulose and xylan polysaccharides in the SCW were not substantially affected in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).

<p>In Arabidopsis, the glucuronoxylan backbone is decorated predominantly by acetyl, GlcA, and MeGlcA groups, that are deposited in a regular and controlled manner by a specific enzymatic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Scheller and Ulvskov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grantham et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wierzbicki et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the ESK1, GUX2, and GXM3 enzymes, which are involved in the deposition of the acetyl and GlcA groups, as well as the methylation of GlcA group, respectively, are over-accumulated in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> stem proteomics, providing a possible explanation for the modification in glucuronoxylan decoration observed in the interfascicular fiber cells of the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant. To investigate further the variations in glucuronoxylan decoration incurred by the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutation, we analyzed the patterns of xylanase-released SCW oligosaccharide using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ropartz et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mortimer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Urbanowicz et al., 2012</xref>), MALDI-TOF analysis of Col-0 glucurononoxylan oligosaccharides showed the release of xylo-oligosaccharide pairs, evenly spaced by their degrees of polymerization and acetylation, bearing a GlcA (m/z 1705.5/1747.5) or methylated GlcA (m/z 1719.5/1761.5) substitution group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, the level of GlcA branched xylo-oligomers was strongly decreased in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> double mutant, and this whatever the complexity of the oligomers considered (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and Figure 6-figure supplement 1A). Importantly, the molecular phenotypes observed in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant were rescued in both <italic>msil2/4</italic>+<italic>MSIL</italic>2F1 and <italic>msil2/4</italic>+<italic>MSIL4</italic>F1 complemented lines, confirming the specificity of the mutation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). In agreement with the MALDI–TOF outcome, quantification of the acidic sugar levels in unpretreated (-Tr), or acid pretreated (+Tr) WT and <italic>msil2/4</italic> stem samples confirmed that the release of GlcA moiety was strongly reduced in <italic>msil2/4</italic> double mutant, as opposed to the galacturonic acid/GalA group located on pectins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>It has been previously proposed that the intermediate level of glucuronoxylan methylation observed in Arabidopsis is due to an intrinsic rate-limiting activity of GXM enzymes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>). We noticed that in addition to GXM3, a second member of the GXM family, GXM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>), tends also to be over-expressed in <italic>msil2/4</italic> stem although at a fold change of 1.77 slightly below the fixed significance threshold in the proteomic analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and Supplementary file 4). This observations make us wonder whether the apparent decrease of GlcA branched xylooligosaccharides in <italic>msil2/4</italic> could be due to an overmethylation of the GlcA substituent. To address this question, we performed the xylanase digestion and MALDI-TOF analysis in presence of an added spike-in oligosaccharide control (Pentaacetyl-chitopentaose) for normalization of the MALDI_TOF data (Figure 6-figure supplement 1A). Upon normalization, the MALDI-TOF data indicated that the decrease of the peaks corresponding to the GlcA-branched xylooligosaccharides was correlated with a increase in corresponding meGlcA branched xylooligosaccharides, (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and Figure 6-figure supplement 1B, Supplementary file 6), suggesting that the MSIL2/4 mutations unleash the activity of the GXM1/3 in stem. RNA immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed that the <italic>GXM3</italic> and <italic>GXM1</italic> mRNAs are efficiently pulled-down from MSIL4G-3, but not MSIL4G<sup>RRM</sup>-3 plant extracts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that the MSIL2/4 interaction network controls the 4-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of glucuronoxylan by repressing the activity of the GXM1/3 mRNAs in stem.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential components of the gene regulation machinery that govern the fate and expression of cellular RNA at post-transcriptional levels, including processing, splicing, base modification, translation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). Sequence-based bioinformatic, reverse and forward genetic, and affinity-based proteomic analyses have converged to show that plants, like animals and fungi, harbor a large diversity of RBPs whose functions in gene regulation and plant development are ill-defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Reichel et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we have identified an RRM motif-containing RBP family, hereafter named as MSIL, whose members share sequence, structural and functional similarities with the animal translational regulator Musashi/MSI. We found that two of the four MSIL members, MSIL2 and MSIL4, function redundantly to control various aspects of Arabidopsis development, including leaf senescence, morphology of rosette leaves, and the rigidity of the inflorescence stem. Our data suggest that the pleiotropy associated with the MSIL2/4 mutation likely results from the multifunctionality of these proteins in Arabidopsis development, a situation similar to the complex phenotypic traits previously associated to MSI mutations in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fox et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kudinov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). Although the molecular bases underlying the <italic>msil2/4</italic> phenotypic variation remain unclear, the presence of MSILs in the high confidence Arabidopsis mRNA-binding proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Reichel et al., 2016</xref>), suggests that these proteins are likely to exert control over development by targeting a complex repertoire of mRNAs. Regardless of the mechanism, our data support a cell/tissue-context specific role for MSIL and provide a resource for further studies on the mechanisms of MSIL regulation in plants.</p>
<p>Our data also provide evidence that the RRM domains of the MSIL2/4 proteins exhibit RNA-binding ability and are essential for the activity of these proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, an observation that is corroborated by the presence of the MSIL2/4 proteins in an experimentally determined Arabidopsis mRNA-binding proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Reichel et al., 2016</xref>). Further supporting a role for MSIL2/4 in mRNA-related transactions, affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that these proteins share a common network of protein-protein interactions with well-known mRNA-binding proteins, including the PAB2/4/8, RBP45/47, and the translation factor EIF4G. Notably, the animal polyA-binding protein/PABP (homolog of the plant PABs) was previously shown to be a functional partner of MSI that is essential for it activity in translation repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fox et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cragle et al. 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the MSIL2/4-associated proteins also include the phylogenetically related RBGD2/4 proteins, two constitutively expressed RBPs that are involved in heat resistance in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>). The comparison of the MSIL2/4 and RBGD2/4 interactomes indicates only a partial overlap, suggesting a certain level of subfunctionalization. In accordance with this observation, the MSILs and RBGDs clearly diversify in function, since the <italic>rbgd2/4</italic> double mutant exhibits no developmental phenotypes under normal growth conditions.</p>
<p>A penetrant developmental phenotype associated with the MSIL2/4 mutations is a loss in stem rigidity that we could trace back to a defect in SCW formation, an important reservoir of fixed carbon and a renewable resource of major environmental and economic importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Meents et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, with the exception of few microRNAs involved in the control of lignin polymer synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), no information about RBPs-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of SCW biosynthetic genes was previously reported. In this study, we show that MSIL2 and MSIL4, function redundantly to promote SCW formation in the interfascicular fibers and that their ability to bind RNA is essential to fulfill this function. Our conclusions are supported by independent approaches which highlight changes of SCW thickness, lignin content, and xylan decoration profile in the interfascicular fiber cells of the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant. The fiber-specific effect of the MSIL2/4 mutations on SCW formation, is further supported by our evidence showing that the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant grows normally and lacks the xylem collapses usually observed in more pleiotropic SCW deficient mutants. Previous studies have shown that specific master transcriptional regulators, such as NST1 and NST3, control cell-lineage specific formation of SCW formation in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Taylor-Teeples et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mitsuda et al., 2007</xref>). Our study extends this observation by showing that RBP-mediated post-transcriptional mechanisms are also involved in cell-type specific control of SCW formation in Arabidopsis. Notably, the presumed role of MSIL2/4 in SCW formation in the interfascicular fiber cells contrasts with the rather constitutive expression of the corresponding <italic>MSIL2/4</italic> genes, suggesting as previously discussed, that MSIL2/4 activities depend on cell-context. This is in accordance with the reported cell-type specific activities of the ubiquitous MSI2 in cell renewal, cell differentiation and cancer control in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fox et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kudinov et al., 2017</xref>). Understanding how the activity of the <italic>MSIL2/4</italic> genes is controlled by the cellular context will be essential from a basic point of view, providing a unique model for studying RBP regulation in specific cell type in plants.</p>
<p>From the set of genes found to be misregulated in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> stem transcriptome, none could be functionally associated with SCW biosynthesis. In contrast, we found that the MSIL2/4 mutation upregulates a battery of plant defense-related genes, known to be involved in systemic acquired resistance (SAR). In this regard, the constitutive activation of defense pathways has been well documented in mutant plants defective in cell wall formation, including the SCW (Ellis et al. 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Miedes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al. 2023</xref>), an observation that tends to support the idea that the transcriptome changes incurred by the MSIL2/4 disruption could be indirect. This hypothesis was supported by several lines of evidence: 1) the level of activation of defense genes in <italic>msil2/4</italic> is low compared to that usually observed in plants developing SAR or in mutant plants showing an auto-activation of plant immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wu et al., 2012</xref>); 2) SAR-dependent activation of defense genes is controlled mostly at a transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>); 3) the stem phenotypes displayed by <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant have not been reported, to our knowledge, in the numerous plant-pathogen studies published so far; 4) the top enriched proteins in the stem proteome of <italic>msil2/4</italic> are players of the SCW biosynthesis pathway but not plant-defense signaling. That being said, we can’t exclude that the activation of immune-related genes, that include many cell wall-modifying enzymes, additively contributes to the <italic>msil2/4</italic> stem phenotype. Further studies will be required to clarify this issue.</p>
<p>Our data reveal that the accumulation of the mRNA of SCW biosynthesis enzymes and regulators are unaffected in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant, suggesting that the MSIL2/4 proteins act at a translational level to regulate the SCW formation. In this regard, the stem proteomics gives us a glimpse into the changes in protein abundance that could account for the observed <italic>msil2/4</italic> SCW phenotype. Indeed, our MS data reveal that proteins related to the glucuronoxylan biosynthesis machinery, including enzymes involved both in the synthesis (IRX9/10/14) and substitution (GUX1, ESK1, and GXM3) of the xylan backbone, are significantly over-accumulated in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant. Knowing that the synthesis of the structurally complex glucuronoxylan polysaccharide requires the coordinated production and action of these enzymes in the Golgi apparatus, our results suggests that MSIL2/4 is exerting a multilevel control on the glucuronoxylan pathway, a mechanism reminiscent of the multi-nodal control displays by MSI2 on the TGF-β and translation pathways in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Park et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Duggimpudi et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>From a mechanistic point of view, however, our data raise several intriguing questions. In particular, the extent of glucuronoxylan-related protein abundance changes in <italic>msil2/4</italic> is at odds with the minor changes observed to glucuronoxylan composition. In particular, while the proteomic changes can correlate with the observed increase in glucuronoxylan methylation, it is not associated as expected with an increase in global glucuronoxylan content. One possible explanation for this observation could be that the activities of the GUX, ESK, IRXs glucuronoxylan biosynthesis enzymes, in contrast to that of GXM3, are not rate-limiting for glucuronoxylan synthesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Alternatively, in light with prior studies that have shown that the steady-state levels of glucuronoxylan and cellulose are correlated within the SCW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ye and Zhong, 2022</xref>), one could imagine that mechanisms acting downstream of glucuronoxylan <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis step contribute to fine tune the final content in glucuronoxylan in the SCW. Comparing the levels of glucuronoxylan produced in the Golgi apparatus versus the ones deposited in the SCW in both WT ve<italic>rs</italic>us msil2/4 plants will be necessary to ascertain this hypothesis. In contrast, the concomitance between the glucuronoxylan hypermethylation and the GXM3 overaccumulation phenotypes observed in <italic>msil2/4</italic> clearly support the previous assumption that GXM-mediated methylation is a rate-limiting step in glucuronoxylan that can be overcome by GXM protein overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>). In fine, our data support the idea that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation act in a concerted manner to fine tune the GXM3 and glucuronoxylan methylation levels in the stem. We currently posit that MSIL2/4 act in addition to the transcriptional network to adjust the final level of GXM enzymes by regulating the translation of the <italic>GXM</italic> mRNAs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Future biochemical and functional studies will be necessary to precisely understand the mechanism by which MSIL2/4 proteins impact gene expression during SCW synthesis in Arabidopsis.</p>

<caption><title>Model of MSIL-dependent control of glucuronoxylan methylation in Arabidopsis and its consequence for SCW architecture.</title>
<p>In the interfascicular fiber cells of Col-0, MSIL2/4 restrain the translation of the glucuronoxylan biosynthesis enzymes, including the rate-limiting GXM3 enzyme. This activity would keep the level of glucuronoxylan methylation at an intermediate level, therefore providing a biochemical environment that favors the interactions between the glucuronoxylan and lignin polymers. In the interfascicular fiber cells of <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant, the translation of the glucuronoxylan biosynthesis machinery, including GXM3, is increased, leading to the deposition of an over-methylated form of glucuronoxylan that would be less prone to interact with lignin and establish SCW formation. In a non exclusive manner, MSIL2/4 could also have a positive role in lignin synthesis, whose defect in <italic>msil2/4</italic> would lead to a decrease in lignin content. The model was inspired from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grantham et al., 2017</xref>.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Our data indicate that, in addition to the reported change in glucuronoxylan methylation, the MSIL2/4 mutations is also associated with a specific decrease of lignin content in the SCW of the interfascicular fiber cells, whose origin remains unclear. On the basis of the previous observations, we envision two possible mechanisms by which the MSIL2/4 mutations could impact the lignin deposition in the fiber cells. In the first model, we propose that MSIL2/4 positively control the lignin synthesis pathway in the interfascicular cells by promoting the translation of lignin biosynthesis genes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In this regard, although no GO enrichment could be observed for lignin biosynthesis related genes in the proteomic analysis, two lignin biosynthetic enzymes, CAD4 and PAL2, are significantly down-accumulated in <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant (Supplementary file 4), an observation that could account for the observed decrease in lignin content. However, previous published biochemical and genetic analyses do not support this conclusion, as the single <italic>cad4</italic> and <italic>pal2</italic> knock-out mutants display no significant alteration of lignin content due to genetic redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sibout et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rohde et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, thioacidolysis analyses showed that the ratio or degree of polymerization of the different lignin monomers remain unchanged in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant, reinforcing the idea that the lignin biosynthesis pathway is functional in this mutant, leaving open the question of the specificity of MSIL2/4 action on the lignin pathway (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7</xref>). An alternative explanation for the decrease in lignin phenotype observed in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant would be that it results from an indirect cascade effect primarily triggered by the <italic>msil2/4</italic>-dependent changes in glucuronoxylan methylation. In this regard, it has been proposed that the 4-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of GlcA substituent results in the xylan being more hydrophobic, possibly impacting its interaction with lignin and the capacity of lignin to assemble in the SCW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Urbanowicz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Busse-Wicher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Terret and Dupree, 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). However, a 35S promoter-dependent overexpression study of GXMs in Arabidopsis previously failed to report any discernable developmental or molecular phenotypes associated to a glucuronoxylan hypermethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>). In the light of these results and despite it is necessary to elucidate deeper the role of MSIL on other SCW genes, our work provides evidence that they are new players in the regulation of SCW and may consequently impact biomass digestibility, with possible implications for improving feedstock for biorefinery.</p>

<p>Total RNA was isolated using the TRI re-agent (Cat. No. TR-118; Euromedex) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA was then digested out using the RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Cat. No. M6101; Promega). cDNAs were obtained from 400 ng of RQ1-treated RNA using 1 μl of GoScript Reverse Transcriptase (Cat. No. A5003; Promega) in a 20-μl final volume reaction using random primers (Cat. No. C1181; Promega) in the presence of 20 units of RNasin (Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor, Cat. No. C2511; Promega) and dNTP mix at a final concentration of 0.5 mM of each dNTP (Cat. No. U1511; Promega). Semi-quantitative RT–PCR amplifications were performed on 1 μl of cDNA in a 12.5-μl reaction volume to start with. The amplification of EF1αtranscripts was used to equilibrate. qRT–PCR was performed on a Light Cycler 480 II machine (Roche Diagnostics) by using the Takyon No ROX SYBR MasterMix blue dTTP kit (Cat. No. UF-NSMT-B0701; Eurogentec). Each amplification reaction was set up in a 10-μl reaction containing each primer at 300 nM and 1 μl of RT template in the case of total RNA with a thermal profile of 95°C for 10 min and 40 amplification cycles of 95°C, 15 s; 60°C, 60 s. Relative transcript accumulation was calculated using the ΔΔCt methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Livak and Schmittgen, 2001</xref>), using ACTIN2 as internal control. Average ΔΔCt represents three experimental replicates with standard errors. PolyA+ RNAs were purified from RNA obtained by the TRI Reagent extraction, using the PolyATtract mRNA Isolation System III (Cat. No. Z5310; Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNAs were then synthetized according to the above protocol using 50 ng of polyA+ RNA as starting material. Semiquantitative and quantitative RT–PCRs were performed as described above with a 1/25 dilution of cDNAs from polyA+ RNA as template for qRT–PCR. The primers used for RT and qRT-PCR are listed in Supplementary file 7.</p>

<title>RNA Sequencing</title>
<p>Total RNA were extracted from the basal stem section of mature Col-0 and <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant plants using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat.#74904) and treated onto the column with the RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen, Cat.#79254). Two replicates were performed per plant lines. PolyA purification, library preparation using the Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA kit and library quality controls were performed by the BioEnvironment Illumina Platform. The mRNA sequencing of Col-0 and msil2/4 mRNAs was done with single-reads, 1x 75pb and 30–35x10<sup>6</sup> reads per library.</p>

<sec id="s4i">
<title>RNASeq analysis</title>
<p>For each library, 30–35x10<sup>6</sup> reads were obtained with 85–90% of the bases displaying a Q-score ≥ 30, with a mean Q-score of 38 as assessed with Fastqc (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>). Reads were mapped against the TAIR 10 genome using gtf annotation file and default parameters of TopHat2 v2.0.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). Assembly and transcript quantification were performed with Cufflinks v2.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the low expressed transcripts -less than 1 RPKM (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) in one of the libraries were filtered out. The differential analysis was conducted by Cuffdiff software, belonging to the Trapnell suite. Foldchange (FC) was determined as the ratio between the normalized read counts between mutant and wild-type.</p>

<title>Fluorescence detection and tissue colorations</title>
<p>GFP detections were performed on <italic>in vitro</italic> grown one week seedling roots fixed in fixation buffer (50mM Pipes, 5mM EGTA, 5mM MgSO4, pH7 added with 2% para-formaldehyde and 0.2% Triton). After 5 min vacuum infiltration and 10 min agitation at room temperature, roots were washed twice with fixation buffer and stored at 4°C until confocal observation. Confocal imaging was done using an Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 LSM 700. Roots were observed in water and for GFP detection samples were excited at 488 nm and the signal captured at 495–555 nm. For RFP detection, excitation was performed at 555 nm and the signal captures at 600-700 nm. Images were analysed with ImageJ. At least 15 samples per line were analyzed.</p>
<p>Stem coloration were performed from 5 cm length basal stem pieces conserved in ethanol 80%. Stems were rehydrated first in ethanol 50% and later in water and then embedded in agarose 5% before being transversally cut using a vibratome (Leica vt 1000s) to obtain 120 micron thickness sections stored in water. The presence of lignin was determined by staining with phloroglucinol for 30 seconds, giving a red coloration in the presence of lignin cinnamaldehyde groups. Sections were observed using an inverted microscope (Leitz DMRIBE, Leica Micro-systems, Wetzlar, Germany) and images were registered using a CCD camera (Color Collview, Photonic Science, Milham, UK).</p>
<p>For cellulose detection, the brightener Calcofluor White ST [4,4’-bis(anilino-6-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino-s-triazine-ylamino)-2,2’-stilbene disulfonic acid; Cyanamide Co., Bound Brook, N.J] was used at a final concentration of 0.1%. The samples were incubated with calcofluor for 3 min, washed three times with water before being observed. For detection, excitation was performed at 405 nm and the signal captures at 434-496 nm. For auto-fluorescence analysis stem sections were excited at 405 nm and the signal captures at 410-470 nm for blue. Pictures have been analyzed with LAS X (Leica Application Suite X).</p>

<title>Biochemical analyses of SCWs</title>
<p>Arabidopsis stems (5 cm sections at the bottom part of the stems) were harvested from Col0 and <italic>msil2/4</italic> double mutant as four independent biological replicates. Soluble extractives were eliminated as described by Ployet et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ployet et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, stems were freeze dried for 48h, ground using a Mixer Mill MM 400 (Retsch), and extracted by hot solvents (successively water, ethanol, ethanol/toluene (1:1 v/v) and acetone) to obtain extractive-free stem residues (ESR). The determination of acetyl bromide (AcBr) lignin was performed on 10mg of ESR as described by Ployet et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ployet et al., 2019</xref>). All analyses were done in triplicate. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis was performed on 100-200 mg of ESR. Spectra were recorded from ten technical replicates, in the range 400–4000 cm−1 with a 4 cm-1 resolution and 32 scans per spectrum using an attenuated total reflection (ATR) Nicolet IS50 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France) equipped with a deuterated-triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector. Spectra analyses were performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dai et al., 2020</xref>. Saccharification yield was estimated with or without alkali pretreatment, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Van Acker et al., 2016</xref>. Reducing sugar concentration was assessed with dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) reagent using 10µl of the supernatant after 9 h of reaction.

<title>Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analyses</title>
<p>Proteins from total inflorescence stem extracts of three biological replicates of Col-0 and <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant plants were solubilized in Laemmli buffer and heated for 10 min at 95°C. They were then stacked in the top of a 4-12% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen), stained with Coomassie blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) before in-gel digestion using modified trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Casabona et al., 2013</xref>). The resulting peptides were analyzed by online nanoliquid chromatography coupled to MS/MS (Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano and Orbitrap Exploris 480, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 180-min gradient. For this purpose, the peptides were sampled on a precolumn (300 μm x 5 mm PepMap C18, Thermo Scientific) and separated in a 75 μm x 250 mm C18 column (Aurora Generation 2, 1.6µm, IonOpticks). The MS and MS/MS data were acquired using Xcalibur 4.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>
<p>Peptides and proteins were identified by Mascot (version 2.8.0, Matrix Science) through concomitant searches against the Viridiplantae database (from Uniprot, Arabidopsis thaliana (thale-cress) taxonomy, 136447 sequences) and a homemade database containing the sequences of classical contaminant proteins found in proteomic analyses (human keratins, trypsin…, 126 sequences). Trypsin/P was chosen as the enzyme and two missed cleavages were allowed. Precursor and fragment mass error tolerances were set at respectively at 10 and 20 ppm. Peptide modifications allowed during the search were: Carbamidomethyl (C, fixed), Acetyl (Protein N-term, variable) and Oxidation (M, variable). The Proline software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bouyssié et al., 2020</xref>) (version 2.2.0) was used for the compilation, grouping, and filtering of the results (conservation of rank 1 peptides, peptide length ≥ 6 amino acids, false discovery rate of peptide-spectrum-match identifications &lt; 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Couté et al., 2020</xref>), and minimum of one specific peptide per identified protein group). MS data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Perez-Riverol et al., 2022</xref>). Proline was then used to perform a MS1 label-free quantification of the identified protein groups based on razor and specific peptides.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the ProStaR software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wieczorek et al., 2017</xref>) based on the quantitative data obtained with the four biological replicates analyzed per condition. Proteins identified in the contaminant database, proteins identified by MS/MS in less than two replicates of one condition, and proteins quantified in less than three replicates of one condition were discarded. After log2 transformation, abundance values were normalized using the variance stabilizing normalization (vsn) method, before missing value imputation (SLSA algorithm for partially observed values in the condition and DetQuantile algorithm for totally absent values in the condition). Statistical testing was conducted with limma, whereby differentially expressed proteins were selected using a log2(Fold Change) cut-off of 1 and a p-value cut-off of 0.00513, allowing to reach a false discovery rate close to 1% according to the Benjamini-Hochberg estimator. Proteins found differentially abundant but identified by MS/MS in less than two replicates, and detected in less than three replicates, in the condition in which they were found to be more abundant were invalidated (p-value = 1).</p>

<p>Samples of Arabidopsis tissues were dehydrated in a successive ethanol series (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 95%, and 100%) and embedded in LR White resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences ). Thin sections (1 µm) were placed on Teflon-coated slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences), blocked in phosphate-buffered saline, 2% Tween, and 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h (PBST-BSA), and labeled overnight (12 h) at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted in PBST-BSA. Sections were washed with PBST and incubated at room temperature for 2 h with a secondary antibody diluted in PBST-BSA. Slides were then washed with deionized water and dried under a stream of dry air. Primary antibodies and dilutions were as follows:, LM10 and LM11 (1:10, v/v; Plant Probes for both). The secondary antibody was a goat anti-rat IgG coupled to the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 555 (Molecular Probes) and was used at a 1:100 (v/v) dilution. Observations were carried out using a LeicaDM 6000microscope with a TCS SP8 scanning confocal system using a 40 x apochromatic oil immersion objective to visualized Alexa555 fluorescence (excitation: 561 nm; emission: 565–645 nm). Acquisition settings, including laser power,photomultiplier gain, field of view (X,Y dimension), Z-step, and pixel size of the image, were strictly identical to ensure reliable comparisons between plant material (i.e. the wild type versus mutants).</p>

<p>Secondary cell walls support vascular plants and conduct water throughout the plant body, but are also important resources for lignocellulosic feedstocks. Secondary cell wall synthesis is under complex transcriptional control, presumably because it must only be initiated after cell growth is complete. Here, the authors found that two Musashi-type RNA-binding proteins, MSIL2 and MSIL4 are redundantly required for secondary cell wall development in Arabidopsis. The plant phenotypes could be complemented by the wild-type version of either protein, but not by a MSIL4 version that carries mutations in the conserved RNA-binding domains, and the authors localized MSIL2 &amp; 4 to stress granules, implicating the RNA-binding function of MSIL4 in the cell wall phenotype. Upon closer inspection, the secondary cell wall phenotypes included changes in vasculature morphology, and minor changes to lignin and hemicellulose (glucuronoxylan). While there were no changes to likely cell wall target genes in the transcriptome of msil2msil4 plants, proteomics experiments found glucuronoxylan biosynthesis components were upregulated in the mutants, and they detected an increase in substituted xylan via several methods. Finally, they documented MSIL4 binding to RNA encoding one of these targets, suggesting that MSIL2 and MSIL4 act to post-transcriptionally regulate glucuronoxylan modification. Altogether, this is a new mechanism by which cell wall composition could be regulated.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is well-written, the data are generally high-quality, and the authors typically use several independent methods to support each claim. However, several important questions remain unanswered by this work in its current state and the model presented in Figure 7 is quite speculative. For example, the link between the striking plant phenotype and GXM misregulation is unclear since GXM overexpression doesn't alter plant phenotypes or lignin content (Yuan et al 2014 Plant Science), so misregulation of GXMs in msil2msil4 mutants clearly is not the whole story. It also remains to be determined why one particular secondary cell wall synthesis enzyme is regulated likely post-transcriptionally, while so much of the pathway is regulated at the transcriptional level. There are likely other targets for MSIL2- and MSIL4-mediated regulation since it seems that MSIL2 and MSIL4 are expressed in tissues that are not synthesizing secondary cell walls.</p>

<p>This work explored the biological functions of a small family of RNA-binding proteins that was previously studied in animals, but was uncharacterized in plants. Combinatorial T-DNA insertional mutants disrupting the expression of the four Mushashi-like (MSIL) genes in Arabidopsis revealed that only the msil2 msil4 double mutant visibly alters plant development. The msil2/4 plants produced stems that could not stand upright. Transgene complementation, site-directed mutagenesis of MSIL4 conserved RNA-binding motifs, and in vitro RNA binding assays support the conclusion that the loss of MSIL2 and MISL4 function is responsible for the observed morphological defects. MSIL2/4 interact with proteins associated with mRNA 3'UTR binding and translational regulation.</p>
<p>The authors present compelling biochemical evidence that Mushashi-like2 (MSIL2) and MSIL4 jointly regulate secondary cell wall biosynthesis in the Arabidopsis stem. Quantitative analyses of proteins and transcripts in msil2/4 stems uncovered transcriptional upregulation of several xylan-related enzymes (despite WT-like RNA levels). Consistent with MALDI-TOF data for released xylan oligosaccharides, the authors propose a model in which MSIL2/4 negatively regulate the translation of GXM (glucuronoxylan methyltransferase), a presumed rate-limiting step. The molecular links between overmethylated xylans and the observed stem defects (which include subtle reductions in lignin and increases beta-glucan polymer distribution) warrants further investigation in future studies. Similarly, as the authors point out, it is intriguing that the loss of the broadly expressed MSIL2/4 genes only significantly affects specific cell types in the stem.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Kairouani et al. investigates the function of a small family of plant RNA binding proteins with similarity to the well-studied Musashi protein in animals, and, therefore, called MUSASHI-LIKE1-4 (MSL1-4). Studies on the biological importance of post-transcriptional control of gene expression via RNA-binding proteins in plants are not numerous, and advances in this important field are much needed. The thorough work presented in this manuscript is such an advance.</p>
<p>The central observations of the paper are</p>
<p>
- Knockout of any MSL gene alone does not produce a phenotype.</p>
<p>
It is of note that basic characterization of knockout mutations is really well done - for example, the authors have taken care to raise specific antibodies to each of the MSL proteins and use them to demonstrate that each of the T-DNA insertion mutants used actually does knock out protein production from the corresponding gene.</p>
<p>- Knockout of MSL2/4 (but no other double mutant) produces a clear leaf phenotype, and a remarkable stem phenotype in which the mutants collapse as they are unable to support upright growth</p>
<p>- The phenotypes of knockout mutants persist in point mutants defective in RNA-binding, indicating that RNA-binding is required for biological activity. Consistent with this, and associate physically with other RNA-binding proteins and translation factors.</p>
<p>- MSL proteins are cytoplasmic</p>
<p>- The msl2/4 mutants present multiple defects in secondary cell wall composition and structure, probably explaining their inability to grow upright. I did not examine the cell wall analyses in detail as I am no specialist in this field.</p>
<p>- Msl2/4 mutants show transcriptomic changes with at large two big categories of differentially expressed genes compared to wild type.</p>
<p>
(1) Genes related to cell wall metabolism</p>
<p>
(2) Genes associated with defense against herbivores and pathogens</p>
<p>- Two of the mRNAs encoding cell wall factors with significant upregulation in msl2/4 mutants compared to wild type also associate physically with MSL4 as judged by RNA-immunoprecipitation-RT-PCR assays, and this physical association is abrogated in the RNA-binding deficient MSL4 mutant.</p>
<p>Altogether, the study shows clear biological relevance of the MSL family of RNA-binding proteins and provides good arguments that the underlying mechanism is control of mRNAs encoding enzymes involved in secondary cell wall metabolism (although concluding on translational control in the abstract is perhaps saying too much - post-transcriptional control will do given the evidence presented). One observation reported in the study makes it vulnerable to alternative interpretation, however, and I think this should be explicitly treated in the discussion:</p>
<p>The fact that immune responses are switched on in msl2/4 mutants could also mean that MSL2/4 have biological functions unrelated to cell wall metabolism in wild type plants, and that cell wall defects arise solely as an indirect effect of immune activation (that is known to involve changes in expression of many cell wall-modifying enzymes and components such as pectin methylesterases, xyloglucan endotransglycosylases, arabinogalactan proteins etc. Indeed, the literature is rich in examples of gene functions that have been misinterpreted on the basis of knockout studies because constitutive defense activation mediated by immune receptors was not taken into account (see for example Lolle et al., 2017, Cell Host &amp; Microbe 21, 518-529).</p>
<p>With the evidence presented here, I am actually close to being convinced that the primary defect of msl2/msl4 mutants is directly related to altered cell wall metabolism, and that defense responses arise as a consequence of that, not the other way round. But I do not think that the reverse scenario can be formally excluded with the evidence at hand, and a discussion listing arguments in favor of the direct effect proposed here would be appropriate. Elements that the authors could consider to include would be the isolation of a cellulose synthase mutant as a constitutive expressor of jasmonic acid responses (cev1) as a clear example that a primary defect in cell wall metabolism can produce defense activation as secondary effect. The interaction of MSL4 with GXM1/3 mRNAs is also helpful to argue for a direct effect, and it would strengthen the argument if more examples of this kind could be included.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>Please find below our detailed point-by-point response to the eLife reviewer comments. As suggested by the reviewers, we have 1) replaced most of the Bar charts by Box plots, 2) highlighted the sucellular regions that are analyzed in the measurement experiments, and 3) have rewritten and toned down several subsections of the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I suggest that the authors consider the following points in future versions of this manuscript:</p>
<p>1). The link between the striking plant phenotype and GXM misregulation is unclear since GXM overexpression doesn't alter plant phenotypes or lignin content (Yuan et al 2014 Plant Science), so misregulation of GXMs in msil2msil4 mutants clearly is not the whole story. The authors should discuss alternative interpretations of their results and other possible targets of MSIL2/4 that might be contributing to the plant phenotype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We completely agree with the reviewer that the misregulation of GXMs in msil2/4 is not the whole story and we are currently developing specific strategies in order to characterize in an unbiased manner the full repertoire of MSIL mRNA targets in the stem, hoping we can identify other targets relevant to the formation of SCW. We have also toned-down our discussion concerning the possible impact of glucuronoxylan methylation level on lignin deposition (L546-552).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Similarly, it remains unclear why one particular secondary cell wall enzyme is regulated post-transcriptionally, while so much of the pathway is regulated at the transcriptional level. Please discuss.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not exclude that other genes encoding for SCW enzymes are impacted and it will be the subject of further investigations.  We have extended the discussion concerning these points. We have extended the discussion concerning these points (L486-498).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Thirdly, it seems that MSIL2 and MSIL4 are expressed in tissues that are not synthesizing secondary cell walls. The authors should discuss other possible targets of MSIL2/4 from their work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have extended the discussion concerning the pleiotropic effects of MSIL mutation in Arabidopsis (L 416-425). The variability of the msil2/4 phenotype is so large that we expect these proteins to regulate various cellular functions through the binding of specific set of mRNA. The mRNA targets specifically involved in these regulations will need to be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The discussion is extremely speculative and introduces new abbreviations (LTAc, XTRe) that are only used in their model (Figure 7). I suggest replacing these with dashed lines and/or question marks in the model, since as currently depicted, it looks as if these could be known gene products, which could be very misleading.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have removed the Ltac and XTRe abbreviations in Figure 7, and the corresponding text in the discussion section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Similarly, the speculation that cellulose content somehow regulates glucuronoxylan levels via xylan-cellulose interactions, leading to degradation of excess glucuronoxylan after synthesis is, to my knowledge, completely unsupported by any evidence except the correlation between cellulose and xylan levels. Please either support this claim with references or remove it from the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have removed the claim and have rewritten and toned down the text accordingly to the reviewer 1 comments (L 499-512).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Bar charts are rarely the most appropriate method for displaying biological data (Streit &amp; Gehlenborg 2014 Nature Methods). Authors should replace bar charts with one of the following options: A) plot all individual datapoints and overlay summary statistics, B) box plots with all individual datapoints show, C) violin plots (when n is large, i.e. n &gt; 50). R and R studio are free software that can generate such plots. Several excellent tools exist online to generate such plots via a free, graphical user interface, such as boxplotr (Spitzer et al 2014 Nature Methods): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/">http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/</ext-link> and PlotsOfData (Postma &amp; Goedhart 2019 PLoS Biology): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotsOfData/">https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotsOfData/</ext-link></p>

<p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</p>
<p>Altogether, the study shows clear biological relevance of the MSL family of RNA-binding proteins, and provides good arguments that the underlying mechanism is control of mRNAs encoding enzymes involved in secondary cell wall metabolism (although concluding on translational control in the abstract is perhaps saying too much - post-transcriptional control will do given the evidence presented). One observation reported in the study makes it vulnerable to alternative interpretation, however, and I think this should be explicitly treated in the discussion:</p>
<p>The fact that immune responses are switched on in msl2/4 mutants could also mean that MSL2/4 have biological functions unrelated to cell wall metabolism in wild type plants, and that cell wall defects arise solely as an indirect effect of immune activation (that is known to involve changes in expression of many cell wall-modifying enzymes and components such as pectin methylesterases, xyloglucan endotransglycosylases, arabinogalactan proteins etc. Indeed, the literature is rich in examples of gene functions that have been misinterpreted on the basis of knockout studies because constitutive defense activation mediated by immune receptors was not taken into account (see for example Lolle et al., 2017, Cell Host &amp; Microbe 21, 518-529).</p>
<p>With the evidence presented here, I am actually close to being convinced that the primary defect of msl2/msl4 mutants is directly related to altered cell wall metabolism, and that defense responses arise as a consequence of that, not the other way round. But I do not think that the reverse scenario can be formally excluded with the evidence at hand, and a discussion listing arguments in favor of the direct effect proposed here would be appropriate. Elements that the authors could consider to include would be the isolation of a cellulose synthase mutant as a constitutive expressor of jasmonic acid responses (cev1) as a clear example that a primary defect in cell wall metabolism can produce defense activation as secondary effect. The interaction of MSL4 with GXM1/3 mRNAs is also helpful to argue for a direct effect, and it would strengthen the argument if more examples of this kind could be included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In accordance to Rev3 comments, we have extended the discussion, listing the arguments, that we believe, are not in favor of a primary effect of the MSIL2/4 proteins on the activation of plant defense pathways (L468-485).</p>

<p>SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVED ANALYSES &amp; MINOR TEXT AND FIGURE CORRECTIONS.</p>
<p>(1) Unless there is a very good reason to use homology modelling such as SWISS-MODEL (for example ligand-bound proteins), Alphafold2 is now the tool to use for structure prediction. I would at least verify that Alphafold agrees with SWISS-MODEL on the predicted structures shown in Fig 2a.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have analyzed the MSIL4 sequence using the Alphafold2 prediction software and the output of this analysis completely agrees with the SWISS-Model prediction. We have added an additional panel showing the Alphafold 2 prediction (see figure 2-figure supplement 1B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The plant pictures shown in Figure 2d are not publication quality in terms of resolution, mounting, size. They really should be redone before final publication.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important observation, and have improved the resolution of the figure 2D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The colocalization in Figure 3d/e would benefit from some statistical analysis of the data: How many foci were examined? How many showed colocalization? Is that fraction statistically significant? It can be done from the images at hand; I do not think that additional data acquisition is necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have used an ImageJ plugin to perform colocalization analysis on the microscopy images corresponding to the bottom panel of the figure 3D (heat stress). This analysis confirmed that most of the foci are actually colocalizing (see Author response image 1). However our initial image data acquisition do not allow us to perform statistical analysis on it. We have added a sentence indicating that colocalization is supported by an analysis using an ImageJ plugin.</p>
