<abstract><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, RNase E, a central enzyme in RNA processing and mRNA degradation, contains a catalytic N-terminal domain (NTD), a membrane-targeting sequence (MTS), and a C-terminal domain (CTD). We investigated how MTS and CTD influence RNase E localization, diffusion, and function. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that ∼93% of RNase E localizes to the inner membrane and exhibits slow diffusion similar to polysomes. Comparing the native amphipathic MTS with a transmembrane motif showed that the MTS confers slower diffusion and stronger membrane binding. The CTD further slows diffusion by increasing mass but unexpectedly weakens membrane association. RNase E mutants with partial cytoplasmic localization displayed enhanced co-transcriptional degradation of <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA. These findings indicate that variations in the MTS and the presence of the CTD shape the spatiotemporal organization of RNA processing in bacterial cells, providing mechanistic insight into how RNase E domain architecture influences its cellular function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>RNase E (RNE) is the main endoribonuclease in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, known for its role in RNA processing and mRNA degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. It is an essential protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and homologous proteins are found across many bacterial species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The essentiality stems from the N-terminal domain (NTD), or the catalytic domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The NTD is followed by a membrane targeting sequence (MTS) and the C-terminal domain (CTD), or macromolecular interaction domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, where RhlB (a DEAD-box RNA helicase), PNPase (a 3’→5’ exonuclease), and enolase (a glycolytic enzyme) bind to form the RNA degradosome complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The MTS forms an amphipathic α helix, responsible for the localization of RNE on the inner membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the membrane localization of RNE and the presence of the CTD are not essential in <italic>E. coli</italic> nor are they conserved across bacterial species, in contrast to the broad conservation of the NTD across bacteria as well as chloroplasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This raises a question about the roles of membrane localization and the CTD in the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of RNE.</p>
<p><italic>E. coli</italic> strains with cytoplasmic RNE (due to the removal of the MTS) are viable, although they grow more slowly than the wild-type (WT) cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that membrane binding of RNE does not necessarily increase its enzymatic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, membrane localization is likely important for gene regulation <italic>in vivo</italic> because RNE becomes sequestered from the cytoplasmic pool of mRNAs, giving mRNAs time for translation. This idea is supported by our recent observation that the membrane-bound RNE limits the degradation of nascent mRNAs while cytoplasmic RNE (ΔMTS) can degrade nascent mRNAs during transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We found that transcripts encoding membrane proteins can be an exception to this rule, in that they can experience co-transcriptional degradation assisted by the transertion effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. These findings agree with results from a genome-wide study, indicating that the membrane localization of RNE allows for differential regulation of mRNA stability for genes encoding cytoplasmic proteins versus inner membrane proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported evidence that <italic>E. coli</italic> RNE can localize in the cytoplasm—for example, when cells were grown anaerobically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> or when membrane fluidity was reduced by changes in lipid composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. These findings imply that RNE can dissociate from the membrane; however, the origin of its weak membrane binding remains unknown.</p>
<p>Across bacteria, several species within α-proteobacteria have cytoplasmic RNE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> while other species possess membrane-bound RNE. Among these, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RNase Y (a functional homolog of RNE) associates with the membrane via a transmembrane (TM) motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, instead of an amphipathic motif used by <italic>E. coli</italic> and other γ-proteobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Given the diversity of membrane-binding motifs that have arisen through evolution, it should be possible to engineer <italic>E. coli</italic> RNE with a TM motif. Such a mutant would provide a useful model for investigating the impact of membrane-binding motifs on the localization, diffusion, and activity of RNE.</p>
<p>Lastly, the CTD of <italic>E. coli</italic> RNE is an intrinsically disordered region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> that, while nonessential for cell viability, enhances the enzymatic activity of the NTD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. As the primary binding site for degradosome components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, the CTD is thought to facilitate mRNA degradation by recruiting these proteins near the catalytic NTD. However, our recent study showed that these associated proteins have minimal impact on the degradation rate of <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA, whereas deletion of the CTD markedly stabilizes the transcript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, suggesting a possible intramolecular allosteric effect within RNE. In the present study, we further show that the CTD modulates the membrane binding affinity of RNE, possibly by affecting its conformation. These results reveal a previously underappreciated role of the CTD in regulating RNE function beyond degradosome assembly, with implications for how the spatial organization and structural dynamics of RNE fine-tune RNA degradation in bacteria.</p>
<p>In this study, we quantified the membrane binding percentage (MB%) of RNE in <italic>E. coli</italic> using single-molecule microscopy and showed that membrane association governs its diffusion and mRNA-degradation activity. Perturbing the native MTS, substituting it with LacY TM segments, and deleting the CTD collectively revealed how the MTS and CTD set RNE’s spatial organization and provided routes for tuning activity through subcellular control.</p>

<title>Membrane binding percentage (MB%) of RNE</title>
<p>First, we investigated the subcellular localization of RNE in live cells. Previous fluorescence microscopy studies have shown that RNE is localized to the inner membrane in <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, but the percentage of membrane-bound molecules has not been quantitatively examined in live cells. To address this gap, we fused RNE with a photo-convertible fluorescent protein, mEos3.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and imaged individual RNE molecules over time in two dimensions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The positions of fluorescent molecules were identified in each frame and linked into trajectories using the open-source software u-track<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In this section, we analyze localization, and diffusion dynamics are addressed in subsequent sections.</p>

<p>Subcellular locations were calculated relative to the cell boundaries identified from bright-field images using another open-source image analysis package Oufti<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To combine data from many cells, molecular positions along the short and long axes of a cell were normalized to the cell width and cell length, yielding xNorm and yNorm, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Based on yNorm, molecules within the cylindrical part of the cell were selected, and their xNorm values were used to generate an xNorm histogram. Hereinafter, we focus on the xNorm histogram to compare the membrane enrichment across protein constructs.</p>
<p>The xNorm histogram of RNE shows two peaks corresponding to the inner membrane on each side of the cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1A</xref>), very similar to the xNorm histogram of LacY, obtained by imaging LacY-mEos3.2 using the same method. LacY is a membrane channel for lactose and is composed of 12 TM segments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. It is expected to be inserted into the inner membrane during translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, such that all imaged LacY is expected to be localized in the inner membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We further quantified the percentage of molecules bound to the membrane (membrane-binding percentage or MB%) from the xNorm histogram. For this analysis, we first confirmed that proteins localized on the membrane and in the cytoplasm are detected with equal probability, despite differences in their mobilities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1B-C</xref>). Next, we developed a mathematical model based on a 2D projection of molecules randomly distributed either on the surface of or within a cylinder. The model includes imaging effects that affect the shape of xNorm histograms: localization error, the limited focal depth of the quasi-TIRF illumination we used, and the location of the inner membrane relative to the cell boundary (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1D-G</xref>). Model fitting was performed using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (MCMC). For validation, we applied the model to xNorm histograms of LacY and LacZ, which serve as benchmarks for complete membrane binding and complete cytoplasmic localization, respectively. The MB% of LacY was 99% with a 95% confidence interval of [96%, 100%], and LacZ showed MB% of 3.4% [0.2%, 7.3%] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F</xref>). Both MB% agree with the expectations for membrane and cytoplasmic proteins. For RNE, we found an MB% of 93% [91%, 96%] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The xNorm histogram of the fastest 7% of the RNE population (based on the diffusion coefficient, as discussed below) exhibited a cytoplasmic localization pattern (without the two membrane-associated peaks), supporting the existence of a cytoplasmic RNE subpopulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2A</xref>).</p>
<p>We confirmed that the MTS (residue 568-582) is essential for the membrane binding of RNE, as deletion of the MTS sequence made the xNorm like that of LacZ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2D</xref>). We note that the xNorm profile of RNE ΔMTS was slightly different from that of LacZ near the center line of the cell (x = 0), suggesting fewer RNE ΔMTS molecules were at the midline of the cell. Also, xNorm fitting yielded an MB% of 33%. These results may reflect nucleoid exclusion of RNE ΔMTS due to its large size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Consistently, a smaller cytoplasmic RNE variant generated by CTD truncation (RNE (1-529) or RNE ΔMTS ΔCTD) exhibited a xNorm profile closer to that of LacZ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2E</xref>).</p>

<p>Is there a critical residue(s) within the MTS required for membrane binding? The MTS forms an amphipathic α-helix, in which hydrophobic residues are expected to align on one side of the helix (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Previous studies suggested that replacing one of the hydrophobic residues with a hydrophilic amino acid can disrupt membrane binding of RNE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. We revisited the point mutations discussed in Khemici et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and analyzed MB% by mEos3.2 imaging. We found that the F574A F575A double mutation (noted as F574AA) did not significantly affect MB%, consistent with the fact that the substituted amino acids remain hydrophobic (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2F</xref>). In contrast, F582E and F575E mutations reduced MB% to 47% and 50%, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), and their xNorm histograms resembled that of RNE ΔMTS, suggesting predominantly cytoplasmic localization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2D</xref>, <bold>S2G-H</bold>). These findings indicate that the phenylalanine residues at positions 575 and 582 are critical for membrane association of RNE.</p>

<title>Effect of membrane binding on the diffusion of RNE</title>
<p>The membrane localization of RNE likely limits its diffusion and interaction with mRNA targets. Additionally, interaction with ribosome-bound mRNAs can further slow the diffusion of RNE. Here, we examined how these factors contribute to the diffusion dynamics of RNE.</p>
<p>To measure the diffusion of RNE, we analyzed the trajectories of individual RNE-mEos3.2 imaged at a 21.7-ms acquisition interval (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We calculated the diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic> by fitting the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of each trajectory to the equation MSD = 4<italic>D</italic>τ + <italic>b</italic>, where τ is lag time and <italic>b</italic> accounts for both dynamic and static localization errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We obtained <italic>D</italic><sub>RNE</sub> = 0.0184 ± 0.0002 µm<sup>2</sup>/s (mean ± SEM). This value was well above the lower detection limit of our microscope, determined using stationary, surface-immobilized mEos3.2, <italic>D</italic> = 0.0020 ± 0.0001 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S3A, Supplementary Discussion</xref>). Notably, <italic>D</italic><sub>RNE</sub> was comparable to that of ribosome-bound mRNAs, estimated to be <italic>D</italic> ∼0.015 µm<sup>2</sup>/s based on the diffusion of ribosomal protein L1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S3B</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess how membrane association affects diffusion, we compared <italic>D</italic> of WT RNE and the ΔMTS mutant. These two proteins have similar molecular masses, as the MTS comprises only 15 of the 1061 residues in a monomer of RNE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Therefore, any difference in <italic>D</italic> can be attributed to their subcellular localizations (membrane vs cytoplasm) rather than mass. We found that <italic>D</italic><sub>ΔMTS</sub> is ∼5.5 times that of <italic>D</italic><sub>RNE</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>We examined another pair of RNE mutants that differ in localization (membrane vs cytoplasm) but are similar in size: membrane-bound RNE (1-592) and cytoplasmic RNE (1-529), both lacking the CTD. These truncated variants diffused faster than their full-length counterparts due to reduced mass, but their <italic>D</italic> values still differed by a factor of ∼5.3 due to localization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the membrane binding reduces RNE mobility by a factor of 5.</p>

<title>Diffusion of RNE in the absence of mRNA substrates</title>
<p>When some of RNE molecules interact with mRNA, their diffusion can slow due to the added mass of mRNA and ribosomes, possibly yielding slower RNE subpopulations. Such mobility-based subpopulations have been observed for RNA polymerases and ribosomes in <italic>E. coli</italic> and used to estimate the fraction of molecules interacting with RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To test the effect of mRNA substrates on RNE diffusion, we treated cells with rifampicin (rif), which blocks transcription initiation, thus depleting cellular mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In rif-treated cells, <italic>D</italic><sub>RNE</sub> increased to 0.0270 ± 0.0003 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, which is 1.47 ± 0.010 times that in untreated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). We note that <italic>D</italic><sub>LacY</sub> also increased to 1.25 ± 0.01 times relative to untreated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Although this increase is relatively small, the increase in <italic>D</italic><sub>LacY</sub> was unexpected because LacY is not an RNA-binding protein. The increase in <italic>D</italic><sub>LacY</sub> likely results from the depletion of mRNAs near the membrane (e.g., the mRNAs undergoing transertion), which could otherwise hinder the diffusion of membrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The similar fold change in <italic>D</italic><sub>RNE</sub> and <italic>D</italic><sub>LacY</sub> upon rif treatment suggests that the change in RNE diffusion may largely be attributed to physical changes in the intracellular environment (such as reduced viscosity or macromolecular crowding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>), rather than a loss of RNA-RNE interactions.</p>
<p>Because the rif-induced change in <italic>D</italic><sub>RNE</sub> is largely physical, we next examined why eliminating RNA-RNE interactions does not further increase RNE mobility, using the ribosome as a benchmark. The diffusion of ribosomal protein L1 became 7 times as fast as that in rif-treated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. This big change can be explained by the fact that ribosomes form polysomes, where the effective mass of L1 protein in untreated cells would be 2 or more times that in rif-treated cells (where it remains as a free subunit). In the case of RNE, it forms the RNA degradosome complex, whose mass can be from 450 kDa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> to 2.3 MDa depending on the occupancy of the RNA degradosome component proteins (RhlB, PNPase, enolase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> (<bold>Supplementary Discussion)</bold>. Even at its largest size, the RNE complex is smaller than a 70S ribosome (∼2.5 MDa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>). This means that if RNE interacts with an mRNA associated with n ribosomes, the total mass of the RNE complex would increase by a factor of n or more. Thus, a substantial increase in <italic>D</italic><sub>RNE</sub> would be expected upon mRNA depletion, assuming that a significant fraction of RNE is engaged with mRNA-ribosome assemblies.</p>
<p>To explain the marginal increase in <italic>D</italic><sub>RNE</sub> upon rif treatment, we considered two possibilities; (1) only a small percentage of RNE molecules interacts with mRNAs at a given time and/or (2) RNE interacts with mRNAs only briefly, unlike ribosomes which spend an order of 10-100 s in a polysome state during translation elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. To distinguish between these possibilities, we attempted to increase the cellular pool of polysomes, either by treating cells with a translation elongation inhibitor chloramphenicol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> or by overexpressing <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA from a high-copy plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S3D-E</xref>). In both cases, a larger fraction of RNE would engage with mRNAs, potentially increasing the fraction of RNE in the slow-diffusing state. However, <italic>D</italic><sub>RNE</sub> remained unchanged compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S3F</xref>). This result rules out the possibility that only a small percentage of RNE interacts with mRNAs and instead weighs in favor of the scenario that RNE-mRNA interactions are brief. Specifically, if RNE interacts with mRNAs for ∼20 ms or less, the slow-diffusing state would last shorter than the frame interval and remain undetected in our experiment.</p>

<title>Diffusion and localization of the MTS and TM segments</title>
<p>Unlike RNE in <italic>E. coli</italic>, RNase Y, a functional homolog of RNE in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, is localized to the membrane via a TM domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. We wondered if there are differences between a peripheral motif (like the MTS of <italic>E. coli</italic>’s RNE) and a TM motif in terms of membrane localization and mobility. To address this question, we created RNE mutants in which the MTS was replaced with a TM domain. For the TM domain, we used TM segments of LacY, a native <italic>E. coli</italic> protein, rather than using the TM motif from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RNase Y, which might interact with the <italic>E. coli</italic> membrane in a non-native manner.</p>
<p>Before creating the RNE mutants, we characterized the MB% and the diffusion of individual short membrane-binding motifs. Native LacY contains 12 TM segments, arranged into two groups of six<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We successfully expressed constructs containing the first two TM segments (LacY (1-74) or LacY2), the first six TM segments (LacY (1-193) or LacY6), and the full-length LacY (LacY12), each fused to mEos3.2 and expressed from a chromosomal IPTG-inducible promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We then imaged their membrane localization and diffusion. Both the MTS segment and LacY-derived TM segments showed a strong membrane enrichment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In terms of diffusion, LacY2 and LacY6 diffused faster than the MTS segment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), contrary to expectations based on size (or mass)-dependent diffusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>According to the Stokes-Einstein relation for diffusion in simple fluids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> and the Saffman-Delbruck diffusion model for membrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, <italic>D</italic> decreases as particle size increases, albeit with different scaling behaviors. Specifically, the Saffman-Delbruck model predicts that <italic>D</italic> for membrane proteins decreases logarithmically with increasing radius of the membrane-embedded region, assuming a constant membrane environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Thus, if size (or mass) were the primary determinant of diffusion, LacY2 and LacY6 would diffuse more slowly than the smaller MTS. The observed discrepancy instead implies that <italic>D</italic> may be governed by how each motif interacts with the membrane. For example, the way that TM domains are anchored to the membrane may facilitate faster lateral diffusion with surrounding lipids.</p>
<p>Despite the prevalence of peripheral membrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, how they interact with the membrane and how this differs from TM proteins remain poorly understood. To further explore this, we conducted all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the MTS and the LacY variants interacting with the <italic>E. coli</italic> membrane using the NAMD software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. In the simulations, protein motion was calculated for 1 µs. Although the absolute <italic>D</italic> values were higher than experimental values (possibly due to the absence of mEos3.2 in the model), the overall trends were preserved; among the LacY series, larger constructs diffused more slowly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S4A</xref>).

By calculating membrane-protein interaction energies, we found that the MTS-membrane interactions were more stable than those of LacY2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S4B</xref>). These results suggest that the slower diffusion of the MTS is due to stronger interactions with lipid head groups compared to membrane-embedded TM segments.</p>

<p>xNorm histograms of the ΔCTD mutants indicated membrane localization similar to LacY (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). However, mutants containing the CTD showed noticeable cytoplasmic subpopulations when LacY2 and LacY6 were used in place of the MTS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2J-K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S6B</xref>). Mathematical model fitting of the xNorm histograms estimated the MB% of RNE-LacY2-CTD and RNE-LacY6-CTD to be 69% [66%, 73%] and 86% [84%, 90%], respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). We note that imperfect membrane localization was observed only in mutants containing the CTD; the same protein without the CTD showed MB% of 100% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S6A-B</xref>). These findings suggest that the CTD may contribute to unstable membrane binding of RNE. Supporting this idea, previously characterized RNE MTS point mutants with MB% &lt;50% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>) also exhibited increased MB% upon the CTD removal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S6A-B</xref>). Such a difference in MB% between the CTD-containing and the CTD-lacking mutants was not observed in the chimera based on LacY12 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E-F</xref>), possibly due to the stable membrane insertion by LacY12.</p>
<p>Next, we examined whether the <italic>D</italic> of chimeric RNE mutants varied depending on the type of membrane-binding motifs. For example, the MTS diffused more slowly than LacY2 and LacY6, despite being smaller in size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-D</xref>). Based on this, we expected the chimeric RNE with LacY2 or LacY6 to diffuse faster than RNE with MTS. Indeed, in the absence of the CTD, we found that the <italic>D</italic> of LacY2-based RNE was 1.33 ± 0.01 times as fast as the MTS-based RNE (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). However, LacY6-based RNE did not diffuse faster than the MTS-based version (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). This result may be due to the high TM load (24 helices) created by four LacY6 anchors in the RNE tetramer. Although all constructs are tetrameric, the 24-helix load (LacY6), compared with 8 (LacY2) and 4 (MTS), likely enlarges the membrane-embedded footprint and increases drag, thereby changing the mobility advantages assessed as standalone membrane anchors.</p>
<p>In the presence of the CTD, the <italic>D</italic> of LacY2 and LacY6-based RNE became 3.33 ± 0.004 and 1.14 ± 0.01 times that of the MTS-based RNE counterpart (i.e. the WT RNE), respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). This is likely influenced by the presence of a cytoplasmic population (∼31% for LacY2 and ∼14% for LacY6; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig S2J-K</xref>), which diffuses more rapidly than membrane-bound molecules (possibly by a factor of five, based on <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that the CTD weakens the membrane association of RNE and small TM motifs can facilitate the diffusion of RNE.</p>

<title>Functional consequence of subcellular localization and diffusion of RNE</title>
<p>To check the functional consequence of cytoplasmic localization of RNE, we measured <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA degradation in various RNE mutants presented in this study. Recently, we developed an assay to quantify both co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional degradation rates of <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA by inducing its transcription for only 75 s, thereby capturing the degradation of nascent mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In WT cells, we found that the co-transcriptional degradation rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>d1</sub>) is about 10 times slower than the post-transcriptional degradation rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>d2</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In cells expressing RNE ΔMTS, however, <italic>k</italic><sub>d1</sub> increases by a factor of ∼3, suggesting that cytoplasmic RNE can freely diffuse and degrade nascent mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. This result led us to hypothesize that RNE variants exhibiting a cytoplasmic subpopulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>) may exhibit a larger <italic>k</italic><sub>d1</sub> compared to more membrane-bound variants.</p>
<p>We repeated this assay in a strain expressing the WT RNE fused to mEos3.2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S7A</xref>). Note that this strain is different from the one we used for imaging because a monocistronic <italic>lacZ</italic> gene is needed for the transient induction assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The relative abundances of 5’ <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA (Z5) remained constant prior to the rise in 3’ <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA (Z3) levels (between ∼100 and 210 s), confirming negligible co-transcriptional degradation in WT cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, in cells expressing RNE-LacY2-CTD (MB% = 69%), Z5 levels exhibited a downward trend during the same time window (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).

<p>We next examined whether the post-transcriptional mRNA degradation rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>d2</sub>) is limited by the slow diffusion of membrane-bound RNE. In the presence of the CTD, <italic>k</italic><sub>d2</sub> did not significantly vary across membrane-targeting variants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>).

A critical control for this comparison is RNE abundance: because RNE autoregulates its expression by degrading its own transcript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, slower diffusion could elevate RNE levels and mask the negative effect of the reduced mobility. We tested this explicitly and found that over-expression of WT RNE does not significantly change <italic>k</italic><sub>d1</sub> or <italic>k</italic><sub>d2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S7B</xref>). Thus, when the CTD is present, neither copy number nor diffusion of membrane-bound RNE limits <italic>k</italic><sub>d2</sub>.</p>
<p>In the absence of the CTD, <italic>k</italic><sub>d1</sub> was high in RNE variant F582E (MB% = 67%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S6A</xref>), reaching levels close to its cytoplasmic counterpart, the ΔMTS ΔCTD mutant (gray line, <italic>p</italic> = 0.7; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). <italic>k</italic><sub>d2</sub> values for ΔCTD variants were, in general, lower than those of their CTD-containing counterparts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), indicating the importance of the CTD for the catalytic activity. These findings are consistent with previous reports on RNE constructs based on the MTS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Among ΔCTD variants with different membrane motifs, point mutants F575E and F582E (MB% = 91% and 67%, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S6A</xref>) exhibited higher <italic>k</italic><sub>d2</sub> than the MTS-based variant, in agreement with the fact that completely cytoplasmic ΔMTS ΔCTD exhibited higher <italic>k</italic><sub>d2</sub> than the MTS-containing ΔCTD (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). However, the LacY2-based RNE variant, which diffuses faster than the MTS version (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>), did not show a corresponding increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>d2</sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Plus, LacY6 and LacY12 versions showed even lower <italic>k</italic><sub>d2</sub> than MTS-based RNE ΔCTD. Overall, these results indicate that the reduced <italic>k</italic><sub>d2</sub> caused by ΔCTD cannot be rescued by faster diffusion of membrane-bound RNE. In fact, it may be further impaired by large and slow membrane motifs (such as LacY12). The presence of the CTD appears to buffer the effects of large membrane-binding motifs on RNE’s catalytic activity, helping to maintain efficient post-transcriptional mRNA degradation (<italic>k</italic><sub>d2</sub>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study establishes the membrane enrichment and slow diffusion of RNE in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This supports the notion that sequestration of RNE on the membrane confers the spatial and temporal separation between synthesis and decay of mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the processing of rRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> and tRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> and small RNA-based gene regulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> mediated by RNE likely take place on the membrane.</p>
<p>For WT RNE, our analysis showed MB% of 93%, close to 91% previously reported using immunogold labeling and freeze-fracture electron microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Whether the MB% of RNE changes under different growth conditions remains to be tested. As a case study, we examined the MB% of WT RNE when cells were grown in M9 minimal medium with succinate as the sole carbon source without supplements, a condition different from that used in our primary experiments (M9 glycerol with supplements). The MTS segment exhibited a reduction in MB% from 100% to 83% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S6C</xref>), suggesting that MTS-mediated membrane binding can be sensitive to growth conditions. However, the MB% of WT RNE was only marginally affected by the same media change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S6C</xref>). We speculate that tetramer formation stabilizes RNE membrane localization, even when individual MTS motifs exhibit a weak membrane affinity. A similar phenomenon has been observed with MinD; although its amphipathic motif alone is cytoplasmic, MinD becomes membrane-associated upon dimerization, indicating that oligomerization enhances the membrane binding of this peripheral membrane protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. By analogy, the tetrameric structure of RNE may reinforce membrane association, buffering against changes in cellular metabolism or lipid environment that would otherwise weaken MTS-mediated binding.</p>
<p>While individual TM motifs exhibited strong membrane association regardless of growth conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S6D</xref>), we found LacY2-based RNE can lose membrane binding affinity, unlike MTS-based RNE. The loss of MB% in LacY2-based RNE was observed only in the presence of the CTD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S6D</xref>), suggesting that the CTD negatively affects membrane binding of RNE, possibly by altering protein conformation. In fact, all ΔCTD RNE mutants we tested exhibited higher MB% than their CTD-containing counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S6A-B</xref>). For example, WT RNE (containing CTD) showed an MB% of 93%, whereas its ΔCTD version, RNE (1-592), showed 100%. Similarly, the chimeric RNE-LacY6-CTD showed an MB% of 86%, while its ΔCTD version showed 100% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S6A-B</xref>). A similar trend was observed for MTS point mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S6A-B</xref>), further supporting that the CTD decreases membrane association across RNE variants. We speculate that this effect may be related to the CTD’s role in promoting phase-separated ribonucleoprotein condensates, as observed in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, we also observed a modest increase in the clustering tendency of RNE compared to ΔCTD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S8</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>D</italic><sub>RNE</sub> we measured in <italic>E. coli</italic> (0.018 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) is comparable to those measured in other bacterial species. For example, in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, the <italic>D</italic> of its cytoplasmic RNE was shown to be about 0.03 μm<sup>2</sup>/s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. The diffusion of RNase Y in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was found in either a slow (0.031 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) or fast (0.3 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, with the slow population corresponding to RNase Y bound to mRNA and/or the putative RNA degradosome and the fast population representing freely diffusing RNase Y. In the case of <italic>E. coli</italic> RNE, a two-population fit of the <italic>D</italic> histogram based on MB% identified the slow and fast subpopulations whose <italic>D</italic> values differed by a factor of 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S3C</xref>). This agrees with our finding that cytoplasmic RNE ΔMTS diffuses ∼5 times as fast as WT RNE on average (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Diffusion is affected by the size of the particle in a given medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, and it has been used to identify different size forms of a protein due to biochemical interactions or complex formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Related, RNA substrates interacting with RNE can also increase the effective mass of RNE and lower its <italic>D</italic> value. However, when cellular mRNAs were depleted by rifampicin treatment, RNE diffusion increased less than that of other RNA-binding proteins related to transcription and translation. For example, the large and small ribosomal subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, tRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, and RNA polymerase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> showed a large (about 10-20 fold) increase in <italic>D</italic> upon rifampicin treatment. Interestingly, Hfq, an RNA chaperon involved in small RNA regulation together with RNE, showed a moderate increase (∼2 fold) in <italic>D</italic> when RNA was depleted by rifampicin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. We note that our result is consistent with previous studies that examined the effect of rifampicin on RNE diffusion in <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> as well as RNE in <italic>C. crescentus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> and RNase Y in <italic>B. subtilis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. One possible explanation is that RNA-bound RNE (and RNase Y) is short-lived compared to our frame interval (∼20 ms), unlike other RNA-binding proteins related to transcription and translation, interacting with RNA for ∼1 min for elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Lastly, the slow diffusion of the MTS in comparison to LacY2 and LacY6 suggests that MTS is less favorable for rapid lateral motion in the membrane. Our MD simulations demonstrated that this reduced diffusivity may originate from a stronger interaction energy between the protein and the membrane. Whether this property is specific to the MTS or generalizable to other peripheral versus integral membrane motifs remains to be tested. We speculate that this can be a general phenomenon, as peripheral motifs interact with lipids orthogonally while integral membrane motifs align parallel to the bilayer and may diffuse more freely by coupling with the motion of surrounding lipids. The diffusion behavior of membrane-bound proteins reflects underlying protein-lipid interactions and membrane dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Accordingly, future work may analyze how protein-lipid interaction strength and membrane dynamics contribute to differences in lateral diffusion between peripheral and integral membrane proteins.</p>
<p>Altogether, our work highlights strategies to modulate the MB% and diffusion of RNE to possibly affect mRNA degradation rates. For example, membrane-bound RNE lacking the CTD can stabilize mRNAs and increase protein expression. This idea has been used in a commercial <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 strain (Invitrogen’s One Shot BL21 Star) to increase recombinant protein yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Additionally, RNE variants with environmentally responsive MB%, such as RNE-LacY2-CTD, could be harnessed to tune mRNA half-lives and protein expression levels under different growth conditions.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study uses single-molecule imaging to characterize factors controlling the localization, mobility, and function of RNase E in E. coli, a key bacterial ribonuclease central to mRNA catabolism. The supporting evidence for the differential roles of RNAse E's membrane targeting sequence (MTS) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) to RNAse E's diffusion and membrane association is <bold>convincing</bold>. It provides insight into how RNAse E shapes the spatiotemporal organization of RNA processing in bacterial cells. This interdisciplinary work will be of interest to cell biologists, microbiologists, biochemists, and biophysicists.</p>

<p>This paper by Troyer et al. measures the positioning and diffusivity of RNaseE-mEos3.2 proteins in E. coli as a function of rifampicin treatment, compares RNaseE to other E. coli proteins, and measures the effect of changes in domain composition on this localization and motion. The straightforward study is thoroughly presented, including very good descriptions of the imaging parameters and the image analysis/modeling involved, which is good because the key impact of the work lies in presenting this clear methodology for determining the position and mobility of a series of proteins in living bacteria cells.</p>
<p>Most of my concerns in the original review were addressed in this round of revisions based on new text, experiments, and analysis, including most notably:</p>
<p>-A revision of the abstract to focus on the actual topic of the manuscript.</p>
<p>
-New experiments (Fig. S1) to confirm that there is no significant undercounting of the fast-moving cytoplasmic population</p>
<p>
-Removing the experiments discussion related to degradosome proteins rather than overstating results.</p>
<p>
-Improving the logical flow and writing.</p>
<p>One minor concern still remains:</p>
<p>-Though the discussion of the rifampicin-treated cells is improved, this experiment is motivated (line 196) as &quot;To test the effect of mRNA substrates on RNE diffusion&quot;, but the conclusion of the paragraph (based on similarities with the effect on LacY) is that the observed changes are due to factors other than the concentration of mRNA substrates, such that the effect of mRNA has not been tested.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Troyer and colleagues have studied the in vivo localisation and mobility of the E.coli RNaseE (a protein key for mRNA degradation in all bacteria) as well as the impact of two key protein segments (MTS and CTD) on RNase E cellular localisation and mobility. Such sequences are important to study since there is significant sequence diversity within bacteria, as well as lack of clarity about their functional effects. Using single-molecule tracking in living bacteria, the authors confirmed that &gt;90% of RNaseE localised on the membrane, and measured its diffusion coefficient. Via a series of mutants, they also showed that MTS leads to stronger membrane association and slower diffusion compared to a transmembrane motif (despite the latter being more embedded in the membrane), and that the CTD weakens membrane binding. The study also rationalised how the interplay of MTS and CTD modulate mRNA metabolism (and hence gene expression) in different cellular contexts.</p>
<p>The authors have also done an excellent job addressing reviewer's concerns and improving the manuscript during revision.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Troyer et al quantitatively measured the membrane localization and diffusion of RNase E, an essential ribonuclease for mRNA turnover as well as tRNA and rRNA processing in bacteria cells. Using single-molecule tracking in live E. coli cells, the authors investigated the impact of membrane targeting sequence (MTS) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) on the membrane localization and diffusion of RNase E under various perturbations. Finally, the authors tried to correlate the membrane localization of RNase E to its function on co- and post-transcriptional mRNA decay using lacZ mRNA as a model.</p>
<p>The major findings of the manuscripts include:</p>
<p>(1) WT RNase E is mostly membrane localized via MTS, confirming previous results. The diffusion of RNase E is increased upon removal of MTS or CTD, and more significantly increased upon removal of both regions.</p>
<p>(2) By tagging RNase E MTS and different lengths of LacY transmembrane domain (LacY2, LacY6 or LacY12) to mEos3.2, the results demonstrate that short LacY transmembrane sequence (LacY2 and LacY6) can increase the diffusion of mEos3.2 on the membrane compared to MTS, further supported by the molecular dynamics simulation. The similar trend was roughly observed in RNase E mutants with MTS switched to LacY transmembrane domains.</p>
<p>(3) The removal of RNase E MTS significantly increases the co-transcriptional degradation of lacZ mRNA, but has minimal effect on the post-transcriptional degradation of lacZ mRNA. Removal of CTD of RNase E overall decrease the mRNA decay rates, suggesting the synergistic effect of CTD on RNase E activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript is clearly written with very detailed methods description and analysis parameters.</p>
<p>(2) The conclusions are mostly supported by the data and analysis.</p>
<p>(3) Some of the main conclusions are interesting and important for understanding the cellular behavior and function of RNase E.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my previous concerns in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I have one additional comment. When interpreting the small increase in the diffusion coefficient of RNase E when treating the cell with rifampicin, the authors rule out the possibility that only a small fraction of RNase E interacts with mRNA and suggest that it is more likely the mRNA-RNase E interaction is transient. However, I am wondering about an alternative possibility that RNase E prefers mRNAs with low ribosome density or even untranslated mRNAs?</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This paper measures the positioning and diffusivity of RNaseE-mEos3.2 proteins in E. coli as a function of rifampicin treatment, compares RNaseE to other E. coli proteins, and measures the effect of changes in domain composition on this localization and motion. The straightforward study is thoroughly presented, including very good descriptions of the imaging parameters and the image analysis/modeling involved, which is good because the key impact of the work lies in presenting this clear methodology for determining the position and mobility of a series of proteins in living bacteria cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the nice summary and positive feedback on the descriptions and methodology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>My key notes and concerns are listed below; the most important concerns are indicated with asterisks.</p>
<p>(1) The very start of the abstract mentions that the domain composition of RNase E varies among species, which leads the reader to believe that the modifications made to E. coli RNase E would be to swap in the domains from other species, but the experiment is actually to swap in domains from other E. coli proteins. The impact of this work would be increased by examining, for instance, RNase E domains from B. subtilis and C. crescentus as mentioned in the introduction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestions. We agree that the sentence may convey an unintended expectation. Our original intention was to note the presence and absence of certain domains of RNase E (e.g. membrane-binding motif and CTD) vary across species, rather than the actual sequence variations. To avoid any misinterpretation, we decided to remove the sentence from the abstract. Using the domains of B. subtilis and C. crescentus RNase E in E. coli is a very interesting suggestion, but we will leave that for a future study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Furthermore, the introduction ends by suggesting that this work will modulate the localization, diffusion, and activity of RNase E for &quot;various applications&quot;, but no applications are discussed in the discussion or conclusion. The impact of this work would be increased by actually indicating potential reasons why one would want to modulate the activity of RNase E.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. For example, an E. coli strain expressing membranebound RNase E without CTD can help stabilize mRNAs and enhance protein expression. In fact, this idea was used in a commercial BL21 cell line (Invitrogen’s One Shot BL21 Star), to increase the yield of protein expression. We also think that environmentally modulated MB% of RNase E can be useful for controlling the mRNA half-lives and protein expression levels in different conditions. We discussed these ideas at the end of the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Lines 114 - 115: &quot;The xNorm histogram of RNase E shows two peaks corresponding to each side edge of the membrane&quot;: &quot;side edge&quot; is not a helpful term. I suggest instead: &quot;...corresponding to the membrane at each side of the cell&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. We made the suggested change.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) A key concern of this reviewer is that, since membrane-bound proteins diffuse more slowly than cytoplasmic proteins, some significant undercounting of the % of cytoplasmic proteins is expected due to decreased detectability of the faster-moving proteins. This would not be a problem for the LacZ imaging where essentially all proteins are cytoplasmic, but would significantly affect the reported MB% for the intermediate protein constructs. How is this undercounting considered and taken into account? One could, for instance, compare LacZ vs. LacY (or RNase E) copy numbers detected in fixed cells to those detected in living cells to estimate it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point and suggesting a possible way to address this. We compared the number of tracks for mEos3.2-fused proteins in live vs fixed cells and tested the undercounting effect of cytoplasmic molecules. We compared WT RNase E molecules in live and fixed cells and found that there are about 50% lower molecules detected in the fixed cells, which agrees with the expectation that fluorescent proteins lose their signal upon fixation. Similarly, cytoplasmic RNase E (RNase E ΔMTS) copy number was also ~50% less in the fixed cells compared to live cells. If cytoplasmic molecules were undercounted compared membrane-bound molecules in live cells, fixation would reduce the copy number less than 50%. The comparable ratio of 50% indicates that the undercounting issue is not significant. This control analysis is provided in Figure S1B-C, and we made corresponding textual change in the result section as below:</p>
<p>For this analysis, we first confirmed that proteins localized on the membrane and in the cytoplasm are detected with equal probability, despite differences in their mobilities (Fig. S1B-C).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The rifampicin treatment study is not presented well. Firstly, it is found that LacY diffuses more rapidly upon rifampicin treatment. This change is attributed to changes in crowding at the membrane due to mRNA. Several other things change in cells after adding rif, including ATP levels, and these factors should be considered. More importantly, since the change in the diffusivity of RNaseE is similar to the change in diffusivity of LacY, then it seems that most of the change in RNaseE diffusion is NOT due to RNaseE-mRNAribosome binding, but rather due to whatever crowding/viscosity effects are experienced by LacY (along these lines: the error reported for D is SEM, but really should be a confidence interval, as in Figure 1, to give the reader a better sense of how different (or similar) 1.47 and 1.25 are).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that upon rifampicin treatment, RNase E’s D increases to a similar extent as that of LacY. Hence, the increase likely arises from a factor common to both proteins. We have added the reviewer’s suggested interpretation as a possible explanation in the manuscript as below.</p>
<p>The similar fold change in D<sub>RNE</sub> and D<sub>LacY</sub> upon rif treatment suggests that the change in RNE diffusion may largely be attributed to physical changes in the intracellular environment (such as reduced viscosity or macromolecular crowding[41,42]), rather than a loss of RNA-RNE interactions.</p>
<p>As requested by the reviewer, we have provided confidence intervals for our D values in Table S8. Because these intervals are very narrow, we chose to present the SEM as the error metric for D and have also reported the corresponding errors for the fold-change values whenever we describe the fold differences between D values.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Lines 185-189: it is surprising to me that the CTD mutants both have the same change in D (5.5x and 5.3x) relative to their full-length counterparts since D for the membranebound WT protein should be much less sensitive to protein size than D for the cytoplasmic MTS mutant. Can the authors comment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps the reviewer understood that these differences are the ratios between +/-CTD (e.g. WT RNE vs ΔCTD). However, the differences we mentioned were from membrane-bound vs cytoplasmic versions of RNase E with comparable sizes (e.g. WT RNase E vs RNase E ΔMTS). We modified text and added a summary sentence at the end of the paragraph to clarify the point.</p>
<p>We found that D<sub>ΔMTS</sub> is ~5.5 times that of D<sub>RNE</sub> (Fig. 3B). [...] Together, these results suggest that the membrane binding reduces RNE mobility by a factor of 5.</p>
<p>That being said, we also realized a similar fold difference between +/-CTD. Specifically, WT RNE vs RNE ΔCTD (both membrane-bound) show a ~4.1-fold difference and RNE ΔMTS vs RNE ΔMTS ΔCTD (both cytoplasmic) show ~3.9-fold difference. We do not currently do not have a clear explanation for this pattern. Given that these two pairs have a similar change in mass, we speculate that the relationship between D and molecular mass may be comparable for membrane-bound and free-floating RNE variants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Lines 190-194. Again, the confidence intervals and experimental uncertainties should be considered before drawing biological conclusions. It would seem that there is &quot;no significant change&quot; in the rhlB and pnp mutants, and I would avoid saying &quot;especially for ∆pnp&quot; when the same conclusion is true for both (one shouldn't say 1.04 is &quot;very minute&quot; and 1.08 is just kind of small - they are pretty much the same within experiments like this).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point, which we fully agree with. That being said, we decided to remove results related to the degradosome proteins to improve the flow of the paper. We are preparing another paper related to the RNA degradosome complex formation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Lines 221-223 &quot; This is remarkable because their molecular masses (and thus size) are expected to be larger than that of MTS&quot; should be reconsidered: diffusion in a membrane does not follow the Einstein law (indeed lines 223-225 agree with me and disagree with lines 221-223). (Also the discussion paragraph starting at line 375). Rather, it is generally limited by the interactions with the transmembrane segments with the membrane. So Figure 3D does not contain the right data for a comparison, and what is surprising to me is that MTS doesn't diffuse considerably faster than LacY2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s point that diffusion in a membrane does not follow the Stokes-Einstein law. That is why we introduced Saffman’s model. However, even in this model, proteins of larger size (or mass) should be slower than smaller size (a reason why we presented Figure 3D, now 4D). In other words, both Einstein and Saffman models predict that larger particles diffuse slower, although the exact scaling relationship differs between two models. Here, we assume that mass is related to the size. Contrary to Saffman’s model for membrane proteins, LacY2 diffuses faster than MTS despite of large size. Using MD simulations, we showed that this discrepancy can be explained by different interaction energies as the reviewer mentioned. This analysis further demonstrates that the size is not the only factor to consider protein diffusion in the membrane. We edited the paragraph to clarify the expectations and our interpretations.</p>
<p>According to the Stokes-Einstein relation for diffusion in simple fluids[49] and the Saffman-Delbruck diffusion model for membrane proteins, D decreases as particle size increases, albeit with different scaling behaviors. […] Thus, if size (or mass) were the primary determinant of diffusion, LacY2 and LacY6 would diffuse more slowly than the smaller MTS. The observed discrepancy instead implies that D may be governed by how each motif interacts with the membrane. For example, the way that TM domains are anchored to the membrane may facilitate faster lateral diffusion with surrounding lipids.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) The logical connection between the membrane-association discussion (which seems to ignore associations with other proteins in the cell) and the preceding +/- rifampicin discussion (which seeks to attribute very small changes to mRNA association) is confusing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point. We re-arranged the second result section to present diffusion due to membrane binding first before rifampicin. Furthermore, we stated our hypothesis and expectations in the beginning of the results section. This addition will legitimate our logic flow.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Separately, the manuscript should be read through again for grammar and usage. For instance, the title should be: &quot;Single-molecule imaging reveals the *roles* of *the* membrane-binding motif and *the* C-terminal domain of RNase E in its localization and diffusion in Escherichia coli&quot;. Also, some writing is unwieldy, for instance, &quot;RNase E's D&quot; would be easier to read if written as D_{RNaseE}. (underscore = subscript), and there is a lot of repetition in the sentence structures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for catching grammar mistakes. We went through extensive proofreading to avoid these mistakes and also used simple notation suggested by the reviewer, such as D<sub>RNE</sub>, to make it easier to read. Thank you again for your suggestions.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Troyer and colleagues have studied the in vivo localisation and mobility of the E.coli RNaseE (a protein key for mRNA degradation in all bacteria) as well as the impact of two key protein segments (MTS and CTD) on RNase E cellular localisation and mobility. Such sequences are important to study since there is significant sequence diversity within bacteria, as well as a lack of clarity about their functional effects. Using single-molecule tracking in living bacteria, the authors confirmed that &gt;90% of RNaseE localised on the membrane, and measured its diffusion coefficient. Via a series of mutants, they also showed that MTS leads to stronger membrane association and slower diffusion compared to a transmembrane motif (despite the latter being more embedded in the membrane), and that the CTD weakens membrane binding. The study also rationalised how the interplay of MTS and CTD modulate mRNA metabolism (and hence gene expression) in different cellular contexts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study uses powerful single-molecule tracking in living cells along with solid quantitative analysis, and provides direct measurements for the mobility and localisation of E.coli RNaseE, adding to information from complementary studies and other bacteria. The exploration of different membrane-binding motifs (both MTS and CTD) has novelty and provides insight on how sequence and membrane interactions can control function of protein-associated membranes and complexes. The methods and membrane-protein standards used contribute to the toolbox for molecular analysis in live bacteria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the nice summary of our work and positive comments about the paper’s strengths.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The Results sections can be structured better to present the main hypotheses to be tested. For example, since it is well known that RNase E is membrane-localised (via its MTS), one expects its mobility to be mainly controlled by the interaction with the membrane (rather than with other molecules, such as polysomes and the degradosome). The results indeed support this expectation - however, the manuscript in its current form does not lay down the dominant hypothesis early on (see second Results chapter), and instead considers the rifampicin-addition results as &quot;surprising&quot;; it will be best to outline the most likely hypotheses, and then discuss the results in that light.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. We addressed this point by stating our main hypothesis from the beginning of the results section. We also agree with the reviewer that the membrane binding effect should be discussed first; hence, we re-arranged the result section. In the revised manuscript, we discuss the effect of membrane binding on diffusion first, followed by rif effects.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly, the authors should first discuss the different modes of interaction for a peripheral anchor vs a transmembrane anchor, outline the state of knowledge and possibilities, and then discuss their result; in its current version, the ms considers the LacY2 and LacY6 faster diffusion compared to MTS &quot;remarkable&quot;, but considering the very different mode of interaction, there is no clear expectation prior to the experiment. In the same section, it would be good to see how the MD simulations capture the motion of LacY6 and LacY12, since this will provide a set of results consistent with the experimental set.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. In fact, there is little discussion in the literature about the different modes of interaction for a peripheral anchor vs a transmembrane anchor. To our knowledge, our work (experiments and MD simulations) is the first that directly compared the two to reveal that the peripheral anchor has higher interaction energy than the transmembrane anchor. We added a sentence “Despite the prevalence of peripheral membrane proteins, how they interact with the membrane and how this differs from TM proteins remain poorly understood”. Furthermore, we added the MD simulation result of LacY6 and LacY12 in Figure 4E-F.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The work will benefit from further exploration of the membrane-RNase E interactions; e.g., the effect of membrane composition is explored by just using two different growth media (which on its own is not a well-controlled setting), and no attempts to change the MTS itself were made. The manuscript will benefit from considering experiments that explore the diversity of RNaseE interactions in different species; for example, the authors may want to consider the possibility of using the membrane-localisation signals of functional homologs of RNaseE in different bacteria (e.g., B. subtilis). It would be good to look at the effect of CTD deletions in a similar context (i.e., in addition to the MTS substitution by LacY2 and LacY6).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for this suggestion. During revision, we engineered point mutations in MTS and analyzed critical hydrophobic residues for membrane binding. We characterized MB% in both +/-CTD variants (Fig. 2 and Fig. S6) and their effect on lacZ mRNA degradation (Fig. 6). We will leave the use of membrane motif of B. subtilis RNase E for future study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The manuscript will benefit from further discussion of the unstructured nature of the CTD, especially since the RNase CTD is well known to form condensates in Caulobacter crescentus; it is unclear how the authors excluded any roles for RNaseE phase separation in the mobility of RNaseE in E.coli cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we agree with the reviewer that the intrinsically disordered nature of the CTD might contribute to condensate formation. We explored this possibility using both epifluorescence microscopy (with a YFP fusion) and single-molecule imaging with cluster analysis (using an mEos3.2 fusion). Please see Figure S8. We did observe some weak de-clustering of RNase E upon CTD deletion. In the current study, we are unable to quantify the extent to which clustering contributes to the slow diffusion of RNase E. However, we speculate that the clustering may be linked to the low MB% of certain RNE mutants containing CTD, and we discussed this possibility in the Discussion.</p>
<p>[…] further supporting that the CTD decreases membrane association across RNE variants. We speculate that this effect may be related to the CTD’s role in promoting phase-separated ribonucleoprotein condensates, as observed in Caulobacter crescentus[19]. In E. coli, we also observed a modest increase in the clustering tendency of RNE compared to ΔCTD (Fig. S8).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Some statements in the Discussion require support with example calculations or toning down substantially. Specifically, it is not clear how the authors conclude that RNaseE interacts with its substrate for a short time (and what this time may actually be); further, the speculation about the MTS &quot;not being an efficient membrane-binding motif for diffusion&quot; lacks adequate support as it stands.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these points. To elaborate our point on transient interaction between RNase E and RNA, we added a sentence “Specifically, if RNE interacts with mRNAs for ~20 ms or less, the slow-diffusing state would last shorter than the frame interval and remain undetected in our experiment.” Also, we added this sentence in the discussion.</p>
<p>One possible explanation is that RNA-bound RNE (and RNase Y) is short-lived compared to our frame interval (~20 ms), unlike other RNA-binding proteins related to transcription and translation, interacting with RNA for ~1 min for elongation [48].</p>
<p>Plus, we clarified the wording used in the second sentence that the reviewer pointed out as follows,</p>
<p>Lastly, the slow diffusion of the MTS in comparison to LacY2 and LacY6 suggests that MTS is less favorable for rapid lateral motion in the membrane.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Troyer et al quantitatively measured the membrane localization and diffusion of RNase E, an essential ribonuclease for mRNA turnover as well as tRNA and rRNA processing in bacteria cells. Using single-molecule tracking in live E. coli cells, the authors investigated the impact of membrane targeting sequence (MTS) and the Cterminal domain (CTD) on the membrane localization and diffusion of RNase E under various perturbations. Finally, the authors tried to correlate the membrane localization of RNase E to its function on co- and post-transcriptional mRNA decay using lacZ mRNA as a model.</p>
<p>The major findings of the manuscripts include:</p>
<p>(1) WT RNase E is mostly membrane localized via MTS, confirming previous results. The diffusion of RNase E is increased upon removal of MTS or CTD, and more significantly increased upon removal of both regions.</p>
<p>(2) By tagging RNase E MTS and different lengths of LacY transmembrane domain (LacY2, LacY6, or LacY12) to mEos3.2, the results demonstrate that short LacY transmembrane sequence (LacY2 and LacY6) can increase the diffusion of mEos3.2 on the membrane compared to MTS, further supported by the molecular dynamics simulation. A similar trend was roughly observed in RNase E mutants with MTS switched to LacY transmembrane domains.</p>
<p>(3) The removal of RNase E MTS significantly increases the co-transcriptional degradation of lacZ mRNA, but has minimal effect on the post-transcriptional degradation of lacZ mRNA. Removal of CTD of RNase E overall decreases the mRNA decay rates, suggesting the synergistic effect of CTD on RNase E activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript is clearly written with very detailed method descriptions and analysis parameters.</p>
<p>(2) The conclusions are mostly supported by the data and analysis.</p>
<p>(3) Some of the main conclusions are interesting and important for understanding the cellular behavior and function of RNase E.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thorough summary of our work and positive comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Some of the observations show inconsistent or context-dependent trends that make it hard to generalize certain conclusions. Those points are worth discussion at least. Examples include:</p>
<p>(a) The authors conclude that MTS segment exhibits reduced MB% when succinate is used as a carbon source compared to glycerol, whereas LacY2 segment maintains 100% membrane localization, suggesting that MTS can lose membrane affinity in the former growth condition (Ln 341-342). However, the opposite case was observed for the WT RNase E and RNase E-LacY2-CTD, in which RNase E-LacY2-CTD showed reduced MB% in the succinate-containing M9 media compared to the WT RNase E (Ln 264-267). This opposite trend was not discussed. In the absence of CTD, would the media-dependent membrane localization be similar to the membrane localization sequence or to the fulllength RNase E?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a great point. Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy in data. We think the weak membrane interaction of RNaseE-lacY2-CTD likely stems from the structure instability in the presence of the CTD. Our data shows that an RNase E variant with a cytoplasmic population under a normal growth condition exhibits a greater cytoplasmic fraction in a poor growth media. In contrast, RNaseE-MTS and RNaseE-LacY2 lacking the CTD both showed 100% MB% under both normal and poor growth conditions. These results are presented in Figure S6 and further discussed in the Discussion section.</p>
<p>The loss of MB% in LacY2-based RNE was observed only in the presence of the CTD (Fig. S6D), suggesting that the CTD negatively affects membrane binding of RNE, possibly by altering protein conformation. In fact, all ΔCTD RNE mutants we tested exhibited higher MB% than their CTD-containing counterparts (Fig. S6A-B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) When using mEos3.2 reporter only, LacY2 and LacY6 both increase the diffusion of mEos3.2 compared to MTS. However, when inserting the LacY transmembrane sequence into RNase E or RNase E without CTD, only the LacY2 increases the diffusion of RNase E. This should also be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point. As the reviewer pointed out, as the membrane motifs, both LacY2 and LacY6 diffuse faster than the MTS, but when they are fused to RNE, only LacY2-based RNE diffuses faster than MTS-based RNE. We speculate that it is possibly due to a structural reason—having four (large) LacY6 in a tetrameric arrangement may cancel out the original fast-diffusing property of LacY6. We added this idea in the result section:</p>
<p>This result may be due to the high TM load (24 helices) created by four LacY6 anchors in the RNE tetramer. Although all constructs are tetrameric, the 24-helix load (LacY6), compared with 8 (LacY2) and 4 (MTS), likely enlarges the membrane-embedded footprint and increases drag, thereby changing the mobility advantages assessed as standalone membrane anchors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors interpret that in some cases the increase in the diffusion coefficient is related to the increase in the cytoplasm localization portion, such as for the LacY2 inserted RNase E with CTD, which is rational. However, the authors can directly measure the diffusion coefficient of the membrane and cytoplasm portion of RNase E by classifying the trajectories based on their localizations first, rather than just the ensemble calculation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. Currently, because of the 2D projection effect from imaging, we cannot clearly distinguish which individual tracks are from the cytoplasm or from the inner membrane based on the localization. Therefore, we are unable to assign individual tracks as membrane-bound or cytoplasmic. However, we can demonstrate that the xNorm data can be separated into two different spatial populations based on the diffusion coefficient. D. That is we can plot xNorm of slow tracks vs xNorm of fast tracks. This analysis showed that the slow tracks have LacY-like xNorm profiles while the fast tracks have LacZ-like xNorm profiles, also quantitatively supporting our MB% fitting results. We have added this analysis to Figure S2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The error bars of the diffusion coefficient and MB% are all SEM from bootstrapping, which are very small. I am wondering how much of the difference is simply due to a batch effect. Were the data mixed from multiple biological replicates? The number of biological replicates should also be reported.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point. In the original manuscript, we reported the number of tracks analyzed and noted that all data was from at least three separate biological replicates (measurements were repeated at least three different days). Furthermore, in the revised manuscript, we have provided the number of cells imaged in Table S6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Some figures lack p-values, such as Figures 4 and 5C-D. Also, adding p-values directly to the bar graphs will make it easier to read.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for checking these details. We added p values in the graphs showing k<sub>d1</sub> and k<sub>d2</sub> (Table S7).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Minor and technical points:</p>
<p>(1) Clarity and flow will be improved if each section first highlights the objective for the experiments that are described (e.g., line 240).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. We addressed this point by editing the beginning of each subsection in the Results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 272 (and elsewhere).&quot;1.33-times faster is wrong&quot;. The authors mean 33% faster (from 0.075 to 1, see Figure 4G), and not 133% faster. Needs fixing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out. We changed this as well as other incidences where we talk about the fold difference. For example, this particular incidence was changed to:</p>
<p>Indeed, in the absence of the CTD, we found that the D of LacY2-based RNE was 1.33 ± 0.01 times as fast as the MTS-based RNE.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors need to consider the fitting of two species on their D population. e.g., how will a 93% - 7% split between diffusive species would have looked for the distribution in S4B? Note also the L1 profile in Fig S4C - while it is not hugely different from Figure S4B, the analysis gives a 41% amplitude for the fast-diffusing species. The 2-species analysis can also be used on some of the samples with much higher cytoplasmic components. Further, tracks that are in the more central region can be analysed to see whether the fast-diffusing species increase in amplitude.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. The D histograms of L1 and RNase E show a dominant peak at around 0.015, but L1 has a residual population in the shoulder (note the difference between L1’s experimental data and D1 fit, a yellow line in now Figure S3B). This residual shoulder population is absent in the D histogram of RNase E. We also performed two-species analysis as suggested by the reviewer and provided the result in Figure S3C. The analysis shows that the two-population fit (black line) is very close to one one-population fit (yellow line). While we agree with the reviewer that subpopulation analysis is helpful for other proteins that show &lt;90% MB% (&gt;10% significant cytoplasmic population). we found it useful to divide xNorm histogram into two populations based on the diffusivity (rather than doing two-population fit to the D histogram, which does not have spatial information). This analysis, shown in Figure S2, supports our MB% fit results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors suggest that the sequestration of RNaseE to the membrane limits its interaction with cytoplasmic mRNAs, and may increase mRNA lifetime. While this is true and supported by the authors' preprint (Ref15), it will also be good to consider (and discuss) that highly-transcribed regions are in the nucleoid periphery (and thus close to the membrane) and that ribosomes/polysomes are likewise predominantly peripheral (coregulation of transcription/translation) and membrane proximal.</p>

<p>This is an interesting point, which we appreciate very much. The lacZ gene, when induced, is shown to move to the nucleoid periphery (Yang et al. 2019, Nat Comm). Also, in our preprint (Ref 15), we engineered to have lacZ closer to the membrane, by translationally fusing it to lacY. However, the degradation rate of lacZ mRNA was not enhanced by the proximity to the membrane (for both k<sub>d1</sub> and k<sub>d2</sub>). For lacZ mRNA, we mainly see the change in k<sub>d1</sub> when RNE localization changes. We think it is due to the slow diffusion of the nascent mRNA (attached to the chromosome) and the slow diffusion of membrane-bound RNE, such that regardless of the location of the nascent mRNA, the degradation by the membrane-bound RNE is inefficient. Only when RNE is free diffusing in the cytoplasm, it seems to increase k<sub>d1</sub> (the decay of nascent mRNAs).</p>

<p>(1) It will increase the clarity of the manuscript if the authors can provide better nomenclatures for different constructs, such as for different membrane targeting sequences fused to mEos3.2, full-length RNase E, or CDT truncated RNaseE.</p>

<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We agree that many constructions were discussed, and their naming can be confusing. To help with clarity, we have abbreviated RNase E as RNE throughout the text where appropriate.</p>
