<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Niemann–Pick disease type C (NPC) is a devastating lysosomal storage disease characterized by abnormal cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes. Currently, there is no treatment for NPC. Transcription factor EB (TFEB), a member of the microphthalmia transcription factors (MiTF), has emerged as a master regulator of lysosomal function and promoted the clearance of substrates stored in cells. However, it is not known whether TFEB plays a role in cholesterol clearance in NPC disease. Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of TFEB, but not TFE3 (another member of MiTF family) facilitates cholesterol clearance in various NPC1 cell models. Pharmacological activation of TFEB by sulforaphane (SFN), a previously identified natural small-molecule TFEB agonist by us, can dramatically ameliorate cholesterol accumulation in human and mouse NPC1 cell models. In NPC1 cells, SFN induces TFEB nuclear translocation via a ROS-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calcineurin dependent but MTOR-independent pathway and upregulates the expression of TFEB-downstream genes, promoting lysosomal exocytosis and biogenesis. While genetic inhibition of TFEB abolishes the cholesterol clearance and exocytosis effect by SFN. In the NPC1 mouse model, SFN dephosphorylates/activates TFEB in brain and exhibits potent efficacy of rescuing the loss of Purkinje cells and body weight. Hence, pharmacological upregulating lysosome machinery via targeting TFEB represents a promising approach to treat NPC and related lysosomal storage diseases, and provides the possibility of TFEB agonists ie SFN as potential NPC therapeutic candidates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lysosomes are essential organelles for the degradation and recycle of damaged complex substrates and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Xu and Ren 2015</xref>). In recent years, lysosomes have emerging roles in plasma membrane repair, external environmental sensing, autophagic cargo sensing, and proinflammatory response, thereby regulating fundamental processes such as cellular clearance and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tsunemi, Perez-Rosello et al. 2019</xref>). Mutations in genes encoding lysosomal proteins could result in more than approximately 70 different lysosomal storage disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fraldi, Klein et al. 2016</xref>). Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutation in either <italic>NPC1</italic> or <italic>NPC2</italic> gene. Deficiency in NPC1 or NPC2 protein results in late endosomal/lysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sarkar, Carroll et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Spampanato, Feeney et al. 2013</xref>). Clinical symptoms of NPC include hepatosplenomegaly, progressive neurodegeneration and central neurol system dysfunction ie. seizure, motor impairment, and decline of intellectual function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carstea, Morris et al. 1997</xref>). So far there is no FDA-approved specific therapy for NPC, although miglustat, approved to treat type I Gaucher disease, has been used for NPC treatment in countries including China, Canada and European Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pineda, Wraith et al. 2009</xref>, Pineda, Perez-Poyato et al. 2010, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wraith, Vecchio et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chien, Peng et al. 2013</xref>)</p>
<p>Transcription factor EB (TFEB), a member of the microphthalmia/TFE transcription factor (MiTF) family, is identified as a master regulator of lysosome and autophagy by controlling the “coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation” (CLEAR) network, covering genes associated to lysosomal exocytosis and biogenesis, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sardiello and Ballabio 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Martini-Stoica, Xu et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Napolitano and Ballabio 2016</xref>). In normal condition, TFEB is phosphorylated by mTOR kinase and kept in cytosol inactively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Martina and Rosa 2018</xref>, Napolitano, Esposito et al. 2018). Under stress conditions ie. starvation or oxidative stress, TFEB is dephosphorylated and actively translocates into nucleus, promoting the expression of genes associated with lysosome and autophagy (Medina, Diego et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhang, Cheng et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Puertollano, Ferguson et al. 2018</xref>). TFEB overexpression or activation results in increased number of lysosomes, autophagy flux and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Medina, Fraldi et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Settembre, Di Malta et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Giatromanolaki, Kalamida et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Xu, Du et al. 2020</xref>), which may trigger cellular clearance. In fact, it is reported that TFEB overexpression promotes cellular clearance and ameliorates the phenotypes in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sardiello, Palmieri et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tsunemi and La Spada 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Decressac and Björklund 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Polito, Li et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ballabio 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Napolitano and Ballabio 2016</xref>). Moreover, upregulation of TFEB has been reported to benefit lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), such as Pompe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Argüello, Balboa et al. 2021</xref>). However, it is not known whether upregulation of TFEB by genetic or pharmacological methods is sufficient to increase lysosomal function and alleviate NPC phenotypes <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>. If so, TFEB may be a putative target for NPC treatment and manipulating lysosomal function via small-molecule TFEB agonists may have broad therapeutic potential for NPC.</p>

<p>TFEB and TFE3 are identified as key transcription factors regulating lysosome and autophagy biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sardiello, Palmieri et al. 2009</xref>). To investigate the role of TFEB/TFE3 in cellular cholesterol levels in NPC1 cells, HeLa cells were treated with U18666A (2.5 μM, an inhibitor of the endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1), a drug that has been widely used to induce NPC phenotype in cell models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Poh, Shui et al. 2012</xref>) (Thereafter HeLa NPC1 cells represent U18666A-treated HeLa cells). Cellular cholesterol levels were measured by the well-known cholesterol-marker filipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lu, Liang et al. 2015</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B, in</xref> HeLa NPC1 cells overexpressing TFEB-mCherry or TFEB<sup>S211A</sup>-mCherry (S211 non-phosphorylatable mutant, a constitutively active TFEB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang, Gao et al. 2015</xref>), the cellular cholesterol levels (filipin) were significantly diminished compared to non-expressed or mCherry-only transfected NPC1 cells. In contrast, TFE3-GFP overexpression displayed no obvious reduction of cholesterol levels in HeLa NPC1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A, B</xref>). Hence, TFEB but not TFE3 contributes to cholesterol reduction in NPC1 cells.</p>

<p>Pharmacological activation of TFEB is an emerging strategy for LSD treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Levine and Kroemer 2008</xref>). We have previously identified a natural TFEB agonist-sulforaphane (SFN), which is also an activator of cellular antioxidant NFE2L2/Nrf2 pathway, dramatically mitigating oxidative stress commonly associated with metabolic and age-related diseases including NPC diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Corssac, Campos-Carraro et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Li, Shao et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Liu, Fu et al. 2021</xref>). Based on our previous data that SFN (10-15 μM, 3–24 h) potently activates TFEB in various cell lines, promoting lysosomal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Li, Shao et al. 2021</xref>), thus, in this study, we set SFN treatment dose to 15 μM and treatment time to 4-24 h according to individual experiment. We hypothesize that SFN may contribute to cholesterol clearance in NPC disease. To evaluate this hypothesis, we first examined the effect of SFN on cellular cholesterol levels in HeLa NPC1 cell model using filipin staining. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>, U18666A treatment significantly increased filipin signals in bright perinuclear granules, which were well co-localized with lysosomal marker LAMP1, but not with ER marker calnexin in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2A, B</xref>), suggesting that U18666A-isnduced cholesterol accumulation presents in the late endosome/lysosome compartment, but not in ER. Moreover, when HeLa NPC1 cells were further challenged with SFN (15 μM, 12-24 h), a dramatically reduction of cholesterol accumulation (filipin intensity) by more than 30% was observed in lysosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2C, D</xref>). These results confirmed that U18666A interferes with the egress of free cholesterol from endosomes/lysosomes as previously reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lange and Steck 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Davis, Shin et al. 2021</xref>) and SFN reduces lysosomal cholesterol in NPC1 cells.</p>
<p>In our previous study, we identified that SFN activates TFEB via a ROS-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calcineurin-mediated but MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase)-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Li, Shao et al. 2021</xref>). Thus, we further validated this mechanism of SFN in HeLa NPC1 cell model by performing immunofluorescence experiments. In HeLa NPC1 cells, SFN (15 μM, 24 h) induced robust TFEB translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F, G</xref>). SFN treatment (15 μM, 24 h) also resulted an increase in the mRNA levels of TFEB downstream genes, including genes required for autophagy (<italic>ULK1</italic>, <italic>SQSTM1</italic> and <italic>ATG5</italic>) and lysosome biogenesis-<italic>LAMP1</italic>, using quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Consistent with previous finding, BAPTA-AM (a membrane-permeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator), FK506 and cyclosporin A (CsA) (calcineurin inhibitors) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC, a ROS scavenger) can robustly block SFN-induced TFEB nuclear translocation in HeLa NPC1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3</xref>), suggesting that in NPC1 cells SFN induces TFEB nuclear translocation via a ROS-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calcineurin dependent mechanism A key mechanism of TFEB activation is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent dephosphorylation of TFEB by protein phosphatases (Medina, Diego et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Martina and Puertollano 2018</xref>). We next investigated the specific phosphorylated site on TFEB by SFN in NPC1 cells. Following 24 h exposure to SFN, S211 and S142-TFEB phosphorylation were significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I, J</xref>), while S122 phosphorylation was not affected. These results indicate that TFEB is dephosphorylated at S211 and S142 residues by SFN in HeLa NPC1 model. TFEB nuclear shuffling is regulated by the activity of MTOR, which is regulated by its phosphorylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Martina, Chen et al. 2012</xref>). SFN reportedly activates TFEB in a mTOR-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Li, Shao et al. 2021</xref>). Consistently, no significant inhibition of phosphorylated MTOR (p-MTOR) or RPS6KB1 (p-RPS6KB1) can be observed in HeLa NPC1 cells treated with SFN (15 μM, 24 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4A, B</xref>). Therefore, in HeLa NPC1 cells SFN-induced TFEB activation is unlikely to be mediated by MTOR inhibition. We also examined the possibility of the direct effect of SFN on NPC1 by western blotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5</xref>, SFN (15 μM, 24 h) treatment did not affect NPC1 expression in human NPC1-patient fibroblasts. Give the well-known role of SFN as a NFE2/Nrf2 inducer, we also validated whether SFN can induce Nrf2 activation in NPC cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6A, B</xref>, SFN (15 μM, 24 h) induced robust Nrf2 nuclear translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus in HeLa NPC1 and NPC primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cells.</p>
<p>Next, we verified the effect of SFN in another NPC1 cell model by knockdown (KD) <italic>NPC1</italic> with specific siRNA (Liao, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hoglinger, Burgoyne et al. 2019</xref>). In <italic>NPC1</italic> KD HeLa cells with more than 80 % knockdown efficiency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), SFN can induce TFEB nuclear translocation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C</xref>) and upregulate its downstream gene expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Notably, SFN (15 μM, 24 h) treatment significantly reduced cholesterol levels in <italic>NPC1</italic> KD cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E, F</xref>).

<title>TFEB is required in SFN-promoted cholesterol clearance in NPC1 cells</title>
<p>We next investigated whether TFEB is required for SFN-promoted cholesterol clearance using two strategies.

The efficiency of siRNA KD and overexpression was evaluated by western blot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

<title>SFN promotes lysosomal exocytosis and biogenesis in human NPC1 models in a TFEB-dependent manner</title>
<p>We then studied the mechanism by which SFN led to diminish cellular cholesterol in NPC1 cells. Considering the established role of TFEB activation in lysosomal exocytosis, we verified the hypothesis that SFN-induced cholesterol clearance through upregulation of lysosomal exocytosis using surface LAMP1 immunostaining (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). When lysosomal exocytosis processes, luminal lysosomal membrane proteins can be detected on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane (PM) by measuring surface expression of LAMP1 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 1), a resident marker protein of late endosomes and lysosomes (referred to as “lysosomes” for simplicity hereafter) with a monoclonal antibody against a luminal epitope of LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Reddy, Caler et al. 2001</xref>). After incubation with SFN (15 μM) for 24 h, HeLa NPC1 cells exhibited a dramatic increase in the signal of LAMP1 staining in the PM (Surface LAMP1 signal colocalized with DiO, a PM marker) compared to untreated control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>), suggesting an increase of lysosomal exocytic process. Likewise, SFN promoted lysosomal exocytosis in primary macrophage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7A</xref>). In contrast, this increase of surface LAMP1 signal by SFN was significantly reduced in <italic>TFEB</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7B</xref>), demonstrating that SFN-induced lysosomal exocytosis is TFEB-dependent.</p>

<p>A direct consequence of lysosomal exocytosis is the release of lysosomal contents into the cell culture medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rodriguez, Webster et al. 1997</xref>). We then quantified the release of free cholesterol/cholesteryl ester into the medium upon SFN treatment in HeLa NPC1 cells using the Cholesterol/Cholesteryl Ester assay Kit. This assay allows to detect total cholesterol or free cholesterol in the presence or absence of cholesterol esterase; the levels of cholesteryl ester are determined by subtracting the levels of free cholesterol from total cholesterol. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, the levels of free cholesterol released into the medium treated were significantly increased with SFN (15 μM, 24 h) treatment compared to untreated control, suggesting that SFN can stimulate the release of free cholesterol into medium. Notably, the difference of released cholesteryl ester with or without SFN treatment has not been observed and the percentage of cholesteryl ester in total cholesterol released to medium were less than 10% under all conditions tested. Meanwhile, we further examined the effect of SFN on the release of lysosomal enzymes-β-hexosaminidase (NAGase) and acid phosphatase (ACP). In HeLa NPC1 cells treated with SFN (15 μM, 24 h), significantly higher levels of lysosomal enzymes (NAGases and ACP) were detected in the medium compared with untreated controls, but not in <italic>TFEB</italic> KO cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that SFN induces an active movement of lysosomes toward the PM and increases lysosomal exocytosis in a TFEB-dependent manner.</p>
<p>Previously we reported that SFN could increase lysosome biogenesis and regulate lysosomal function, which contribute to ROS reduction in NPC models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Li, Shao et al. 2020</xref>). We then studied whether SFN activate lysosomal machinery in NPC1 cells. In HeLa NPC1 cells, SFN (15 μM, 12 h) treatment significantly increased the immunofluorescence intensity of LAMP1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). Likewise, similar results were observed in NPC1 KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. S8A, B</xref>). Lysosomal enzymes operate better under acidic conditions, and the degradation-active lysosomes can be tracked using LysoTracker, a fluorescent acidotropic probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Li, Gu et al. 2019</xref>). We observed significant increases of LysoTracker staining in HeLa NPC1 cells following 12 h treatment with SFN (15 μM) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G, H</xref>) as well as in NPC1 KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. S8C, D</xref>), yet LAMP1 staining was also increased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. S8A, B</xref>). Thus lysosomal pH was more accurately determined using a ratiometric dye-pHrodo Green Dextran. When the fluorescence ratios (pHrodo Green Dextran /CF555) were calibrated to pH values, we found that SFN treatment induced significant lysosomal hyperacidity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I, J</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that SFN promotes lysosome function and biogenesis in human NPC1 model cells, consistent with our previous report.</p>
<p>Notably, we then examined the TFEB expression in two NPC cell lines (HeLa NPC1 cells and NPC1-patient fibroblast cells). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig. S9A, B</xref>, TFEB expression levels in both NPC cell models were significantly decreased compared to WT, indicating that TFEB expression may be inhibited in NPC cells. Interestingly, the basal levels of lysosome biogenesis in NPC cells were comparable with WT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. S8A-D</xref>), suggestive of compensatory changes caused by TFEB downregulation. Taken together, excessive activation of TFEB in NPC cells can be targeted for cholesterol clearance via upregulation of lysosomal function and biogenesis.</p>

As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A, B</xref>, we observed a significant decrease of pS211-TFEB protein in brain tissues with SFN treatment compared to vehicle, suggesting that TFEB in the brain was directly targeted by SFN treatment.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have demonstrated in the current study that genetic overexpression of TFEB, but not TFE3 can dramatically mitigate cholesterol accumulation in NPC cells. Pharmacological activation of TFEB by SFN, a previously identified TFEB agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Li, Shao et al. 2021</xref>), significantly promoted cholesterol clearance in human and mouse NPC cells, while genetic inhibition (KO) of TFEB blocked SFN-induced cholesterol clearance. This clearance effect exerted by SFN was associated with upregulated lysosomal exocytosis and biogenesis. Notably, SFN is reportedly BBB-permeable, assuring a good candidate for efficient delivery to the brain, which is essential for targeting neurodegenerative phenotypes in neurological diseases including NPC. In the NPC mouse models, SFN exhibits <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of suppressing the loss of Purkinje cells and maintaining body weight. Hence, genetically or pharmacologically targeting TFEB may represent a promising approach to treat NPC and manipulating lysosome function with small-molecule TFEB agonists may have broad therapeutic potentials.</p>
<p>The MiT/TFE family contains four factors: MITF, TFEB, TFE3, and TFEC, which share an identical basic region for DNA binding, and highly similar HLH and Zip regions for dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Haq and Fisher 2011</xref>). Many of the mechanistic insights into MiT regulation have been focused on TFEB and TFE3, which shares some overlapping functions, Surprisingly, in this study we found that overexpression of TFEB, but not TFE3 alleviated lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in NPC cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A, B</xref>). Moreover, studies reported that only TFEB overexpression, but not other MiT members upregulates lysosomal gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sardiello, Palmieri et al. 2009</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that the functions exerted by TFEB and TFE3 in NPC may appear to be specialized.</p>
<p>As a proof of the role of TFEB activation in NPC, pharmacological activation of TFEB by SFN, a natural small-molecule TFEB agonist, promotes a dramatic lysosomal cholesterol-lowering effect in several genetic and pharmacological NPC cell models (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). The concentration of SFN used in this study has no cytotoxicity towards the cell lines we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10</xref>). SFN-induced lysosomal exocytosis and the increased population of lysosomes ready to fuse with the PM contribute to the cholesterol clearance by SFN (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-G</xref>). Previously we have shown that SFN can mitigate oxidative stress via a ROS-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calcineurin-TFEB-mediated lysosomal function and autophagy flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Li, Shao et al. 2021</xref>). SFN, an electrophilic compound enriched in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, is a known potent inducer of NFE2L2/NRF2 in various cell types including NPC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6A,B</xref>), a transcriptional factor that controls the expression of multiple detoxifying enzymes through antioxidant response elements (AREs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yamamoto, Kensler et al. 2018</xref>). Notably, the promoter region of the <italic>Nfe2l2</italic> gene harbors a CLEAR site, and TFEB activation can upregulate the expression of <italic>Nfe2l2</italic> (Mansueto, Armani et al. 2017). Hence, TFEB, together with NFE2L2, function as key regulators of cellular redox. Oxidative stress is a major feature of NPC and has been attributed to neuronal damage, leading to the pathogenesis and progression of NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vazquez, Balboa et al. 2012</xref>). Elevated oxidative stress has been observed in the brain of NPC patient and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Smith, Wallom et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zampieri, Mellon et al. 2009</xref>). NPC patients also show decreased antioxidant capacity (expressed as Trolox equivalents) and diminished activity of different antioxidant enzymes, which indicates a decrease in antioxidant defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fu, Yanjanin et al. 2010</xref>). Hence, the protective effect of SFN against NPC could attribute to a combination with antioxidant activity and cholesterol clearance via the lysosome-dependent, TFEB-mediated regulation. Therefore, pharmacological activation of TFEB may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for NPC.</p>

<title>Filipin staining</title>
<p>Cellular unesterified cholesterol were detected using a cell-based cholesterol assay kit (Abcam, ab133116). It provides a simple fluorometric method to detect the interaction of cholesterol and filipin III, which alters the filipin absorption and fluorescence spectra allowing visualization with a fluorescence microscope. Cells were cultured at 5×10<sup>2</sup> cells/well in black, clear-bottom 96-well plates and treated with compounds for the indicated conditions. After rinsing with PBS twice, cells were fixed with fixation solution for 10min followed by a PBS rinse twice. The cells were then stained with filipin III solution for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The images were then captured by an Olympus IX73/Zeiss microscope. Image analysis was conducted using the image J software.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents an important finding that the activation of TFEB by sulforaphane (SFN) could promote lysosomal exocytosis and biogenesis in NPC, suggesting a potential mechanism by SFN for the removal of cholesterol accumulation, which may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches for NPC treatment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The cell-based assays are convincing, utilizing appropriate and validated methodologies to support the conclusion that SFN facilitates the removal of lysosomal cholesterol via TFEB activation.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed most of my questions. I have only one minor technical point to emphasize, which does not affect the overall strength of the evidence for this project.</p>
<p>The pKa values of pHrodo Green (P35368, pKa=6.757) and pHrodo Red-Dex (P10361, pKa=6.816) are very similar. Prof. Xu's article, cited in the response letter (Hu, Li et al. 2022), is an excellent example of lysosomal pH measurement. He used LysoTracker Red DND-99 for a rough estimation of lysosomal acidity, and for accurate monitoring of lysosomal pH, he employed the ratiometric OG488-dex (pKa 4.6).</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>Although the reviewers found our work interesting, they raised several important concerns about our study. To address these concerns, mostly we performed new experiments. The most important changes are highlighted in the summary paragraphs.</p>
<p>First, in response to Reviewer 1’s suggestions, we have conducted the SFN experiments systematically, e.g., we further confirmed the mechanism of SFN-activated TFEB in HeLa NPC1 cells with new experiments including: the effect of BAPTA-AM (a calcium chelator), FK506+CsA (calcineurin inhibitors) and NAC (ROS scavenger) on SFN-induced TFEB-nuclear translocation in HeLa NPC1 cells (New Fig. S3). The effect of SFN on NPC1 expression (New Fig. S5). Particularly, we examined the colocalization of DiO (a PM marker) staining and surface LAMP1 staining in HeLa NPC1 cells under SFN treatment to confirm the PM exocytosis. In main text and figure legends, accuracy of sentence is thoroughly checked and defined. Hence, we have significantly improved the presentation and clarity in the revision.</p>
<p>Second, in response to Reviewer 2’s suggestions, we have performed additional experiments to demonstrate that the role of TFEB in SFN-evoked the lysosomal exocytosis by using TFEB-KO cells (New Fig. S7B). In TFEB KO cells, this increase of surface LAMP1 signal by SFN treatment was significantly reduced, suggestive of SFN-induced exocytosis in a TFEB-dependent manner. We also investigated the effect of U18666A on CF555-dextran endocytosis. By examining the localization of CF-dex and Lamp1, we found that CF555 is present in the lysosome with U18666A treatment (Fig for reviewers only A,B), suggesting that NPC1 deficiency/U18666A treatment has no effect on CF-dex endocytosis.</p>
<p>Third, in response to Reviewer 3’s suggestions, we have performed experiments in addition to response to other reviewers’ suggestion ie. the cytotoxicity of the concentration of SFN used in this study in various cell lines (New Fig.S10).</p>
<p>In addition, according to the reviewers’ suggestions, we made clarifications and corrections wherever appropriate in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors are trying to determine if SFN treatment results in dephosphorylation of TFEB, subsequent activation of autophagy-related genes, exocytosis of lysosomes, and reduction in lysosomal cholesterol levels in models of NPC disease.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Clear evidence that SFN results in translocation of TFEB to the nucleus.</p>
<p>(2) In vivo data demonstrating that SFN can rescue Purkinje neuron number and weight in NPC1<sup>-/-</sup> animals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the support!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of molecular details regarding how SFN results in dephosphorylation of TFEB leading to activation of the aforementioned pathways. Currently, datasets represent correlations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this critical point! The reviewer is right that in this manuscript we did not talk too much about the molecular mechanism of SFN-evoked TFEB activation. Because in our previous study (Li, Shao et al. 2021), we explored the mechanism of SFN-induced TFEB activation. We show that SFN-evoked TFEB activation via a ROS-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calcineurin dependent but MTOR -independent pathway (Li, Shao et al. 2021). In the current manuscript, we cited this paper, but did not talk the details of the mechanism, which obviously confused the reviewers. Therefore, in the revision manuscript we added more details of the molecular mechanism of SFN-activated TFEB. Also, we further confirmed this mechanism in HeLa NPC1 cells with new experiments including: the effect of BAPTA-AM (a calcium chelator), FK506+CsA (calcineurin inhibitors) and NAC (ROS scavenger) on SFN-induced TFEB-nuclear translocation in NPC cells (New Fig.S3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Based on the manuscript narrative, discussion, and data it is unclear exactly how steady-state cholesterol would change in models of NPC disease following SFN treatment. Yes, there is good evidence that lysosomal flux to (and presumably across) the plasma membrane increases with SFN. However, lysosomal biogenesis genes also seem to be increasing. Given that NPC inhibition, NPC1 knockout, or NPC1 disease mutations are constitutively present and the cell models of NPC disease contain lysosomes (even with SFN) how could a simple increase in lysosomal flux decrease cholesterol levels? It would seem important to quantify the number of lysosomes per cell in each condition to begin to disentangle differences in steady state number of lysosomes, number of new lysosomes, and number of lysosomes being exocytosed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this constructive comment. From our data, in NPC1 cells SFN reduced the cholesterol levels by inducing lysosomal exocytosis and increasing lysosomal biogenesis. We understand the reviewer’s point that it would be really helpful to differentiate the exact three states of original number of lysosomes, number of new lysosomes, and number of lysosomes being exocytosis. Unfortunately, due to the technique limitation, so far seems there is no appropriate method that could clearly differentiate the lysosomes exactly come from which state. In the future, hopefully we will have technique to explore this mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Lack of evidence supporting the authors' premise that &quot;SFN could be a good therapeutic candidate for neuropathology in NPC disease&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Suggestion was taken! We removed this sentence. Thanks!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>(4) The in vivo experiments demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SFN for NPC. A clear dose response analysis would further strengthen the proposed therapeutic mechanism of SFN.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this constructive suggestion. We examined the effect of two doses of SFN30 and 50mg/kg on NPC mice. As shown in Fig.6, SFN (50mg/kg), but not 30mg/kg prevents a degree of Purkinje cell loss in the lobule IV/V of cerebellum, suggesting a dose-correlated preventive effect of SFN. In the future study, we will continue optimizing the dosage form and amount of SFN and do a dose-responsive analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Additional data supporting the activation of TFEB by SFN for cholesterol clearance in vivo would strengthen the overall impact of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank the reviewer for this constructive comment. We have detected a significant decrease of pS211-TFEB protein in brain tissues of NPC mice upon SFN treatment compared to vehicle, suggesting that SFN activates TFEB in brain tissue for the first time. It is worth to further examine the lysosomal cholesterol levels in brain tissues to show the direct effect of SFN. However, in our hands and in the literatures Filipin seems not suitable for detecting lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in brain tissue. So far there isn’t a good method to directly measure lysosomal cholesterol in tissue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure 4, the authors demonstrate increased lysosomal exocytosis and biogenesis by SFN in NPC cells. Including a TFEB-KO/KD in this assay would provide additional validation of whether these effects are TFEB-dependent.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Great suggestion! We investigated the role of TFEB in SFN-evoked the lysosomal exocytosis by using TFEB-KO cells. As shown in New Suppl. Fig. 7B, in TFEB KO cells, this increase of surface LAMP1 signal by SFN (15 μM, 12 h) treatment was significantly reduced, suggestive of SFN induced exocytosis in a TFEB-dependent manner.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) For lysosomal pH measurement, the combination of pHrodo-dex and CF-dex enables ratiometric pH measurement. However, the pKa of pHrodo red-dex (according to Invitrogen) is ~6.8, while lysosomal pH is typically around 4.7. This discrepancy may account for the lack of observed lysosomal pH changes between WT and U18666A-treated cells. Notably, previous studies (PMID: 28742019) have reported an increase in lysosomal pH in U18666A-treated cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewer’s point. But as stated in the methods and main text, we used pHrodo™ Green-Dextran (P35368, Invitrogen), rather than pHrodo Red-dextran. According to the product information from Invitrogen, pHrodo Green-dex conjugates are non-fluorescent at neural pH, but fluorescence bright green at acidic pH around 4, such as those in endosomes and lysosomes. Therefore, pHrodo Green-dex is suitable to monitor the acidity of lysosome (Hu, Li et al. 2022). We also used LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Thermo Scien fic, L7528) to measure lysosomal pH (Fig. 4G, H), which is consistent with results from pHrodo Green/CF measurement.</p>
<p>The reviewer mentioned that previous studies have reported an increase in lysosomal pH in U18666Atreated cells. We understood this concern. But in our hands, from our data with two lysosomal pH sensors, we have not detected lysosomal pH change in U18666A-treated NPC1 cell models.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The authors are also encouraged to perform colocalization studies between CF-dex and a lysosomal marker, as some researchers may be concerned that NPC1 deficiency could reduce or block the trafficking of dextran along endocytosis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this important point and suggestion was taken! We investigated the effect of NPC1 deficiency on CF555-dextran trafficking into lysosome by examining the localization of CF-dex and Lamp1. To clearly define whether CF555-dex is present in the lysosome, we first used apilimod to enlarge lysosomes and then examined the relative posi on of CF555-dex and lamp1. As shown in Author response image 1A,B, in HeLa cells treated with U18666A, CF555 signals (red) clearly present inside lysosome (LAMP1 labelled lysosomal membrane, green signal), suggesting that CF555dex endocytosis is not affected by NPC1 deficiency (U18666A treatment).</p>

<p>(9) In vivo data supporting the activation of TFEB by SFN for cholesterol clearance would significantly enhance the impact of the study. For example, measuring whole-animal or brain cholesterol levels would provide stronger evidence of SFN's therapeutic potential.</p>

<p>We really appreciate the reviewer’s comments. Please see response to point #5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>(10) The manuscript is extremely hard to read due to the writing; it needs careful editing for grammar and English.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sorry for the defects in the writing and grammar. We had thoroughly checked grammar and polished the English to improve the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) There are a number of important technical issues that need to be addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will address the technical issues mentioned in the following ques ons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) The TFEB influence on filipin staining in Figure 1A is somewhat subtle. In the mCherry alone panels there is a transfected cell with no filipin staining and the mCherry-TFEBS211A cells still show some filipin staining.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point. The reviewer is right that not all the mCherry alone cells with the same level of filipin signal and not all mCherry-TFEBS211 transfected cells show completely no filipin signal. The statistical results were from randomly selected cells from 3 independent experiments. To avoid the confusion, we have included more cells in the statistical analysis to cover all the conditions as shown in the new Fig. 1B. Hopefully this helps to clarify the confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) Figure 1C is impressive for the upregulation of filipin with U18666A treatment. However, SFN is used at 15 microM. This must be hitting multiple pathways. Vauzour et al (PMID: 20166144) use SFN at 10 nM to 1microM. Other manuscripts use it in the low microM range. The authors should repeat at least some key experiments using SFN at a range of concentrations from perhaps 100 nM to 5 microM. The use of 15 microM throughout is an overall concern.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reason that we use this concentration of SFN is based on our previous study (Li, Shao et al. 2021). We had shown that SFN (10–15 μM, 2–9 h) induces robust TFEB nuclear translocation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HeLa cells as well as in other human cell lines without cytotoxicity (Li, Shao et al. 2021). Also, tissue concentrations of SFN can reach 3–30 μM upon broccoli consumption (Hu, Khor et al. 2006), so we used low micromolar concentrations of SFN (15 μM) in our study. Moreover, we further confirmed that SFN (15 μM) induces TFEB nuclear translocation in HeLa NPC1 cells (Fig. 1F, G Fig. 2B, G) and this concentration of SFN has no cytotoxicity (New Fig.S10).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The following comments are designed to improve and focus the authors' work.</p>
<p>(14) Related to data in Figure 1. The mechanism through which TFEB can reduce Filipin in U18 conditions is unclear. Inhibi on of NPC1 results in hyperactivation of mTOR through cholesterol transport at ER-Lysosome contacts (see Zoncu group publications). If mTORC is hyperac ve in NPC disease models, TFEB would be expected to remain cytoplasmic and not enter the nucleus as the representative image in Figure 1A demonstrates.</p>

<p>In our previous study (Li, Shao et al. 2021), we have shown that SFN induces TFEB nuclear translocation in a mTOR-independent manner (Li, Shao et al. 2021). Consistent with this result, in this study we confirmed that SFN-induced TFEB nuclear translocation is mTor-independent in NPC1 cells (Now Fig. S4A, B). Thus, SFN induced TFEB nuclear translocation in various NPC cells (Fig. 1F, G, Fig. 2B, G). Please also see the discussion about the mechanism of SFN in response to point #1.</p>

<p>(15) Therefore, how does overexpression of TFEB, which remains in the cytoplasm, result in a decreased filipin signal? Similar ques ons relate to Figure 1C-H.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Medina et. al (Medina, Fraldi et al. 2011) show that TFEB overexpression (not activation, so overexpressed TFEB is in the cytoplasm) increases the pool of lysosomes in the proximity of the plasma membrane and promotes their fusion with PM by raising intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels through lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel MCOLN1, leading to increased lysosomal exocytosis. Hence, TFEB overexpression only (TFEB is not activated) could reduce filipin signal via increasing lysosomal exocytosis. And with TFEB agonist treatment such as TFEB could further boost this increase.</p>

<p>(16) It would seem appropriate to measure the NPC1 and NPC2 proteins using western blot to ensure that SFN-dependent clearance of cholesterol is not due to enhanced expression of the native protein in U18-treated cells or enhanced folding of the protein in patient fibroblasts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this constructive comment! Because NPC1 gene mutation takes about 95% of NPC cases and NPC2 mutation takes about 5% of NPC cases. And in this study we focused on NPC1 deficiency cases. Thus, we measured the effect of SFN on the expression of NPC1 in human NPC1-patient fibroblasts. Western blot analysis showed that SFN (15 μM, 24 h) treatment did not affect NPC1 expression in human NPC1-patient fibroblasts (new Fig. S5).</p>

<p>(17) Related to data in Figures 1C-E. Controls are missing related to the effect SFN has on steady-state cholesterol levels. This may be insightful in providing information on the mode of action of this compound.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Suggestion was taken! We have supplemented the control- SFN only in new Fig. 1C-E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(18) The mechanism that links SFN to TFEB-dependent translocation is suggested to involve calcineur independent dephosphorylation of TFEB. However, no data is provided. It would seem important to iden fy the mechanism(s) through which SFN positively regulates TFEB location. This would shift the manuscript and its model from correlations to causation. Experiments involving calcineurin inhibitors, or agonists of TRPML1 that have been reported as being a key source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> for calcineurin activation, may provide molecular insight.</p>

<p>(19) Related to Figure 4. Using a plasma membrane counterstain to quantify plasma membrane LAMP1 would increase the rigor of the analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Great idea! We examined the colocalization of DiO (a PM marker) staining and LAMP1 staining in HeLa NPC1 cells under SFN treatment. As shown in new Fig.4A, surface LAMP1 signal(red) colocalized with DiO (green), a PM marker.</p>

<p>(20) Related to Figure 5. How do the authors explain the kinetic disparity between SFN treatment for 24 vs 72 hrs? IF TFEB is activated and promoting lysosomal biogenesis and increased lysosomal flux across the PM, why does cholesterol accumulation lag? Perhaps related to this point. Are other cholesterol metabolizing enzymes that may have altered activity in NPC sensitive to SFN? A similar comment applies to the Sterol regulatory element binding protein pathway, which has been shown to be activated in models of NPC disease.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewer’s point. As shown in Fig. 5C, D, in NPC1<sup>-/-</sup> MEF cells, SFN treatment for 24 h showed relative weaker cholesterol clearance compared to the effects in human cells (Fig.1C, D, Fig.2.E, I). Thus, we explored a longer treatment of SFN for 72 h (fresh SFN in medium was added every 24 h), and 72h treatment of SFN exhibited substantial cholesterol reduction (Fig. 5C, D). This different effect could be attributed to the continuous action of SFN, which could prolong the exocytosis, leading to more effective cholesterol clearance. As shown in the DMSO-treated MEF cells, the cholesterol levels are similar in both 24 and 72 h, thus 24 h U18666A treatment has reached the upper limit of the accumulated cholesterol, longer treatment me would not change the cholesterol levels. Thus, cholesterol accumulation has no lag.</p>
<p>We did not investigate whether SFN regulates other cholesterol metabolizing enzymes or sterol regulatory element binding proteins although we cannot rule out this possibility. In this study we mainly focus on the cholesterol clearance effect by SFN via TFEB-mediated pathways. From our data, TFEB KO could significantly diminish SFN-evoked cholesterol clearance. Hence, the effect of other cholesterol metabolizing enzymes or sterol regulatory element binding proteins maybe not as important as TFEB, thus out of scope of this study. In the future, we may explore the involvement of possible other pathways on SFN’s effects.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(26) In Figure 3 the authors should use multiple single siRNAs or perform a functional rescue to determine specificity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewer’s point. We did design several siRNAs and the efficiency of these siRNAs were validated. Finally, we decide use this siRNA whose knockdown efficiency is best in the study and the specificity of the siTFEB has been validated by Western blot as shown in Fig. 3A. Furthermore, we used TFEB knockout cells constructed by CRISPR/Cas9 to further examine the role of TFEB in SFN-induced cholesterol clearance (Fig. 3D). Consistently with the results in the siTFEB-transfected HeLa NPC1 cells (Fig. 3B, C), SFN failed to diminish cholesterol in HeLa TFEB KO cells. The result from TFEB KO cells is even convincing than siRNA experiment. We also performed a functional rescue of re-expressing TFEB in TFEB KO cells, in which SFN-induced cholesterol clearance was restored (Fig. 3E, F). Collectively, these data indicate that TFEB is required for lysosomal cholesterol reduction upon SFN treatment. Thus, we did not repeat this rescue experiment in the siTFEB-transfected HeLa NPC1 cells.</p>
