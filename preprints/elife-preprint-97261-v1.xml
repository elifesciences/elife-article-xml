<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Birnaviruses form a distinct class of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses characterized by the absence of a transcription-competent inner core particle. The early endosomes (EE) of cells infected with the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) - a prototypical birnavirus and an important avian pathogen - constitute a platform for viral replication. Here, we study the mechanism of birnaviral hijacking of EE membranes for this process. We demonstrate that the viral protein 3 (VP3) specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) present in EE membranes. We identify the domain of VP3 involved in PI3P-binding and its role in viral replication. Finally, our molecular simulations results unveil a two-stage modular mechanism for VP3 association with EE. Firstly, the carboxy-terminal region of VP3 adsorbs to the membrane via non-specific electrostatic interactions. Then, in the second stage, the VP3 core seals the membrane engagement by specifically binding PI3P through its P2 domain, additionally promoting PI3P accumulation.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Birnaviruses are different from the rest of the dsRNA viruses. They contain an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with a unique motif arrangement in the palm subdomain, their viral particles lack the inner protein layer protecting the dsRNA, and the viral capsid protein VP2 presents a jelly-roll topology characteristic of +sRNA viruses. Here, we provide evidence that birnaviruses replicate in association with cellular membranes. Since the remodeling of the host’s membranes is a characteristic shared by all +sRNA viruses, our results highlight parallels in the replication strategy of these “<italic>non-canonical</italic>” dsRNA viruses and +sRNA viruses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Birnaviruses belong to the <italic>Birnaviridae</italic> family composed of nonenveloped icosahedral dsRNA viruses that infect a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. The prototypical and best-characterized family member, IBDV, is the causative agent of Gumboro disease, a highly contagious immunosuppressive disease that affects young chickens (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) causing significant damage to the poultry industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Delmas et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Birnaviruses are unconventional dsRNA viruses, as the virions lack a “<italic>core”,</italic> i.e., an inner protein layer containing the genome, which instead forms a filamentous ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) with the multifunctional protein VP3, the RdRp VP1, and the dsRNA genome segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Luque et al., 2009b</xref>). IBDV contains a single ∼70-nm diameter T = 13<italic>l</italic> icosahedral capsid surrounding a polyploid bipartite dsRNA genome (segments A and B, 3.2 and 2.8 kbp, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Luque et al., 2009a</xref>). The X-ray crystal structure of its capsid revealed that VP2 is the only component. VP2 has two main domains, a “shell” domain homologous to the coat proteins of +sRNA such as the T = 3 nodaviruses, and a “tower” domain like those present in the T = 13 middle-layer protein of dsRNA viruses of the order <italic>Reovirales</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Coulibaly et al., 2005</xref>). VP3 is a 257-residues long polypeptide with multiple essential roles during the viral life cycle. In the mature virion, VP3 is a component of the RNPs where it is associated with the dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Luque et al., 2009b</xref>). During viral assembly, VP3 acts as a scaffold protein via electrostatic interactions between basic residues of pVP2 and acidic residues at the VP3 carboxy-terminal (Ct) region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Saugar et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, VP3 interacts with VP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lombardo et al., 1999</xref>). VP3’s multifunctional properties might be mediated by its capacity to form oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Casañas et al., 2008</xref>), or by its intrinsically disordered regions. The X-ray crystal structure of the central region of the IBDV VP3 (residues 82 to 222) showed that it consists entirely of α-helices connected by loops that can be divided into two structural domains linked by a flexible hinge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Casañas et al., 2008</xref>). The 36 Ct residues of the protein, a highly hydrophilic region rich in charged amino acids and proline residues, were predicted to be disordered, so it was excluded from the crystallized construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Casañas et al., 2008</xref>). The 81 amino-terminal (Nt) region of VP3 was cleaved during the crystallization process and was absent in the crystal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Casañas et al., 2008</xref>). The X-ray crystal structure indicated the presence of two positively charged domains, termed Patch 1 (P1) and Patch 2 (P2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Valli et al., 2012</xref>). Both patches are composed of four discontinuous, positively charged residues forming two exposed patches on the surface of the protein. P1 was demonstrated to be involved in the dsRNA binding-activity of VP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Valli et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies on the subcellular localization of the IBDV replication complex (RC) have shown that IBDV replication components are localized to EE (8). Further analysis revealed that VP3 associates with the cytosolic leaflet of EE membranes via P2, with a critical functional role in the virus life cycle (9). Additionally, the presence of PI3P in EE membranes was demonstrated to be a key host factor for VP3 association and the consequent establishment of IBDV RCs on EE membranes (10).</p>
<p>Here we studied the mechanism mediating the birnaviral hijacking of EE membranes, focusing on the VP3-PI3P interaction. Using biophysical approaches in cell-free <italic>in vitro</italic> systems, we demonstrate that PI3P constitutes the cellular partner for VP3 association to EE membranes. By introducing charge-reversal point mutations on VP3 P2, we established the contribution of each of the four positively charged residues composing P2, with a key role of the arginine at position 200 (R<sub>200</sub>), a residue conserved across all known birnaviruses. Using a reverse genetic system for IBDV, we show that mutating R<sub>200</sub> abolishes viral replication. Finally, by using molecular simulations, we unveil a potential two-stage modular mechanism for VP3 association with EE. We show that, in the first step, the Ct flexible tail of VP3 adsorbs to the membrane by electrostatic interactions due to its positive charge. Then, in the second stage,the VP3 core seals the membrane engagement by recruiting PI3P scattered in the EE membrane to the P2 region, promoting a stable VP3-PI3P interaction.</p>

<title>Biophysical characterization of VP3 binding to PI3P</title>
<p>We set up a liposome co-flotation assay to assess the binding of VP3 to PI3P in membranes. We expressed and purified His-tagged VP3 full-length (His-VP3 FL) and confirmed its identity by Western blot using specific anti-VP3 and anti-His antibodies, as well as by mass spectrometry (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1). We prepared two populations: “liposomes PI3P(-)” and “liposomes PI3P(+)”. We confirmed that these preparations were suitable for evaluating the interaction with PI3P by monitoring co-flotation of a recombinant His-2xFYVE domain (<underline>F</underline>ab1p, <underline>Y</underline>OTB, <underline>V</underline>ac1p, and <underline>E</underline>EA1), followed by immunoblot detection of the His-tag (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). We observed specific binding of His-VP3 FL to liposomes PI3P(+), evidenced by a significant difference in the ability to bind to both liposome populations (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). To further test His-VP3 FL PI3P-binding specificity, we performed a co-flotation assay using liposomes where PI3P was replaced by a different anionic lipid, such as 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (“liposomes PA”) or [1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1’-myo-inositol)] (“liposomes PI”) at the same molar ratio. We observed that His-VP3 FL bound to liposomes PI3P(+), but not to liposomes PA or PI, reinforcing the notion that the interaction of VP3 with PI3P is specific (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2).</p>

<p>Two additional biophysical approaches were implemented. On one side, we prepared liposomes PI3P(-) and PI3P(+), and incubated them with His-2xFYVE or His-VP3 FL that had been pre-bound to Ni-NTA [nickel (II) nitrilotriacetic acid] gold particles. Subsequently we inspected the preparations by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We observed gold particles decorating liposomes PI3P(+) in the presence of both, His-2xFYVE and His-VP3 FL (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>). On the other side, we performed bio-layer interferometry (BLI) experiments using purified His-VP3 FL, and liposomes PI3P(-) and PI3P(+) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shah et al., 2014</xref>). In the BLI experiments, the protein is immobilized on the tip of Ni-NTA sensors while the liposomes remain in solution, allowing to monitor the molecular interactions in real-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kairys et al., 2019</xref>). Purified His-Streptavidin and His-2xFYVE were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. A specific liposome PI3P(+) dose-dependent binding of His-2xFYVE and His-VP3 FL was observed (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Previous studies indicated that the P2 is responsible for PI3P binding on EE membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gimenez et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2018</xref>). Yet the Ct region of VP3 is also highly enriched in positively charged residues. We generated a computational model of FL VP3 using AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>), which predicted a disordered Ct region (pLDTT of 42.6) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>). Thus, we hypothesized that both conditions, the positive electrostatic surface charge and the disordered character of the VP3 Ct, might be required for the binding to the surface of EE. To test this hypothesis, we made a VP3 construct bearing a Ct truncation (His-VP3 ΔCt) and used in co-flotation assays and BLI experiments. We did not detect interaction of this mutant with PI3P(-) nor PI3P(+) liposomes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F, G</xref></bold>). Taken together, our results strongly validate the role of PI3P in the interaction with VP3 and underscore the significance of the Ct domain in mediating this interaction.</p>

<title>Role of VP3 P2 in the association of VP3 with PI3P on the EE membrane</title>
<p>To further assess the contribution of P2 residues to for PI3P binding by VP3, we set up two additional cell biology assays. One consists of co-transfecting cells with EGFP-2xFYVE and VP3 constructs, and detecting them by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The second one consists of assessing the ability of purified GST-2xFYVE, which recognizes endogenous PI3P, to co-localize with VP3. We employed QM7 cells transiently co-overexpressing EGFP-2xFYVE and VP3 P2 WT, P2 all reversed, or the four point mutants to evaluate their colocalization.

<title>VP3 R<sub>200</sub> is crucial for binding to PI3P</title>
<p>To confirm the role of R<sub>200</sub> in binding to PI3P-bearing EE, we devised a liposome co-flotation assay using a recombinant His-tagged R<sub>200</sub>D VP3 mutant. When assayed in parallel with His-2xFYVE and His-VP3 FL, we observed that His-VP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D lost binding to PI3P(+) liposomes (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>). To confirm that the lack of binding was not due to misfolding of the mutant, we compared the circular dichroism spectra of mutant and WT proteins, without detecting significant differences (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). To assess its relevance in IBDV infectivity, we generated recombinant mutant IBDV by reverse genetics. QM7 cells were transfected with the plasmids SegA, SegB or Seg.R<sub>200</sub>D alone (as controls) or with a mixture of plasmids SegA+SegB or SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D+SegB. At 8 h post transfection (p.t.) the cells were recovered and re-plated onto fresh non-transfected cells. At 72 h post-plating, the generation of foci forming units (FFUs) was revealed by Coomassie staining. As expected, single-transfections of SegA, SegB or Seg.R<sub>200</sub>D did not produce FFUs. As observed in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>, the transfection of SegA+SegB produced detectable FFUs while no FFUs were detected after the transfection of SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D+SegB (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>). Given the relevance of VP3 R<sub>200</sub>, we assessed its conservation among members of the <italic>Birnaviridae</italic> family.

<title>Electrostatic forces mediate VP3 membrane binding</title>
<p>Computer simulations based on coarse-grain models were designed to assess the binding free-energy and adsorption mechanism of three protein variants: VP3 Ct, VP3 ΔNt, and VP3 FL. The VP3 Ct region, with a positive electrostatic charge of +5, was modeled as an intrinsically disordered region according to the AlphaFold2 prediction (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>). VP3 ΔNt encompasses residues 82 to 257 and is electroneutral. This variant was chosen primarily because it retains the structural data from the crystallized protein. Similarly to His-VP3 FL, His-VP3 ΔNt retains the ability to bind to liposomes PI3P(+) (see <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S5A-C). Finally, VP3 FL is the full length monomeric VP3, using the AlphaFold2 predicted structure with an overall electrostatic charge of −3. We employed the Molecular Theory (MT) approach to obtain adsorption free-energy profiles, PMF(z), at different salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chiarpotti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ramírez et al., 2019</xref>). <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold> (panels A-C) shows PMF(z), where z represents the distance between the center of mass of the protein and the center of the membrane, at 50 and 150 mM NaCl. As observed in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>, the positively charged VP3 Ct shows the highest affinity for the membrane due to the deprotonation of the acidic lipids at pH 8, resulting in a net negative charge on the membrane surface (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S6). However, the electroneutral construct VP3 ΔNt has a lower binding energy than VP3 Ct, and also VP3 FL shows some degree of membrane binding, despite both the protein and the membrane being negatively charged, as evidenced by the shallow minimum in the PMF.</p>

<p>The binding of the three protein constructs is strongly affected by electrostatics, as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>, where the adsorption energy is plotted as a function of the concentration of salt. The effect of salt concentration is most significant for VP3 Ct, but it is also noticeable for VP3 ΔNt and VP3 FL. Also, the interfacial concentration of each construct is higher at lower ionic strengths, as depicted in <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S7. The weak binding energy of VP3 FL to the anionic membrane under physiological conditions (∼150 mM NaCl, pH 7) is consistent with the experimental observation that VP3 FL does not bind to liposomes PA and PI, which are anionic at the pH of the experiments. However, those same experiments showed that VP3 FL did bind to PI3P(+) liposomes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref></bold>), despite the MT calculations predicting weak binding. Taken together, our results suggest that specific VP3-PI3P interactions enhance the binding of VP3 to PI3P-containing EE membranes, while exhibiting weak and non-specific electrostatic attractions to an otherwise generic anionic membrane. <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S8 illustrates the distribution of charged residues of VP3 near the membrane, indicating that the Ct fragment drives the non-specific binding (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S9).</p>
<p>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations based on the MARTINI model were employed to investigate the mechanism by which VP3 Ct and VP3 ΔNt approach the membrane surface. We chose VP3 ΔNt over VP3 FL because VP3 ΔNt has a closer resemblance to the well-established experimental crystal structure. Additionally, the adsorption free energy profiles predicted by MT for both VP3 ΔNt and VP3 FL are notably similar (compare panels B and C of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Unlike the MT model, MARTINI considers both electrostatic and van der Waals forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">De Jong et al., 2013</xref>). To mimic the liposome PI3P(+) composition used in the co-flotation assays, the lipid bilayer was modeled with a molar ratio of 64:31:5 for the lipids DOPE, DOPC, and PI3P, respectively. DOPE and DOPC are electroneutral, PI3P is anionic. The MD simulations revealed that both VP3 Ct and VP3 ΔNt settled on the membrane surface after 120 ns, as shown in <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S10A. <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-D</xref></bold> shows a temporal sequence of configurations during the adsorption of VP3 ΔNt.

VP3 Ct exhibited the same behavior, as demonstrated in <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S10A and Fig. S11. Notably, VP3 Ct and VP3 ΔNt did not detach from the surface during these MD simulations, suggesting that the adsorption energies calculated by MT were underestimated.

In both cases, the recruitment of PI3P in the cis hemilayer is accompanied by a local depletion of PI3P in the trans hemilayer, due to interhemilayer electrostatic repulsions (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S12). The effects on PI3P concentration, induced by VP3 ΔNt, result from a synergistic action between the positively charged Ct and the P2 region of the protein. Furthermore, when mutations are introduced to the P2 region - starting with R<sub>200</sub>D and eventually including the entire P2 domain - there is a gradual reduction in its contribution to the recruitment of PI3P (see <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S14). Finally, to examine the potential impact of VP3 on the lipid bilayer, we incubated liposomes PI3P(-) and PI3P(+) with purified His-VP3 FL as described previously. The samples were cryo-fixed and cryo-EM was used to observe the resulting structures. As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref></bold>, His-VP3 FL distorts the membrane of liposomes containing PI3P, resulting in small pinches in the bilayer, detectable in 36% of the liposomes PI3P(+), while it is completely absent in PI3P(-) liposomes. Taken together, our findings suggest that the binding of VP3 to EE membranes has the potential to alter the local lipid composition by recruiting PI3P, which could then lead to the localized membrane pinches observed in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref></bold>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several viruses hijack the PI3P metabolism machinery to complete their infectious cycle. However, only a few cases of viral proteins that bind PI3P have been described. Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a member of the lentivirus subgroup of retroviruses and replicates in macrophages. Retroviral assembly and release are directed by the structural precursor polyprotein Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wills and Craven, 1991</xref>). EIAV Gag localizes to both the cell interior and to the plasma membrane due to its high-affinity interaction with PI3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fernandes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Puffer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tanzi et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, mutation of K<sub>49</sub>, a residue in the PIs-binding pocket of Gag inhibited the release of viral-like particles from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fernandes et al., 2011</xref>). Another example are the poxviruses, a family of cytoplasmic DNA viruses that also rely on intracellular membranes to develop their envelope, whose morphogenesis requires enzymes from the cellular phosphoinositide metabolic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mcnulty et al., 2010</xref>). For vaccinia virus (VACV), the prototypic poxvirus, Kolli and coworkers showed that the VACV H7 protein binds to PI3P and PI4P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kolli et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly to our observations in IBDV VP3, the authors uncovered two regions of H7 essential for viral replication. One region is a positive surface patch centered on K<sub>108</sub>, and the other region is the flexible Ct tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kolli et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Our biophysical and molecular simulation results suggest a specific but weak interaction of VP3 with PI3P bearing membranes. In co-floatation assays, we observed that His-VP3 FL reaches the top of the gradient, where liposomes PI3P(+) are located, with a high proportion of protein still found at the bottom of the gradient. This phenomenon was not observed with the His-2xFYVE protein. Additionally, the slopes of the BLI curves show that His-VP3 FL dissociate faster than His-2xFYVE from liposomes PI3P(+). Computer simulations have also revealed a weak attractive interaction between the negatively charged VP3 and membranes that contain PI3P. VP3 bears multiple essential roles during the viral life cycle. In this context, our hypothesis is that an early, specific, but weak interaction with PI3P is required for the formation of RCs associated with EE and represents an advantage for the virus that counts with VP3 to go forward into the replication cycle.</p>
<p>It has recently been reported that the RCs of IBDV exhibit liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Reddy et al., 2022</xref>). In LLPS, one or more biomolecules form a network of mild homo- and heterotypic interactions, resulting in the formation of a distinct liquid phase within a liquid medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banani et al., 2017</xref>). In light of our results, it is conceivable to hypothesize that viral interaction with the EE membranes acts as a first step in the RCs biogenesis, leading to the growth of biomolecular condensates with LLPS characteristics around EE membranes, as recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brodrick and Broadbent, 2023</xref>). In support of this model, both the RNA dependent RNA polymerase VP1 and the viral dsRNA associate to endosomes (6) and to the LLPS condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Delgui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Reddy et al., 2022</xref>). Further experiments are needed in order to link the association of VP3 to EE membranes with biomolecular condensate formation.</p>

<p>Liposomes were freshly prepared by the freeze-thaw and extrusion method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">F Olson, C A Hunt and W J Vail, 1979</xref>). Briefly, lipids dissolved in chloroform were mixed and placed in glass vials, and the chloroform was evaporated by centrifuging 2 h at 35°C in a SpeedVac. The dried lipids were resuspended in a binding buffer composed of 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8 to a final concentration of 5 mM. The preparation was submitted to ten cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing in a 37°C water bath. To generate small unilamellar liposomes, the multilamellar lipids were extruded through polycarbonate membranes (pore size 200 nm, Whatman). The liposomes were used within 1 week. The lipids POPE (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), PI3P [1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1’-myo-inositol-3’-phosphate)], PA (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate) and PI [1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1’-myo-inositol)] were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Liposomes PI3P(-) liposomes were prepared as a mixture of POPE and POPC at a molar ratio of 64:36. Liposomes PI3P(+), PA(+) or PI(+) were prepared as a mixture of POPE and POPC, with either PI3P, PA or PI at a molar ratio of 64:31:5.</p>

Thus, IBDV VP3 FL protein was subcloned from plasmid pcDNAVP3 FL into the pFastBacHTb vector (Gibco BRL), which incorporates a 6xHis tag at the N-terminal of the recombinant protein. Briefly, VP3 FL coding sequence was amplified by PCR with the oligonucleotide pairs VP3.Fw and VP3.Rv incorporating <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Eco</italic>RI restriction sites, respectively (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table 1). The resulting DNA fragment containing the VP3 gene was digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Eco</italic>RI and ligated to plasmid pFastBacHTb restricted with the same enzymes, generating the plasmid pFastBac-his-VP3 FL. This plasmid contained the VP3 gene fused to a histidine tag under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. The generation of rBV His-VP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D was performed following the same procedure, but using the pcDNAVP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D as a template for subcloning. The generation of rBV His-VP3 Δ223-257 was performed as follows. A 663 nucleotide DNA fragment containing a truncated version of the VP3 sequence encoding a polypeptide lacking the 36 carboxi-terminal residues was amplified by PCR from pcDNAVP3 FL with the oligonucleotide pairs VP3.Fw and VP3 Δ223-257.Rv incorporating <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Eco</italic>RI restriction sites, respectively (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table 1).

All the resulting plasmids were subjected to nucleotide sequencing to assess the correctness of the inserted VP3 sequence, and they were then used to produce the corresponding rBVs by using the Bac-to-Bac system and by following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, the recombinant plasmids were transformed into DH10Bac competent cells to obtain recombinant bacmids. The white colonies on culture plates were picked, confirmed by PCR and used for Sf9 cell transfection by using Cellfectin II Reagent (Gibco). The transfected cells were cultured at 28°C for 5 days to produce rBVs. Then, the cells were subjected to Western blot analysis for recombinant proteins expression confirmation and the supernatant (P1) was used to amplify the rBVs to a higher-titre P2 and scaled up to obtain a higher volume of P3 to be titrated (Plate-Forme Technologique Production et Purification de Protéines Recombinantes, Institut Pasteur) and used for protein production.</p>

<title>Protein expression and purification</title>
<p>For the liposome co-flotation assays, His-VP3 polypeptides were produced with a histidine-tag in the Bac-to-Bac™ Baculovirus Expression System. Briefly, Sf9 cells (Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientific) were infected with recombinant Baculoviruses (rBVs) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 PFU/cell. Cells were harvested at 96 h post-infection, washed once with chilled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche), and maintained on ice for 30 min. Thereafter, extracts were sonicated and centrifuged at 13.000 g for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatants were collected and subjected to immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) purification by using a Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity column (HiTrap Fast Flow Crude, GE Healthcare). Resin-bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole].

<title>Recombinant viruses foci forming units assay</title>
<p>QM7 cells were grown in M24 multi-well plates for 12 h to approximately 90-95% confluency and then 800 ng (400 ng of plasmid with each segment) were transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 (number 11668027; Thermo Fisher, Spain) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. When performing single segment transfections (SegA, SegB and SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D), 400 ng of the plasmid pCAGIG (a gift from Connie Cepko; Addgene plasmid #11159; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Matsuda and Cepko, 2004b</xref>)) was added to 400 ng of those containing the viral segments to reach a total of 800 ng of total DNA per transfection. pCAGIG is a mammalian expression vector that shares the backbone with the pCAGEN vector used for the expression of the viral segments. The following transfections were performed in triplicate: SegA, SegB, SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D, SegA+SegB or SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D+ SegB. At 8 h post-transfection (p.t.) the supernatants were discarded and the monolayers were recovered for further plating on M6 multi-well plates containing non transfected QM7 cells. For monolayers transfected with SegA, SegB, SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D and SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D+ SegB half of the transfected monolayer was plated on fresh cells. For SegA+SegB, which leads to the production of wild type virus, several dilutions were tested, always in triplicate. To limit virus diffusion and facilitating the foci forming Avicel RC-591 (FMC Biopolymer) was added to the M6 multi-well plates. 72 h p.i., the monolayers were 16% formaldehyde-fixated and stained with Coomassie R250 (BioRad).</p>

<title>Coarse Grain (CG) models of VP3 constructs</title>
<p>Three protein constructs derived from VP3 were considered: 1. VP3 Ct. A peptide comprising the last 36 residues of VP3 (223 to 257) ending in the Ct. VP3 Ct has an overall electrical charge of +5, and is absent from the available crystal structure of VP3. Consequently, it was assumed to be a disordered domain and was modeled as unstructured. 2. VP3 Δ81. A shorter version of VP3 that lacks the first 81 residues leading to the Nt. It consists of the crystallized structure of the protein core (residues 82 to 222, available from the Protein Data Bank PDB ID 2R18), concatenated with the VP3 Ct peptide. As the first 9 residues of the protein core are also missing from resolved structure, they were modeled as unstructured, similar to the VP3 Ct fragment. VP3 Δ81 was selected primarily because it contains the structural information of the crystallized protein, which provides valuable insights into the protein’s overall structure and function. In addition, the construct includes the Ct peptide (VP3 Ct), which is crucial for membrane binding. Although the Nt 81 residues are absent in this construct, their exclusion was found to be inconsequential in terms of evaluating the protein’s binding energy and positioning on the membrane surface (compare, for example, VP3 Δ81 and VP3 FL in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). 3. VP3 FL. The full-length VP3 protein, which was obtained as an AlphaFold prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). The structure of the protein predicted by AlphaFold not only provided insight into the overall architecture of VP3, but it also reinforced our model of unstructured VP3 Ct. It is worth noting that the Nt 81 residues, which are absent in VP3 Δ81, are predicted to be in a modular conformation, constituting a globular domain separated by a loop from the globular domain of the core region (crystallized residues 82 to 222). The structural information provided by the full-length VP3 model is therefore useful in understanding the interaction with lipid membranes.</p>
<p>All proteins were modeled with the MARTINI force-field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">De Jong et al., 2013</xref>) [whenever needed, the secondary structure of the non-disordered protein domains was restrained by means of the ElNeDyn elastic network model (elnedyn22)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Periole et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Poma et al., 2017</xref>). In this case, harmonic potentials with a force constant of 1000 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> nm<sup>2</sup> were applied between backbone particles separated by less than 1.4 nm. In the construction of VP3 Δ81, elastic network restrictions were applied to residues 91 to 220, which was the fragment resolved from by crystallography. However, in VP3 FL, the elastic network was applied to all globular domains, while leaving the linkers and the last 36 residues at the Ct unrestricted.</p>

<title>Molecular Theory calculations</title>
<p>The Molecular Theory (MT) used to assess protein adsorption is detailed in references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chiarpotti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ramírez et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, this mean-field method yields the distribution of macromolecules in an anisotropic system, through the minimization of a model free-energy functional that accounts for electrostatic and steric interactions, the configurational and translational entropy of the macromolecules, the translational entropy of the free species (protons, hydroxyls, and salt ions) and the acid-base equilibrium of all ionizable molecules in the system. In the present case, the membrane was modeled as a dielectric slab of thickness h, with a dielectric constant ε<sub>M</sub>, which is in contact with a solution of dielectric constant ε<sub>S</sub>. Far from the membrane (z→∞), the solution is in contact with an infinite bulk that contains the proteins (1 μM concentration), all the free species, and a fixed pH=8. The rigid membrane contained 15% of ionizable groups on its surface, in order to mimic the 5% of ternary ionizable PI3P. One third of these groups were assigned a pK<sub>a</sub> of 2.5, corresponding to the phosphate group of the glycerol moiety, while the pK<sub>a</sub> for the rest was set to 6.5, corresponding to the phosphoesther groups of inositol. MT requires the input of a large set of protein conformations, which are subsequently reweighted by the theory. These conformations were generated by Molecular Dynamics simulations of the proteins in water. VP3 Ct, VP3 Δ81 and VP3 FL were modeled using MARTINI-2.2 parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Marrink et al., 2007</xref>). The proteins were hydrated in MARTINI polarizable water. As stated before, the proteins globular segments (residues 92-222 in both VP3 Δ81 and VP3 FL, and residues 7-79 additionally in VP3 FL) were restricted through the application of the elastic network ElNeDyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Marrink et al., 2007</xref>) with a spring constant of 1000 kJ.mol<sup>−1</sup> applied to backbone beads (BB) within a cutoff distance of 1.4 nm. Each protein was simulated for 100 ns, after equilibration, in the NPT ensemble using GROMACS 2021.3. A cluster analysis was performed in order to obtain the most representative conformations of the simulated ensemble. This method groups conformations by structural similarity, using the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of the coordinates calculated for all conformer pairs along the trajectory, clustering structures with RMSD ≤ 0.3 nm. This procedure leads to 50 conformers for each protein construct. Each conformer was subsequently rotated 30 times randomly to produce a set of 1500 configurations for the MT calculations.</p>

<title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of VP3 on a lipid bilayer</title>
<p>MARTINI-2.2 was also used to model the lipid molecules in our MD simulations. The bilayer was assembled using insane utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wassenaar et al., 2015</xref>), while hydration with polarizable water molecules and ions was performed with the solvate utility of the GROMACS package. The bilayer had a symmetric lipid composition of 30% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 65% of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 5% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P), leading to a lipid composition of 111:231:18 (DOPC, DOPE, and PI3P) in each leaflet. The protein was placed at a distance of 10 nm from the membrane surface, to avoid a possible initial binding bias. The system was then equilibrated and finally simulated for 500 ns. Both equilibration and production were in the NPT ensemble. A semi-isotropic Parinello-Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>) with a 12 ps time constant, and lateral and normal compressibilities of 3×10<sup>−4</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup> were used to keep the pressure at 1.0 bar.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zanetti et al. use biophysical and cellular assays to investigate the interaction of the birnavirus VP3 protein with the early endosome lipid PI3P. The major novel finding is that the association of the VP3 protein with an anionic lipid (PI3P) appears to be important for viral replication, as evidenced through a cellular assay on FFUs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Supports previously published claims that VP3 may associate with early endosomes and bind to PI3P-containing membranes. The claim that mutating a single residue (R200) critically affects early endosome binding and that the same mutation also inhibits viral replication suggests a very important role for this binding in the viral life cycle.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is relatively narrowly focused: one bimolecular interaction between a host cell lipid and one protein of an unusual avian virus (VP3-PI3P). Aspects of this interaction have been described previously. Additional data would strengthen claims about the specificity and some technical issues should be addressed. Many of the core claims would benefit from additional experimental support to improve consistency.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Birnavirus replication factories form alongside early endosomes (EEs) in the host cell cytoplasm. Previous work from the Delgui lab has shown that the VP3 protein of the birnavirus strain infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) interacts with phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) within the EE membrane (Gimenez et al., 2018, 2020). Here, Zanetti et al. extend this previous work by biochemically mapping the specific determinants within IBDV VP3 that are required for PI3P binding in vitro, and they employ in silico simulations to propose a biophysical model for VP3-PI3P interactions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is generally well-written, and much of the data is rigorous and solid. The results provide deep knowledge into how birnaviruses might nucleate factories in association with EEs. The combination of approaches (biochemical, imaging, and computational) employed to investigate VP3-PI3P interactions is deemed a strength.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Concerns about the sources, sizes, and amounts of recombinant proteins used for co-flotation: Figures 1A, 1B, 1G, and 4A show the results of co-flotation experiments in which recombinant proteins (control His-FYVE v. either full length or mutant His VP3) were either found to be associated with membranes (top) or non-associated (bottom). However, in some experiments, the total amounts of protein in the top + bottom fractions do not appear to be consistent in control v. experimental conditions. For instance, the Figure 4A western blot of His-2xFYVE following co-flotation with PI3P+ membranes shows almost no detectable protein in either top or bottom fractions. Reading the paper, it was difficult to understand which source of protein was used for each experiment (i.e., E. coli or baculovirus-expressed), and this information is contradicted in several places (see lines 358-359 v. 383-384). Also, both the control protein and the His-VP3-FL proteins show up as several bands in the western blots, but they don't appear to be consistent with the sizes of the proteins stated on lines 383-384. For example, line 383 states that His-VP3-FL is ~43 kDa, but the blots show triplet bands that are all below the 35 kDa marker (Figures 1B and 1G). Mass spectrometry information is shown in the supplemental data (describing the different bands for His-VP3-FL) but this is not mentioned in the actual manuscript, causing confusion. Finally, the results appear to differ throughout the paper (see Figures 1B v. 1G and 1A v. 4A).</p>
<p>(2) Possible &quot;other&quot; effects of the R200D mutation on the VP3 protein. The authors performed mutagenesis to identify which residues within patch 2 on VP3 are important for association with PI3P. They found that a VP3 mutant with an engineered R200D change (i) did not associate with PI3P membranes in co-floatation assays, and (ii) did not co-localize with EE markers in transfected cells. Moreover, this mutation resulted in the loss of IBDV viability in reverse genetics studies. The authors interpret these results to indicate that this residue is important for &quot;mediating VP3-PI3P interaction&quot; (line 211) and that this interaction is essential for viral replication. However, it seems possible that this mutation abrogated other aspects of VP3 function (e.g., dimerization or other protein/RNA interactions) aside from or in addition to PI3P binding. Such possibilities are not mentioned by the authors.</p>
<p>(3) Interpretations from computational simulations. The authors performed computational simulations on the VP3 structure to infer how the protein might interact with membranes. Such computational approaches are powerful hypothesis-generating tools. However, additional biochemical evidence beyond what is presented would be required to support the authors' claims that they &quot;unveiled a two-stage modular mechanism&quot; for VP3-PI3P interactions (see lines 55-59). Moreover, given the biochemical data presented for R200D VP3, it was surprising that the authors did not perform computational simulations on this mutant. The inclusion of such an experiment would help tie together the in vitro and in silico data and strengthen the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a birnavirus and an important avian pathogen. Interestingly, IBDV appears to be a unique dsRNA virus that uses early endosomes for RNA replication that is more common for +ssRNA viruses such as for example SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>This work builds on previous studies showing that IBDV VP3 interacts with PIP3 during virus replication. The authors provide further biophysical evidence for the interaction and map the interacting domain on VP3.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Detailed characterization of the interaction between VP3 and PIP3 identified R200D mutation as critical for the interaction. Cryo-EM data show that VP3 leads to membrane deformation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The work does not directly show that the identified R200 residues are directly involved in VP3-early endosome recruitment during infection. The majority of work is done with transfected VP3 protein (or in vitro) and not in virus-infected cells.</p>
<p>Additional controls such as the use of PIP3 antagonizing drugs in infected cells together with a colocalization study of VP3 with early endosomes would strengthen the study.</p>
<p>In addition, it would be advisable to include a control for cryo-EM using liposomes that do not contain PIP3 but are incubated with HIS-VP3-FL. This would allow ruling out any unspecific binding that might not be detected on WB.</p>
<p>The authors also do not propose how their findings could be translated into drug development that could be applied to protect poultry during an outbreak. The title of the manuscript is broad and would improve with rewording so that it captures what the authors achieved.</p>

<p>We focused our efforts on the characterization of the molecular interaction between the birnaviral protein VP3 and the anionic lipid PI3P, which is found in the host cell. This decision was motivated by our previous research, which made use of cell biology and virology techniques to demonstrate that VP3 facilitates the formation of the viral replication machinery on the cytosolic leaflet of early endosomes due to its inherent endosome-targeting capability (J Virol. 2018 May 14;92(11):e01964-17). Additionally, our previous findings indicated that PI3P, present in early endosomal membranes, is a critical host factor enabling VP3's association with these membranes, thereby promoting viral replication (J Virol. 2021 Feb 24;95(6):e02313-20). Consequently, an in-depth characterization of the VP3/PI3P interaction was necessary and motivated the present work. We plan to incorporate specific recommendations to further substantiate our assertions in the revised version of our manuscript.</p>

<p>(1) Concerns about the sources, sizes, and amounts of recombinant proteins used for co-flotation: Figures 1A, 1B, 1G, and 4A show the results of co-flotation experiments in which recombinant proteins (control His-FYVE v. either full length or mutant His VP3) were either found to be associated with membranes (top) or non-associated (bottom). However, in some experiments, the total amounts of protein in the top + bottom fractions do not appear to be consistent in control v. experimental conditions. For instance, the Figure 4A western blot of His-2xFYVE following co-flotation with PI3P+ membranes shows almost no detectable protein in either top or bottom fractions.</p>

<p>Liposome-based methods, such as the co-flotation assay, are well-known and preferred to study protein-phosphoinositide interaction because the phosphoinositides are incorporated in a membrane, the composition of which can mimic cellular membranes. Additionally, by modifying the phosphoinositide incorporated in the liposomes, this technique allows for determining the specificity of the protein binding. However, this approach is rather qualitative, meaning that, after density gradient separation, the protein is found in the top fractions (bound to liposomes) or in the bottom fractions (not bound to liposomes), and our quantifications have the aim of showing the difference in the bound fraction between liposome populations with or without PI3P. Given the setting of the co-flotation assays, each protein-liposome system [2xFYVE-PI3P(-), 2xFYVE-PI3P(+), VP3-PI3P(-), or VP3-PI3P(+)] is assessed separately, and even if the conditions are homogeneous, it’s not surprising to observe differences in the protein level between each one. Indeed, our revised version of the manuscript will include membranes with more similar band intensities.</p>

<p>Reading the paper, it was difficult to understand which source of protein was used for each experiment (i.e., E. coli or baculovirus-expressed), and this information is contradicted in several places (see lines 358-359 v. 383-384). Also, both the control protein and the His-VP3-FL proteins show up as several bands in the western blots, but they don't appear to be consistent with the sizes of the proteins stated on lines 383-384. For example, line 383 states that His-VP3-FL is ~43 kDa, but the blots show triplet bands that are all below the 35 kDa marker (Figures 1B and 1G). Mass spectrometry information is shown in the supplemental data (describing the different bands for His-VP3-FL) but this is not mentioned in the actual manuscript, causing confusion. Finally, the results appear to differ throughout the paper (see Figures 1B v. 1G and 1A v. 4A).</p>

<p>We used two sources of recombinant VP3: baculovirus and Escherichia coli. Initially, we opted for the baculovirus system based on evidence from previous studies that it was suitable for ectopic expression of VP3. Subsequently, we successfully produced VP3 using Escherichia coli and chose to transition to this system due to several technical advantages. Moreover, mass spectrometry analysis did not reveal any post-translational modifications that may have favored retaining the baculoviral system. We confirmed that VP3, produced in either system, exhibited similar behavior in our co-flotation assays. We will clarify all this in the revised version of our manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) Possible &quot;other&quot; effects of the R200D mutation on the VP3 protein. The authors performed mutagenesis to identify which residues within patch 2 on VP3 are important for association with PI3P. They found that a VP3 mutant with an engineered R200D change (i) did not associate with PI3P membranes in co-floatation assays, and (ii) did not co-localize with EE markers in transfected cells. Moreover, this mutation resulted in the loss of IBDV viability in reverse genetics studies. The authors interpret these results to indicate that this residue is important for &quot;mediating VP3-PI3P interaction&quot; (line 211) and that this interaction is essential for viral replication. However, it seems possible that this mutation abrogated other aspects of VP3 function (e.g., dimerization or other protein/RNA interactions) aside from or in addition to PI3P binding. Such possibilities are not mentioned by the authors.</p>

<p>The arginine amino acid at position 200 of VP3 is not located in any of the protein regions associated with its other known functions. VP3 has a dimerization domain located in the second helical domain,  where different amino acids across the three helices form a total of 81 interprotomeric close contacts; however, R200 is not involved in these contacts (Structure. 2008 Jan;16(1):29-37). VP3 also has an oligomerization domain mapped within the 42 C-terminal residues of the polypeptide, i.e., the segment of the protein composed by the residues at positions 216-257 (J Virol. 2003 Jun;77(11):6438–6449). Regarding VP3’s ability to bind RNA, it is facilitated by a region of positively charged amino acids, identified as P1, which includes K99, R102, K105, and K106 (PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e45957). Furthermore, our findings indicate that the R200D mutant retains a folding pattern similar to the wild-type protein, as shown in Figure 4B. All these lead us to conclude that the loss of replication capacity of R200D viruses results from impaired, or even lost, VP3-PI3P interaction.</p>

<p>(3) Interpretations from computational simulations. The authors performed computational simulations on the VP3 structure to infer how the protein might interact with membranes. Such computational approaches are powerful hypothesis-generating tools. However, additional biochemical evidence beyond what is presented would be required to support the authors' claims that they &quot;unveiled a two-stage modular mechanism&quot; for VP3-PI3P interactions (see lines 55-59). Moreover, given the biochemical data presented for R200D VP3, it was surprising that the authors did not perform computational simulations on this mutant. The inclusion of such an experiment would help tie together the in vitro and in silico data and strengthen the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that the language used may have overstated the &quot;unveiling&quot; of the two-stage binding mechanism for VP3 on membranes containing PI3P. We intended to propose, rather than confirm, this mechanism, largely based on our coarse-grained simulations. Accordingly, we will revise the manuscript to temper our claims and frame them more appropriately. Regarding the absence of computer simulations for the R200D VP3 mutant, these were indeed conducted, and the results are detailed in Figure 14 of the supplementary material. We realize this was not adequately emphasized in the main manuscript, an oversight we will correct in the revised version.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a birnavirus and an important avian pathogen. Interestingly, IBDV appears to be a unique dsRNA virus that uses early endosomes for RNA replication that is more common for +ssRNA viruses such as for example SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>This work builds on previous studies showing that IBDV VP3 interacts with PIP3 during virus replication. The authors provide further biophysical evidence for the interaction and map the interacting domain on VP3.</p>
<p>Strengths:
Detailed characterization of the interaction between VP3 and PIP3 identified R200D mutation as critical for the interaction. Cryo-EM data show that VP3 leads to membrane deformation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The work does not directly show that the identified R200 residues are directly involved in VP3-early endosome recruitment during infection. The majority of work is done with transfected VP3 protein (or in vitro) and not in virus-infected cells. Additional controls such as the use of PIP3 antagonizing drugs in infected cells together with a colocalization study of VP3 with early endosomes would strengthen the study.
In addition, it would be advisable to include a control for cryo-EM using liposomes that do not contain PIP3 but are incubated with HIS-VP3-FL. This would allow ruling out any unspecific binding that might not be detected on WB.</p>
<p>The authors also do not propose how their findings could be translated into drug development that could be applied to protect poultry during an outbreak. The title of the manuscript is broad and would improve with rewording so that it captures what the authors achieved.</p>

<p>In previous works from our group, we demonstrated the crucial role of the VP3 P2 region in targeting the early endosomal membranes and for viral replication, including the use of PI3K inhibitors to deplete PI3P, showing that both the control RFP-2xFYVE and VP3 lost their ability to associate with the early endosomal membranes (J Virol. 2018 May 14;92(11):e01964-17; J Virol. 2021 Feb 24;95(6):e02313-20). In the present work, to further characterize the role of R200 in binding to early endosomes and for viral replication, we show that: i) the transfected VP3 R200D protein loses the ability to bind to early endosomes in immunofluorescence assays (Figure 2E and Figure 3); ii) the recombinant VP3 R200D protein loses the ability to bind to liposomes PI3P(+) in co-flotation assays (Figure 4A); and, iii) the mutant virus R200D loses replication capacity (Figure 4C).</p>
<p>Regarding the cryo-EM comment: we will include images where we used liposomes PIP3(-) in the revised version of our manuscript.</p>
<p>We will also modify the title of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of how our findings could be translated into drug development, indeed, VP3-PI3P binding constitutes a good target for drugs that counteract infectious bursal disease. However, we did not mention this idea in the manuscript, first because it is somewhat speculative and second because infected farms do not implement any specific treatment. The control is based on vaccination. We will mention these aspects of the infection in the revised version of our manuscript.</p>
