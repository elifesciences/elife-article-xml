<title>Abstract</title><p>Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (HIRI) is a common and inevitable factor leading to poor prognosis in various liver diseases, making the outcomes of current treatments in clinic unsatisfactory. Metformin has been demonstrated to be beneficial to alleviate HIRI in recent studies, however, the underpinning mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we found metformin mitigates HIRI-induced ferroptosis through reshaped gut microbiota in mice, which was confirmed by the results of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) treatment but showed the elimination of the beneficial effects when gut bacteria were depleted using antibiotics. Detailedly, through 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing, we identified that the metformin-reshaped microbiota was characterized by the increase of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) producing bacteria. This increase was further confirmed by the elevation of GABA synthesis key enzymes, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and putrescine aminotransferase (PAT), in gut microbes of metformin-treated mice and healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the benefit of GABA against HIRI-induced ferroptosis was demonstrated in GABA-treated mice. Collectively, our data indicate that metformin can mitigate HIRI-induced ferroptosis by reshaped gut microbiota, with GABA identified as a key metabolite.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (HIRI) remains a major cause of liver damage mainly following liver transplantation, complicated hepatectomy, haemorrhagic shock and severe liver trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Traditional therapeutics have been developed and repurposed to treat HIRI, including ischemic preconditioning, machine perfusion technologies, gene interventions, and stem cell therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Unfortunately, current treatments are not satisfactory due to the complicated pathogenesis of HIRI. Recently, a novel theory relating to the gut-liver axis has been well accepted, demonstrating that gut microbiota is vital for liver diseases, however, there is no strategy targeted this theory to alleviate HIRI in clinical practice.</p>
<p>The liver links with the intestine by portal circulation which allows the transfer of gut-derived products, not only nutrients, but also microbial metabolites and components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> As an important part of the gut-liver communication, the intestinal mucosal and vascular barriers limit the systemic dissemination of microbes and toxins while allowing nutrients to access the circulation and reaching the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Additionally, it is generally believed that liver injury can provoke intestinal mucosal damage and inflammation, further resulting in gut dysbiosis, which reversely induces a secondary attack on the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Microbial agents, such as synbiotics and probiotics, have demonstrated to attenuate different liver diseases in animal studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> indicating that modulating gut microbes potentially prevents HIRI in clinical practice.</p>
<p>Recently, the hypoglycaemic drug, metformin, has attracted intensive attention in its pleiotropic biological actions in various diseases, such as obesity, cancer, nuroinflammation, especially liver diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> As evidences shown, the gut with high concentration of metformin become an important action site to reshape microbiota.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> According to <italic>Sun et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> metformin was proven to decrease the abundance of the <italic>B. fragilis</italic> species and to increase the levels of bile acid and glycoursodeoxycholic acid in the gut, which inhibited intestinal farnesoid X receptor against obesity-related metabolic dysfunction in mice. Moreover, it is also demonstrated that metformin could attenuate sepsis-related liver injury by increasing the proportion of <italic>Bifidobacterium, Muribaculaceae, Parabacteroides distasonis,</italic> and <italic>Alloprevitella</italic> in rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> As for the HIRI, metformin has also shown the protective effect,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> but the detailed role of gut microbiota remains unclear.</p>
<p>Although metformin showed protective effects on HIRI, the role and distinctions of reshaping microbes have yet to be determined. In the present study, we sought to elucidate that gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing bacteria played a critical role for the protective effects of metformin against HIRI by using 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing to find the different features of gut microbiota. The finding was reconfirmed by the results of mice that were treated with metformin-reshaped fecal microbiota or oral antibiotics administration. Furthermore, GABA was found to show a protective effect on HIRI by intraperitoneally injection into mice in advance, while an increase of microbial GABA was observed in both mice and human experiments after metformin treatment. Evidenced by the improvement of HIRI, we hypothesize that metformin-reshaped gut microbiota elicits greater therapeutic responses for liver diseases and serve as a promising targeted therapeutic.</p>

<title>Metformin significantly mitigates HIRI and reshapes gut microbiota in mice</title>
<p>In order to evaluate the protective effect of metformin on HIRI, survival experiment was employed in mice. The survival rate of HIRI mice increased from 41.67% to 90.00% after metformin intervention (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), accompanied by hepatic morphological and histopathological improvement including the recovery of liver pathological structure, the decrease in red blood cell aggregation and consumption of liver glycogen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), as well as the decrease in serum activity of ALT and AST (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Qualification of MDA and GSH concentrations in the mice liver demonstrated that the presence of metformin significantly attenuated HIRI-induced oxidation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to clarify the critical role of gut microbiota in the pleiotropic actions of metformin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> fecal samples were collected from the mice to perform 16S rRNA sequencing. It was found that the gut microbiota was substantially modulated in IR + metformin (Met) group, showing decreased abundance (alpha diversity) and reshaped distribution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Next, as the microbiota-gut-liver axis theory indicates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> HIRI-induced dysfunction of the gut barrier may aggravate liver damage by disrupting the gut microbiota. H&amp;E staining of the colon and ileum, mainly involved in gut barrier dysfunction, showed that the density and integrity of intestinal mucosa were strikingly reduced by HIRI, which was restored by metformin treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). The immunofluorescence analysis of colon tissues showed that the decreased tight junction protein ZO-1 and Occludin in HIRI-treated mice were reversed by metformin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). Similarly, western blot analysis of Occludin in colon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>) and the mRNA levels of <italic>Ocln, Tjp1, Cldn7, F11r</italic> and <italic>Igsf5</italic> in ileum of HIRI mice were increased with metformin administration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>). The inflammatory cytokine <italic>Il6, Il1b</italic> and <italic>Il18</italic> were significantly upregulated in the ileum and colon received HIRI and were reduced by metformin treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>). In addition, the serum FD-4 level in IR group was cut down by metformin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k</xref>). These results suggested that metformin plays a critical role in restoring gut barrier function and alleviating HIRI.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Metformin-reshaped fecal microbiota attenuates HIRI</title>
<p>In order to further confirm the role of metformin in reshaping the gut microbiota, microbes were transplanted into mice before inducing ischemia reperfusion (IR). As expected, the survival analysis of mice in the IR + fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) group showed a similarly protective efficacy as the IR + Met group, as indicated by the significantly improved survival rate of IR mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). This finding was validated by ALT and AST levels as well as H&amp;E, PAS and DHE staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). FMT treatment could restore the GSH level but reduce the accumulation of MDA in hepatic tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Furthermore, a decreased alpha diversity was observed in the FMT group, similar to IR + Met group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Meanwhile, the attenuation of gut damage was showed by H&amp;E staining, and the improvement in tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin, and decreased HIRI-induced <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, and <italic>Il18</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). Serum FD-4 level showed a sharply decrease in IR + FMT group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j</xref>). To further identify the function of gut microbes, experiments were designed, and combination treatment of antibiotics (1 mg/mL penicillin sulfate, 1 mg/mL neomycin sulfate, 1 mg/mL metronidazole and 0.16 mg/mL gentamicin) and metformin were employed for 1 week before IR treated. As results showed, the ALT, AST and MDA detection in control group treated with Abx showed no obvious change to control group, indicating that the Abx had no influence on the liver. The survival rate of IR + Met + antibiotics (Abx) group was greatly reduced, while the levels of ALT, AST, MAD and GSH were completely opposite to IR + Met group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2k</xref>). The results confirmed that gut microbiota is critical for the effect of metformin against HIRI.</p>

<p>Since the reperfusion-induced excessive oxidative stress takes place in iron-rich hepatocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> experiments were designed to observe ferroptosis in HIRI. The ferroptosis inhibitor, DFO, significantly ameliorated the liver injury, suggesting that ferroptosis contributes to HIRI (s<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Hence, to find out the relation, ferroptosis-related indicators were also monitored in both IR + Met and IR + FMT groups. The increased accumulation of Fe after HIRI was significantly cut down by metformin and FMT treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that the HIRI-induced upregulation of ferroptotic parameters, <italic>Acsl4, Slc7a11, Slc39a14</italic> and <italic>Ptgs2,</italic> were significantly decreased by metformin and its reshaped gut microbiota, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). The results of western blotting further confirmed the anti-ferroptosis of metformin and FMT by the remarkable reduction of ACSL4, TFR1, VDAC1, VDAC2 and VDAC3 levels and the apparent increase of antiferroptotic FTH1 and Xct levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>), The results were further consolidated by lipid ROS staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). Additionally, transcriptome data on genes associated with antiferroptosis showed an increase in both IR + Met and IR + FMT groups, whereas proferroptic genes showed a decrease, when compared with IR group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>). Collectively, the results suggested that FMT performed protection against HIRI by inhibiting ferroptosis.</p>

<title>Metformin induces GABA-producing gut microbiota</title>
<p>To elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which pathway participates metformin-treated IR injury, we analysed gene expression profiles of each group mice. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that 9697 genes were in common among four groups (sfig. 6). Therefore, we used these common genes for KEGG analysis, showing that similar mRNA changes are mainly concentrated in the three top pathways: lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid metabolism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>). Given the close relevance between lipid metabolism and ferroptosis (s<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), and the fact of carbohydrate metabolism is a primary way to metabolize amino acids, 22 species of amino acid were detected in liver tissues using HPLC-MS/MS for further identification of key metabolites involved in the role of metformin against HIRI-induced ferroptosis. It was found that only GABA level is significantly increased by metformin treatment and FMT treatment (s<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), further verifying by the data of ELISA detection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Moreover, it was observed that the genus of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> had a significant increase based on the 16s rRNA gene sequencing of metformin-treated mice microbes. qRT-PCR analysis of eukaryotic GABA synthesis key enzymes including <italic>Aldh5a1, Abat, Gad1</italic> and <italic>Gad2</italic> in liver tissues, were not upregulated by metformin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), which was also confirmed by western blotting detection of GAD1 and GAD2 in liver (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Interestingly, the fecal GABA concentration was shown a significant increase in metformin-treated mice, which was copied by the IR + FMT group, but eliminated by antibiotics treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). In order to further identify the increased GABA originates from gut microbiota, two key enzymes of prokaryotes GABA synthesis, GAD and PAT, were detected on DNA level, finding that both of them are significantly increased in the feces from IR+Met and IR+FMT groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g and h</xref>). In order to clarify the specific effects of metformin on microbiota, given the big safety margin, healthy volunteers were recruited for a 1 week of daily oral 500mg dose of metformin trial. Fecal samples were collected before and after oral administration of metformin for metagenomic analysis. Detailedly, the species of Bacteroides containing Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides unifomis, and Bacteroides salyersiae, were enriched in human gut after metformin administration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). Excitingly, the increase of GABA production, and the expression of GAD and PAT were shown in the results of fecal experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, accompanied by the decreased glutamic acid (Glu), a key substrate for gut microbiota to synthesize GABA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j and k</xref>). Besides, putrescine, another substrate of GABA synthesis, was not found in primary culture medium but appeared after 24h fermentation and then was consumption later in the anaerobic culture of human feces experiment. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4l</xref>). Taken collectively, GABA- producing gut microbiota was upregulated by metformin.</p>

<title>GABA is the critical metabolite of metformin-reshaped gut microbiota against HIRI-induced ferroptosis</title>
<p>The animal experiment was designed to further observe the effects of GABA on HIRI-induced ferroptosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). As expected, the data showed that GABA treatment reduced histological damage and liver glycogen consumption (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>).

The results of western blotting showed the anti-ferroptosis effect of GABA treatment by the significant reduction in ACSL4, TFR1, VDAC1,2,3 and increase of anti-ferroptotic FTH1 levels, which had the same attenuating effect as metformin and FMT treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). In addition, the clustergram showed GABA upregulated the genes of antiferroptosis and depressed the proferroptic ones, which was similar to the effect after metformin treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). In summary, GABA treatment reduced HIRI- induced ferroptosis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Metformin has been well researched for treating various liver diseases due to its multifarious effects. Notably, it has been well documented that oral administration of metformin lead to therapeutic effects on HIRI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> leaving a thought-provoking question in its underlying mechanism. In the current study, the changes in the gut microbiota altered by metformin are demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for conferring liver injury protection. Moreover, it has been confirmed that metformin attenuated HIRI by the increased GABA from reshaped gut microbiota, through anti-ferroptosis.</p>
<p>Increasing evidence shows that the gut microbiota is critical for the pleiotropic actions of metformin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Interestingly, metformin was previously found to have a much higher concentration in the gut lumen than other organs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> as also confirmed by the current study. In fact, that concentration favoured the action of metformin on reshaping gut microbes. Despite the distinct heterogeneity of metformin-reshaped gut microbiota in recent research, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> with a high abundance of gut microbes was reported to be reduced after metformin treatment in studies of hyperlipidemia and diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> which other studies vary from for the different action of this bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> In our study, we used a disease model of HIRI, which may have unique characteristics compared to other disease models. It is possible that the specific disease model influenced the response of the gut microbiota. Additionally, the starting microbiota of the recipients and the characteristics of the donor microbiota used for FMT could also play a role in the disparity. Our findings showed an increase abundance of the genus of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> after metformin treatment supported by the data of mice and healthy volunteers. Detailedly, the increased <italic>Bacteroides</italic> especially <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides unifomis,</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides salyersiae</italic> were observed in the human gut after metformin administration. The enriched <italic>Bacteroides theaiotaomicron,</italic> a glutamate-fermenting commensal, was reported to be decreased in obese individuals and was inversely correlated with serum glutamate concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Therefore, <italic>Bacteroides theaiotaomicron</italic> might be the potential bacterium regulating of GABA production. Little research has been done on <italic>Bacteroides unifomis</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides salyersiae</italic>, needing a further exploration of their characteristics in the future. Notably, <italic>Phascolarctobacterium</italic>, coexistly with <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron,</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> was reported as an emerging probiotic which showed a significant increase in our study. Taken collectively, those reshaped bacteria after metformin treatment may be responsible for attenuating HIRI.</p>
<p>Increased GABA was shown from the metformin reshaped gut microbiota for the first time, verified by our results of feces from mice and humans. As the critical metabolite of bacteria against acid stress, GABA was extensively produced by gut microbes, especially the species with strong capacity of acid resistance. Interestingly, our analysis of the sequences in PUBMED Gene bank found that those three species of <italic>Bacteroides, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides unifomis, and Bacteroides salyersiae,</italic> which belong to metformin reshaped microbiota, contain the key enzyme genes of GABA synthesis GAD and PAT (s<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), further confirmed by the qRT-PCR result of human fecal DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment. Specifically, the species with the strong ability of producing GABA such as <italic>Bacteroides theaiotaomicron, Bacteroides unifomis and Bacteroides salyersiae</italic> were increased in metformin-treated volunteers. Some studies were published to elucidate the mechanism of metformin regulating bile acids and folate metabolite by reshaped gut microbiota, however, there is no report about how metformin to affect GABA synthesis of gut microbes. The data from anaerobic cultured human feces showed that metformin promoted the increase of GAD and PAT, and GABA level along with the substrate consumption of glutamate and putrescine in a time-dependent manner.</p>
<p>GABA production was reported to be critical against acid stress for microbiota to survive and preserve metabolic activity, especially in the human gut with a lower pH than other animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> Humans benefit from bacteria-derived GABA. Peripheral GABA was first demonstrated in intestinal flora in 1981 and further confirmed by recent studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> In addition to the important role in the central neural system and immune system, GABA showed a protective effect in different acute liver injury models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> Published papers have shown that GABA performs beneficial effect through binding to the GABA receptors or promoting histone acetylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Our data from GABA-treated mice showed protective effects against HIRI-induced ferroptosis. However, further studies are required to examine the exact molecular mechanisms of GABA regulating ferroptosis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated metformin-reshaped gut microbiota performs therapeutic responses for HIRI. Gut microbiota has been obviously modified while receiving oral metformin treatment, suggesting that metformin-reshaped gut microbiota has enhanced intestinal mucosal function so that reduce harmful substances to the liver, which most efficiently evade damage. Specifically, GABA producing bacteria were significantly regulated after metformin administration. Demonstrated for the first time, we showed that the increased GABA is a key metabolite of gut microbiota for metformin to mitigate HIRI. These results offer a unique therapeutic strategy, with optimized gut microbiota, that can serve as a target for metformin treating liver diseases.</p>

<p>Many drugs have off-target effects on the gut microbiota but the downstream consequences for drug efficacy and side effect profiles remain unclear. Herein, Wang et al. use a mouse model of liver injury coupled to antibiotic and microbiota transplantation experiments. Their results suggest that metformin-induced shifts in gut microbial community structure and metabolite levels may contribute to drug efficacy. This study provides valuable mechanistic insights that could be dissected further in future studies, including efforts to identify which specific bacterial species, genes, and metabolites play a causal role in drug response. Importantly, although some pilot data from human subjects is shown, the clinical relevance of these findings for liver disease remain to be determined.</p>

<p>The authors examine the use of metformin in the treatment of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (HIRI) and suggest the mechanism of action is mediated in part by the gut microbiota and changes in hepatic ferroptosis. The concept is intriguing and their results have potential to better understand the pleiotropic functions of metformin. The histological and imaging studies were considered a strength and reveal a significant impact of metformin post-HIRI. The connections with GABA producing bacteria adds to our understanding of the chemical signals exchanged between the host and microbiota. While the authors have characterized these connections in mice, how/if these observations translate to humans remains to be determined.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Many of my specific issues have been addressed in the revision. However, the data shown in Reviewer Fig. 1 and 2 is not sufficiently described to assess it's reliability and these new data do not appear to have been integrated into the paper. A response that more clearly states how the manuscript has been revised to address the comments is necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the opportunity to respond to your updated comments on our manuscript. We carefully considered the feedback and made changes to address the specific issues raised.</p>
<p>In response to your question of insufficient description of the data shown in Reviewer Fig. 1 and 2, we would like to confirm that we have taken this feedback seriously. Supplementary data, including the information provided in Reviewer Figures 1 and 2, have been fully described and integrated into the body of the manuscript according to your request. We ensured that the reliability and significance of new data were clearly presented to enhance the overall synthesis of the manuscript.</p>
<p>We are grateful to your valuable feedback, which undoubtedly contributed to the refinement of our manuscript. We hope that the revised version meets the standards of the journal and look forward to the opportunity for further deliberation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Additional feedback from the reviewer:</p>
<p>&quot;I think the authors have been responsive to my previous comments. However, I cannot find this new data in the main text but rather only in the response to reviewers. New data should be incorporated into the main text not the supplement as the controls are important to consider alongside the treatment groups. Lastly, while the authors include BODIPY in their approaches, their results are not quantitative. My suggestion was to include this data in a quantitative manner not just the images. Lastly, I am still somewhat puzzled about the connection with GABA. The rationale for its selection other than it was significantly changed is not strong.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for providing us with the latest feedback. We appreciate the opportunity to address the specific concerns raised and provide a detailed response to each point.</p>
<p>(1) Incorporation of New Data into the Main Text:</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer's comment regarding the incorporation of new data into the main text rather than solely in the response to reviewers. In response to this feedback, we have diligently revised the manuscript to ensure that the new data, including controls, is now seamlessly integrated into the main body of the text. This modification allows for a more comprehensive and contextual presentation of the data, as recommended by the reviewer.</p>
<p>(2) Quantitative Presentation of BODIPY Results:</p>
<p>We understand the importance of presenting quantitative data for the BODIPY results, and we appreciate the reviewer's suggestion to include this information in a quantitative manner, not just as images. In line with this valuable feedback, we have revised the relevant sections to incorporate quantitative data alongside the images, providing a more robust and comprehensive presentation of the results.</p>
<p>(3) Rationale for the Selection of GABA:</p>
<p>In the present study, in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which pathway participates metformin-treated IR injury, we analysed gene expression profiles of each group mice, showing that similar mRNA changes are mainly concentrated in the three top pathways: lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Given the close relevance between lipid metabolism and ferroptosis, and the fact of carbohydrate metabolism is a primary way to metabolize amino acids, 22 species of amino acid were detected in liver tissues using HPLC-MS/MS for further identification of key metabolites involved in the role of metformin against HIRI-induced ferroptosis. It was found that only GABA level is significantly increased by metformin treatment and FMT treatment, further verifying by the data of ELISA detection. Consequently, we identified GABA was the main metabolism of metformin protecting from HIRI and focus on the source of GABA generation.</p>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude to your thorough evaluation and constructive feedback, which has undoubtedly contributed to the improvement of our manuscript.</p>
