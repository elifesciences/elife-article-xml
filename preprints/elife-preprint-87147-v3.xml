<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Homeodomain transcription factors (HD TFs) play a fundamental role in vertebrate development. Members of the HD TF family are characterized by the presence of a highly conserved 60 amino acid helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain known as the homeodomain (HD). The HD is one of the most studied eukaryotic DNA-binding motifs since its discovery in <italic>Drosophila</italic> homeotic transformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Hundreds of HD TFs have subsequently been documented in regulating gene expression programs important for body plan specification, pattern formation and cell fate determination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Mutations in HD TFs have been linked to many human diseases, including neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Although significant progress has been made in understanding HD-DNA interactions, uncovering the pathogenetic mechanisms of disease-causing missense mutations in HD have proven challenging.</p>
<p>The retina has long been used as a model system to study the role of HD TFs in normal central nervous system (CNS) development and in neurological diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. During retinogenesis, HD TFs play essential roles in the patterning of neuroepithelium, specification of retinal progenitors and differentiation of all retinal cell classes that derive from a common progenitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Importantly, many HD TFs are shared between the brain and the retina during development and mutations in these TFs can lead to disease manifestation in both tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The accessibility and wealth of available molecular tools makes the retina a valuable tool to decipher the pathogenic mechanisms of HD TF mutations associated with neurological diseases.</p>
<p>Here, we study CRX, a HD TF essential for photoreceptor cells in the retina, as a model to understand how single amino acid substitutions in the HD impact TF functions and cause blinding diseases. Photoreceptors are the most numerous neurons in the retina and are specialized to sense light and initiate vision through a process called phototransduction. Animal studies have demonstrated that <italic>Crx</italic> is first expressed in post-mitotic photoreceptor precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and maintained throughout life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Loss of CRX results in impaired photoreceptor gene expression, failure of maturation and rapid degeneration of immature, non-functional photoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Protein-coding sequence variants in human <italic>CRX</italic> have been associated with inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) that affect photoreceptors: Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), cone-rod dystrophy (CoRD), and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (OMIM:602225). However, the recessive phenotype observed in <italic>Crx</italic> knockout mouse models fails to recapitulate many dominant human <italic>CRX</italic> mutations that arise <italic>de novo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>CRX contains two functional domains – the N-terminal HD and C-terminal activation domain (AD) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), both are required for proper activation of target genes and maintenance of normal <italic>Crx</italic> mRNA transcript abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. To understand how CRX HD mutations cause diseases, we have previously reported a mutation knock-in mouse model carrying a hypomorphic mutation <italic>p.R90W</italic> (R90W) in CRX HD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. We found that R90W mutation produces a recessive loss-of-function phenotype very similar to that of <italic>Crx</italic> knockout mice.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, several missense mutations within the same HD recognition helix as R90W, including <italic>p.E80A</italic> (E80A) and <italic>p.K88N</italic> (K88N), are linked to severe dominant IRDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Here, we utilized a multi-omics approach to investigate the functional consequences of the E80A and K88N mutations on CRX regulatory activities and photoreceptor development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>). Comparison of the <italic>in vitro</italic> HD-DNA binding models of CRX and disease variants generated by Spec-seq revealed unique specificity changes of each mutant protein. Introduction of each mutation into the endogenous <italic>Crx</italic> locus generated knock-in mouse models <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> and <italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic> that reproduced dCoRD- and dLCA-like phenotypes. ChIP-seq analysis of CRX binding <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed mutation-specific changes in CRX targetome, consistent with mutation-specific DNA binding changes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Retinal RNA-seq analysis uncovered two distinct mechanisms by which the two HD missense mutations contribute to altered gene expression programs during photoreceptor differentiation and maturation. Our results highlight the importance of residues E80 and K88 in CRX-mediated transcriptional regulation during photoreceptor development and the diverse mechanisms by which HD missense mutations can affect TF functions and lead to severe dominant neurological diseases.</p>

<title>K88N but not E80A mutation alters CRX HD DNA-binding specificity <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>CRX belongs to the <italic>paired</italic>-like HD TF family that recognize a 6-bp DNA motif in a stereotypic way<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Extensive studies of the HD have revealed a canonical HD-DNA recognition model where recognition of the 3’ region (bases 4-6) of the HD DNA binding site is mediated by specificity determinants within the conserved HD recognition helix, corresponding to CRX residues 80-96<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In particular, HD residue 50, equivalent to CRX K88 residue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), is the major specificity determinant in <italic>paired</italic>-like HD TF-DNA interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Since the three disease-associated HD missense mutations, E80A, K88N and R90W, are located within the CRX HD recognition helix, we wondered if these mutations change CRX HD DNA-binding specificity.</p>
<p>We adapted a high-throughput <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, Spec-seq, that determines protein-DNA-binding specificity by sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Spec-seq was developed based on the traditional electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to measure protein-DNA interactions. Spec-seq allows us to measure the relative binding affinities (i.e., specificity) for a library of HD binding motifs in parallel and generate quantitative binding models for different CRX HDs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>). Based on the HD-DNA interaction model, we designed and tested a Spec-seq library containing all possible monomeric HD motifs (TAANNN) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>We first obtained the wild-type (WT) CRX HD DNA binding model with Spec-seq using bacterially-expressed and affinity-purified HD peptides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>, Methods). Relative binding energies of CRX WT HD from two experiments showed strong correlation (<italic>r</italic>: 0.984) and noise level (0.114 kT) within the expected range in typical Spec-seq data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Binding energy model of WT HD was then generated by applying multiple linear regressions on the relative binding energies of all sequences within two base-pair mismatches to the WT CRX consensus (TAATCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, Methods). A clear preference for CC bases at the 3’ end of the motif is consistent with known CRX binding preference <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We next sought to understand how disease mutations affect CRX DNA-binding specificity. We purified all mutant HD peptides following the same protocol as WT HD peptides and verified their DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figures S2A-S2D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Comparison of the relative binding energies between each pair of mutant and WT HD revealed distinct effects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1J</xref>). By definition, the consensus DNA binding motif of a testing peptide has a relative binding energy of 0kT. The relative binding energy difference between nucleotide variants and the consensus motif correlates with the DNA binding specificity of the testing peptide. We found that R90W HD and E80A HD both prefer the same consensus motif as WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1K</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1L</xref>). R90W HD bound with slightly higher specificity than WT, as demonstrated by most data points falling above the identity line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1K</xref>), suggesting that R90W HD is more sensitive than WT to binding sequence variations. In contrast, when comparing E80A HD with WT HD, many data points fell below the identity line and the relative binding energies regressed towards 0 on the E80A axis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1I</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1L</xref>). This suggests that E80A HD bound with lower specificity than WT HD and thus was more tolerant to base variations in the HD DNA motif. Different from R90W and E80A, K88N mutation dramatically altered CRX HD DNA-binding specificity (<italic>r</italic>: 0.160) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1J</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1M</xref>). The K88N preferred binding sequence (TAAT/ATT/A) is referred to as N88 HD motif hereafter. K88N HD also had the largest degree of discrimination from its preferred to the weakest binding motif, suggesting that it is most sensitive to variants in the HD DNA motif. As a control, we tested a second library with the TAANNN sites on the reverse strand and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figures S2E-S2L</xref>). Together, these results indicate that while E80A mutation does not affect CRX HD DNA binding specificity, the K88N mutation dramatically alters the specificity <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>E80A protein binds to WT sites while K88N occupies novel genomic regions with N88 HD motifs <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Next, we asked if changes in DNA-binding specificity affected mutant CRX chromatin binding in developing photoreceptors. We first created two human mutation knock-in mouse models, <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> and <italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic>, each carrying a single base substitution at the endogenous <italic>Crx</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figures S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3B</xref>, Methods). We confirmed that <italic>Crx</italic> mRNA was expressed at comparable levels in WT and mutant retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3C</xref>), and the full-length CRX proteins were readily detectable in the nuclear extracts from all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3D</xref>). We then obtained genome-wide binding profiles for each CRX variant by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) on mouse retinas at P14, a time when all retinal cell types are born, photoreceptor specification is completed in <italic>WT</italic> animals, and prior to any observed cell death in other CRX mutants previously characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. To focus on changes specific to each mutant CRX protein, only homozygous animals were used for ChIP-seq profiling.</p>
<p>Unsupervised clustering of all CRX binding sites revealed two major clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Methods). Cluster 1 consisted of canonical WT CRX binding sites that are also occupied by CRX E80A protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Similar to WT CRX, CRX E80A binding <italic>in vivo</italic> was mostly enriched in intronic, followed by intergenic and TSS regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).

<title>E80A and K88N mutations affected the expression of CRX-dependent activated genes in opposite directions in a critical time window of photoreceptor differentiation</title>
<p>To understand how different CRX mutations affected gene expression at canonical and <italic>de novo</italic> binding sites and how these changes impair photoreceptor differentiation, we turned to bulk RNA-seq analysis from the developing retinas at P10. At P10, photoreceptors have started to differentiate, and the expression of many photoreceptor genes undergo exponential increase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. To focus on the most relevant expression changes, we first defined a set of genes that most likely depend on CRX activity nearby for expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A</xref>, Methods). Briefly, we associated each CRX ChIP-seq peak to the nearest gene, filtered only genes with nearby CRX ChIP-seq peaks, and further narrowed the list of genes to those significantly down-regulated in the loss of function mutant <italic>Crx<sup>R90W/W</sup></italic>. Gene ontology (GO) analysis confirmed that this putative CRX-dependent gene set is associated with biological processes related to photoreceptor development and functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4B</xref>). This set of putative CRX-dependent genes also showed developmental dependent gain in expression, consistent with CRX’s primary function as a transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4C</xref>). As a control, CRX-independent genes were constitutively expressed and largely involved in general cellular processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figures S4D-S4F</xref>). Therefore, the CRX-dependent gene set comprises genes important for photoreceptor differentiation and functional maturation and are dependent on CRX for activation. We denote these genes as “CRX-dependent activated genes” (<italic>CRX-DAGs</italic>).</p>
<p>Next, we sought to understand how each mutation affected photoreceptor differentiation. One way of measuring the progression of photoreceptor differentiation is to determine the similarity in <italic>CRX-DAG</italic> expression in a given sample with that of known developmental ages in <italic>WT</italic> control animals. We thus performed sample-wise correlation of <italic>CRX-DAG</italic> expression obtained in our P10 samples with a previously published RNA-seq dataset of normal mouse retinal development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. As expected, our P10 <italic>WT</italic> sample showed strong correlations with all developmental ages in the published <italic>WT</italic> control dataset. A stronger correlation with early ages (P3, P7, P10) and a weaker correlation with later ages (P14, P21) is also an indication of ongoing photoreceptor differentiation at P10. Unlike the <italic>WT</italic> sample, <italic>Crx<sup>E80A/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Crx<sup>E80A/A</sup></italic>samples both showed a stronger correlation with later developmental ages (P14, P21) but a weaker correlation with earlier postnatal ages (P3, P7). Since the <italic>CRX-DAGs</italic> are normally developmentally upregulated, this shift in correlation towards later developmental ages suggested that these genes were prematurely upregulated in the P10 <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> mutant retinas. In contrast, <italic>Crx<sup>K88N/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Crx<sup>K88N/N</sup></italic> samples both showed a weaker correlation with all developmental ages when compared with <italic>WT</italic> samples in our dataset. This suggests that early photoreceptor differentiation was compromised in both <italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic> mutants, consistent with their association with early-onset LCA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Importantly, <italic>Crx<sup>R90W/W</sup></italic>, also associated with LCA-like phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, displayed strong correlation with earlier ages (P3, P7) similar to <italic>WT</italic>, but only showed moderate correlation with later ages (P14, P21). This suggests loss of CRX function at canonical binding sites does not affect the initiation of photoreceptor differentiation, but WT CRX activity at these sites is required to sustain differentiation. Since <italic>CRX-DAG</italic> expression was more severely affected in <italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic> mutants than in <italic>Crx<sup>R90W/W</sup></italic>, the photoreceptor differentiation deficits seen in the <italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic> mutants cannot be explained solely by the loss of regulatory activity at canonical CRX binding sites. Overall, our sample-wise correlation analysis with normal retinal development dataset suggests that E80A and K88N mutations affected the expression CRX-dependent activated genes in opposite directions, implicating novel and distinct pathogenic mechanisms from the loss-of-function R90W mutation.</p>

<title><italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> retinas show up-regulation of rod genes but down-regulation of cone genes, underlying CoRD-like phenotype</title>
<p>Upon closer examination, we noted that not all <italic>CRX-DAGs</italic> were up-regulated in <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of all <italic>CRX-DAGs</italic> using expression changes revealed two major groups (Methods). In aggregate, when compared to <italic>WT</italic>, Group 1 genes were up-regulated in <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> mutants while Group 2 genes were down-regulated. We noted genes indicative of the two photoreceptor subtypes, rods and cones, could partially define the two groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). For example, <italic>Esrrb</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> and <italic>Nrl</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> in Group 1 are important regulators of rod differentiation. Other genes in Group 1 are components of the phototransduction cascade in rods, including <italic>Rcvrn</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, <italic>Rho</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, <italic>Gnat1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, <italic>Pde6g</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, <italic>Abca4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, <italic>Gnb1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, <italic>Rdh12</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, <italic>Cngb1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, <italic>Rp1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Mis-regulations of many of these genes have been associated with diseases that affect rod development, function, and long-term survival. The increased activation of these genes likely underlies the stronger correlation with later developmental ages in <italic>Crx<sup>E80A+/</sup></italic>and <italic>Crx<sup>E80A/A</sup></italic> retinas (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, Group 2 genes, many down-regulated in <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> mutants, were implicated in cone development and functions. For example, <italic>Gnat2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, <italic>Pde6c</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, and <italic>Pde6h</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> all act in the cone phototransduction cascade. Mis-regulation of these genes has also been implicated in different retinal dystrophies that primarily affect cone photoreceptors. Comparison of ChIP-seq signal revealed that peaks associated with Group 2 genes showed lower occupancy compared to Group 1 genes in the <italic>Crx<sup>E80A/A</sup></italic> retinas (Mann-Whitney U test <italic>p-value</italic>: 9.51e-07) while no difference was observed in <italic>WT</italic> retinas (Mann-Whitney U test <italic>p-value</italic>: 0.541), suggesting loss of CRX activity likely underlies the down-regulation of Group 2 genes in the <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5A</xref>). Collectively, the selective down-regulation of cone genes in Group 2 may explain the CoRD-like phenotype in adult <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic>mutant mice described later.</p>
<p>Additionally, we noticed that a subset of genes not affected in <italic>Crx<sup>R90W/W</sup></italic>(CRX-independent genes) were also down-regulated in <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figures S5B-S5D</xref>). Among these genes were transcription regulators important for early photoreceptor development, such as <italic>Ascl1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, <italic>Rax</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, <italic>Sall3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, and <italic>Pias3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. The down-regulation of these factors coincided with the up-regulation of mature rod genes in P10 <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> retinas, suggesting that the E80A mutation might hamper the proper timing of photoreceptor differentiation.</p>

<title><italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic> retinas display greater reduction of rod and cone genes than the loss-of-function mutants</title>
<p><italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic> retinas had the most severe gene expression changes among all mutants with down-regulation of both Group 1 (rod) and Group 2 (cone) genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).

Given the normal phenotype of heterozygous loss-of-function mutants - <italic>Crx<sup>+/-</sup></italic>and <italic>Crx<sup>R90W/+</sup></italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, these results suggest that mutant CRX K88N not only failed to activate WT target genes, but also functionally antagonized WT CRX regulatory activity in differentiating photoreceptors.

In the absence of WT CRX, <italic>Crx<sup>K88N/N</sup></italic> retina displayed a more severe expression reduction of <italic>CRX-DAG</italic> than <italic>Crx<sup>R90W/W</sup></italic>, raising the possibility that CRX K88N also antagonized the activity of other transcriptional regulators important for photoreceptor differentiation. Supporting this possibility, a set of CRX-independent genes were also mis-regulated in both heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic> mutants. We noted that a number of these down-regulated genes are also involved in photoreceptor functional development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figures S5B, S5E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5F</xref>). Overall, CRX K88N is associated with greater gene expression changes than other CRX HD mutants, which is likely attributed to ectopic regulatory activity.</p>

<p>Since <italic>Crx<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Crx<sup>R90W/+</sup></italic> mutant mouse models showed a late-time recovery in photoreceptor gene expression and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, we sought to determine the degree of photoreceptor differentiation in <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> and <italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic> mutants at P21.

<p>To assess retinal morphology and photoreceptor subtype-specific gene expression at the cellular level, we performed immunohistochemistry analysis on P21 retinal sections. In <italic>WT</italic> animals, a hallmark of photoreceptor maturation is the outgrowth of photoreceptor outer segments (OS) filled with proteins necessary for the phototransduction. We thus performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining on P21 sagittal retinal sections to visualize changes in retinal layer organization, focusing on photoreceptor layers – outer nuclear layer (ONL) and OS. Compared to the well-organized ONL in <italic>WT</italic> retinas (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), all mutants showed variable degrees of ONL disorganization, forming waves, whorls, and rosettes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). The ONL disorganization was more severe in homozygotes than in heterozygotes for both mutations and <italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic>mutants were more severely affected than <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> mutants.

<p>Next, we sought to determine the expression of the rod-specific visual pigment rhodopsin (RHO) and cone arrestin (mCAR) in the P21 mouse retinas. In <italic>WT</italic> retinas, RHO is trafficked to the rod OS while mCAR is present in the cone OS and IS (inner segment), cell body, and synaptic terminals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Unlike <italic>WT</italic> retina, all mutants lacked mCAR immunoreactivity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5G</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5J</xref>), consistent with the loss of cone gene expression shown by RNAseq (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In <italic>Crx<sup>E80A/+</sup></italic> retinas, RHO staining was localized to the OS layer; in <italic>Crx<sup>E80A/A</sup></italic> and <italic>Crx<sup>K88N/+</sup></italic>retinas, positive RHO staining was observed within the whorls and rosettes; in <italic>Crx<sup>K88N/N</sup></italic> mutant retinas, RHO staining was completely absent. Importantly, we did not observe mis-localized RHO staining in the inner retinal layers (INL) suggesting that the developmental programs of other retinal cell types were not directly affected by E80A or K88N mutation. Overall, abnormalities in the cone/rod gene expression matched the corresponding human disease diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and the phenotypic severity correlated with the degree of mis-regulation of CRX target genes in the corresponding RNAseq dataset. Thus, these results support a model that CRX HD mutation-mediated mis-regulation of gene expression disrupts photoreceptor terminal differentiation and leads to defects in retinal layer organization and OS formation.</p>

To determine the consequences of E80A hyperactivity on photoreceptor differentiation timing, we compared RHO protein expression during early postnatal retinal development using retinal section immunostaining (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6B</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). In <italic>WT</italic> retinas, most rods were born by P3 but had not differentiated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Previous studies showed that RHO proteins were detected by IHC starting around P7 in <italic>WT</italic> retinas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. In comparison, both <italic>Crx<sup>E80A/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Crx<sup>E80A/A</sup></italic> retinas showed positive RHO staining at P3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). RHO<sup>+</sup> cells were largely seen in the outer portion of the ONBL layers in <italic>Crx<sup>E80A/+</sup></italic> retinas, and strikingly spread throughout the large presumptive ONL layers in <italic>Crx<sup>E80A/A</sup></italic> retinas. The detection of RHO protein in P3 <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> mutant retinas indicates that photoreceptor differentiation program was precociously activated. Taken together, our results support a model that <italic>E80A</italic> and <italic>K88N</italic> mutations each perturbs CRX regulatory activity in a unique way, causes photoreceptor differentiation defects, and ultimately leads to distinct dominant disease phenotype that recapitulates human diseases.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Through molecular characterization of mutant proteins, transcriptome, and cellular profiling of developing mutant mouse retinas and ERG testing of adult retinas, we have identified two novel pathogenic mechanisms of CRX HD mutations, E80A and K88N, that are associated with dominant CoRD and dominant LCA in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Distinct from the previously characterized loss-of-function R90W mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, E80A and K88N mutations produce altered CRX proteins with gain of regulatory functions - CRX E80A is associated with increased transcriptional activity and CRX K88N has altered DNA binding specificity. Both CRX E80A and CRX K88N proteins impair photoreceptor gene expression, development and produce structural and functional deficits in knock-in mouse models, recapitulating human diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, both target specificity and regulatory activity precision at the canonical CRX targets are essential for proper photoreceptor development and functional maturation.</p>

</fig>
<p>Although associated with distinct disease phenotypes, the E80A, K88N, and R90W mutations are located very close to each other in the CRX HD recognition helix. Extensive biochemical and structural studies on the HD-DNA complexes afford important insights into how these mutations could affect CRX HD-DNA interactions differently. Most distinctively, CRX K88 residue, at HD50 position, is the major contributor to HD-DNA binding specificity, with lysine making favorable interactions with both guanines in the CRX consensus TAATCC binding site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. It is thus expected that K88N mutation drastically changes CRX DNA binding preference at the 3’ end of the HD motif, reminiscent of previous findings on novel HD DNA-binding specificity using bacterial one-hybrid (B1H) systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Supporting the importance of K88 residue mediated CRX target specificity in regulating photoreceptor development, <italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic>retinas show more severe perturbations in photoreceptor gene expression and development than in loss-of-function mutant <italic>Crx<sup>R90W/W</sup></italic>. <italic>Crx<sup>K88N/+</sup></italic>and <italic>Crx<sup>K88N/N</sup></italic> mice display the most severe photoreceptor morphological deficits observed in any <italic>Crx</italic> mouse models and show absence of visual functions in young adults. Thus, CRX target specificity is critical for photoreceptor development fidelity.</p>
<p>In developing <italic>WT</italic> mouse retinas, the HD motif preferred by HD TFs with a glutamine (Q) at HD50 position encodes quantitatively different activity than the CRX consensus suggesting functional difference between HD binding site variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. It is likely that the severe <italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic> phenotypes are attributed to both diminished activity at canonical CRX motifs and ectopic binding and transcriptional activity at N88 HD motifs. Since a functional copy of WT CRX is retained in <italic>Crx<sup>K88N/+</sup></italic> retinas, the lack of WT activity alone cannot explain the severe developmental deficits. Alternatively, these results suggest involvement of additional regulatory mechanisms: CRX K88N activity at N88 HD motifs might (1) ectopically activate genes whose expression prevents the progression of development or inactivate genes required for development; (2) interfere with other HD TFs that also recognize N88 HD motifs; (3) lead to epigenetic alterations that antagonize normal CRX functions. Many other HD containing TFs are expressed in developing mouse retina, including OTX2, RAX, VSX2, PAX6, SIX3/6, and LHX family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Different from CRX, these HD TFs are essential for gene regulation in retinal progenitor cells and/or in other retinal cell lineages. Alteration of CRX DNA binding specificity could mis-regulate genes originally targeted by these HD TFs and lead to severe perturbations in the retinal gene regulatory networks (GRNs). To date, most studies have focused on CRX activity at cis-regulatory sequences enriched for the WT CRX consensus motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Systematic comparison of regulatory activity at N88 HD motifs and WT consensus in the context of photoreceptor development in both <italic>WT</italic> and mutant retinas would be needed to substantiate the impact of mutant CRX K88N activity at different HD motifs. These experiments will also help clarify the pathogenic mechanisms in the <italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic>models and extend our knowledge of CRX HD mediated regulatory grammar during photoreceptor development.</p>
<p>Different from CRX K88, the E80 and R90 residues, although the most common residues at HD42 and HD52 positions respectively, do not contact DNA directly and thus lacked in-depth investigations in prior studies. CRX R90 residue has been suggested to confer additional stability for the homeodomain fold besides the core residues and make contacts with the DNA backbone through bases in the TAAT core motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Substitution of the basic R90 residue with a bulky, neutral tryptophan (W) potentially reduces overall CRX HD stability which in term reduces CRX HD DNA-binding affinity without affecting its binding preference. The potential reduction in CRX HD-DNA complex stability is in line with our observation that R90W mutation abolishes CRX binding across the genome resulting in global loss of CRX target gene activation. It also explains the association of CRX R90W mutation with recessive loss-of-function LCA phenotypes in human and mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Structural studies suggest that CRX E80 residue plays a role in stabilizing the HD-DNA binding complex through intramolecular interactions with other HD residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, yet functional validations await further experiments. E80A mutation, replacing glutamic acid (E), which is acidic and polar, with alanine (A), which is neutral and non-polar, could render HD-DNA interactions more promiscuous as reflected in overall reduced magnitude of CRX E80A HD specificity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Regulatory sequences of many photoreceptor genes contain both consensus and non-consensus CRX motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. It is likely that the more promiscuous CRX E80A-DNA interaction increases the likelihood of non-consensus CRX HD motifs being bound and activated resulting in overall increased transcriptional output (hyperactivity) as seen both in luciferase assays and in developing <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> mouse retinas. The promiscuous TF-DNA-binding associated hyperactivity phenomenon has also been observed in a dominant disease mouse model harboring a missense mutation in the zinc finger TF Krüppel-like factor-1 (KLF1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Yet, in adult <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> retinas, photoreceptor terminal differentiation is impaired, resulting in disrupted retinal morphology and defective visual functions. Photoreceptor differentiation is programmed via sequential and concerted gene expression programs within a defined time window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. One explanation for adult <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> phenotypes is that CRX E80A hyperactivity precociously activates later stage genes in the absence of proper nuclear context and/or subcellular structures, which in turn negatively impacts early events in photoreceptor differentiation. These observations underscore the importance of precisely tuned CRX-mediated transcriptional activity during photoreceptor development.</p>
<p>Although a global increase in expression is expected in <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> retinas based on the hyperactivity model, a subset of CRX dependent activated genes implicated in cone photoreceptor development and functions is down-regulated in both differentiating and mature mutant retinas. While cones undergo terminal differentiation to develop into cone subtypes – M- or S-cones – in a similar postnatal window as rods, they were born prenatally in mice within an earlier time window than rods. At an early postnatal age, cells expressing RXRγ, a ligand-dependent nuclear hormone receptor normally expressed in developing cones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, were observed in <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> retinas, suggesting cone photoreceptors were born in these mutant retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure S7A</xref>). One model for lack of cone markers in adult <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> retinas is that CRX E80A improperly activates later stage cone genes at a much earlier time window, disrupting cone terminal differentiation. Supporting this model, CRX E80A also hyperactivates the <italic>S-cone opsin</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure S7B</xref>). An alternative model is that cones might be more sensitive to perturbations in CRX activity. It is known that cones depend on a different repertoire of TFs than rods for subtype terminal differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. It is possible that cone TFs respond differently to mutant CRX E80A hyperactivity, leading to the distinct expression changes in <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> mutant retains. It is important to note that different point mutations at CRX E80 residue have been reported in dominant CoRD cases (ClinVar VCV000865803.1, VCV000007416.7, VCV000099599.6), emphasizing the importance of residue CRX E80 in regulating cone photoreceptor development. Since cones only make up a very small portion (3%) of photoreceptors in mouse retinas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>, quantitative characterization of CRX E80A molecular functions in a cone dominant retina warrants further study to understand its selective effect on the cone differentiation program and help elucidate WT CRX regulatory principles in early photoreceptor development.</p>
<p>Given that the spatial structures and HD-DNA contact models of HD proteins are evolutionarily conserved, our study of CRX provides valuable molecular insights for HD mutations implicated in other diseases. For example, <italic>p.E79K</italic> substitution (corresponds to CRX E80) in OTX2 HD is associated with dominant early-onset retinal dystrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>, heterozygous <italic>p.R89G</italic> (corresponds to CRX R90) mutation in OTX2 HD causes severe ocular malformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>, and missense mutations of the CRX K88 and R90 homologous residues in PITX2 HD are associated with dominant Rieger syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. It is likely that these mutations affect HD activity in similar ways as observed in CRX, and the exact disease manifestation is determined by cell-type or tissue specific mechanisms. The retina is readily accessible, and a broad range of molecular tools are available for <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> manipulations. We believe that CRX is an ideal model to study the pathogenic mechanisms of HD mutations and to test therapeutic regimens, which would ultimately benefit the study of HD TFs and their associated diseases in other tissues and organs.</p>
<p>One limitation of this work is that effects of E80A and K88N mutations on CRX HD-DNA interactions have been evaluated at monomeric HD motifs and with homogenous protein species both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further evaluation of WT and mutant CRX binding at dimeric motifs will be desirable, since selected dimeric HD motifs are known to mediate HD TF interactions to ensure gene expression fidelity during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. Relatedly, we also need to address how CRX WT and mutant E80A or K88N proteins interact at HD binding motifs – whether they cooperate or compete with each other, whether these interactions are HD motif sequence-dependent, and how gene expression is impacted by CRX cooperativity or competition. While CRX HD mediates both TF-DNA interactions and protein-protein interactions, evaluation of how E80A and K88N mutations impact CRX interaction with other important photoreceptor TFs and how perturbations in these interactions lead to disease phenotypes warrant further study.</p>
<p>Collectively, our findings support a unifying model in which precise CRX interaction with cis-regulatory sequences is essential for gene expression and functional maturation during photoreceptor development. Disease-associated mutations in CRX have been classified into two main groups – insertion/deletion-derived frameshift mutations in the activation domain (AD) and missense mutations in the homeodomain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Prior biochemical and mouse model studies of the first group have established that AD-truncated mutant proteins abolish CRX transcriptional activity and functionally interfere with the <italic>WT</italic> allele. As a result, the mutant retinas fail to activate or maintain robust cone/rod gene expression, resulting in incomplete photoreceptor differentiation and ultimately rapid degeneration of immature photoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In this study, we demonstrate that missense mutations in the CRX HD, by either a loss- or gain-of-function mechanism, alter CRX target specificity and/or CRX transactivation activity. These biochemical property changes impair CRX-mediated transcriptional regulation <italic>in vivo</italic> and lead to distinct morphological and functional deficits (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>). Despite the difference in molecular mechanisms, both <italic>Crx<sup>E80A</sup></italic> and <italic>Crx<sup>K88N</sup></italic> mouse models develop whorls and rosettes in the ONL by P21, which are not observed in degenerative CRX mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, suggesting distinct pathogenic mechanisms. Future cellular biology studies are needed to understand the formation mechanisms of these unique cellular phenotypes (ONL disorganization) and their impacts on the function and survival of photoreceptors and other retinal cell types over development.</p>
<p>Our study here also emphasizes the importance of tailoring gene therapy regimens to tackle individual pathogenic mechanisms. For instance, while supplementing WT CRX might be sufficient to rescue a hypomorphic/loss-of-function mutant, simultaneous elimination of a gain-of-function <italic>CRX</italic> product would be necessary to rescue dominant mutants, as exemplified in a recent report of allele-specific gene editing to rescue dominant CRX-associated LCA7 phenotypes in a retinal organoid model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. We believe that this principle also applies to other dominant neurological diseases. Additionally, with the refinement of the CRX mechanistic model, when new disease mutations are identified, genetic counsellors can now provide more informed predictions of disease progression and future visual deficits. This information is important for individuals to be psychologically prepared and seek necessary assistance to improve their quality of life.</p>

The validated gRNA and Cas9 protein were then microinjected into the pronuclei of C57Bl/6J-0.5-dpc (days post coitum) zygotes along with the donor DNA, a 190-bp single stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) carrying either the <italic>c.239A&gt;G</italic> substitution for <italic>p.E80A</italic> mutation or the <italic>c.264G&gt;T</italic> substitution for <italic>p.K88N</italic> mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>.

<title>Determination of relative binding affinity with Spec-seq</title>
<p>For a biomolecular interaction between a protein <italic>P</italic> and a particular DNA sequence, <italic>S<sub>i</sub></italic>, the interaction can be diagrammed as:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="526652v4_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>p</italic> · <italic>i<sub>i</sub></italic> refers to the protein-DNA complex. The affinity of the protein <italic>P</italic> to sequence <italic>S<sub>i</sub></italic> is defined as the association constant <italic>K<sub>A</sub></italic>, or its reciprocal, the dissociation constant <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>. The <italic>K<sub>A</sub></italic> of the protein-DNA interaction is determined by measuring the equilibrium concentrations of each reactant and the complex:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="526652v4_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where […] refers to concentrations. As in a typical Spec-seq experiment, thousands of different DNA sequences compete for the same pool of proteins, their relative binding affinities (the ratio of their <italic>K<sub>A</sub></italic>) can be determined by measuring the concentrations of each sequence in the bound and unbound fractions without measuring the free protein concentrations, which is often the most difficult to measure accurately:</p>
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="526652v4_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<p>In a binding reaction involving TF and a library of DNAs, the concentration of bound and unbound species are directly proportional to the number of individual DNA molecules in each fraction which can be obtained directly from sequencing data. With enough counts in each fraction, we can accurately estimate the ratios of concentrations from counts with the relationship:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="526652v4_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>N<sub>U</sub></italic> denotes counts in the unbound fraction and <italic>N<sub>B</sub></italic> denotes counts in the bound fraction. Therefore, the binding affinity of a sequence variant <italic>S<sub>x</sub></italic> relative to the reference sequence <italic>S<sub>ref</sub></italic> can be calculated by:</p>
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="526652v4_eqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<p>The natural logarithms of these ratios are the relative binding free energies in the units of <italic>kcal/mol</italic>. The relative free energy of the reference site for each CRX HD was set to 0.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Zheng et al. examined the disease-causing mechanisms of two missense mutations within the homeodomain (HD) of CRX protein. Both mutations were found in humans and can produce severe dominant retinopathy. The authors investigated the two CRX HD mutants via in vitro DNA-binding assay (Spec-seq), in vivo chromatin-binding assay (ChIP-seq), in vivo expression assay of downstream target genes (RNA-seq), and retinal histological and functional assays. They concluded that p.E80A increased the transactivation activity of CRX and resulted in precocious photoreceptor differentiation, whereas p.K88N significantly changed the binding specificity of CRX and led to defects in photoreceptor differentiation and maintenance. The authors performed a significant amount of analyses. The claims are sufficiently supported by the data. The results not only uncovered the underlying disease-causing mechanisms, but also can significantly improve our understanding of the interaction between HD-TF and DNA during development.</p>

<p>Zheng et al., investigated the molecular and functional mechanisms of two homeodomain missense mutations causing human retinal photoreceptor degeneration diseases in photoreceptor development regulated by the CRX transcription factor. They analyzed the E80A mutation associated with dominant cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) and the K88N mutation associated with dominant Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA). The authors found that E80A CRX binds to the same target DNA sites as WT CRX, but the binding specificity of K88N CRX is altered from that of WT in an in vitro assay. They generated Crx(E80A) and Crx(K88N) KI mice and performed ChIP assay and observed that K88N CRX binds to novel genomic regions from the WT-binding sites, while E80A binds to the WT sites. In addition, using the KI mice, they found that E80A and K88N differently affect the expression of Crx target genes. The authors may want to provide explicit clarification on whether CRX E80A mice exhibit cone development and/or degeneration defects.</p>
<p>This study is well executed with proper and solid methodologies, and the manuscript is clearly written. This study gives us the insights into how single missense CRX mutations lead to different types of human retinal photoreceptor degeneration diseases.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<p>Thank you for sending our revised manuscript for review and the positive editorial comments. On behalf of all authors, I would like to, again, thank the reviewers for their critical reading of our revised manuscript and for providing further suggestions. We have revised the introduction and discussion sections to specifically address the comments made by Reviewer #2. Please see below for detailed explanations.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Overall, the authors have significantly improved the manuscript, but there is still an unclarified point. In response to the inquiry in the initial review on how extent E80A KI mice function as a pathological model of dominant CoRD, the authors add data (Figures S7) and described the sixth section in the discussion. However, the authors mentioned that it is technically too challenging because of a small number of cones. The point is not clear to me, but it is possible to analyze cone differentiation and degeneration by immunostaining at multiple stages even though cone number is small. Cone arrestin and S- and M-opsins become positive at early postnatal stages in the mouse retina. Cone arrestin seems earlier than cone opsins. Cones seem born by detecting RXRg at P0, but are cone arrestin and/or cone opsins expressed in early postnatal E80A/+ retina? If positive, how about an apoptosis marker? If negative, it seems to be a cone development phenotype rather than cone degeneration phenotype. If so, authors should modify the expression to say that the E80A retina underlies CoRD-like phenotype. It seems an overstatement.</p>

<p>We greatly appreciate Reviewer 2’s suggestions on further investigating cone photoreceptor phenotypes in the CRX E80A KI mouse model. All the points raised deserve a comprehensive and in-depth study. However, the focus of the current manuscript is to establish a general framework for understanding different missense mutations in homeodomain TFs beyond CRX. We believe that a separate and dedicated study is more appropriate to detail the quantitative molecular and cellular mechanisms of CRX E80A dysfunction in cone and rod photoreceptors, as stated in the last sentence of discussion section paragraph 6: “… quantitative characterization of CRX E80A molecular functions in a cone dominant retina warrants further study to understand its selective effect on the cone differentiation program and help elucidate WT CRX regulatory principles in early photoreceptor development.”.</p>
<p>Clinical diagnosis of cone-rod dystrophy (CoRD) is largely based on functional deficits of cones and rods. 1-month electroretinogram (ERG) (Figures 5K-M) shows no cone-mediated light responses and reduced rod functions in CrxE80A/+ mouse. These ERG deficits in the CRX E80A KI mouse model are in agreement with CoRD characteristics. Thus, it is reasonable to say that CRX E80A KI retina phenotype resembles CoRD phenotype.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>As a minor comment, in page 8, second section, &quot;Previous studies have demonstrated the CRX is activated shortly after cell cycle exit in retinal progenitor cells fated to be photoreceptor.&quot;, the authors cited refs 66 and 67, which were in 2105 and 2016. However, it was demonstrated in the paper of J. Neurosci.31(46), 16792-807, 2011, Figure 1. The authors need to be scientifically fair to cite the JN 2011 paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to this comment above, the authors cited the JN 2011 paper in a modified sentence of &quot;Animal studies have demonstrated that Crx is first expressed in post-mitotic photoreceptor precursors and maintained throughout life (Refs.13-15)&quot;, moved from the discussion to the introduction. To my knowledge, the JN2011 (new Ref 15) is the first study directly demonstrated that Crx begins to be expressed shortly after cell cycle exit of retinal progenitor cells. Refs. 13 and 14 showed Crx expression in adult stage photoreceptors but did not directly demonstrate the Crx expression in post-mitotic photoreceptor precursors. To be scientifically precise, the references should be cited as &quot;Animal studies have demonstrated that Crx is first expressed in post-mitotic photoreceptor precursors (Ref. 15) and maintained throughout life (Refs.13 and 14)&quot;.”
Thanks to the reviewer for the precise instruction. We have adjusted the reference order as follows:  “Animal studies have demonstrated that Crx is first expressed in post-mitotic photoreceptor precursors13 and maintained throughout life14,15.”, where JN2011 paper is reference 13.</p>
