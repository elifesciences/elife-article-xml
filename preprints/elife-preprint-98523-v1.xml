<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Endosomes have emerged as major signaling hubs where different internalized ligand-receptor complexes are integrated and the outcome of signaling pathways are organized to regulate the strength and specificity of signal transduction events. Ezrin, a major membrane-actin linker that assembles and coordinates macromolecular signaling complexes at membranes, has emerged recently as an important regulator of lysosomal function. Here, we report that endosomal-localized EGFR/Ezrin complex interacts with and triggers the inhibition of the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) in response to EGF stimuli. This is regulated through activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Loss of Ezrin was deficient in TSC repression by EGF and culminated in translocation of TSC to lysosomes triggering suppression of mTORC1 signaling. Overexpression of constitutively active EZRIN<sup>T567D</sup> is sufficient to relocalize TSC to the endosomes and reactivate mTORC1. Our findings identify EZRIN as a critical regulator of autophagy via TSC in response to EGF stimuli and establish the central role of early endosomal signaling in the regulation of mTORC1. Consistently, Medaka fish deficient for Ezrin exhibit defective endo-lysosomal pathway, attributable to the compromised EGFR/AKT signaling, ultimately leading to retinal degeneration. Our data identify a pivotal mechanism of endo-lysosomal signaling involving Ezrin and its associated EGFR/TSC complex, which are essential for retinal function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Endosomes are intracellular membrane-bound organelles that receive, integrate, and transmit a variety of signals to intracellular compartments. Trafficking of receptors, ion channels, lipids, and other effector proteins within the endosomal vesicles provides a mechanism to either sustain intracellular signaling pathways active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Palfy, Remenyi, &amp; Korcsmaros, 2012</xref>) or to downregulate signaling pathways through their degradation in lysosomes. Accordingly, altered endosomal maturation and function play a key role in the pathogenesis of a wide range of human diseases including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, new insights about endosomal signaling and understanding the molecular components restricting signaling activity to specific pathways will uncover new opportunities for pharmacological targeting of such disorders. In the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), endosomes contribute to the diurnal clearance of phagocytosed photoreceptor outer segments (POS) that is required for RPE and photoreceptor health. This process is linked to circadian and light phase and is initiated by the scission from the plasma membrane of phagosomes containing POS, which undergo gradual fusion with endosomes and finally with lysosomes in a coordinated process termed “maturation”. The high demand on lysosomes for the digestion and recycling of phagocytosed POS rather than for the clearance of mitochondria, oxidized proteins, and other cellular components suggests the existence of a signaling pathway that can finely coordinate lysosomal function according to needs that will not upset cellular homeostasis. A long-standing question in the field is how functional diversity within the autophagy pathway is achieved in the RPE in the dark and light phases. Inhibition of endosomal biogenesis, trafficking, and fusion is associated with impairment of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy flux. Implicit in these findings is the idea that endosomes, by carrying signaling molecules, could serve as a signaling hub for the regulated transfer of signals to lysosomes, acting more specifically than diffusion-based signal propagation. However, how endosomes are essential for lysosomal function, and their relevant components regulating this process are still not well defined.</p>
<p>Ezrin, a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) protein family, is mainly localized just beneath the plasma membrane around cellular protrusions and villi. Ezrin acts as a scaffolding platform to cross-link F-actin cytoskeleton with specialized membrane components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kawaguchi &amp; Asano, 2022</xref>) that are implicated in the spatiotemporal dynamics of phagosomes and endosomes. Its association with both F-actin filaments and membrane proteins is finely regulated and requires conformational activation thorough phosphorylation at unique (Y353, Y477, and T567) residues. The central role of Ezrin in regulating trafficking of vesicles has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tamma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, maturation of endosomes and recycling/exocytosis of their components (i.e. α1β-adrenergic receptor, NHE3, and others) require the Ezrin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barroso-Gonzalez, Machado, Garcia-Exposito, &amp; Valenzuela-Fernandez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Stanasila, Abuin, Diviani, &amp; Cotecchia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>). The phosphorylated active Ezrin is observed within early and late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Parameswaran, Enyindah-Asonye, Bagheri, Shah, &amp; Gupta, 2013</xref>). Moreover, through its active and reversible interactions with actin filaments and endosomal proteins, Ezrin organizes signal transduction. Indeed, phosphorylation of the T567 residue of EZRIN leads to its colocalization in a functional complex with NHE1, EGFR, and β1-integrin in human breast tumors, suggesting its crucial role as a scaffold protein of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Antelmi et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, Ezrin also interacts with EGFR at membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Saygideger-Kont et al., 2016</xref>). In mammalian cells, depletion of an Ezrin-interacting protein, Vsp11, delays the delivery of EGFR to endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chirivino et al., 2011</xref>), thus linking the Ezrin protein network with EGFR trafficking via clathrin-coated transport vesicles. However, the mechanisms of Ezrin-EGFR interaction and its function at the endosomal compartments remain largely unexplored. Interestingly, recent findings have shown that PI3K-mediated activation of AKT upon EGF stimulation is mediated by EGFR via an early endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nishimura, Takiguchi, Ito, &amp; Itoh, 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that Ezrin may be required as a protein scaffold for coordinating EGFR/AKT signaling at endosomes. Interestingly, EZR interacts with AKT in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the Y353-phosphorylation of Ezrin is relevant for PI3K-initiated signaling through its interaction with p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gautreau, Poullet, Louvard, &amp; Arpin, 1999</xref>). Notably, the Ezrin-p85 complex optimizes the physiological activation of AKT, supporting a central role of Ezrin in controlling intracellular pathways in response to external cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gautreau et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence has shown that the AKT-mediated Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) phosphorylation is a major mechanism in triggering the activity of the GTPase Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), an essential activator of mTORC1 at lysosomes. We demonstrated recently that Ezrin is a key regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and functions in RPE/retina crosstalk by modulating TFEB nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Naso et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, Ezrin overexpression leads to altered autophagy and an impairment of POS maturation and degradation in RPE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Naso et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is intriguing that Ezrin has been recently observed to be associated with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Poupon, Stewart, Gray, Piper, &amp; Luzio, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, cancer cell proliferation and invasion through an activated Akt/mTOR pathway was linked with activation of Ezrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Krishnan et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, depletion of Ezrin was found to be associated with the repression of the mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wan, Mendoza, Khanna, &amp; Helman, 2005</xref>). Together, these data led us to hypothesize that Ezrin-mediated EGFR endosomal sorting and trafficking could play a central role in mTOR activation on lysosomes.</p>
<p>Here, we identify a previously undocumented function for Ezrin as a platform that is essential for the endosomal signaling network involving EGFR and AKT pathways, which provides an important insight into the spatial inactivation of the TSC complex on endosomal compartments. We show that inactivation of Ezrin is crucial to neutralize EGF-stimulated EGFR endosomal sorting and signaling from the plasma membrane with a reduction of AKT-mediated phosphorylation of TSC, which in turn translocates and inhibits mTORC1 on lysosomes. These results reveal an essential layer of mTOR regulation by Ezrin and EGFR signaling and uncover part of the paradigm of signaling from endosomes to lysosomes to coordinate the lysosomal function in the retina and other tissues. Consistent with a role of the Ezrin/EGFR/TSC axis in lysosomal biogenesis and function, alteration of this molecular network alters autophagy in vivo in Medaka fish, resulting in retinal degeneration. Derangement of this control mechanism may underpin human eye disorders and may be relevant as a therapeutic target to restore normal vision.</p>

<title>Ezrin regulates lysosomal biogenesis</title>
<p>Activated Ezrin represses the autophagy pathway in the RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Naso et al., 2020</xref>), but the mechanism remains undefined. To gain insights into this, we used integrated comparative analysis by unbiased RNA-seq and high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomic studies on Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (EZR<sup>KO</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ognibene et al., 2011</xref>). The comparison of the transcriptomics and proteomics identified 572 commonly regulated genes: 317 and 213 genes are induced and inhibited in both datasets, respectively (Figure supplement 1A). Gene Ontology (GO) and Functional Annotation Clustering analyses were performed on these 530 commonly differentially expressed genes (DEGs), restricting the output Cellular Compartments (CC) terms (Tables supplement 1-3). We found an enriched overlap of these genes in cell compartments, including cell membrane and lysosome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, Figure supplement 1A and supplement 1B and Tables supplement 1-3). Consistent with this, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the EZR<sup>KO</sup> displayed an increased number of lysosomes, as assessed by quantification of lysotracker-fluorescent staining and Lamp1-LC3 colocalization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-F</xref>). Compared with WT MEFs, lysosomal Cathepsin B (CTSB) activity of EZR<sup>KO</sup> MEFs was significantly increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Furthermore, western blot analysis also revealed that EZR<sup>KO</sup> increased the expression of lysosomal markers (LAMP1, CTSD and LC3) as well as reducing the levels of the autophagy substrate p62 and NBR1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). To further investigate whether this autophagic induction was Ezrin dependent, we inserted a frameshift deletion of 13 nt in the coding region (exon 2) of the <italic>EZRIN</italic> gene in HeLa cells via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (EZR<sup>−/−</sup>) (Figure supplement 1D). Concordantly, we found that EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells have a significantly increased number of lysosomes and increased lysosomal activity (Figure supplement 1E and F and supplement 1H), indicative of augmented lysosomal biogenesis and function. Consistent with this, western blot analysis showed that lysosomal markers and autophagic flux were also increased in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> compared to control (Figure supplement 1G and I). Taken together, these results reveal the crucial roles of Ezrin in lysosomal biogenesis and function. These results are consistent with our previous report showing that the autophagy pathway is blocked by Ezrin overexpression <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Naso et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Ezrin interacts with EGFR and regulates its activation</title>
<p>Previous studies have implicated Ezrin in coordinating signaling complexes on membranes in cancer, raising the question of whether the Ezrin-mediated control of autophagy may be attributed to an alteration of signaling pathways. To identify potential signaling pathways affected by Ezrin modulation, we performed an enrichment analysis of the 530 differentially expressed genes in EZR<sup>KO</sup>, using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) phosphoproteomics, kinase perturbations from GEO database, and the Proteomics drug atlas. Interestingly, SILAC phosphoproteomics data highlighted a significant overlap with phosphorylation changes in HeLa cells upon EGF treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and Table supplement 4). Accordingly, kinase perturbation revealed a significant overlap with downregulated genes upon EGFR drug activation (Figure supplement 2A and Table supplement 4), whereas Proteomics drug atlas revealed a significant enrichment in cells upon AZ628 (a Raf Inhibitor) or MEK162 (a MEK inhibitor) (Figure supplement 2B and Table supplement 4) (B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu, Chen, Johns, &amp; Neufeld, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mitchell et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Olsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Warde-Farley et al., 2010</xref>) (All resources are available <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://maayanlab.cloud/enrichr-kg/downloads">https://maayanlab.cloud/enrichr-kg/downloads</ext-link>). Thus, we hypothesized that the EGFR needs to be selectively recognized by EZRIN to be subjected to EZRIN-mediated endosomal trafficking and signaling. Consistent with this, gene network based on physical interaction reveals EGFR as a possible direct EZRIN protein partner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and Table supplement 5). Moreover, EGFR resulted strongly upregulated in our omics dataset (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) and co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) experiments revealed a complex composed of EZRIN and EGFR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with human biomedical interaction repositories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Oughtred et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Petschnigg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Salokas et al., 2022</xref>). Phosphorylated Ezrin (Thr567) localizes at curved cytoplasmic membranes and has been implicated as a membrane-cytoskeleton scaffolding protein rather than a membrane shaper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore tested whether phosphorylation at Thr567 of Ezrin was involved in interacting with EGFR in a complex at cytoplasmic membrane. As suspected, phosphomimic active-EZR<sup>T567D</sup>, but not phospho-mutant inactive-EZR<sup>T567A</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Naso et al., 2020</xref>), when expressed in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells, co-immunoprecipitated with EGFR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These data support that active EZRIN protein interacts with EGFR. Co-immunostaining analysis confirmed that EZRIN is localized at the plasma membrane with EGFR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, a fraction of the EZRIN signal colocalizes with EGFR, within same intracellular compartments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), supporting the presence of an EZRIN/EGFR complex, in which EZRIN acts as a scaffold protein for EGFR. Thus, we postulated that EZRIN participates in EGFR trafficking and signaling. To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression levels and subcellular distribution of EGFR under normal and EZRIN-depleted conditions by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Interestingly, the genetic depletion of EZRIN strongly induced the localization of EGFR at the plasma membrane and dramatically reduced its presence within intracellular compartments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Considering that the specific EGFR signals can arise from intracellular compartments, such as the endosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burke, Schooler, &amp; Wiley, 2001</xref>), we examined whether EZRIN depletion would impair EGFR signaling. Consistent with proteomic results, we found that the levels of total EGFR are increased in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> compared to control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the absence of EZRIN induced a reduction in EGFR signaling. Notably, the level of HER3 and active pY845 EGFR were almost abolished following EZRIN depletion, which also reduced the EGFR-stimulated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK at Threonine 180 (T180) and Tyrosine 182 (Y182), and increased phosphorylation at T222 of its substrate, MK2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). These data suggest a model by which the EZRIN interaction with EGFR contributes to EGFR trafficking and signaling.</p>

<title>Ezrin regulates endocytic EGFR sorting and signaling</title>
<p>Activation of EGFR leads to its internalization and trafficking to early endosomes, which sustains specific EGFR signaling and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burke et al., 2001</xref>). We asked if the increased EGFR protein level at cell membrane and the reduction of EGFR signaling in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells could be due to an alteration in EGFR dimerization and packaging into endosomal vesicles. To test this hypothesis, the cellular internalization and trafficking of EGFR basis was investigated by immunofluorescence and live-imaging studies. We found that the lack of Ezrin reduced dimerization of EGFR upon EGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence analyses; indeed, compared to control cells, Ezrin-depleted cells showed higher levels of EGFR on the cell surface, which was mirrored by reduced EGFR abundance at endosomal compartments, as assessed by a reduction in the overlap between EGFR and EEA1 signals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) and increased EGFR protein levels on purified membranes and endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). The reduced internalization of EGFR to endosomes was not accompanied by a suppression of endocytosis, as indicated by the slight and significant increase in the number of EEA1-positive early endosomes and endotracker-positive structures in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> compared to WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). These results support that EGFR accumulation at the plasma membrane was not a result of an endocytosis defect. To better define whether the lack of EZRIN alters EGFR internalization and trafficking in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells upon EGF stimulation, we performed Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) time-lapse imaging at high spatiotemporal resolution. Both EZR<sup>−/−</sup> and control cells, transfected with an EGFR-GFP vector, were imaged every 0.5 s for 5 min upon EGF treatment. Notably, the EGF-induced EGFR endosomal internalization was dramatically abolished in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> compared to control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and Video 1-4). Consistent with a defective EGFR integration in the early endosome, EGFR was localized at the plasma membrane in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells, despite EGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and Video1-4). These results support that EZRIN play a key role for the dimerization, integration, and trafficking of EGFR in the endosomes. To strengthen these findings, we performed ultrastructural analysis using immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) that further revealed the reduced number of EGFR-positive endosomal compartments and the increased presence of EGFR at the plasma membrane in EGF-stimulated EZR<sup>−/−</sup> compared with EGF-stimulated control cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistent with this, pY845 EGFR and pT180/pY182 p38 MAPK were reduced upon EGF stimulation in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, the increased EGFR internalization from membranes to endosomes by EGF stimulation was significantly inhibited in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells compared to WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). As expected, we found that the endosomal EGFR internalization was further repressed in MEF-EZR<sup>KO</sup> (Figure supplement 2C-E) and in HeLa cells upon <italic>NSC668394</italic> treatment (Figure supplement 2F and G), a specific Ezrin inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Naso et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, these data strongly support a primary role of EZRIN in mediating the internalization and trafficking of EGFR from plasma membrane to endosomes.</p>

<title>The endosomal Ezrin-EGFR complex targets TSC1 protein</title>
<p>We next sought to identify the molecular networks by which Ezrin/EGFR axis controls lysosomal biogenesis and function. Interestingly, EGFR stimulates several downstream effectors, including PI3K/AKT signaling in response to multiple stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wee &amp; Wang, 2017</xref>). This led us to investigate the role of Ezrin/EGFR axis in the control of AKT signaling. AKT binds, phosphorylates, and inhibits hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2) complex. TSC complex is essential to turn off the activity of Rheb, a crucial activator of mTORC1 at lysosomal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dibble &amp; Cantley, 2015</xref>). This raised the possibility of Ezrin-mediated activation of EGFR signaling would be required for AKT activation and thus stimulation of the mTORC1 pathway via TSC repression. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the interaction between endogenous Ezrin/EGFR with AKT and TSC1 to define an endosomal signaling platform. In agreement with previously presented data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Haddad et al., 2002</xref>), TSC1 and AKT co-immunoprecipitated with EZRIN (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Consistently, immunoprecipitation of EGFR was able to pull down both TSC1 and AKT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that EGFR, AKT, TSC1 and EZRIN are present in a complex. The latter result led us to investigate whether EGFR could interact with AKT and TSC1 indirectly through EZRIN. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed this possibility given that <italic>EZRIN</italic> depletion abolished the interactions of EGFR with TSC1 and AKT, thereby point out the key role of Ezrin as a scaffold protein for the formation and activation of the EGFR/AKT/TSC1 signaling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis, lack of Ezrin reduced pS473 AKT activation and in turn suppressed AKT-mediated phosphorylation of pS939 TSC2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). As expected, inactivation of AKT promoted activation of TSC1 and TSC2, which localized on the lysosomes in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Consistently, translocation of the TSC complex on the lysosomes led to inhibition of mTORC1 pathway, as demonstrated by reduction of pT389 P70 S6 Kinase and pS65 4E-BP1 levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). These data were confirmed also in Ezrin-inhibited HeLa (Figure supplement 3A), ARPE-19 cells (Figure supplement 3B and C) and MEF EZR<sup>KO</sup> cells (Figure supplement 3D and E). Together, these results establish an Ezrin-dependent molecular machinery coordinating EGFR sorting and signaling at the endosome to a well-regulated signals transfer to lysosomes via AKT/TSC axis. Consistent with this idea, phosphorylation of pS473 AKT was significantly abolished in response to EGF treatment in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> compared to control cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Accordingly, using confocal Airyscan high-resolution microscopy, we found that the majority of the TSC complex was present in early endosomes of HeLa WT cells upon EGF treatment, as shown by co-localization with the endosomal marker EEA1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Notably, the endosomal TSC localization was abolished in EGF-treated EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>), which indicates that EGFR-mediated repression of TSC by AKT activation could occur in a stable endosomal complex dependent by Ezrin. Consistently, the ectopic expression of a constitutively active EZR<sup>T567D</sup> protein, but not a constitutively inactive Ezr<sup>T567A</sup> protein, rescued EGFR sorting and signaling activation at the endosome in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells upon EGF treatment (Figure supplement 4A). Additionally, EZR<sup>T567D</sup>, but not EZR<sup>T567A</sup>, rescued the physiological localization of TSC complex on the cytoplasm in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells (Figure supplement 4B). Moreover, full translocation of TSC on endosomes was restored in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells expressing EZR<sup>T567D</sup> protein after EGF treatment, as shown by co-localization between TSC1 and EEA1 proteins (Figure supplement 4B).</p>

<title>Aberrant EGFR signaling induces retinal degeneration in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> medaka fish</title>
<p>To further investigate on the role of EZRIN/EGFR axis, which is conserved among vertebrates, in daily modulation of lysosomal biogenesis and function in retinal cells, we carried out <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Accordingly, we found that the EGFR expression pattern in the rodents’ retina diminished in response to light and increased after light off (Figure supplement 5A and B), coinciding with Ezrin expression and diurnal lysosomal biogenesis in the RPE/retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Naso et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, we found an inhibition of TSC2 and an increase of AKT/mTOR pathway in the mice retina in response to dark condition, when active Ezrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Naso et al., 2020</xref>) and EGFR are highly expressed (Figure supplement 5C). Moreover, TSC2 resulted activated and AKT/mTOR signaling decreased in response to light in the retina, when inactive Ezrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Naso et al., 2020</xref>) and EGFR are weakly expressed (Figure supplement 5C), which suggests that activation of Ezrin underlies the requirement endosomal EGFR signaling to assemble the EGFR/AKT/TSC complex and represses lysosomal biogenesis. This data supported that EGFR signaling in retinal cells could be regulated by Ezrin for finely control lysosomal biogenesis and function in mTOR-dependent manner. Thus, we used the highly effective CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutagenesis to create stable Ezrin mutant lines in Medaka fish (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>, Ol) as <italic>in vivo</italic> model system. Targeting two sgRNAs (sgRNA1 and sgRNA2) in the exon 1 of <italic>Ezrin</italic> gene, we generated a 386 bp deletion and established founder lines for this deletion. This mutation eliminates the first 129 amino acids containing ATG (olEzrin<sup>Δ386</sup>), generating a severely truncated Ezrin protein (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), which was not detectable by western blot analyses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). This indicated that the Δ386 Ezrin allele is likely functionally null, and mutants will hereafter be called Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka line. Larval homozygous Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka line appeared almost visually indistinguishable from wild-type siblings, and the Δ386 allele was inherited in Mendelian ratios (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Interestingly, the Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka larvae recapitulated in part a previously reported phenotype characterized in postnatal ezrin knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bonilha, Rayborn, Saotome, McClatchey, &amp; Hollyfield, 2006</xref>). Consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data, we observed increased levels of the EGFR protein accompanied by a significant reduction of active pY845 EGFR. This was accompanied by a significant reduction of the phosphorylation of pS473 AKT in Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka line compared to control larvae (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Consistently, we observed reduced AKT-mediated phosphorylation of pT1462 of TSC2 and an increased autophagy, as demonstrated by higher levels of LC3-II and Lamp1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Notably, endosomal internalization of EGFR was significantly repressed in the RPE of Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka line. Consistent with defective EGFR internalization and trafficking, whole mount immunofluorescence analysis showed that EGFR accumulated at plasma membrane of RPE of Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka line compared with control fish (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Considering the role of endosomal sorting and signaling in the health of retinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Toops, Tan, &amp; Lakkaraju, 2014</xref>), we addressed the consequences of aberrant EGFR signaling pathway in retina of Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka line. Notably, defective endosomal EGFR signaling was sufficient to induce deleterious consequences for the health of photoreceptor cells, which showed reduction in photoreceptor outer segments compared with native rods, similarly to the pathogenesis of macular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Borrelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kaur &amp; Lakkaraju, 2018</xref>). Altogether, these data support the dynamic regulation of EGFR signaling at endosomal compartments in response to Ezrin activation, which assembles and activates an EGFR/AKT/TSC signalosome at endosomes to finely regulate the lysosomal signaling by mTOR pathway, required for the correct autophagy and retinal cell health (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<p>Canonical EGFR signaling begins at the plasma membrane with the engagement of the EGF ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>).

Consistent with this notion, it is now increasingly recognized that many molecules participating in signal transduction are central sorting hubs that coordinate signaling from and to different intracellular compartments, including early endosomes, late endosomes, phagosomes, and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sorkin &amp; von Zastrow, 2009</xref>). However, molecular networks determining selective signal transduction from endosomes to lysosomes are not well defined. In this study, we demonstrated that EZRIN is a cytoskeleton scaffold protein aligned along internal membranes and that this localization is essential for endosomal EGFR signal transduction to the TSC complex. Endosomal EGFR sorting and activation occurs mainly due to binding with EZRIN that facilitates dimerization and activation of the EGF-EGFR receptor complex, resulting in their recruitment to endosomes, followed by AKT activation that targets and inhibits the TSC complex. Indeed, time-lapse confocal imaging revealed that EGFR fails to be recruited to endosomal compartments upon EGF stimulation in the absence of Ezrin or in the presence of its inactive form (EZRIN<sup>T567A</sup>). The loss of Ezrin function compromises EGFR-mediated AKT activation, which in turn reduces TSC complex inhibition resulting in TSC complex translocation to lysosomes where it constrains mTOR activity. Consistent with this, not only does loss of Ezrin impact on lysosomal TSC complex translocation, but we also documented that dephosphorylation of Ezrin in its inactive form is required for EGFR inactivation and TSC1 and TSC2 release from an EGFR/EZRIN complex, possibly to support the lysosomal biogenesis and function. Indeed, autophagy appears to be highly sensitive to pharmacological Ezrin inhibition via the EGFR/AKT axis. Moreover, overexpression of EZRIN<sup>T567A</sup>, but not EZRIN<sup>T567D</sup>, fails to restore EGFR endosomal signaling and lysosomal function in Ezrin-defective cells, indicating that phosphorylation of Ezrin is indispensable for this activity. Supporting this possibility, loss of βA3/A1-crystallin affects PITPβ/PLC signaling axis associated with an age-related loss of PLC-mediated Ezrin phosphorylation and subsequent compromised RPE cell polarity and EGFR signaling. Notably, the lysosome-mediated POS clearance was disrupted in the Cryba1 cKO RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Shang et al., 2021</xref>). Beyond this, our findings also showed an interaction of EGFR with the TSC complex and their co-localization with endosomes, opening to future work on mechanisms of how endosomal system connects extracellular signals with lysosomes under different physiological and pathological conditions.</p>
<p>Upregulation of Ezrin has been shown to induce an age-related macular degeneration-like phenotype in miR-211<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Naso et al., 2020</xref>), where light-mediated cell clearance is completely abolished. We can speculate that recruitment of EGFR on endosomal compartments by Ezrin orchestrates a local signal between endosomes and lysosomes to drive tight control on the lysosomal cargo demands, although future studies are needed in this regard. Interestingly, inhibition of EGFR activity, by silencing Rubicon (RUBCN), switches lysosomal cargo degradation from POS associated to LC3-associated phagocytosis to autophagy process in the RPE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Muniz-Feliciano, Doggett, Zhou, &amp; Ferguson, 2017</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms are completely unknown. Therefore, Ezrin may represent a nodal point in endosomal compartments where EGFR signaling and AKT converge and integrate to directly control the TSC/mTOR pathway and lysosomal cargo demands and degradation. Notably, mutations affecting TSC1 and TSC2 alter lysosomal function with retinal manifestations in 40–50% of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rosset, Netto, &amp; Ashton-Prolla, 2017</xref>). This phenotype is also showed in RPE-specific deletion of TSC1 profoundly leading to an age-related impairment in lysosomal function associated with RPE degeneration <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Huang et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings of the cellular mechanisms governing endosomal EGFR sorting and signaling might be of therapeutic relevance. Indeed, alteration of endosomal biogenesis and signaling have been shown to participate in the age-related, progressive neurodegeneration such as in age-related macular degeneration and Alzheimer’s disease (REF Kaur et al). Thus, the identification of the mechanisms that control Ezrin/EGFR/mTOR molecular network might be exploited for the treatment of diseases in which defective endo-lysosomes play a part.</p>

To observe the genomic DNA mutations induced by Cas9 and <italic>OlEzrin</italic>-sgRNA in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Ezrin-mutated medaka, a small piece of the caudal fin from individual F0 fish was collected and subjected to genomic DNA analysis, using the primer set indicating in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. After the above screening had confirmed the occurrence of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Ezrin mutation in the F0 generation, these founder fish were crossed with each other, and their offspring (F1) were checked for Ezrin mutations in the same way. Two of the F1 progeny with the same mutation patterns were mated to produce the F2 generation. The F2 generation were crossed with each other to produce F3 progeny, that was screened as described above to confirm that the same mutation patterns were successfully inherited.</p>

<p>Medaka larvae were fixed in 4% PFA, 2X PBS, and 0.1% Tween-20. The fixed larvae were washed with PTW 1X and digested for 20 min with 10 μg/ml proteinase K and washed two-fold with 2 mg/ml glycine/PTW 1x. The samples were fixed for 20 min in 4% PFA, 2X PBS, and 0.1% Tween-20, washed with PTW 1X, and then incubated for 2 h in FBS 1%/PTW 1X, at room temperature. The larvae were incubated with mouse anti-EGFR (1:50, Santa Cruz sc-120) overnight at 4°C. The samples were washed with PTW 1X, incubated with the secondary antibody, Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG (ThermoFisher), then with DAPI. Finally, the larvae were placed in glycerol 100%.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<sec id="s4y1">
<title>T-test, Welch’s t-test, Mann-Whitney test</title>
<p>For the analysis of the statistically significant differences between two conditions, we performed the Shapiro-Wilk test to check if each condition had followed the normal distribution (null hypothesis): we performed the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test in case of rejection of the null hypothesis (p-value &lt; 0.05), and we performed the parametric unpaired t-test in case of non-rejection of the null hypothesis (p-value ≥ 0.05). In the second case, we also performed the F-test to check the homoscedasticity between the compared conditions (null hypothesis): we applied the parametric Welch’s t-test in case of rejection of the null hypothesis (p-value &lt; 0.05). All the tests were performed with GraphPad Prism 10.0.0, GraphPad Software, Boston, Massachusetts USA.</p>

<title>ANOVA, Welch’s ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test (with multiple comparisons post hoc tests)</title>
<p>For the analysis of the statistically significant differences among multiple conditions, we performed the Shapiro-Wilk test to check if each condition had followed the normal distribution (null hypothesis): we performed the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test in case of rejection of the null hypothesis (p-value &lt; 0.05), and we performed the parametric one way ANOVA in case of non-rejection of the null hypothesis (p-value ≥ 0.05). In the second case, we also performed the Brown-Forsythe test to check the homoscedasticity between the compared conditions (null hypothesis): we applied the parametric Welch’s one way ANOVA in case of rejection of the null hypothesis (p-value &lt; 0.05). For completeness, we computed the p-values with post hoc tests for the pairwise multiple comparisons: Tukey’s test for one way ANOVA, Dunnett’s test for Welch’s one way ANOVA, and Dunn’s test for Kruskal-Wallis test. All the tests were performed with GraphPad Prism 10.0.0, GraphPad Software, Boston, Massachusetts USA.</p>

<sec id="s4y3">
<title>Poisson Regression</title>
<p>For the analysis of the statically significant differences between two conditions with discrete values (i.e., counts), we performed the Poisson Regression over data, considering a Generalized Linear Model with Likelihood Ratio test. No correction for multiple comparisons was necessary. Poisson Regression with Generalized Linear Model and Likelihood Ratio test were performed with the package ‘car’ (version 3.1-2) in the R environment (version 4.2.3).</p>

<p>Giamundo et al. present <bold>valuable</bold> data with new insights new insight into the role of Ezrin, a major membrane-actin linker that assembles signaling complexes, in the spatial regulation of EGF signaling mediators. The use of multiple state-of-the-art microscopy techniques, multiple cell lines and inhibitors, and in vivo models provides <bold>solid</bold> support for the majority of their conclusions. The findings are helpful for our understanding of EGF/mTOR signal transduction and support a critical role for the scaffolding protein Ezrin, in the upstream regulation of EGFR/AKT activity, TSC subcellular localization and mTORC1 signaling, thus contributing to our understanding of the regulation of endo-lysosomal signaling, alterations in which are implicated in many human diseases.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors demonstrate that, while the loss of Ezrin increases lysosomal biogenesis and function, its presence is required for the specific endocytosis of EGFR. Upon further investigation, the authors reveal that Ezrin is a crucial intermediary protein that links EGFR to AKT, leading to the phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC. TSC is a critical negative regulator of the mTORC1 complex, which is dysregulated in various diseases, making their findings a valuable addition to multiple fields of study. Their cell signaling findings are translatable to an in vivo Medaka fish model and suggest that Ezrin may play a crucial role in retinal degeneration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Giamundo, Intartaglia, et al. utilized unbiased proteomic and transcriptomic screens in Ezrin KO cells to investigate the mechanistic function of Ezrin in lysosome and cell signaling pathways. The authors' findings are consistent with past literature demonstrating Ezrin's role in the EGFR and mTORC1 signaling pathways. They used several cell lines, small molecule inhibitors, and cellular and in vivo knockout models to validate signaling changes through biochemical and microscopy assays. Their use of multiple advanced microscopy techniques is also impressive.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
While the authors demonstrated activation of TSC1 (lysosomal accumulation) and inactivation of Akt (decreased phosphorylation in TSC1), as well as decreased mTORC1 signaling in Ezrin knockout cells, direct experiments showing the rescue of mTORC1 activity by AKT and TSC1 mutants are required to confirm the linear signaling pathway and establish Ezrin as a mediator of EGFR-AKT-TSC1-mTORC1 signaling. Although the authors presented representative images from advanced microscopy techniques to support their claims, there is insufficient quantification of these experiments. Additionally, several immunoblots in the manuscript lack vital loading controls, such as input lanes for immunoprecipitations and loading controls for western blots.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors begin with the stated goal of gaining insight into the known repression of autophagy by Ezrin, a major membrane-actin linker that assembles signaling complexes on membranes. RNA and protein expression analysis is consistent with upregulation of lysosomal proteins in Ezrin-deficient MEFs, which the authors confirm by immunostaining and western blotting for lysosomal markers. Expression analysis also implicates EGF signaling as being altered downstream of Ezrin loss, and the authors demonstrate that Ezrin promotes relocalization of EGFR from the plasma membrane to endosomes. Ezrin loss impacts downstream MAPK/Akt/mTORC1 signaling, although the mechanistic links remain unclear. An Ezrin mutant Medaka fish line wa then generated to test Ezrin's role in retinal cells, which are known to be sensitive to changes in autophagy regulation. Phenotypes in this model appear generally consistent with observations made in cultured cells, though mild overall.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Data on the impact of Ezrin-loss on relocalization of EGFR from the plasma membrane are extensive, and thoroughly demonstrate that Ezrin is required for EGFR internalization in response to EGF.</p>
<p>A new Ezrin-deficient in vivo model (Medaka fish) is generated.</p>
<p>Strong data demonstrates that Ezrin loss suppresses Akt signaling. Ezrin loss also clearly suppresses mTORC1 signaling in cell culture, although examination of mTORC1 activity is notably missing in Ezrin-deficient fish.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
LC3 is used as a readout of autophagy, however the lipidated/unlipidated LC3 ratio generally does not appear to change, thus there does not appear to be evidence that Ezrin loss is affecting autophagy in this study.</p>
<p>The conclusion is drawn that Ezrin loss suppresses EGF signaling, however this is complicated by a strong increase in phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK substrate MK2. Without additional characterization of MAPK and Erk signaling, the effect of Ezrin loss remains unclear.</p>
<p>Causative conclusions between effects on MAPK, Akt, and mTORC1 signaling are frequently drawn, but the data only demonstrate correlations. For example, many signaling pathways can activate mTORC1 including MAPK/Erk, thus reduced mTORC1 activity upon Ezrin-loss cannot currently be attributed to reduced Akt signaling. Similarly, other kinases can phosphorylate TSC2 at the sites examined here, so the conclusion cannot be drawn that Ezrin-loss causes a reduction in Akt-mediated TSC2 phosphorylation. In Figure 7, the conclusion cannot be drawn that retinal degeneration results from aberrant EGFR signaling.</p>
<p>It is unclear why TSC1 is highlighted in the title, as there does not appear to be any specific regulation of TSC1 here.</p>
<p>In Figure 1 the conclusion is drawn that there is an increase in lysosome number with Ezrin KO, however it does not appear that the current analysis can distinguish an increased number from increased lysosome size or activity. Similarly, conclusions about increased lysosome &quot;biogenesis&quot; could instead reflect decreased turnover.</p>
<p>Immunoprecipitation data for a role for Ezrin as a signaling scaffold appear minimal and seem to lack important controls.</p>
<p>In Figure 3A it seems difficult to conclude that EGFR dimerization is reduced since the whole blot, including the background between lanes, is lighter on that side.</p>
<p>In Figure 6C specificity controls for the TSC1 and TSC2 antibodies are not included, but seem necessary since their localization patterns appear very different from each other in WT cells.</p>
<p>In Figure 7 the signaling effects in Ezrin-deficient fish are mild compared to cultured cells, and effects on mTORC1 are not examined. Further data on the retinal cell phenotypes would strengthen the conclusions.</p>
<p>In Figure 7F there appears to be more EGFR throughout the cell, so it is difficult to conclude that more EGFR at the PM in Ezrin-/- fish means reduced internalization.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, the authors have attempted to demonstrate a critical role for the cytoskeletal scaffold protein Ezrin, in the upstream regulation of EGFR/AKT/MTOR signaling. They show that in the absence of Ezrin, ligand-induced EGFR trafficking and activation at the endosomes is perturbed, with decreased endosomal recruitment of the TSC complex, and a corresponding decrease in AKT/MTOR signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors have used a combination of novel imaging techniques, as well as conventional proteomic and biochemical assays to substantiate their findings. The findings expand our understanding of the upstream regulators of the EGFR/AKT MTOR signaling and lysosomal biogenesis, appear to be conserved in multiple species, and may have important implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of diseases involving endo-lysosomal function, such as diabetes and cancer, as well as neuro-degenerative diseases like macular degeneration. Furthermore, pharmacological targeting of Ezrin could potentially be utilized in diseases with defective TFEB/TFE3 functions like LSDs. While a majority of the findings appear to support the hypotheses, there are substantial gaps in the findings that could be better addressed. Since Ezrin appears to directly regulate MTOR activity, the effects of Ezrin KO on MTOR-regulated, TFEB/TFE3 -driven lysosomal function should be explored more thoroughly. Similarly, a more convincing analysis of autophagic flux should be carried out. Additionally, many immunoblots lack key controls (Control IgG in co-IPs) and many others merit repetition to either improve upon the quality of the existing data, validate the findings using orthogonal approaches, or provide a more rigorous quantitative assessment of the findings, as highlighted in the recommendation for authors.</p>
