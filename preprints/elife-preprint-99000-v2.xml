<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The parasitic nematode <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</italic> secretes the HpARI family, which bind to IL-33, either suppressing (HpARI1 and HpARI2) or enhancing (HpARI3) responses to the cytokine. We previously showed that HpARI2 also bound to DNA via its first Complement Control Protein (CCP1) domain. Here, we find that HpARI1 can also bind DNA, while HpARI3 cannot. Through the production of HpARI2/HpARI3 CCP1 domain-swapped chimeras, DNA-binding ability can be transferred, and correlates with in vivo half-life of administered proteins. We found that HpARI1 and HpARI2 (but not HpARI3) also binds to the extracellular matrix component heparan sulphate (HS), and structural modelling showed a basic charged patch in the CCP1 domain of HpARI1 and HpARI2 (but not HpARI3) which could facilitate these interactions. Finally, a mutant of HpARI2 was produced which lacked DNA and HS binding, and was also shown to have a short half-life in vivo. Therefore, we propose that during infection the suppressive HpARI1 and HpARI2 proteins have long-lasting effects at the site of deposition due to DNA and/or extracellular matrix interactions, while HpARI3 has a shorter half-life due to a lack of these interactions.</p>

<sec id="s1">
<p>IL-33 is a pleiotropic cytokine. It can act as a potent inducer of type 2 immune responses, and genetic studies show a strong link between the IL-33 pathway and the risk of developing allergic asthma (Moffatt et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Oboki et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, IL-33 responses are important for induction of anti-parasite type 2 immune responses in helminth infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">McSorley &amp; Smyth, 2021</xref>). Conversely, IL-33 is a potent inducer of IFN-γ and regulatory T cell responses, dependent on the cytokine’s context, cytokine release mode, and the cell responding to the cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bonilla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Schiering et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, IL-33 can have pro-allergic, pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory activities, and modulation of IL-33 responses can have a range of effects.</p>
<p>Parasitic helminths secrete an array of immunomodulatory proteins which tailor the host immune response to allow parasite persistence without immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Maizels et al., 2018</xref>). Our previous work identified the HpARI protein family, secreted by the murine intestinal nematode <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</italic> (Hpb). Each member of the HpARI family consists of 3 complement control protein domains, CCP1-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Colomb et al., 2024</xref>). Our initial characterisation of the HpARI protein (later renamed HpARI2) showed that it bound directly to IL-33, inhibiting the interaction between IL-33 and its receptor (Osbourn et al., 2017). Our recent structural characterisation of the HpARI2:IL-33 complex showed that HpARI2 binds IL-33 via interactions between the cytokine and the CCP2 and CCP3 domains of HpARI2. In particular, a long loop in CCP3 contacts IL-33 at a site which overlaps with the IL-33:ST2 binding site, thus inhibiting cytokine-receptor interactions to effectively block the cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Jamwal et al., 2023</xref>). However, the CCP1 domain was not characterised in this structure.</p>
<p>We previously showed that HpARI2 can interact with DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner, via its CCP1 domain. Truncations of HpARI2 which lack CCP1 cannot bind to DNA (Osbourn et al., 2017), while HpARI2 truncations lacking the CCP3 domain can still bind to IL-33 (albeit with lower affinity), but cannot block interactions between IL-33 and its receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chauche et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Jamwal et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, through CCP1-DNA and CCP2/3-IL-33 interactions, HpARI2 binds to genomic DNA and IL-33 within the nucleus of necrotic epithelial cells, tethering the cytokine and preventing its release (Osbourn et al., 2017). Characterisation of the other members of the HpARI family showed that HpARI1, like HpARI2, blocked responses to IL-33. HpARI3, however, bound to IL-33 but did not block interaction of IL-33 with its receptor. Instead HpARI3 stabilised IL-33, amplifying responses to the cytokine in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Colomb et al., 2024</xref>). Thus <italic>Hpb</italic> produces a family of structurally similar HpARI molecules with opposing physiological effects.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated the role of the CCP1 domain of the HpARI proteins, and found that HpARI1 and HpARI2 can also bind to heparan sulphate via their CCP1 domain, while HpARI3 cannot. This extracellular matrix binding extends the half-life of HpARI2 <italic>in vivo</italic> at the site of administration.</p>

<title>HpARI1 and HpARI2 bind to DNA, while HpARI3 does not</title>
<p>HpARI2 was previously shown to tether IL-33 in necrotic cell nuclei (Osbourn et al., 2017). Using a short-term in vivo model of IL-33 release, we co-administered HpARI1, HpARI2 or HpARI3 with Alternaria allergen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) and assessed IL-33 release. As shown previously (Osbourn et al., 2017), due to interaction between the HpARIs and IL-33, released IL-33 could not be detected by ELISA in the presence of HpARIs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). However, denaturing western blots dissociated the HpARI-IL-33 complex and allowed measurement of released IL-33 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1 Supplement 1</xref>). As shown previously, HpARI2 suppressed the release of IL-33 measured by western blot, due to its tethering function (Osbourn et al., 2017). HpARI1 showed a similar trend which did not reach statistical significance in this experiment. HpARI3 lacked this ability and did not alter the levels of released IL-33 as assessed by western blot. We therefore measured the ability of the HpARIs to bind to DNA (as a correlate of the tethering function of these proteins) using an electromobility shift assay (EMSA) to measure formation of DNA-protein complexes via altered polyacrylamide gel migration of short DNA oligonucleotides. HpARI1 and HpARI2 both caused altered migration of DNA probes, indicating binding to DNA, while HpARI3 did not (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Interestingly, while HpARI2 effectively bound all DNA, HpARI1 showed a reduced DNA-binding ability, only binding 50% of the DNA in this assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>The DNA-binding activity of HpARI2 was previously shown to be localised to its CCP1 domain. To assess the stark difference in DNA binding between HpARI2 and HpARI3, fusion constructs were expressed with the CCP1 domain of HpARI2 fused to the CCP2+3 domains of HpARI3 (HpARI2:3) or vice versa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). In EMSA experiments, these constructs showed DNA binding directly related to the source of their CCP1 domain, with HpARI3:2 lacking, and HpARI2:3 showing DNA binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). Therefore, members of the HpARI family differ in their ability to bind both IL-33 and DNA, the latter of which is mediated solely by the CCP1 domain.</p>

<title>HpARI fusion proteins show unexpected eCects on IL-33 responses in vivo</title>
<p>The HpARI2:3 and HpARI3:2 fusion proteins represent useful tools to separate the DNA binding and IL-33 modulation effects of HpARI2 and HpARI3 respectively. These fusion proteins were tested in an in vitro model of IL-33 release and responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chauche et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Colomb et al., 2024</xref>), where the CMT-64 epithelial cell line is freeze-thawed to induce necrosis and IL-33 release in the presence of HpARI proteins. Supernatants from these necrotic cells were then transferred to cultures of bone marrow cells in the presence of IL-2 and IL-7 to support ILC2 differentiation, and IL-33-mediated ILC2 activation was assessed by IL-5 release. As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Colomb et al., 2024</xref>), in this assay HpARI2 dose-dependently suppresses ILC2 responses, while HpARI3 amplifies them (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). The HpARI2:3 and HpARI3:2 fusion proteins retained the amplifying or suppressing activities of their CCP2/3 domains. Small alterations in activity were seen when CCP1 domains were swapped, with HpARI2:3 showing decreased activity compared to HpARI3 wild-type (HpARI3 EC50=1.2ng/ml, HpARI3:2 EC50=21.5 ng/ml), and HpARI3:2 showing slightly increased activity compared to HpARI2 wild-type (HpARI2 IC50=1.9 ng/ml, HpARI3:2 IC50=1.1 ng/ml).</p>

</fig>
<p>As these fusion proteins retained similar activity on IL-33 as their CCP2/3 parent proteins, we then assessed their activity in vivo, first co-administering them with Alternaria allergen and assessing IL-33 release by western blot 15 min later. As expected, HpARI2 and HpARI2:3 tethered IL-33 and reduced its release, due to their combination of IL-33 and DNA binding activities. HpARI3 and HpARI3:2 lack tethering ability, and slightly increased levels of IL-33 in BAL, possibly due to binding and stabilisation of the soluble cytokine in the absence of DNA binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Unexpectedly, when the downstream response to released IL-33 was measured 24 h later (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), IL-33 tethering did not correlate with suppression of IL-33-induced responses: while HpARI2 suppressed and HpARI3 amplified eosinophilia, ILC2 activation (as measured by surface CD25 or cell size by median FSC) and IL-5 release (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D-H</xref>), HpARI2:3 could not suppress IL-33 responses despite tethering of IL-33 at the 15 min timepoint (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). In fact, HpARI2:3 amplified IL-33-dependent responses similarly to HpARI3, and tended to have increased activity compared to the HpARI3 wild-type protein. Similarly, despite a lack of IL-33 tethering, HpARI3:2 was capable of effectively blocking IL-33 dependent responses similarly to HpARI2 wild-type protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D-H</xref>). Therefore, these data indicated that our model of DNA tethering of IL-33 by HpARI2 could not fully explain the activity of these proteins.</p>
<p>We hypothesised that the altered activity of the fusion proteins could be due to their effective half-life in vivo. We administered HpARI2 or HpARI3:2 either 1 day, 3 days or 7 days prior to Alternaria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), and found that while HpARI2 could suppress Alternaria-induced eosinophilia and ILC2 responses when administered 3 days prior to allergen, HpARI3:2 could only replicate this suppression when administered 24 h prior to Alternaria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B-E</xref>, and figure supplement 1-3). Therefore, the in vivo half-life of HpARI2 is controlled by the CCP1 domain, and the HpARI3 CCP1 domain confers a shorter in vivo half-life than the HpARI2 counterpart. As extracellular DNA is only present in the bronchoalveolar lavage at very low concentrations at homeostasis (Curren et al., 2023), and is released in response to stimuli such as Alternaria, we hypothesised that the HpARI2 CCP1 could have a second binding partner which mediates its long in vivo half-life. As other host and pathogen CCP domain proteins have been demonstrated to interact with extracellular matrix constituents such as heparan sulphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Mark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Schmidt et al., 2008</xref>), we hypothesised that this could be the case for the HpARIs also.</p>

<title>HpARI2 binds to heparan sulphate</title>
<p>We first used gel filtration chromatography to assess the mobility of HpARIs in the presence or absence of heparan sulphate (HS). While HS addition resulted in earlier elution of HpARI1 and HpARI2, no shift was seen with HpARI3, implying a lack of HS binding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Likewise, HpARI1 and HpARI2 could be pulled down with heparin-coated beads while HpARI3 could not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). As well as being a common constituent of the extracellular matrix, HS is present on cell surface proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Xu &amp; Esko, 2014</xref>). To assess whether HS binding could mediate interactions between the HpARIs and stromal cells, we added PE-conjugated tetramers of the HpARIs to preparations of naïve mouse lung cells, showing that HpARI1 and HpARI2 bind strongly to CD45-negative stromal cells, but less to CD45-positive cells, while HpARI3 did not show detectable binding to any lung cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, to assess the respective affinities for HS, we used isothermal calorimetry to show that HpARI1 had an affinity for HS of 9.6 μM, while HpARI2 had a slightly higher affinity of 4.2 μM. Furthermore, these experiments confirmed that no binding could be detected between HpARI3 and HS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D-F</xref>).</p>
<p>We next used protein modelling to understand the differential heparan sulphate binding of different HpARIs. AlphaFold2 models were produced to predict the structures of the CCP1 domains of HpARI1, HpARI2 and HpARI3. This revealed that while HpARI1 and HpARI2 contain a strongly positively-charged surface, HpARI3 lacks this charged surface (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). We next used molecular docking to predict the structure of the complex between HpARI1 or HpARI2 CCP1 domains and the extracellular matrix component heparan sulphate (HS). Docking experiments predicted that HS molecules can dock to various locations across the positive charged surfaces of HpARI1 and HpARI2 CCP1 domains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-C</xref>). Therefore, the CCP1 domain of HpARI1 and 2 have a positively-charged surface which acts as a non-specific binding site for negatively charged cellular components, including DNA and heparan sulphates, but this binding surface is lacking in HpARI3.</p>

<p>Electrostatic modelling of HpARI2 indicated that 5 arginine residues in CCP1 form the positively-charged HS and DNA binding surface (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). A pentaR mutant of HpARI2 (with each of the indicated Arg resides mutated to Ala) was expressed.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The parasite helminth <italic>H. polygyrus bakeri</italic> expresses a range of immunomodulatory proteins which have distinct activities. For instance, the TGF-β mimic Hp-TGM binds to the mammalian TGF-β receptor as well as cell surface coreceptors (Johnston et al., 2017; van Dinther et al., 2023). There is a family of 10 Hp-TGM proteins (Hp-TGM1-10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Smyth et al., 2018</xref>) which have distinct activities: HpTGM-1 is an agonist of the TGF-β receptor and uses CD44 as a co-receptor, directing its activity to CD44-positive immune cells such as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, resulting in regulatory T cell induction (van Dinther et al., 2023). Conversely, in a recent pre-print the related protein Hp-TGM6 was shown to be a TGF-β receptor antagonist which is particularly active on fibroblasts (White et al., 2023), blocking TGF-β signalling.</p>
<p>Thus the prototypic Hp-TGM sequence has undergone selection to carry out a range of contradictory functions. Similarly, here we describe the effects of the HpARI family and find that HpARI1 and HpARI2 bind heparan sulphate (HS) and suppress IL-33 responses, while HpARI3 does not bind HS, and amplifies IL-33 responses. As the Hp-TGM proteins are targeted to different cellular targets through co-receptor interactions, we propose that the activity of the HpARIs is controlled by timing of release, in vivo half-life and localisation within the host, controlled by interactions with the extracellular matrix.</p>
<p>We show here that HpARI1 and HpARI2 have a positively charged patch in their CCP1 domain. In the case of HpARI2, we show that this charged patch lengthens the effective half-life of the protein in vivo via binding to DNA and, more relevantly, heparan sulphate. We propose that this binding to the extracellular matrix and cell surface proteoglycans prevents diffusion of HpARI1 and HpARI2, keeps the local concentration high and prevents loss of protein to the circulation. This makes HpARI2 a particularly effective IL-33 suppressor when compared to a systemically administered monoclonal antibody which must reach an effective concentration throughout the circulation of the host to allow blockade at the site of IL-33 release. Some cytokines and chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ridley et al., 2023</xref>) bind to the extracellular matrix to ensure their effects are constrained to the local milieu.</p>
<p>This is critical for their activity: it was recently shown that abrogating the HS-binding activity of IFN-γ results in fatal systemic (rather than local) inflammation after viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Kemna et al., 2023</xref>). This approach of retaining proteins on the extracellular matrix is being developed for increasing the efficacy of protein-based therapeutics, while decreasing toxicity at off-target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alshoubaki et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Martino et al., 2014</xref>). This was exemplified in a study showing that heparin binding was able to prolong the blocking of VEGF signalling by recombinant VEGFR1 in therapeutic use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Xin et al., 2021</xref>). It appears that this same technique has been evolved by parasitic helminths to localise immunomodulatory proteins. HS binding has been demonstrated for several other CCP domain proteins, including the viral CCP protein Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus complement control protein (KCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Mark et al., 2006</xref>), and the mammalian proteins Factor H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Schmidt et al., 2008</xref>) and C4BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Spijkers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Trouw et al., 2005</xref>). In C4BP, the protein presents a basic patch which is able to bind both DNA and HS, similarly to the data we show here for HpARI1 and HpARI2.</p>
<p>While HpARI1 binds to DNA and HS, it has lower affinity for these ligands compared to HpARI2, and in the DNA-binding assays only bound to 50% of the total DNA. It is unclear what the purpose is of this reduced binding affinity, but it could be that HpARI1 remains partially in solution, diffusing further from the site of deposition than HpARI2, and so mediating its effects at a greater distance from the site of release.</p>
<p>In this context, it is interesting that HpARI3 does not bind HS, while having the opposite effect on IL-33 as compared to HpARI2. The effects of IL-33 are highly contingent on the context of IL-33 release, and the cell type and tissue that it is acting on. In parasitic infection, IL-33 released by epithelial cells in the intestine induces a type 2 immune response which results in parasite ejection. In the same helminth infection model, IL-33 released by myeloid cells induced regulatory T cell expansion, suppressing effector immune responses and resulting in increased parasite burdens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hung et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, at different sites and in different cells, IL-33 can have directly opposing effects.</p>
<p>In the context of the findings outlined here, we propose the following model for the HpARI family’s effects: HpARI2 binds strongly to the extracellular matrix, and is retained in the local milieu of the parasite where it blocks IL-33 released in response to infection. HpARI1 binds less strongly to HS, and therefore may diffuse slightly further from the site of deposition, to block more distant IL-33 responses. Finally HpARI3 lacks HS binding and so diffuses freely to amplify IL-33 responses at distal sites, which we hypothesise could amplify IL-33-dependent regulatory responses. To investigate these hypotheses, transgenic parasites deficient for individual HpARI proteins would be useful, however this has proved intractable for parasitic nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Quinzo et al., 2022</xref>), and has not been achieved in <italic>H. polygyrus bakeri</italic> to date.</p>
<p>The findings outlined here may be applicable beyond <italic>H. polygyrus bakeri</italic>, as it appears likely that other parasitic helminths have used extracellular matrix binding as a technique to retain immunoregulators within the local milieu. Indeed, <italic>Trichuris muris</italic>, another intestinal nematode, secretes the immunoregulatory protein p43. This protein binds and blocks IL-13, but also has HS binding activity which has been proposed to tether p43 to the extracellular matrix, increasing survival of the protein at the site of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bancroft et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>H. polygyrus bakeri</italic> has developed a series of immunomodulatory protein families, including 10 Hp-TGMs and 2 HpBARIs, therefore it will be informative to investigate whether members of these families also bind to the extracellular matrix, and whether this alters their in vivo localisation and/or half-life.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we describe a novel HS-binding ability of members of the HpARI family and show that this binding increases their in vivo half-life and activity at the site of deposition.</p>

Direct titration of proteins was done individually against Heparan Sulphate tetrasaccharide (HS4) (Iduron, UK) reconstituted in SEC buffer. Typical titration was carried over 20 injections with an initial injection of 0.4 µl followed by 19 injections of 2 µl of 2 mM Heparan Sulphate tetrasaccharide into protein solution inside the cell, stirring at 750 rpm at room temperature. All titrations were done twice.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistics Data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism v10.0.0. When comparing independent groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s post-test was used. When comparing groups over a timecourse, two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test was used. Standard error of mean is used throughout. ∗∗∗∗ = P &lt; 0.0001, ∗∗∗ = P &lt; 0.001, ∗∗ = P &lt; 0.01, ∗ = P &lt; 0.05, ns = not significant (P &gt; 0.05).</p>

<p>Colomb et al have further explored the mechanisms of action of a family of three immunodulatory proteins produced by the murine gastrointestinal nematode parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri. The family of HpARI proteins binds to the alarmin interleukin 33 and depending on family members, exhibits differential activities, either suppressive or enhancing. The present work extends previous studies by this group showing the binding of DNA by members of this family through a complement control protein (CCP1) domain. Moreover, they identify two members of the family that bind via this domain in a non-specific manner to the extracellular matrix molecule heparan sulphate through a basic charged patch in CCP1. The authors thus propose that binding to DNA or heparan sulphate extends the suppressive action of these two parasite molecules, whereas the third family member does not bind and consequently has a shorter half-life and may function via diffusion.</p>

<p>Colomb et al. investigated here the heparin-binding activity of the HpARI family proteins from H. polygyrus. HpARIs bind to IL-33, a pleiotropic cytokine, and modulate its activities. HpARI1/2 has suppressive functions, while HpARI3 can enhance the interaction between IL-33 and its receptor. This study builds upon their previous observation that HpARI2 binds DNA via its CCP1 domain. Here, the authors tested the CCP1 domain of HpARIs in binding heparan sulfate, an important component of the extracellular matrix, and found that 1/2 bind heparan, but 3 cannot, which is related to their half-lives in vivo.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Colomb et al have further explored the mechanisms of action of a family of three immunodulatory proteins produced by the murine gastrointestinal nematode parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri. The family of HpARI proteins binds to the alarmin interleukin 33 and depending on family members, exhibits differential activities, either suppressive or enhancing. The present work extends previous studies by this group showing the binding of DNA by members of this family through a complement control protein (CCP1) domain. Moreover, they identify two members of the family that bind via this domain in a non-specific manner to the extracellular matrix molecule heparan sulphate through a basic charged patch in CCP1. The authors thus propose that binding to DNA or heparan sulphate extends the suppressive action of these two parasite molecules, whereas the third family member does not bind and consequently has a shorter half-life and may function via diffusion.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A strength of the work is the multifaceted approach to examining and testing their hypotheses, using a well-established and well-defined family of immunomodulatory molecules using multiple approaches including an in vivo setting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are a few weaknesses of the approach. Perhaps some discussion and speculation as to how these three family members might operate in concert during Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri infection would help place the biology of these molecules in context for the reader, e.g. when and where they are produced.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the roles of these proteins during infection requires further study and is not fully elucidated in infection here. We have added further discussion to the manuscript on their potential roles during infection (track changes manuscript, lines 277 – 283).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Colomb et al. investigated here the heparin-binding activity of the HpARI family proteins from H. polygyrus. HpARIs bind to IL-33, a pleiotropic cytokine, and modulate its activities. HpARI1/2 has suppressive functions, while HpARI3 can enhance the interaction between IL-33 and its receptor. This study builds upon their previous observation that HpARI2 binds DNA via its CCP1 domain. Here, the authors tested the CCP1 domain of HpARIs in binding heparan sulfate, an important component of the extracellular matrix, and found that 1/2 bind heparan, but 3 cannot, which is related to their half-lives in vivo.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach to assess the binding and their effects in vivo, coupled with molecular modeling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1C should include Western.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologise for this oversight, and now include an uncropped western blot image as a Figure 1, Figure Supplement 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 1E: Why does HpARI1 stop binding DNA at 50%?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is currently unclear why HpARI1 does not bind to all DNA in the EMSA assay, however this was our repeated finding. With our revised findings we can now state definitively that HpARI1 has a lower affinity for HS compared to HpARI2, and in each of our assays (EMSA (Fig 1D-E), size exclusion chromatography (Fig 4A), HS-bead pull-down (Fig 4B), lung cell surface binding (Fig 4C) and ITC (Fig 4D)) HpARI1 always shows a weaker response compared to HpARI2. We hypothesise that HpARI1 binds more weakly to DNA/HS to allow it to diffuse further from the site of deposition, but we have yet to demonstrate this during infection. We add further discussion of this point (track changes manuscript, lines 262 – 266).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) ITC binding experiment with HpARI1? Also, the ITC results from HpARI2 do not seem to saturate, thus it is difficult to really determine the affinity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included HpARI1-HS ITC, and re-ran the HpARI2 experiment to saturation (Fig 4D-E).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It would be helpful to add docking results from HpARI1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included HpARI1-HS docking, in Figure 5B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Some conclusions are speculative and need to remain in the Discussion. e.g.: a) That HpARI3 may be able to diffuse farther</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have rewritten these points to remove the speculation on localisation from the abstract (lines 18-19) and introduction (line 78).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) That DNA/HS may trap HpARI1/2 at the infection site.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Likewise, these points have been rewritten in the abstract and introduction as above, and we have made it clearer that this is a model that we are proposing in the discussion (line 277-283).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The paper is well-written and the data well-presented. I have one small comment that the authors may like to consider. In the discussion, second paragraph, line 17, perhaps, &quot;evolved&quot; rather than &quot;developed&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion, we have made this change (line 248).</p>
