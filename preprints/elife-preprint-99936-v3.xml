<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In cleavage-stage embryos, preexisting organelles partition evenly into daughter blastomeres without significant cell growth after symmetric cell division. The presence of mitochondrial DNA within mitochondria and its restricted replication during preimplantation development makes their inheritance particularly important. While chromosomes are precisely segregated by the mitotic spindle, the mechanisms controlling mitochondrial partitioning remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the mechanism by which Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) controls the mitochondrial redistribution and partitioning during embryonic cleavage. Depletion of Drp1 in mouse zygotes causes marked mitochondrial aggregation, and the majority of embryos arrest at the 2-cell stage. Clumped mitochondria are located in the center of mitotic Drp1-depleted zygotes with less uniform distribution, thereby preventing their symmetric partitioning. Asymmetric mitochondrial inheritance is accompanied by functionally inequivalent blastomeres with biased ATP and endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. We also find that marked mitochondrial centration in Drp1-depleted zygotes prevents the assembly of parental chromosomes, resulting in chromosome segregation defects and binucleation. Thus, mitochondrial fragmentation mediated by Drp1 ensure proper organelle positioning and partitioning into functional daughters during the first embryonic cleavage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Preimplantation development of mammalian embryos consists of a series of symmetric cell divisions without significant cell growth, known as embryonic cleavage, resulting in approximately half of the cytoplasm in each resulting cell, called blastomere. The segregation of maternal content between daughter blastomeres allows rapid division of a single-cell zygote into multicellular organisms. To ensure the correct segregation of cellular content to produce functional daughters, cells must duplicate and apportion their various organelles with high accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carlton et al., 2020</xref>). Chromosomes are assembled and segregated into daughter cells with the formation of mitotic spindles, whereas membrane-bound organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, are typically generated from existing structures, and both daughters receive a share of these components during cell division. This is particularly important in the case of mitochondria because mitochondria are semi-autonomous organelles that contain their own genome, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Growing oocytes exponentially increase their mtDNA, and a fully grown oocyte contains more than 200 000 copies of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mahrous et al., 2012</xref>). After fertilization, abundant preexisting mtDNA is segregated among daughter cells without replication during preimplantation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Poulton et al., 2010</xref>). As mitochondria are the primary source of ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation in oocytes and early embryos owing to low glycolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dumollard et al., 2007</xref>), proper inheritance must be ensured for cell energetic homogeneity among blastomeres. Mitochondria also play an important role in the regulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which in turn controls cell metabolism and cell death pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, defects in mitochondrial inheritance are likely to have serious consequences for daughter blastomeres and manifest as the failure of pre- or post-implantation development.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that move along cytoskeletal networks and undergo continuous fusion and fission; these dynamics allow cells to respond and adapt to various intracellular and extracellular changes and maintain cellular function and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mishra and Chan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Westermann, 2010</xref>). Active partitioning of mitochondria is observed in budding yeast fission, which undergoes asymmetric cell division; mitochondria actively move along actin filaments into the daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mishra and Chan, 2014</xref>). In mammalian cells that divide symmetrically, the partitioning of mitochondria is largely due to passive processes, as fragmented and dispersed mitochondrial distribution allows for stochastic and roughly equal partitioning into daughter cells. Mitochondrial fission is thus important for faithful inheritance and proper intracellular distribution of the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Westermann, 2010</xref>). Whether active transport of mitochondria by the cytoskeleton contributes to mitochondrial inheritance in dividing animal cells remains controversial. Microtubules function as cytoskeletal platforms for the distribution and transport of mitochondria. During mitosis, mitochondria decouple from spindle microtubules and disperse in the cell periphery, allowing for passive segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chung et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies have shown that actin filaments take over as the dominant mitochondrial scaffold following mitochondrial release from microtubules at the start of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Moore et al., 2021</xref>). Myosin 19 (Myo19), a mitochondrial-localized myosin in vertebrates, acts as an actin-based motor for mitochondrial dynamics. Notably, depletion of Myo19 causes asymmetrical mitochondrial inheritance between daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rohn et al., 2014</xref>), though the molecular characteristics of Myo19 in mammalian oocytes/eggs has yet to be shown.</p>
<p>Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is a key regulator of mitochondrial fission in many eukaryotic organisms. Drp1 is recruited to the mitochondrial membrane where it forms helical oligomers that induce membrane constriction and severing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Westermann, 2010</xref>). The indispensable role of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in mammalian oocytes has been documented using conditional knockout (KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Udagawa et al., 2014</xref>). Drp1 KO oocytes undergo meiotic arrest due to severe organelle aggregation, which complicates the functional analysis of Drp1 in mature oocytes and embryos. More recently, mature oocytes have been successfully isolated from juvenile Drp1 conditional KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adhikari et al., 2022</xref>). After parthenogenetic activation of Drp1 KO oocytes, few embryos develop to the blastocyst stage. Nevertheless, the precise role of mitochondrial fission in normal embryos remains elusive. To this end, we employed Trim-Away, a method to degrade endogenous proteins via the proteasome-mediated pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Clift et al., 2017</xref>), which acutely depletes large amounts of storage proteins in the oocyte, allowing loss-of-function studies during the preimplantation development from the zygotic stage. In this study, we show that Drp1 depletion in fertilized zygotes causes marked mitochondrial aggregation and early embryonic arrest. Live imaging of mitochondria during the first cleavage division reveals that loss of Drp1 disturbs the spatiotemporal mitochondrial dynamics, resulting in an asymmetric mitochondrial inheritance between daughter blastomeres with functional heterogeneities. We also find that misplaced mitochondria impair the assembly of parental spindles leading to binucleated blastomeres, which closely resemble a clinical phenotype of human embryos in <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hardy et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Meriano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Seikkula et al., 2018</xref>)</p>

<title>Fragmented mitochondria are redistributed during the first embryonic cleavage and equally partitioned into daughter blastomeres</title>
<p>We first imaged mitochondria and chromosomes in zygotes expressing mitochondrially-targeted GFP (mt-GFP) and histone H2B-mCherry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; Figure 1-Video 1). Mitochondria in interphase zygotes (27 h post-hCG) progressively accumulated around the two pronuclei (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, left</xref>), encircled metaphase (31 h post-hCG) chromosomes after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB, 30 h post-hCG). During the transition from anaphase to telophase (32 h post-hCG), the cytokinetic furrow constricts the mitochondrial ring that effectively divides the mitochondria approximately equally into the two daughter blastomeres and mitochondria were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in the interphase 2-cell embryos (35 h post-hCG) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, right</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining of microtubules also showed mitochondria progressively surround the spindle and disperse back into the cytoplasm after the first cleavage (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). The accumulation of mitochondria around the spindle is unique to the first cleavage division (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>), as live imaging of fluorescently labeled microtubules (EB3-GFP) and mitochondria (mt-DsRed) confirmed spindle-associated accumulation of mitochondria in one-cell zygotes, but no evidence of mitochondrial accumulation was observed in the spindles of 2-cell or 4-cell stage embryos. By electron microscopy (EM), we found that these accumulated mitochondria around the metaphase spindle were highly fragmented (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The ERs were also abundantly distributed around the spindle and were in partial contact with the mitochondria, and enriched bundles of actin filaments were found around these organelles.</p>

<p>Interphase zygotes stained with fluorescence-labelled phalloidin displayed a mitochondrial distribution pattern closely associated with F-actin cytoplasmic meshwork (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref>). This cytoplasmic meshwork was subsequently reorganized around the spindle at the metaphase and increased co-localization with mitochondria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In interphase 2-cell stage embryos, the F-actin meshwork was seen again, albeit with significantly reduced overlap with mitochondria. To test whether the F-actin is involved in mitochondrial distribution and partitioning, zygotes were treated with 1 μM latrunculin A for 1 h just after NEB, sufficient for F-actin depolymerization (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1E</xref>). Disruption of F-actin organization resulted in asymmetric mitochondrial inheritance (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>), but also increased cell size asymmetry (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1H</xref>), and these two asymmetries were correlated (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1I</xref>). Given many cellular roles, disruption of F-actin per se was unsuitable as a strategy for manipulating mitochondrial distribution, we have therefore targeted Myo19 as a strategy for altering the mitochondrial distribution and ask if it is critical for the early development. Asymmetric mitochondrial inheritance has been previously reported in cells lacking Myo19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Majstrowicz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Moore et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rohn et al., 2014</xref>). Myo19 was expressed in both interphase and metaphase zygotes, where its localization was consistent with the mitochondrial distribution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Acute depletion of Myo19 at the PN stage by Trim-Away was confirmed by Western blot analysis, which was not observed in control zygotes injected with Trim21 mRNA and control IgG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). Unexpectedly, no significant asymmetry was observed in the mitochondrial distribution and partitioning between the daughter blastomeres in Myo19-depleted 2-cell embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1J</xref>). Live imaging of mitochondria (mt-GFP) and chromosomes (H2B-mCherry) in Myo19-depleted zygotes shows symmetric distribution and partitioning of mitochondria during the first embryonic cleavage (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A</xref><bold>, </bold><xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>; Figure 1-Video 2). Moreover, Myo19 depletion did not affect developmental competence of the embryos to the blastocyst stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>). Overall, fragmented mitochondria are closely associated with cytoplasmic F-actin during the first cleavage, but active transport by the actin motor is not directly involved in mitochondrial partitioning.</p>

<title>Loss of Drp1 induces mitochondrial aggregation and disturbs subcellular organelle compartments</title>
<p>The highly fragmented mitochondrial morphology appears to facilitate mitochondrial partitioning during embryonic cleavage. To understand the underlying mechanism of this process, we examined the role of Drp1, a key regulator of mitochondrial fission. Western blot analysis revealed that Drp1 was expressed in PN zygotes, and comparable protein levels were found in the morula stage, whereas their expression was remarkably decreased at the blastocyst stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). To demonstrate the role of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in preimplantation embryos, we employed Trim-Away. Co-injection of Trim21 mRNA and an antibody against Drp1 into zygotes 20–22 h post hCG reduced the Drp1 protein to nearly undetectable levels by 5 h post-injection at the PN stage, whereas co-injection of Trim21 mRNA and control IgG failed to trigger protein degradation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>).</p>

<p>Mitochondria in live 2-cell embryos (37/37) expressing mt-GFP were interspersed throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, almost all Drp1 Trim-Away embryos (55/57) exhibited marked mitochondrial aggregation that was reversed by ectopic expression of mCherry-tagged Drp1 (mCh-Drp1) (50/53) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). In Drp1-depleted embryos, mitochondria became highly aggregated into a small number of large clusters, whereas in controls and Drp1 Trim-Away embryos expressing mCh-Drp1, mitochondria remained dispersed in a large number of small clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). We observed similar mitochondrial aggregation occurred in parthenogenetic Drp1 KO embryos (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref>), as the mitochondrial cluster size in <italic>Drp1<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> parthenotes was greater than <italic>Drp1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>control, albeit the number of clusters were comparable (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>).</p>
<p>EM images of control 2-cell embryos showed that rounded mitochondria with less developed cristae were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, whereas swollen or partially elongated mitochondria with lamella cristae structures in the inner membrane were observed in Drp1-depleted embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). Both mitochondrial major and minor axes in Drp1-depleted embryos was significantly greater than those of control embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J-L</xref>). The mean aspect ratio (major axis/minor axis) increased slightly from 1.36 in control to 1.66 in Drp1-depleted embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>).</p>
<p>To clarify the effects of these morphological changes in mitochondria on their energy production, we compared ATP levels between control and Drp1 Trim-Away embryos at the 2-cell stages. To analyze intracellular ATP concentrations, we expressed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based ATP biosensor, ATeam AT1.03, with an emission ratio of AT1.03 fluorescence (YFP/CFP) used to estimate ATP levels. ATP levels in Drp1-depleted embryos were indistinguishable from those in the control embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N</xref>). No FRET signal was detected in embryos expressing a mutant version of the ATP probe AT1.03RK that cannot bind ATP.</p>
<p>Recent studies have focused on the interactions between organelles at membrane contact sites (MCSs) and their roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">English and Voeltz, 2013</xref>). The ER is a continuous membrane-bound organelle with MCSs such as with the plasma membrane, mitochondria, Golgi, and peroxisomes. Since mitochondrial dynamics are spatially coordinated at the ER–mitochondria MCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>), we surmised that mitochondrial aggregation due to the loss of Drp1 would compromise the organization of ER MCSs. To visualize the distribution of mitochondria with other organelles in live embryos, fluorescently tagged ER (ER-mCherry), Golgi (Golgi-mCherry), and peroxisomes (PEX-mCherry) were co-expressed with mt-GFP. The ER was partially confined to the regions of the mitochondrial aggregation in Drp1 Trim-Away embryos, which appeared to disturb the endogenous ER network (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2A</xref>). Linscan of mt-GFP and ER-mCherry signals at each focal plane of large mitochondrial clumps showed that ER is confined to mitochondrial aggregation. In contrast, the subcellular distribution of the Golgi was not clearly altered by Drp1 depletion (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2B</xref>). Drp1 is also known to regulate peroxisomal fission, as elongated peroxisomes are seen in Drp1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Koch et al., 2003</xref>); however, the subcellular distribution of peroxisomes in mammalian embryos has not been reported. The peroxisomes in normal 2-cell embryos showed a punctate distribution in the cytoplasm, whereas these puncta partially aggregated following Drp1 depletion by Trim-Away (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2C</xref>), although it appeared to be independent of mitochondrial aggregation in terms of spatial positioning.</p>

<title>Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation is required for the symmetric mitochondrial partitioning into two functional daughter blastomeres</title>
<p>To decipher the spatiotemporal regulation of mitochondrial dynamics following Drp1 depletion, we imaged mitochondria and chromosomes in Drp1 Trim-Away zygotes expressing mt-GFP and histone H2B-mCherry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; Figure 3-Video 1). No significant delay in cell cycle progression was observed following Drp1 depletion (data not shown) compared to control zygotes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Clumped mitochondria were located in the center of the metaphase zygotes which resulted in an increase in mitochondrial asymmetry at anaphase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We postulated that this asymmetry was due to non-uniformity in the distribution of mitochondria around the spindle. As expected, live imaging of mitochondria (mt-DsRed) and spindle microtubules (EB3-GFP) revealed compared with the uniform angular positioning of around the spindle observed in control zygotes, mitochondria in Drp1-depleted zygotes lost their uniform distribution (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref><bold>)</bold>. The biased inheritance of mitochondria was further validated by the quantification of mtDNA copy number in isolated blastomeres from 2-cell embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The inheritance ratio of mtDNA in daughter blastomeres of control embryos was comparable, whereas Drp1 depletion led to biased mtDNA inheritance. Although Drp1 depletion did not affect intracellular ATP levels in the whole embryo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), we tested if the biased inheritance of mitochondria led to differences in blastomere ATP levels. Using AT1.03, ATP concentration and mitochondrial distribution were simultaneously visualized in blastomeres of 2-cell embryos (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1C</xref>). Notably, the bias in ATP levels between blastomeres of 2-cell embryos was greater following the Drp1 depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We then quantified mtDNA copy number in each blastomere and found a positive correlation between mtDNA inheritance and ATP levels in the individual blastomeres (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

<p>The presence of ER-mitochondria MCSs may lead to mitochondria-associated ER asymmetry during cleavage. Live imaging of mitochondria and ER showed that part of the ER is confined to mitochondrial aggregation, resulting in asymmetric distribution at the telophase of the first cleavage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref>; Figure 3-Video 2) which was closely correlated with mitochondrial asymmetry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). No significant asymmetry was observed in the distribution of Golgi or peroxisomes, suggesting that these organelles are not directly confined by mitochondrial location. The ER is the main reservoir of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in non-excitable cells. ER-mitochondria MCSs create localized domains of high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from the ER to the mitochondria, in which the propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the mitochondria controls energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>). To explore whether alterations in the ER and mitochondrial distribution and the resulting segregation of the inter-organelle contacts affect intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in 2-cell embryos, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in each blastomere after exposure to thapsigargin (Tg) in Ca<sup>2+</sup> free medium, a specific inhibitor of sarco/ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, was compared between control and Drp1 Trim-Away embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>). Drp1 depletion significantly reduced thapsigargin-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release and also caused significant variability between blastomeres of individual 2-cell embryos which was not seen in controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). These findings indicate that Drp1 depletion disrupts mitochondrial-ER interaction leading to compromised ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and that asymmetric inheritance of ER leads to further variability in Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores between daughter blastomeres.</p>

<p>More than half of the Drp1 Trim-Away embryos were arrested at the 2-cell stage, the vast majority of which did not enter the following M-phase, as assessed by the presence of the nuclear envelope (data not shown). Phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser10), localized in the heterochromatin region in G2-phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hendzel et al., 1997</xref>), was detected in 89% (16/18) of arrested embryos following Drp1 depletion (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that the majority of interphase arrests occur in the G2-phase. Since G2/M interphase arrest presumably activates a DNA damage checkpoint, we estimated DNA lesions by immunofluorescence of γH2AX, a widely used marker for DNA damage 46 h post hCG (corresponding to the G2-stage of the 2-cell stage). As expected, the number of γH2AX foci in Drp1-depleted embryos was significantly greater than that in control embryos (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are generated as byproducts of mitochondrial energy production, increases susceptibility to DNA damage.

<title>Misplaced mitochondria during the first cleavage division impair the assembly of parental chromosomes leading to binuclear formation</title>
<p>We observed that approximately 30% (17/53) of Drp1 Trim-Away embryos consisted of 3 or 4 blastomeres despite the first cleavage (indicated by arrowheads in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting that cleavage defects have occurred. Live imaging experiments showed that Drp1 Trim-Away embryos frequently display chromosome segregation defects. As a typical example, two pronuclei frequently fail to reach apposition but continue into mitosis and subsequently enter anaphase leading to binucleate blastomeres in the subsequent 2-cell embryo (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; Figure 5-Video 1). Immunostaining of metaphase zygotes showed that 55% (17/31) of Drp1-depleted zygotes formed two independent spindles with clustered microtubule organizing centers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Both confocal and EM images showed that large mitochondrial clumps occupied the central region in Drp1-depleted zygotes, to which two spindles were separately located (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Tracking of two sets of chromosomes with mitochondria following Drp1 depletion revealed that the mitochondrial aggregation caused by Drp1-depletion sits between the pronuclei and subsequent spindles such that the distance from chromosomes to the centre of the zygote is increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>).

In addition to the binucleation of blastomeres via dual spindle formation, other cell division abnormalities were apparent. In approximately half (24/43) of the zygotes, multiple cleavage furrows formed between the different sets of chromosomes leading to transient formation of three or four blastomeres, of which 42% (10/24) failed to complete cytokinesis and collapsed back to form binucleated 2-cell embryos (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref><bold>, </bold><xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>; Figure 5-Video 2).

<title>Mechanisms underlying symmetric mitochondrial inheritance in preimplantation embryos</title>
<p>To ensure proper partitioning of intracellular organelles for two functional daughter cells, cells undergo complex and coordinated remodeling of their cytoskeleton and membranes during cell division through mechanisms that are less well understood than chromosomal dynamics. As mitochondria are unique organelles with their own genomes, their biased inheritance is expected to have detrimental effects on daughter cell function. We showed that Drp1 mediates mitochondrial fragmentation and dispersion, enabling symmetric partitioning between daughter blastomeres stochastically, which is indispensable for healthy embryo development (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>Mitochondria that form a morphologically complex network and interact with microtubules at the interphase are rapidly fragmented upon mitotic entry, detached from the microtubules, and redistributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ball and Singer, 1982</xref>). Mitochondrial fission is activated via the phosphorylation of Drp1 during mitosis. Two mitotic kinases, CDK1 and Aurora A, activate Drp1, leading to enhanced mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yamano and Youle, 2011</xref>). As the cell exits mitosis, Drp1 is sumoylated and targeted for degradation to prevent mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Figueroa-Romero et al., 2009</xref>). Although it remains to be investigated whether these cell cycle-dependent modifications of Drp1 also occur in early embryos, mitochondria appear to be constitutively fragmented throughout the cell cycle. This unique mitochondrial morphology not only facilitates symmetric partitioning in cell division without cell growth, but also appears to be well-adapted to the rapid proliferation of single-cell zygotes into multicellular organisms before cell lineages specification. In asymmetrically dividing cells, functionally distinct mitochondria are unequally apportioned to influence daughter cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Katajisto et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, symmetric cell division is intended to produce identical daughter cells with comparable fates. In this context, the highly fragmented mitochondrial morphology in early embryos may contribute to avoid cell fate divergence, as well as fulfill metabolic homogeneity among blastomeres. Interestingly, the apparent morphological changes in mitochondria occur at the blastocyst stage, as elongated mitochondria are formed in trophectoderm (TE) cells, which is likely to be associated with altered energy metabolism in the TE lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). Considering that the transformation from eggs to embryos is a fundamental process in animal development involving changes such as the transition from meiotic to mitotic spindles and maternal to zygotic gene expression, changes in mitochondrial morphology and function may also play a role in regulating cell fate and function in the early embryo.</p>
<p>The cytoskeleton is a critical regulator of organelle positioning. In contrast to a uniformly distributed mitochondria throughout the cytoplasm during somatic cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Moore et al., 2021</xref>), mitochondria progressively accumulated around pronuclei and encircle the metaphase spindle of the first embryonic cleavage. Since the two pronuclei migrate from the periphery to the centre of the eggs by the F-actin-dependent mechanism to unite chromosomes on the first mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chaigne et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scheffler et al., 2021</xref>), actin filaments may drive the mitochondrial movement. In fact, mitochondrial distribution was closely associated with cytoplasmic F-actin organization in zygotes, especially at the metaphase. Although depolymerization of F-actin prior to metaphase led to asymmetric mitochondrial partitioning, the cell division itself was also asymmetric, probably due to failure of centering of the pronuclei. Given that the depletion of Myo19 did not affect the mitochondrial inheritance between daughter blastomeres, actin-based motor may not contribute the symmetric partitioning of mitochondria in cleavage embryos. This result is mostly consistent with previous observations in mitochondrial Rho GTPase (Miro) 1-deleted zygotes. Miro1 is localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane and the adaptor protein TRAK mediates the attachment of motor proteins to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lopez-Domenech et al., 2018</xref>). Miro also regulates Myo19, ensuring stability to actin-mediated mitochondrial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lopez-Domenech et al., 2018</xref>), and thus loss of Miro leads to asymmetric segregation of mitochondria during mitosis most likely due to reduced levels of Myo19. In Miro1-deleted zygotes, mitochondrial dynamics was partially disturbed, but this did not affect mitochondrial partitioning to daughter blastomeres, and fertility was normal as a result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, fragmented mitochondria may be primarily important for symmetric mitochondrial partitioning in cleavage embryos, as a less precise stochastic partitioning mechanism may be suitable or sufficient for equally partitioning of mitochondria, which are present in abundance and are located across the cell volume in oocytes/zygotes. Nevertheless, it is also worth considering the possibility that actin accumulated in mitochondria may be indirectly involved in mitochondrial dynamics via mitochondrial fission. For example, inverted formin 2 controls actin polymerization and has been reported to be required for efficient mitochondrial fission as an upstream function of Drp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

<title>The physiological roles of mitochondrial fission in preimplantation embryos</title>
<p>Inhibition of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission causes severe embryonic arrest. Given the housekeeping cellular functions of mitochondria, dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics may exert profound effects on the developmental competence of embryos. Mitochondrial dynamics are a highly regulated process, and when disrupted, can lead to cellular and tissue pathologies. The importance of mitochondrial fission has been intensively studied in animal cells, and emerging evidence suggests that Drp1-mediated fission participates in diverse cellular processes, including ER contacts, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, autophagy, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kraus et al., 2021</xref>). Drp1-KO mice are embryonic lethal, most likely due to brain, heart, and placental defects; however, various tissues appear normal, and cultured cell lines continue to proliferate even though mitochondria are unevenly segregated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ishihara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wakabayashi et al., 2009</xref>). Cells lacking Drp1 have highly elongated mitochondria that cannot be divided into transportable units, and typically accumulate in a limited area, leaving large parts of the cell devoid of mitochondria. This imbalanced distribution of mitochondria may fail to meet local energy demands and thus would be more manifest in large or extended cells, such as neurons and oocytes/zygotes. Moreover, our data demonstrated that Drp1 depletion in cleavage embryos caused biased mitochondrial inheritance and energy heterogeneity between blastomeres. Given the low levels of de novo mtDNA replication during preimplantation development, these biases may be further magnified by cleavage division progression. It is also noteworthy that we showed that mitochondrial aggregation induced by the loss of Drp1 disturbs the spatial organization of ER. The aggregated ER subdomains likely caused leakage of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, which may compromise the tethering functions at the ER MCSs. The precise mechanisms of 2-cell stage arrest arising from depletion of Drp1 remain elusive. It has been reported that Drp1 depletion during meiosis lead to premature chromosome segregation due to spindle assembly checkpoint defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Drp1-deficient cells has also been reported to cause replication stress, leading to DNA damage response and the G2/M cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Qian et al., 2012</xref>), which is more consistent with our observations. The presence of a Chk1-dependent checkpoint leading to G2 arrest in 2-cell mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ladstatter and Tachibana-Konwalski, 2016</xref>) suggests that this surveillance mechanism may be involve in the 2-cell arrest process in this study.</p>
<p>In the present study, we found frequent binucleation in Drp1-depleted embryos. Binucleation of early embryos is relatively common in human IVF procedures, but the mechanisms of its occurrence and association with the developmental competence of the embryo are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gomes Paim and FitzHarris, 2020</xref>). Reichmann et al. recently demonstrated that mouse zygotes form two functionally independent spindles before anaphase, and spatially separate parental genomes during the first cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Reichmann et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, failure to align the two spindles produced errors, resulting in binuclear formation in the 2-cell embryos. The present study demonstrates that clustered mitochondria in the central space of zygotes interfere with the assembly of two spindles, implying a potential contribution of the organelle misplacement to binucleation in human embryos.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial dynamics and quality control</title>
<p>The present study revealed the response to defective mitochondrial fission at the cellular level in early embryos, but the response at the organelle level remains to be elucidated. Mitochondria in oocytes, with hundreds of thousands of mtDNA copies, are maternally inherited after fertilization. The preservation and apportionment of healthy mtDNA in oocytes and early embryos is important for the inheritance of normal mtDNA in the offspring. Recent full-length mtDNA sequencing has identified de novo mtDNA mutations in oocytes, and their frequency increases with age, implying mtDNA turnover during meiotic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abrisch et al., 2020</xref>). Oocytes with severe mtDNA mutations can be eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fan et al., 2008</xref>), although the thresholds at which mtDNA mutations and the resulting mitochondrial dysfunction result in selection remain unclear. The autophagic elimination of mitochondria and mitophagy may also function as filters to segregate and eliminate pathogenic mtDNA mutations at the organelle level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>). An attractive model has been proposed for the Drosophila female germline, as fragmentation of the mitochondrial network facilitates mitophagy and allows selective elimination of defective mitochondria containing mutant mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lieber et al., 2019</xref>). Functional links between mitochondrial fission and removal of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy have also been documented in mammalian cells, as Drp1 deficiency causes mitochondrial dysfunction owing to the failure of a Drp1-dependent mechanism of mitophagy that removes damaged mitochondria within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Twig et al., 2008</xref>). The highly fragmented mitochondrial structure in mammalian oocytes/zygotes allows mtDNA to be sequestered in small units, which may be beneficial for eliminating mutation-impaired mitochondria for mitophagy. Furthermore, symmetric segregation of fragmented mitochondria might randomize mutant mtDNA among daughter blastomeres during embryonic cleavage to maintain tissue homeostasis. Elucidating the behavior of mutant mitochondria in early embryos is clinically meaningful. Mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT) is a promising approach to prevent the transmission of mtDNA disorders from mother to child, as pathogenic mutant mtDNA in mature oocytes or zygotes is replaced with normal mtDNA by nuclear transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hyslop et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kang et al., 2016</xref>). A potential problem with MRT is that a small fraction of patients’ mtDNA is inevitably carried over into the reconstructed oocytes or zygotes (approximately 1 to 4%, respectively). It has been noted that these low levels of mutant mtDNA may predominantly expand during post-implantation embryogenesis, suggesting a rapid shift to one mtDNA haplotype during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is important to investigate the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the regulation of mtDNA mutations in the preimplantation embryo, and whether mitochondrial fission contributes to reducing the mutational load.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study investigates the role of Drp1 in early embryo development. The authors have addressed most of the original comments and the work now presents <bold>convincing</bold> evidence on how this protein influences mitochondrial localization and partitioning during the first embryonic divisions. The research employs the Trim-Away technique to eliminate Drp1 in zygotes, revealing critical insights into mitochondrial clustering, spindle formation, and embryonic development.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Gekko, Nomura et al., show that Drp1 elimination in zygotes using the Trim-Away technique leads to mitochondrial clustering and uneven mitochondrial partitioning during the first embryonic cleavage, resulting in embryonic arrest. They monitor organellar localization and partitioning using specific targeted fluorophores. They also describe the effects of mitochondrial clustering in spindle formation and the detrimental effect of uneven mitochondrial partitioning to daughter cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have gathered solid evidence for the uneven segregation of mitochondria upon Drp1 depletion through different means: mitochondrial labelling, ATP labelling and mtDNA copy number assessment in each daughter cell. Authors have also characterised the defects in cleavage mitotic spindles upon Drp1 loss</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study convincingly describes the phenotype seen upon Drp1 loss. Further studies should be conducted to elucidate the mechanism by which Drp1 ensures even mitochondrial partitioning during the first embryonic cleavage.</p>

<p>Gekko et al investigate the impact of perturbing mitochondrial during early embryo development, through modulation of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 using Trim-Away technology. They aimed to validate a role for mitochondrial dynamics in modulating chromosomal segregation, mitochondrial inheritance and embryo development and achieve this through the examination of mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum distribution, as well as actin filament involvement, using targeted plasmids, molecular probes and TEM in pronuclear stage embryos through the first cleavages divisions. Drp1 deletion perturbed mitochondrial distribution, leading to asymmetric partitioning of mitochondria to the 2-cell stage embryo, prevented appropriate chromosomal segregation and culminated in embryo arrest. Resultant 2-cell embryos displayed altered ATP, mtDNA and calcium levels. Microinjection of Drp1 mRNA partially rescued embryo development. A role for actin filaments in mitochondrial inheritance is described, however the actin-based motor Myo19 does not appear to contribute.</p>
<p>Overall, this study builds upon their previous work and provides further support for a role of mitochondrial dynamics in mediating chromosomal segregation and mitochondrial inheritance. In particular, Drp1 is required for the redistribution of mitochondria to support symmetric partitioning and ongoing development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is well designed, the methods are appropriate and the results are clearly presented. The findings are nicely summarised in a schematic.</p>
<p>The addition of further quantification, including mitochondrial cluster size, elongation/aspect ratio and ROS, as requested by the reviewers, has provided further evidence for the impact of Drp1 depletion on mitochondrial morphology and function.</p>
<p>Understanding the role of mitochondria in binucleation and mitochondrial inheritance is of clinical relevance for patients undergoing infertility treatment, particularly those undergoing mitochondrial replacement therapy.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The only remaining weakness is that the authors have not undertaken additional experiments to clarify any role for mitochondrial transport following Drp1 depletion.</p>

<p>Why mitochondria are finely maintained in the female germ cell (oocyte), zygotes, and preimplantation embryos? Mitochondrial fusion seems beneficial in somatic cells to compensate for unhealthy mitochondria, for example, mitochondria with mutated mtDNA that potentially defuel the respiratory activity if accumulated above a certain threshold. However, in the germ cells, it may rather increase the risk of transmitting mutated mtDNA to the next generation. Also, finely maintained mitochondria would also be beneficial for efficient removal when damaged, as the authors briefly discussed. Due in part to the limited suitable model, physiological role of mitochondrial fission in embryos were obscure. In this study, authors demonstrated that mitochondrial fission prevents multiple adverse outcomes, especially including the aberrant demixing of parental genome (a clinical phenotype of human embryos) in zygotic stage. Thus, this study would be also of clinical importance that could contribute by proposing a novel mechanism.</p>
<p>The authors have adequately indicated the limitations at each of the specific points. The revisions the authors made have consolidated their conclusion, thus still, making this study an excellent one.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors have taken into consideration and addressed all my previous comments.</p>
<p>This referee has one major concern remaining: although the authors have refined their analysis of mitochondrial morphology, my concern regarding the characterization of mitochondria in Drp1-depleted zygotes as &quot;elongated&quot; persists.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Taking into account this reviewers' comment, the following description has been changed. Line 256-257: “Quantification of the aspect ratio (major axis/minor axis) suggests that mitochondria are significantly elongated in Drp1-depleted embryos&quot; to “The mean aspect ratio (major axis/minor axis) increased slightly from 1.36 in control to 1.66 in Drp1-depleted embryos .&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The morphological analysis of mitochondria reveals that both axes increase in length. Yet, the aspect ratio it is virtually unchanged, at least in biologically relevant terms, if not statistically.</p>
<p>- Please calculate and represent mitochondrial aspect ratio as major axis/minor axis in fig 2M.</p>
<p>- Could the authors also display individual data points in the graphs of Figure 2 K, L and M?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the graph display format in accordance with the reviewer's suggestions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors provide PMID: 25264261 as an example, yet mitochondria in PMID: 35704569 are apparently elongated. Judging by the authors discussion about the differences between these two studies, it would be enriching to comment, in the discussion of the manuscript, on the differences in morphology and to the reason why these might arise</p>
<p>This referee believes that the unconventional mitochondrial morphology upon fission inhibition, reported here, enhances the relevance of the study and raises questions that could promote novel research lines, if thoroughly discussed in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful suggestion. However, since the latter paper (PMID: 35704569) lacks EM images, it would be difficult to accurately assess the elongation. Thus, we would like to reconsider the mitochondrial morphological changes in zygotes caused by Drp1 deletion levels based on the results of future research.</p>

<p>(1) Labels for the staining used are missing in figure 1-figure supplement 1</p>
<p>(2) Line 218. Could the intended sentence be:</p>
<p>&quot;Live imaging of mitochondria (mt-GFP) and chromosomes (H2B-mCherry) in Myo19 depleted zygotes shows symmetric distribution and partitioning of mitochondria during the first embryonic cleavage (Figure 1-figure supplement 2A, 2B; Figure 1-Video 2).&quot;</p>
<p>(3) Figure 2M: Please calculate and represent mitochondrial aspect ratio as major axis/minor axis.</p>
<p>(4) Include a label with the experimental condition in figure 1 fig supp 2.</p>
<p>(5) Line 592: missing reference.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your careful correction. We have corrected all the points the reviewer pointed out in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors have sufficiently revised the manuscript to accommodate the majority of suggestions provided by myself and the other reviewers. While it would have been useful to see further clarity around mitochondrial transport, the data presented provide valuable insight into the role of a mitochondrial dynamics regulator in mediating the first mitosis event in embryo development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank again reviewer 2 for the helpful comment. We would like to address the issue of (aggregated) mitochondrial transport, including analysis methods, as a future challenge.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>After reading through the comments of other reviewers, what authors could potentially improve their manuscript had been largely summarized in three following points.</p>
<p>(1) Authors would better clarify whether a loss of Drp1 contributes to the chromosome segregation defects directly (e.g. checking SAC-like activity) or indirectly (aggregated mitochondria became physically obstacle; maybe in part getting the cytoskeleton involved).</p>
<p>(2) Although the level of Myo19 may not be so high (given the low level of TRAK2 in oocytes: Lee et al. PNAS 2024, PMID 38917013), authors would better further clarify the effect of Myo19-Trim with timelapse (e.g. EB3-GFP/Mt-DsRed) and EM analysis (detailed mitochondrial architecture).</p>
<p>(3) Authors would better clarify phenotypic heterogeneity/variety regarding the degree of alteration in mitochondrial morphology/ architecture dependent on the levels of Drp1 loss with detailed quantification of EM images to address why aggregation of mitochondria in Drp1-/- parthenote (possibly, more likely Drp1 protein-free) looks different/weaker than Trim-awayed one. Employment of the parthenotes of Trim-awayed MII oocytes might also complement the further discussion.</p>
<p>The revised preprinted have addressed all the points described above. Authors have also adequately indicated the limitations at each of the specific points. Revisions authors made have consolidated their conclusion, thus still, making this study an excellent one.The only remaining weakness is that the authors have not undertaken additional experiments to clarify any role for mitochondrial transport following Drp1 depletion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank again reviewer 3 for the insightful comments. We would like to address the comments you have raised (points that were unclear in this study) as issues for future study.</p>
