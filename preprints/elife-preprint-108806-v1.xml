<abstract><p>The Mediator complex is an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional coactivator with well-characterized structure and function, though the roles of its dissociable subunits remain incompletely defined. Here, we demonstrate that Mediator subunit MED16 dissociates from the core complex to form a subcomplex with transcription factors UBP1 and TFCP2, and this interaction modulates transcriptional activation or repression in a context-dependent manner. Using protein purification coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified MED16 as a binding partner of UBP1-TFCP2. Gene expression analyses showed that UBP1 interacts with MED16 to activate a subset of silenced genes involved in lung homeostasis, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation. Conversely, the MED16-UBP1 interaction suppresses HIV-1 transcription, thereby reinforcing viral latency. Mechanistically, MED16 and UBP1 cooperatively bind the HIV-1 transcriptional start site (TSS) to inhibit preinitiation complex assembly. Genomic-scale analyses further demonstrated that transcription is activated when the UBP1-TFCP2 binding motif is proximal to the TSS, but repressed when the motif overlaps the TSS. Collectively, our findings identify a novel MED16-UBP1 interaction, define its dual role in transcriptional regulation, and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting this axis in HIV-1 infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The canonical model for eukaryotic gene transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is that transcription factors recruit co-activators and RNA Pol II. Together, they are assembled into the pre-initiation complex (PIC) along with general transcription factors (GTFs) at a gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Among several kinds of co-activators reported, the multi-subunit Mediator complex has emerged as an essential co-activator that promotes PIC formation and activity.</p>
<p>The Mediator complex is composed of ∼30 subunits in mammals and structurally divided into four modules: Head, Middle, Tail, and Kinase. The scaffold subunit MED14 joins the Tail, Middle, and Head modules together to form the “core Mediator”. The tail module is composed of MED15, MED16, MED23, MED24, MED25, MED27, MED28, MED29, and MED30; and the main function of the tail module is to provide an interactional platform for transcription factors to recruit Mediator complex to gene promoters and enhancers for further regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Among all tail subunits, MED16, MED23, MED24, and MED25 form a submodule that accounts for ∼70% molecular weight of the tail module and creates a large platform for interactions of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Previous studies have found MED23 interacts with multiple transcriptional factors and controls diverse gene expression programs at multiple stages of transcription processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). It prompts us to question whether other subunits in this submodule also play similar roles in transcriptional regulation, especially MED16 that is structurally conserved from yeast to mammals and acts as a critical regulator in yeast and plants. Sin4 (yeast MED16) plays both positive and negative roles in the transcriptional regulation of many genes in yeast, and loss of Sin4 alters chromatin accessibility globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). In plant cells, MED16 controls endoreduplication and cell growth by repressing the expression of APC/C activator genes <italic>CCS52A1/A2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). MED16 also controls plant cold response, chemical and wound response, and iron homeostasis at transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). However, the functions of MED16 in mammalian cells are poorly understood. Among a few reports, MED16 was reported as a key factor in NRF2-activted gene expression via its direct interaction with NRF2. Knockout of MED16 reduces NRF2-dependent anti-oxidative gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Additionally, MED16 was down-regulated in papillary thyroid cancer, leading to increased TGF-β signaling and radioiodine resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Though the exact molecular mechanisms by which MED16 regulates gene expression are poorly understood. Its roles in animal development and diseases are barely investigated.</p>
<p>UBP1 (as known as LBP-1) and TFCP2 (as known as LSF) belong to a subfamily of the TFCP2/Grainyhead transcription factors family. The amino acid sequences of TFCP2 and UBP1 share 88% identity, while TFCP2 and TFCP2L1 share 70% identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). UBP1 and TFCP2 bind to the same consensus sequence CNRG-N6-CNR(G/C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). They function as a transcription activator or repressor to regulate a number of viral and cellular genes, including mouse <italic>α-Globin</italic>, <italic>MMP-9</italic>, <italic>CYP11A1</italic>, <italic>IL-4</italic>, SV-40, and HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). UBP1 and TFCP2 are involved in various biological processes, including embryonic development, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and HIV-1 latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). There is a canonical UBP1 binding motif within the HIV-1 core promoter which overlaps with the transcription start site (TSS). Previous studies have reported that UBP1 inhibits the binding of TFIID to the TATA-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). On the other hand, UBP1 restricts HIV-1 transcription at the level of elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). UBP1 also has been demonstrated to inhibit HIV-1 transcription by recruiting YY1 and HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). However, how UBP1 and TFCP2 regulate cellular gene expression, and what are the genome-wide target genes of UBP1 and TFCP2 still remain unclear.</p>
<p>In this study we identified a tripartite complex consisting of UBP1, TFCP2, and MED16 utilizing gel-filtration chromatography and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS). MED16 interacts with UBP1 to activate expression of an array of endogenous genes, including several pulmonary surface molecules. In addition, MED16 cooperates with UBP1 to inhibit HIV-1 transcription at the HIV-1transcription initiation site. At the genomic scale, we found out that UBP1 activates gene expression when the UBP1-TFCP2 binding motif is located near TSS, but inhibits gene expression by obstructing normal PIC formation when the UBP1-TFCP2 binding motif overlaps with TSS. Based on these results, we propose a dual functional model of MED16 in gene transcriptional control, and provided the underlying mechanisms of UBP1-repression on the HIV-1 genome, which implying a strategy for HIV-1 therapeutics.</p>

<title>Identification of the dissociable MED16 from the Mediator complex</title>
<p>The Mediator complex consists of large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and lacks predictable functional motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). The Mediator complex forms liquid-liquid phase separation condensates at super-enhancers. These IDR-mediated condensates can be disrupted by 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), an aliphatic alcohol, via inhibition of weak hydrophobic protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether 1,6-hexanediol affects the integrity of the Mediator complex, we utilized three antibodies against different Mediator subunits (CDK8, MED1 and MED12) to immunoprecipitate the Mediator complex from the 293T whole cell lysates, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were washed by washing buffers containing different concentrations (0%, 5%, 10%) of 1,6-hexanediol and blotted by antibodies against different Mediator components. Most of the detected subunits show modest decreases, whereas MED16 exhibits a pronounced reduction in response to increasing 1,6-hexanediol treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). To further confirm this observation, a similar experiment was performed in HeLa nuclear extract (NE) with 2,5-hexanediol as a control treatment. As an isomer of 1,6-hexanediol, 2,5-hexanediol does not interfere weak hydrophobic interaction due to the different positions of oxhydryls. Once again, the amount of immunoprecipitated MED16 was easily decreased by 1,6-hexanediol treatment but not by 2,5-hexanediol treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting that MED16 is an easily dissociable subunit.</p>

<p>(A) Co-IP experiment with antibodies against endogenous CDK8, MED1, and MED12 in 293T whole cell lysis. The resultant immunoprecipitates were washed by washing buffers containing 0%, 5%, and 10% of 1,6-hexanediol respectively. Input: 0.5% of the total lysate was loaded. (B) Co-IP experiment with antibodies against endogenous CDK8, MED1, and MED12 in HeLa nuclear extract. The resultant immunoprecipitates were washed by washing buffers containing 10% of 1,6-hexanediol or 10% 2,5-hexanediol. Input: 0.2% of the total HeLa nuclear extract was loaded. (C) Co-IP experiment with antibodies against endogenous MED1 in 293T whole cell lysis. The resultant immunoprecipitated was washed by washing buffers containing 150 mM, 300 mM, and 500 mM of NaCl respectively. Input: 0.2% of the total HeLa nuclear extract was loaded. (D) Gel filtration chromatography of HeLa nuclear extract. 500µl HeLa nuclear extract was applied to Superose 6 column then was run in Buffer D. Column fractions of 500µl were collected. The Void (void volumn) of Superose 6 is based on the volume of effluent required for the elution of blue dextran (molecular mass of ∼2000 kDa). The molecular weight of corresponding fractions was detected by protein standards. (E) Immunoblots of anti-MED16 immunoprecipitation in HeLa nuclear extract and gel filtration factions No.29 to No.31. The immunoprecipitated proteins were detected with indicated antibodies by western blotting. HeLa NE input: 0.2% of the total HeLa nuclear extract was loaded. (F) Immunoblots of anti-TFCP2 immunoprecipitation in HeLa nuclear extract and gel filtration factions No.29 to No.31.

<p>We then immunoprecipitated the Mediator complex with MED1 antibody in high salt condition to test whether the binding of MED16 to Mediator complex is charge dependent. The amount of immunoprecipitated MED16 remained unaltered under 150 mM, 300 mM and 500 mM NaCl conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). These observations suggest that MED16 is integrated into the Mediator complex through weak hydrophobic interaction but not ionic interaction.</p>
<p>To directly examine if MED16 is dissociable from the Mediator complex, we applied HeLa NE to Superose 6 gel-filtration column and separated Mediator subunits within each fraction that were then detected by immunoblotting. Most Mediator subunits, including MED16, were co-eluted at the fraction at about 2,000 kDa, suggesting these fractions contain the integrated Mediator complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). However, a significant amount of MED16 was eluted at the fraction between 443 kDa and 150 kDa, away from other core Mediator subunits, indicating MED16 within this fraction is not part of the core Mediator complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). MED16 subunit may be able to dissociate from the Mediator complex because the interaction between Mediator and MED16 is an unstable hydrophobic interaction.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>MED16 interacts with UBP1 and TFCP2 in vivo and in vitro</title>
<p>Because MED16 is about 95 kDa and eluted at the HeLa NE gel-filtration fractions between 443 kDa and 150 kDa, MED16 may form a higher molecular mass complex with other proteins. To identify the proteins associated with MED16, we performed immunoprecipitation-coupled mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis using antibodies against four Mediator subunits, including MED1, MED12, CDK8 and MED16, respectively. Forty-two proteins were identified as exclusively interacting with MED16 in IP-MS data. Among these, two dimeric transcription factors, UBP1 and TFCP2 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>), were found to be co-eluted with the dissociable MED16 in gel filtration chromatography (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). This suggests that UBP1 and TFCP2 interact with the dissociated MED16 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether UBP1 and TFCP2 form a complex with MED16, an antibody specific to MED16 was used to capture MED16 and its associated proteins in HeLa NE or HeLa NE gel-filtration fractions between 443 kDa and 150 kD. MED1, MED23, TFCP2 and UBP1 were co-immunoprecipitated with MED16 in HeLa NE, but only TFCP2 and UBP1 were co-immunoprecipitated with MED16 in NE fractions between 443KDa and 150KD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). Reciprocally, anti-TFCP2 antibody is also able to pull down MED16 in either HeLa NE or 443KDa-150KDa fractions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). YY1 and HDAC1 are known to complex with TFCP2 and UBP1 to suppress HIV-1 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). YY1 was pulled down in both samples, whereas only a small amount of HDAC1 was pulled down from HeLa NE but not from the 443KDa to 150KD fractions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Because TFCP2 and UBP1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with MED16 and other core Mediator subunits, we examined whether TFCP2 and UBP1 interact with the Mediator complex. Both the TFCP2 and UBP1 were co-imunoprecipitated with Mediator complex under the 2,5-hexanediol treatment, whereas their association with Mediator complex was abolished under treatment with 1,6-hexanediol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). These results suggest that TFCP2 and UBP1 are complexed with MED16 in vivo and dissociate from the Mediator complex, possibly along with the dissociation of MED16.</p>
<p>To extend the analysis of the MED16 subcomplex, a domain-mapping experiment with deletions of multiple structural domains of MED16 was carried out. The N-terminal of MED16 contains nine WD40-repeat (WDR) domains that form a seven-bladed β-propeller structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). This structure appears to be crucial for MED16’s integration into the Mediator complex, as MED16 with WDR-deletion shows a dosage-dependent effect on its association with Mediator complex (as indicated by MED1 here); in details, this association gradually decreased as more WDR domains are truncated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). The C-terminal of MED16 harbors an αβ-domain with 157 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) and the MED16 truncated mutant without αβ-domain failed to interact with UBP1-TFCP2 (as indicated by TFCP2 here) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Therefore, the N-terminal WDR domain of MED16 is crucial for its integration into the Mediator complex, while the C-terminal αβ-domain is essential for interacting with UBP1-TFCP2.</p>

<p>We conducted a GST pull-down experiment to assess the direct interaction between individual transcription factors and MED16. We expressed and purified UBP1, TFCP2, YY1, and TFCP2L1 that were fused with 6×His tag using bacterial (<italic>E.coli</italic>) expression system (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Transcription factor CP2 like 1 (TFCP2L1), a paralog of TFCP2, was included for comparison. Due the solubility issue with full length MED16, we purified only GST-fused C-terminal αβ-domain of MED16 (GST-M16αβ) that comprises 157 amino acids. GST-M16αβ exhibited the strongest binding to recombinant UBP1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), suggesting that UBP1 binds to MED16 directly.</p>
<p>The amino acid sequences of UBP1 and TFCP2 share 88% identity, we investigated why UBP1, but not TFCP2, directly binds to MED16. Through comparison of the amino acid sequences of UBP1 and TFCP2, we found that a 36-amino-acid-long sequence between the DNA binding domain and SAM motif is specific to UBP1 (UBP1-SP) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). To test if UBP1-SP is responsible for interacting with MED16, a UBP1 domain-mapping experiment was performed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). The full-length Flag-tagged UBP1 successfully pulled down endogenous TFCP2 and MED16. In contrast, the SAM motif-deleted UBP1 truncated mutant could only bind to MED16 modestly, and failed to bind to TFCP2. DNA binding domain of UBP1 (DBD) didn’t bind either MED16 or TFCP2 at all. These results indicate that MED16 complexes with UBP1 and TFCP2 in vivo and in vitro, and that the UBP1-SP domain is crucial for the interaction with MED16.</p>

<title>MED16 is required for UBP1 activation of gene transcription</title>
<p>Because the interaction between transcription factors and Mediator subunits is critical for target gene activation, we analyzed if MED16 is required for UBP1-driven gene transcription using reporter gene assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). In the UBP1 overexpression assay, the full-length UBP1 protein significantly promoted transcriptional activation. However, the DNA-binding domain of UBP1 (DBD, 1-274aa) alone was unable to activate the reporter. The truncated UBP1 mutant (ΔS, 1-369aa), which contains the MED16 binding motif but lacks the TFCP2-binding SAM motif, exhibited about half the transcriptional activation when compared to the full-length UBP1 (FL) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>To further confirm that MED16 is required for the transcriptional activity of UBP1, a HeLa cell line with MED16 knockdown was generated using viral-mediated shRNA targeting MED16, along with a negative control cell line (sh-NC). The UBP1-responsive reporter showed similar baseline of transcriptional activity in the two cell lines. The reporter was activated about 4-fold by overexpressing UBP1 in the negative control cell line, whereas knockdown of MED16 attenuated the activation to approximately two-fold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>The coding sequences of human <italic>MED16</italic> and Mouse <italic>Med16</italic> share about 90% identity. Thus, we further established a <italic>Med16</italic> knockout cell line generated using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing method in a mouse pancreatic cancer cell line called HT. Five <italic>Med16</italic> knockout clones (ko16a, ko16b, ko16c, ko16d, &amp; ko16e), with different frameshift mutations were selected and verified by sequencing and Western-Blotting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). All <italic>Med16</italic>-KO clones displayed 2-7-fold reduced reporter activity under ectopic UBP1 activation when compared to the wildtype HT cells, and <italic>Med16</italic> KO also exhibited decreased basal level of UBP1-reporter activity without UBP1 overexpression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). These results confirmed the specific requirement of MED16 for UBP1 transcriptional activation.</p>
<p>To further verify the specific regulation of UBP1 activity by MED16, we performed a titration experiment by co-transfected low and high doses of MED16 or MED16△αβ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, truncation “9”) with the UBP1-luciferase reporter. It has been reported that overexpression of Mediator subunits can result in inhibition of transcription owing to competition between the overexpressed subunits and the Mediator complex for the transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). In agreement with these results, UBP1 luciferase reporter activity tended to be increasingly repressed by MED16 in a dosage-dependent manner. In contrast, MED16△αβ, which cannot interact with UBP1, failed to repress the luciferase reporter activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). These findings highlight a specific coupling between MED16 and UBP1 in activating gene transcription.</p>
<p>The UBP1-TFCP2 hetero-dimerization is important for UBP1-responsive reporter transcription as it is shown above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). We then tested whether UBP1, TFCP2, and MED16 had a combinatorial effect on gene transcription. UBP1 and TFCP2 co-overexpression had better (from 9.8 times of basic level to 12 times of basic level) transcriptional activity than UBP1 alone, but MED16 co-overexpression reduced UBP1’s activity in all of our combinations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>). Together, the results of the UBP1-responsive reporter suggested that MED16 is required for UBP1 activation of gene transcription.</p>

<p>To explore the potential biological processes that are co-regulated by MED16 and UBP1, 198 co-regulated genes by MED16 and UBP1 were subjected to gene ontology (GO) analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). Interestingly, GO analysis revealed that the genes involved in the respiratory gaseous exchange process were regulated by MED16 and UBP1, such as <italic>SFTPA1, SFTPA2, SFTPB</italic>, and <italic>SFTPC</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). These genes encode pulmonary surfactant associated proteins that promote alveolar stability by lowering the surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the peripheral air spaces. They are normally only expressed in alveolar epithelial cells and silenced in HeLa cells. However, highly matched UBP1 motifs were identified in their promoters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>), leading to their activation when UBP1 was overexpressed. In our analysis, angiogenesis and cellular response to VEGF stimulus are also enriched in GO analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), which is consistent with the previous report that UBP1 plays a critical role in the regulation of extraembryonic angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>).

<p>Previous research has shown that overexpression of UBP1 or YY1 inhibits HIV-1 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Consistently, we found our HIV-1 reporter’s activity was reduced by overexpressing either UBP1 or YY1 in HeLa cells, validating our reporter’s response to UBP1 and YY1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). We then tested if MED16 participates the UBP1-driving HIV-1 transcription repression. We observed that overexpression of MED16 inhibited HIV-luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). However, the MED16 mutant with the UBP1 interacting αβ-domain deleted failed to inhibit HIV-1 reporter despite similar increase in the dosage of transfected MED16△ αβ (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). This result demonstrated that MED16-mediated HIV-1 inhibition depends on its binding to UBP1.</p>
<p>To see if this HIV-1 inhibition is MED16 specific, MED23 and MED24 that are part of the Mediator complex tail module neighboring MED16 were cotransfected with the HIV-1 reporter, respectively. Neither MED23 nor MED24 showed any effect on the activity of the HIV-1 reporter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>), thus underscoring the specific role of MED16 in repressing HIV-1 transcription. Moreover, MED16 knockdown by sh-RNA also modestly increased HIV-1 luciferase activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrated that MED16 collaborates with UBP1 to inhibit HIV-1 transcription.</p>

<title>UBP1 binding site determines the UBP1-MED16 inhibition in HIV-1 transcription</title>
<p>In a previous study, UBP1 was shown to inhibit HIV-1 transcription by recruiting YY1 and HDAC1 (Coull et al., 2000). To investigate if MED16 employs a similar mechanism to repress HIV-1 transcription, we transfected HeLa cells with an HIV-1 reporter and treated them with panobinostat, a pan-HDAC inhibitor. Western blot analysis showed increased acetylation of histone H3 (H3ac) upon panobinostat treatment (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2A</xref>). However, this treatment did not reverse MED16-mediated inhibition of HIV-driven luciferase activity (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2A</xref>). These results suggest that MED16 does not rely on HDAC-mediated histone deacetylation to inhibit HIV-1 transcription and involves alternative mechanisms to repress HIV-1 transcription.</p>
<p>We then questioned whether the cis regulatory elements in the HIV-1 promoter are necessary for MED16-mediated inhibition. To address this question, we first examined whether the transactivating response region (TAR) plays a role in MED16-mediated HIV-1 inhibition HIV-1 inhibition. TAR is transcribed into TAR RNA, which recruits the host pTEFb-containing super elongation complex (SEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) to mediate the activation of viral protein Tat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). UBP1 has been reported to restrict HIV-1 transcription at the level of elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). A TAR RNA mutation HIV-1 reporter was created by replacing TAR loop nucleotides 31-34 UGGG with CAAA, which reduces binding affinity of Tat:P-TEFb and abolishes the function of TAR RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). We observed that MED16 inhibited both wild-type and TAR-mutant reporter’s transcription, while mutated TAR attenuated UBP1-mediated inhibition (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2C</xref>). This result suggested that MED16-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 is independent of the TAR-mediated HIV-1 transcriptional elongation.</p>
<p>HIV-1 proximal promoter has a string of GC-box that is bound by SP1, and an AP4 binding site between TATA-box and TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). We then examined whether these two transcription factors interact with MED16 for transcription repression. A reporter driven by 4×GC-box was co-transfected with the MED16 expression plasmid, but no significant inhibition was observed compared with co-transfecting with the control vector (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2D</xref>), suggesting no cross-talk between MED16 and Sp1 (GC-box). Then we mutated the AP-4 binding motif CAGCTG to CAGTCG (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2E</xref>) to abolish AP-4 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Overexpressing MED16 inhibited the luciferase activity, regardless AP-4 binding status, suggesting that MED16 and AP-4 don’t work together to inhibit the HIV-1 transcription.</p>
<p>We then tested if the UBP1-MED16 inhibition of HIV-1 transcription is due to the direct UBP1 binding at the transcription started site (TSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). To test this hypothesis, two chimera reporters were created. Both are driven by a chicken <italic>β-ACTIN</italic> promoter. We replaced the native TSS site of the first reporter (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>) with the HIV-1 TSS contains the UBP1 binding site, while the second (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>) featured a chicken <italic>β-ACTIN</italic> promoter and a standard UBP1 binding site placed upstream of it. Various truncated mutants of MED16 and UBP1 were co-transfected with these reporters, respectively. In the case of the first chimera reporter, transcription was inhibited by full-length MED16 and MED16-bound UBP1 variants, but not by UBP1-binding deficient MED16 or MED16-binding deficient UBP1. Conversely, transcription of the second chimera reporter was not inhibited by any MED16 or UBP1 variants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Additionally, comparison of transcription activities between the two reporters revealed that the first chimera exhibited approximately 50% lower transcription activity than the second (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). These findings suggest that the positioning of the UBP1 binding site could be critical for MED16-mediated transcriptional repression.</p>

<p>We then investigated whether the position-dependent function of UBP1 also influenced UBP1-regulated endogenous gene expression across the human genome. To explore this, we analyzed the correlation between the relative binding position of UBP1 to TSS and gene transcription levels. We selected the top 50 upregulated and top 50 downregulated transcripts under UBP1 overexpression and analyzed the enrichment of the UBP1 motif around their promoters. Notably, UBP1-activated transcripts showed significant enrichment of the UBP1 motif upstream and downstream of the TSS, while UBP1-repressed transcripts exhibited motif enrichment specifically overlapping the TSS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Two UBP1-inhibited gene: <italic>KIFC1</italic> and <italic>GTF2H4</italic>, were found to have their TSS overlapping with UBP1 binding motif (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>).

<p>Med16 overexpression altered both PIC formation and transcription initiation stages of the immobilized template transcription process (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). During the PIC forming stage, there was a decreased binding of CDK8, a key component of the Mediator kinase module. After transcription initiated, the signal for PolII pSer5, a well-known marker of transcription initiation, was reduced in MED16 OE NE compared to the WT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Additionally, other Mediator subunits, such as MED12 from the kinase module, Med1 from the middle module, and MED23 from the tail module, exhibited decreased binding after transcription was initiated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Moreover, Med16 overexpression prolonged the binding of general transcription factor TFIIB, which should be released after transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Consequently, the Luciferase mRNA level in the MED16 OE was only 55% of that in the WT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>).

Several transcription factors, including TFCP2, UBP1, and YY1 were co-immunoprecipitated with MED16 within these fractions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>E and 1F). Although these proteins were isolated from the Mediator complex in gel-filtration chromatography, they functionally relied on the Mediator complex since the WDR-deleted MED16, which cannot interact with UBP1, failed to repress HIV-1 activation (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3B</xref>). MED16 interacts with UBP1 to activate the expression of an array of endogenous genes. In the previous studies, UBP1 deficiency results in lethality at midgestation due to the prominent angiogenic defect observed in the mutant placentas and allantoic blood vessels fail to penetrate deeply and branch into the complex embryonic vasculature characteristic of the normal placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), which is consistent with our GO analysis that UBP1 and MED16 control angiogenesis gene expression. Unexpectedly, pulmonary surface molecule genes were also regulated by UBP1 and MED16. These gene encode pulmonary surfactant associated proteins, typically expressed in alveolar epithelial cells but silenced in HeLa cells. However, UBP1 overexpression activated them, likely due to the well-matched UBP1 motifs in their promoters.</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated UBP1’s role in inhibiting HIV-1 transcription through various mechanisms, including epigenetic and elongational regulation. However, our investigation proposes a novel mechanism where the MED16-UBP1 complex inhibits HIV-1 transcription by preventing PIC formation at the HIV-1 TSS. This inhibition is specific to the position of the UBP1 binding site, with transcription being repressed when UBP1 binds to its site within a TSS and activated when UPB1 binds to its site either upstream or downstream of a TSS. This finding highlights the importance of binding site positioning in transcriptional control, which is often overlooked in past studies. The position-dependent function of transcription factors (TFs) relative to the TSS is supported by a recent study demonstrating how TF binding site’s spatial configuration can lead to distinct gene regulatory outcomes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>) showed that the effect of TF binding on transcription initiation is highly position-dependent. TFs such as NRF1, NFY, and Sp1 activate or repress transcription depending on their exact position relative to the TSS. Our findings with the MED16-UBP1 complex align with this because UBP1 activates transcription when binding upstream or downstream of the TSS but represses it when binding directly at the TSS.</p>
<p>Targeted inhibition of HIV-1 transcription, particularly through enhancing the silencing activity of UBP1-MED16 at the viral transcription start site (TSS), presents a promising strategy for HIV-1 therapy. Many current approaches focus on inhibiting key regulatory proteins crucial for HIV-1 transcription (Ophinni et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2023; Yeh et al., 2020). By strengthening the UBP1-MED16 interaction or increasing MED16’s affinity for the HIV-1 TSS, it may be possible to achieve more effective and stable transcriptional silencing, which could reduce viral expression over prolonged periods. In the future, small molecule drug screening can be conducted targeting the enhancement of this interaction, and the obtained small molecules could be used in combination with existing antiretroviral therapies (ART) to enhance therapeutic efficacy (Pai et al., 2021; Sorokina et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Interestingly, a small peptide fragment of MED16 has the opposing effect of activating HIV-1 transcription while potentially blocking the endogenous UBP1-MED16 interaction (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3C</xref>). By manipulating the expressing form of MED16, we can create a multi-faceted therapeutic tool that enables flexible regulation of HIV-1 transcription based on specific therapeutic needs. For instance, expressing the full-length MED16 could enhance the efficacy of antiretroviral therapies (ART), while expressing the MED16 αβ-domain peptide could support &quot;shock-and-kill&quot; strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) by reactivating latent HIV-1, thereby enabling immune clearance or targeted antiretroviral intervention in previously hidden reservoirs. Together, these dual capabilities of MED16 position it as a versatile approach in the treatment of HIV-1.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Characterization of a dissociable Mediator subunit implicated in cellular pathways, particularly lung alveolar function, and HIV latency is conceptually interesting.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this study are:</p>
<p>(1) Demonstration of MED16 dissociation from the core Mediator complex and formation of a subcomplex containing MED16, upstream-binding protein 1 (UBP1), and transcription factor cellular promoter 2 (TFCP2) by elegant biochemical fractionation and immunoblotting analysis.</p>
<p>(2) Defining nine N-terminal WD-40 repeats (WDRs) of MED16 as a Mediator-incorporating module and the C-terminal ⍺β-domain (157 amino acids) important for interaction with the UBP1-TFCP2 heterodimeric complex.</p>
<p>(3) Illustration of a weak hydrophobic interaction between MED16 and the Mediator core that could be disrupted by 1,6-hexanediol, but not by its 2,5-hexanediol isomer nor by high salt (500 mM NaCl) disruption.</p>
<p>(4) Classification of UBP1-upregulated cellular genes typically containing binding sites flanking the transcription start site (TSS) in contrast to UBP1-downregulated genes often containing a TSS-overlapping UBP1-binding site</p>
<p>(5) Presenting evidence for Mediator complex-dissociated free MED16-repressed HIV promoter activity through functional association with UBP1 and showing bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor JQ1 that potentially disrupts BRD4-inhibited HIV-1 transcription elongation could lead to reversal of HIV-1 latency.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Nevertheless, foreseeable weaknesses include:</p>
<p>(1) No clear demonstration of MED16-UBP1-TFCP2 indeed forming a trimeric core subcomplex in regulating cellular gene transcription and HIV-1 promoter inhibition</p>
<p>(2) No validation of transcriptomic datasets and pathways identified.</p>
<p>(3) Use of mostly artificial reporter gene constructs and non-HIV host cells (e.g., human 293T embryonic kidney cells, human HeLa cervical cancer cells, and mouse HT pancreatic cancer cells) for examining MED16/UBP1-regulated HIV transcription.</p>
<p>(4) Inconsistent use of 293T and HeLa cells in the characterization of dissociated MED16 interaction with UBP1 and TFCP2.</p>
<p>(5) In vitro transcription using immobilized DNA templates was not performed to a high standard, thus failing to convincingly show MED16/UBP1-inhibited HIV-1 transcription preinitiation complex formation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The article from Zheng et al. proposes an interesting hypothesis that the Med16 subunit of Mediator detaches from the complex, associates with transcription factor UBP1, and this complex activates or represses specific sets of genes in human cells. Despite my excitement upon reading the abstract, I was concerned by the lack of rigor in the experimental design. The only statement in the abstract that has some experimental support is the finding that Med16 dissociates from the Mediator and forms a subcomplex, but the data shown remain incomplete.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have preliminary evidence that a stable Med16 complex may exist and that it may regulate specific sets of genes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The experiments are poorly designed and can only infer possible roles for Med16 or UBP1 at this point. Furthermore, the data are often of poor quality and lack replication and quantitation. In other cases, key data such as MS results aren't even shown. Instead, we are given a curated list of only about 6 proteins (Figure S1), a subset of which the authors chose to pursue with follow-up experiments. This is not the expected level of scientific process.</p>
<p>(1) The data supporting the Med16 dissociation and co-association with UBP1 are incomplete and not convincing at this stage. According to the Methods and text, the gel filtration column was run with &quot;un-dialyzed HeLa cell nuclear extract&quot; and eluted in 300mM KCl buffer. The extracts were generated with the Dignam/Roeder method according to the text. Undialyzed, that means the extract would be between 0.4 - 0.5M NaCl. Under these high salt conditions (not physiological), it's possible and even plausible that Mediator subunits could separate over time. This caveat is not mentioned or controlled for by the authors. Because a putative Med16 subcomplex is a foundational point of the article, this is concerning.</p>
<p>The data are incomplete because a potential Med16 complex is not defined biochemically. The current state suggests a smaller Med16-containing complex that may also contain UBP1 and other factors, but its composition is not determined. This is important because if you're going to conclude a new and biologically relevant Med16 complex, which is a point of the article, then readers will expect you to do that.</p>
<p>Equally concerning are the IP-western results shown in Figure 1. In my opinion, these experiments do nothing to support the claims of the authors. The authors use hexanediols at 5% or 10% in an effort to disrupt the Mediator complex. Assuming this was weight/volume, that means ~400 to 800mM hexanediol solution, which is fairly high and can be expected to disrupt protein complexes, but the effects haven't been carefully assessed as far as I'm aware. The 2,5 HD (Figure 1B) experiments appear to simply contain greater protein loading, and this may contribute to the apparent differential results. In fact, in looking at the data, it seems that all MED subunits probed show the same trend as Med16. They are all reduced in the 1,6HD experiment relative to the 2,5 HD experiment. But it's hard to know, because replicates weren't completed and quantitation was not done. There aren't even loading controls. Other concerns about the IP-Western experiments are outlined in point 2.</p>
<p>(2) At no point do the authors apply rigorous methods to test their hypothesis. Instead, methods are applied that have been largely discredited over time and can only serve as preliminary data for pilot studies, and cannot be used to draw definitive conclusions about protein function.</p>
<p>a) IP-westerns are fraught with caveats, especially the way they were performed here, in which the beads were washed at relatively low salt and then eluted by boiling the beads in loading buffer. This will &quot;elute&quot; bound proteins, but also proteins that non-specifically interact with or precipitate on the beads. And because Westerns are so sensitive, it is easy to generate positive results. It's just not a rigorous experiment.</p>
<p>b) Many conclusions relied on transient transfection experiments, which are problematic because they require long timeframes, during which secondary/indirect effects from expression/overexpression will result. This is especially true if the proteins being artificially expressed/overexpressed are major transcription regulators, which is the case here. It is simply impossible to separate direct from indirect effects with these types of experiments. Another concern is that there was no effort to assess whether the induced protein levels were near physiological levels. Protein overexpression, especially if the protein is a known regulator of pol2 transcription (e.g., UBP1 or Med16), will create many unintended consequences.</p>
<p>c) Many conclusions were made based upon shRNA knockdown experiments, which are problematic because they require long timeframes (see above point), which makes it nearly impossible to identify effects that are direct vs. indirect/secondary/tertiary effects. Also, shRNA experiments will have off-target effects, which have been widely reported for well over a decade. An advantage of shRNA knockdowns is that they prevent genetic adaptation (a caveat with KO cell lines). A minimal test would be to show phenotypic rescue of the knockdown by expressing a knockdown-resistant Med16 (for example), but these types of experiments were not done.</p>
<p>d) Many experiments used reporter assays, which involved artificial, non-native promoters. Reporters are good for pilot studies, but they aren't a rigorous test of direct regulatory roles for Med16 or other proteins. Reporters don't even measure transcription directly. In fact, no experiment in this study directly measures transcription. An RNA-seq experiment was done with overexpressed or Med16 knockdown cells, but these required long timeframes and RNA-seq measures steady-state mRNA, which doesn't test the potential direct effects of these proteins on nascent transcription.</p>
<p>e) The MS experiments show promise, but the data were not shown, so it's hard to judge. The reader cannot compare/contrast the experiments, and we have no indication of the statistical confidence of the proteins identified. How many biological replicate MS experiments were performed?</p>
<p>(3) The data are over-interpreted, and alternative (and more plausible) hypotheses are ignored. Many examples of this, some of which are alluded to in the points above. For example, Med16 loss or overexpression will cause compensatory responses in cells. An expected result is that Mediator composition will be disrupted, since Med16 directly interacts with several other subunits. Also in yeast, the Robert, Gross, and Morse labs showed that loss of Med16/Sin4 causes loss of other tail module subunits, and this would be expected to cause major changes in the transcriptome. The authors also mention that yeast Med16/Sin4 &quot;alters chromatin accessibility globally&quot; and this would be expected to cause major changes in the transcriptome, leading to unintended consequences that will make data analysis and identification of direct Med16 effects impossible. The unintended consequences will be magnified with prolonged disruption of MED16 levels in cells (e.g., longer than 4h). These unintended consequences are hard to predict or define, and are likely to be widespread given the pivotal role of Mediator in gene expression. One unintended consequence appears to be loss of pol2 upon Med16 over-expression, as suggested by the western blot in Figure 8B. I point this out as just one example of the caveats/pitfalls associated with long-term knockdowns or over-expression.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>There are two major flaws that fundamentally undermine the value of the study. First, nearly all the central conclusions drawn here rely on the unfounded assumption that the effects observed are direct. No rigorous cause-and-effect relationships are established to support the claims. Second, the quality of the experimental data is substandard. Collectively, these concerns significantly limit any advances that might be gained in our understanding of the UBP1 pathway or Mediator function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The decrease in 1,6-hexanediol-treated cells of MED16 is modest, variable, not quantified, and internally inconsistent. For example, in Figure 1A, 1,6-hexanediol treatment should not have an impact on the level of the protein being directly IP. For MED12 (and CDK8 and MED1 to a lesser extent), 1,6-hexanediol treatment alters the level of the target protein in the IP. Along these lines, Figure 1A shows a no 1,6H-D dependent decrease in MED1 or MED12 levels in the CDK8 IP, whereas Figure 1B does show a decrease. Figure 1A shows no 1,6H-D dependent decrease in CDK8 levels in the MED1 IP, whereas Figure 1B shows a dramatic decrease. MED24 levels in the MED12 IP increase upon 1,6H-D in Figure 1A, but decrease in Figure 1B. Internal inconsistencies of this nature persist in the other Figures.</p>
<p>(2) Undermining the value of Figure 1E/F, UBP1 and TFCP2 may also associate with the small amount of MED16 in the 2MDa fractions. This is not tested, and therefore, the conclusion that they just associate with the dissociable form of MED16 is not supported.</p>
<p>(3) Domain mapping studies in Figure 2 are overinterpreted. Since the interactions could be indirect, it is not accurate to conclude &quot;Therefore, the N-terminal WDR domain of MED16 is crucial for its integration into the Mediator complex, while the C-terminal αβ-domain is essential for interacting with UBP1-TFCP2. &quot;</p>
<p>(4) A close examination of Figure 2C undermines confidence in the association studies. The bait protein in lanes 5-8 should be equal. Also, there is significant binding of GST to UBP1 and TFCP2, in roughly the same patterns as they bind to GST-MED16 αβ. The absence of input samples makes the results even more difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>(5) The domain deletion mutants are utilized throughout the manuscript as evidence of the importance of the UBP1-MED16 interaction. However, in Figure 2F lanes 7 and 8, the delta-S mutant binds MED16 as well as full-length UBP1. This undermines much of the subsequent data and conclusions about specificity.</p>
<p>(6) Even if the delta-S mutant were defective for MED16 binding, the result in Figure 3B does not &quot;confirm that MED16 is required for the transcriptional activity of UBP1,&quot;. Removal of that domain may have other effects.</p>
<p>(7) As Mediator is critical for the activation of many genes, it is not accurate to assume that the impact of its deletion in Figure 3E/F demonstrates a direct requirement in UBP1-driven transcription. This could easily be an indirect effect.</p>
<p>(8) Without documenting the relative protein expression levels in Figure 3G/H, conclusions cannot be drawn about the titration experiments, nor the co-expression experiments. These findings are likely the result of squelching or some form of competition that is not directly related to the UBP1-mediated transcription. A great deal of validation would be required in order to support the model that these effects are a result of MED16 overexpression sequestering UBP1 away from holo-Mediator.</p>
<p>(9) The lack of any documentation of expression levels for the various ectopic proteins in the majority of Figures, renders mechanistic claims meaningless (Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, S2, S3). This is particularly relevant since the model presented for many of the results invokes concentration-dependent competition.</p>
