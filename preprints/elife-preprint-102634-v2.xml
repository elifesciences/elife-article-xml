<abstract>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb</italic>), infects approximately one-fourth of the world’s population. We reported an increased accumulation of mast cells (MCs) in the lungs of macaques with active pulmonary TB (PTB), compared with those with latent TB infection (LTBI). MCs respond in vitro to <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure via degranulation and by inducing proinflammatory cytokines. In the current study, we demonstrate an increased production of chymase by MCs in granulomas of humans and macaques with PTB. Single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing analysis revealed distinct MC transcriptional programs between LTBI and PTB, with PTB associated MCs enriched in interferon gamma, oxidative phosphorylation, and MYC signaling. In a mouse model, MC deficiency led to improved control of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection that coincided with reduced accumulation of lung myeloid cells and diminished lung inflammation at chronic stages of infection. Airway transfer of MCs into wild-type <italic>Mtb</italic> infected mice showed increased neutrophils, decreased recruited macrophages, and elevated <italic>Mtb</italic> dissemination to the spleen. Together, these findings highlight MCs as active drivers of TB pathogenesis and potential targets for host-directed therapies for TB.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health issue, with approximately one-quarter of the world’s population harboring <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</italic>, causing around 1.25 million deaths each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">WHO, 2024</xref>). The disease often starts as a latent TB infection (LTBI), in which the bacteria may remain dormant without disease symptoms. However, LTBI can progress to active pulmonary TB (PTB), characterized by severe respiratory symptoms and high transmission potential. The immune mechanisms that allow progression from latency to PTB are not fully defined. Thus, understanding the immune factors that drive progression toward PTB will allow the development of novel therapeutics for TB control. Towards this overall goal, we recently showed that the lung single-cell transcriptional immune landscape during LTBI and PTB in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macaques was distinct. For example, PTB was characterized by the significant accumulation of Type I IFN-expressing plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), IFN-responsive macrophages, as well as activated T cells in the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Esaulova et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, mast cells (MCs) were increased in the lungs of macaques with PTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Esaulova et al., 2021</xref>). In sharp contrast, LTBI was characterized by increased presence of cytotoxic NK cells but lack of recruitment of MCs in the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Esaulova et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>MCs are found in the lung where they influence inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34a">Virk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wasserman, 1984</xref>). MCs have been shown to respond <italic>in vitro</italic> to <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure via surface receptors such as CD48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Munoz et al., 2003</xref>). They also respond to <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure or mycobacterial lipids by undergoing degranulation of prestored granules, such as histamine and P-hexosaminidase, and secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Munoz et al., 2003</xref>). Degranulation of MCs following intratracheal infection with a high dose of <italic>Mtb</italic> was shown to limit inflammation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carlos et al., 2007</xref>). MCs produce and release either chymase or tryptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bian et al., 2021</xref>), which are both proteases that are stored in the cell’s secretory granules. Recent studies with lung biopsies of TB patients showed an enrichment of MCs expressing IL-17 at inflammatory sites. In contrast, chymase-rich MCs (MCcs) producing TGF-β were detected in proximity to mature granulomas in lung biopsies from PTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Garcia-Rodriguez et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, while healthy lung predominantly has tryptase-expressing mast cells (MCTs), both chymase and mast cells co-expressing chymase and tryptase (MCcs and MCTcs) accumulate in the infected lung of patients with PTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Garcia-Rodriguez et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, while previous studies have shown that MCs respond to <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure and accumulate in macaque and human lungs during PTB, it is not completely known if MCs functionally mediate protective or pathological outcomes in the context of TB infection.</p>
<p>In the current study, we showed that the distribution and localization of MCs in PTB in humans and macaques were associated with chymase production. Using scRNA seq analysis, we show that MCs found in LTBI and healthy lungs in macaques are transcriptionally distinct from PTB lungs, showing enrichment of tumor necrosis factor alpha, cholesterol, and transforming growth factor beta signaling. In contrast, MCs found in PTB express increased levels of signatures associated with interferon gamma, oxidative phosphorylation, and MYC signaling. Additionally, mice deficient in MCs showed improved control of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and reduced lung inflammation. Airway transfer of MCs into wild-type Mtb-infected mice increased lung neutrophils and elevated <italic>Mtb</italic> dissemination to the spleen. These results together provide novel evidence that MCs contribute to immune pathology and reduced <italic>Mtb</italic> control, suggesting a pathological role for MCs during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study subjects and animal studies</title>
<p>All human lung biopsy samples were obtained from the Tuberculosis Outpatient Clinic and the Department of Pathology at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) in Mexico City, before <italic>Mtb</italic> treatment with informed consent, and with the approved protocol by the INER IRB for their use (project numbers B04-15 and B09-23). Also, lung samples from healthy controls (HC), non-TB individuals, were obtained from the tissue repository of the Department of Pathology at INER. No compensation was provided to the patients.</p>
<p>Non-human primate procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tulane National Primate Research Center and were performed following National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. Male and female Indian rhesus macaques, verified to be free of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection by tuberculin skin test, were obtained from the Tulane National Primate Research Center. The animals were housed in an ABSL3 facility.</p>
<p>C57BL/6 and B6.Cg-KitW-sh/HNihrJaeBsmJ (Strain #:030764) alias <italic>CgKitW</italic><sup><italic>Sh</italic></sup> mice were procured from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred at Washington University in St. Louis or University of Chicago. Six to eight-week-old female and male mice were used in the experiments. All mice were maintained and used per the approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines at Washington University in St. Louis or University of Chicago.</p>

<title>Aerosol infection</title>
<p>For murine experiments, <italic>Mtb</italic> strain HN878 was cultured in Proskauer Beck medium containing 0.05% Tween 80 until reaching mid-log phase and frozen in 1 ml aliquots at -80°C until used. Mice were aerosol infected with ∼100 colony-forming units (CFU), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Khader et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> strain CDC1551 was used to infect NHPs. This species-specific choice reflects differences in pathogenicity: HN878 induces robust disease in mice, while CDC1551, a less virulent strain, allows development of a macaque model that recapitulates latent and chronic TB upon low- to moderate-dose aerosol exposure respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kaushal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Sharan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Singh et al., 2025</xref>). This ensures physiologically relevant and controlled studies within each species. Macaques were assigned to three groups: (1) uninfected control, (2) macaques with LTBI were exposed to a low dose (∼10 CFU), and (3) macaques with PTB were exposed to a high dose (∼100 CFU) of <italic>Mtb</italic> CDC1551 via the aerosol route using a custom head-only dynamic inhalation system housed within a class III biological safety cabinet as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Esaulova et al., 2021</xref>). The animals were periodically monitored for their physiological parameters and to monitor disease symptoms.</p>

<title>Bacterial burden and cytokine analysis</title>
<p>Bacterial burden was assessed using serial 10-fold dilutions of lung or spleen homogenates and plated on 7H11 agar solid medium supplemented with OADC (oleic acid, bovine albumin, dextrose, and catalase). Colonies were counted after 2-3 weeks of incubation. Cytokine/chemokine expression was analyzed in lung homogenates from infected mice via Luminex (Millipore-Sigma) or ELISA (R&amp;D) as per the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>

<title>Generation of single-cell suspensions from tissues and flow cytometry staining</title>
<p>Lung single-cell suspensions from <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice were prepared as previously described, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gopal et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, mice were euthanized with CO2. The right lower lobe was isolated and perfused with heparin in saline. Lungs were minced and incubated with collagenase/DNase for 30 minutes at 37°C. Lung tissue was pushed through a 70µm nylon screen to obtain a single cell suspension. Following lysis of erythrocytes, the cells were washed and resuspended in cDMEM (DMEM high glucose + 10% fetal bovine serum + 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin) for flow cytometry staining. For flow cytometric analysis, cells were either stained immediately or stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA-50ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) and ionomycin (750 ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) in the presence of GolgiStop (BD Pharmingen).</p>
<p>For myeloid cell surface staining, the following fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were used: CD11b-APC (clone M1/70), CD11c-PE-Cy7 (clone HL3, BD Biosciences), GR-1-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone RB6-8C5, BD Pharmingen), and MHC class II-FITC (clone M5/114.15.2,Tonb Bioscience), CD117 (cKit)-Super Bright 780 (clone 2BB, eBioscience), and FcεR1-PE (clone MAR-1, eBioscience). Myeloid cell subsets were defined as follows: alveolar macrophages (CDI 1c<sup>+</sup>CDl lb<sup>-</sup>), neutrophils (CDI lb+CDl Ic-Gr-1<sup>hi</sup>), monocytes (CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>−</sup>Gr-1<sup>med</sup>), recruited macrophages (CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>−</sup>Gr-1<sup>low</sup>), and MCs (CDl lb<sup>−</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup>FctεRl<sup>+</sup>). T cells were identified based on a gating strategy as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Griffiths et al., 2016</xref>)). Surface staining included CD3-AF700 (clone 500A2, BD Biosciences), CD4-Pacific Blue (clone RM4.5, BD Biosciences), CD44-PE-Cy7 (clone 1M7, Tonbo Biosciences), and CD8-APC-Cy7 (clone 53-6.7, BD Biosciences). For intracellular cytokine staining, lung cells were fixed and permeabilized using fixation/permeabilization concentrate and diluent (eBioscience) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then stained with IFNγ -APC (clone XMG1.2, Tonbo Biosciences) and TNF-α-FITC (clone MP6-XT22, BD Pharmingen), or respective isotype controls (APC rat IgG1κ and FITC rat IgG1α, BD Pharmingen) for 30 minutes. Samples were acquired on a four-laser BD Fortessa Flow Cytometer, and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar). Absolute cell numbers for each population were back calculated based on total viable cell counts per lung sample.</p>

<title>In vitro culture and intratracheal delivery of MCs</title>
<p>Six to eight weeks old C57BL/6 mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub>, and femurs and tibia were collected. Bone marrow cells obtained after RBC lysis were suspended in Bone Marrow Derived MC (BMMC) media containing RBMI media (Gibco) supplemented with 20% FBS (Sigma), 4mM-glutamine (Sigma), 25mM HEPES (Corning), 5 × 10<sup>−5</sup> 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), lmM sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 0.lmM nonessential amino acids (Gibco), Penicillin and Streptomycin (Sigma), 20ng/ml murine IL-3 and 20ng/ml murine Stem Cell factor (Peprotech) and maintained in BMMC media at 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per ml in T75 flasks at 37°C in 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were fed twice every week with fresh BMMC media by centrifuging non-adherent cells at 1000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature, resuspending at a density of l × l0<sup>6</sup>/ml, and were maintained for 30 days, more than 95% cells were positive for FcεRI and c-kit, which was confirmed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Varma &amp; Puri, 2019</xref>). 5 × l0<sup>4</sup> BMMC having 95% FcεRI and c-kit positivity were transferred in C57B1/6 through the intratracheal route.</p>

<title>Morphometric analysis of lung Histopathology and neutrophil inf ltration</title>
<p>For mouse studies, the left upper lobe was collected for histomorphometric analysis. The lobes were infused with 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. 5 µm-thick lung sections were cut using a microtome, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), and processed for light microscopy. Images were captured using the automated Nanozoomer digital whole slide imaging system (Hamamatsu Photonics). Regions of inflammatory cell infiltration were delineated utilizing the NDP view2 software (Hamamatsu Photonics), and the percentage of inflammation was calculated by dividing the inflammatory area by the total area of individual lung lobes. All scoring was conducted in a blinded manner. Formalin-Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) lung sections were also stained with APC-conjugated rat anti-mouse Ly6G (clone 1A8, BioLegend, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:RRID:AB_2227348">RRID:AB_2227348</ext-link>). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Neutrophils were quantified in three randomly selected 200× fields per lung section. Images at 200× magnification were acquired using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope and recorded with a Hamamatsu camera.</p>
<p>FFPE lung sections from healthy individuals, tuberculosis patients, and NHP infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> were stained with goat anti-human mast cell chymase (LifeSpan Biosciences, LS-B4134, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:RRID:AB_10718418">RRID:AB_10718418</ext-link>) and rabbit anti-human tryptase (Cell Signaling Technology, 195235). Primary antibodies were detected with Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11057, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:RRID:AB_2534104">RRID:AB_2534104</ext-link>) and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 711-546-152, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:RRID:AB_2340619">RRID:AB_2340619</ext-link>). Nuclei were labeled with DAPI. MC positive for chymase, tryptase, or both were blindly quantified in three 200× random fields per sample in human and NHP lung sections. 200× pictures were taken with an Axioplan Zeiss microscope and recorded with a Hamamatsu camera.</p>

<title>Single-cell data reanalysis</title>
<p>The NHP single cell lung data was accessed from GEO (GSE149758) and processed through Cell Ranger v7.0 using the Macaca Mulatta reference genome (Mmul_l0). The obtained matrix file was processed through the R package <italic>Seurat v5</italic> for downstream analysis of the count matrix. The cells were filtered based on mitochondrial gene content and were selected for analysis when at least 500 genes were detected. Data was log normalized. The most variable genes were detected by the <italic>FindVariableFeatures</italic> function and used for subsequent analysis. Latent variables (number of UMIs and mitochondrial content) were regressed out using a negative binomial model (function <italic>ScaleData)</italic>. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed with the <italic>RunPCA</italic> function. A UMAP dimensionality reduction was performed on the scaled matrix (with most variable genes only) using the first 20 PCA components to obtain a two-dimensional representation of the cell states. For clustering, we used the functions <italic>FindNeighbors</italic> (20 PCA) and <italic>FindClusters</italic> (resolution 0.25). MCs were identified and re clustered based on expression of the canonical MC marker genes <italic>FCER1A</italic> (High affinity Fe IgE receptor), <italic>CD48, FCER1G</italic> (Fe IgE receptor), <italic>MS4A2</italic> (IgE subunit), and <italic>ITGAX</italic> (CDI le) as a negative marker. The cells identified MC cluster (only one cluster) were subset and re clustered using the method outlined above at a resolution of 0.1. To identify marker genes for mast cells, we used <italic>FindAllMarkers</italic> to compare the cluster against all other clusters and <italic>FindMarkers</italic> to compare selected clusters. For each cluster, only genes that were expressed in more than 15% of cells with at least 0.15-fold differences were considered. The differential genes were subjected to enrichment analysis using the Hallmark Pathway gene set from <italic>MsigDB</italic>. Only the pathways that met an FDR threshold less than 0.05 were considered. Gene signatures were defined with the R package <italic>Ucell</italic>. The output is a module signature score generated by the <italic>AddModuleScore</italic> function. The obtained score was overlaid on the UMAP and visualized. The Values per cell were extracted and used to plot a summed module U cell score. GraphPad Prism was used for the Violin plots and the heatmap. All other figures were generated in R.</p>
<p>An independent <italic>M.fascicularis</italic> lung single-cell RNA-seq dataset (GSE200151) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gideon et al., 2022</xref>) was downloaded and processed using Cell Ranger v7.0 with the <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> reference genome (Mmul_l0). The resulting count matrices were imported into Seurat v5 for downstream analysis. Cells were filtered based on mitochondrial gene content and were retained if they expressed at least 500 genes. Data were log-normalized, the most variable genes were identified with <italic>FindVariableFeatures</italic>, and confounding effects of sequencing depth (UMI counts) and mitochondrial fraction were regressed out during scaling with ScaleData. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, followed by clustering <italic>(FindNeighbors, FindClusters)</italic> and UMAP embedding <italic>(RunUMAP)</italic>. MCs were identified and subset based on canonical marker expression <italic>(FCER1A, CD48, FCER1G</italic>, <italic>MS4A2)</italic> and re-clustered at low resolution to ensure purity of the MC population. To quantify MC subsets across disease severity states, we culated the proportion of cells expressing chymase (<italic>CMA1</italic>), tryptase <italic>(LOC102140229, TPSG1)</italic>, or dual-positive <italic>CMA1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>LQC102140229</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> using binary thresholds (&gt;0 counts). Fisher’s exact tests were performed to compare proportions between MCs from high-burden granulomas (4 weeks, more severe disease; n = 372 MCs) and low-burden granulomas (10 weeks, less severe disease; n = 7,306 MCs). For each comparison, we reported the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval and the exact p-value. To examine functional programs, we computed UCell signature scores for Hallmark IFNγ; signaling, TNF signaling, and oxidative phosphorylation. Signature score distributions were compared between severity groups. All statistical tests were performed in R (v4.3.l) with the Seurat (v5.0) and UCell (v2.0) packages. Violin and bar plots were generated in R or exported to GraphPad Prism for visualization.</p>

<title>Mast cells localize and transtion phenotypes within TB granulomas</title>
<p>A previous study observed that tryptase-expressing MCTS were primarily found within the lungs of healthy controls (HC), while chymase-expressing MCcs or both chymase and tryptase-expressing MCTcs were found in the lung of patients with PTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Garcia-Rodriguez et al., 2021</xref>). To corroborate these observations and analyze the compartmentalization of MCs in human lungs, we stained lung biopsies from healthy individuals and patients with PTB to visualize the spatial distribution of MC<sub>T</sub>s, MC<sub>C</sub>s, and MC<sub>TC</sub>S. Lung granulomas from PTB patients were further classified by the presence or absence of necrosis, as early or late granulomas. Early granulomas had well-defined immune and stromal cell clusters without central necrosis. Late granulomas were larger, with necrotic cores containing bacteria and dead neutrophils, surrounded by lymphocytes. MCs were quantified both within and around early granulomas, whereas in late granulomas, they were primarily measured in the peripheral regions surrounding the necrotic center.</p>
<p>Considering lung parenchyma, interstitium, vasculature, or bronchus, we observed that HC lungs predominantly contain MC<sub>T</sub>s and, to a lesser extent, MC<sub>TC</sub>s. In TB lesions from PTB patients, MC<sub>TC</sub>S accumulated in early immature granulomas, whereas MC<sub>C</sub>s accumulated in late granulomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). MC<sub>T</sub>S also increased in the interstitium, vasculature, and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue of PTB patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1A-C</xref>). However, we did not observe any differences in MC<sub>TC</sub>s and MC<sub>C</sub>s at these sites (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D-I</xref>). These observations confirmed that tryptase-expressing MC<sub>T</sub>S are found in HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Garcia-Rodriguez et al., 2021</xref>), while the dual tryptase and chymase-expressing MCs were seen in early granulomas, and only chymase-associated MCs were observed in late granulomas with necrotic cores, defined the MCs associated with TB disease progression.</p>

<p>Our previously published data showed that MCs accumulate in the lungs of macaques with PTB compared to LTBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Esaulova et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we next analyzed the accumulation and localization of MCs in the lungs of macaques with LTBI and PTB. We found that, similar to human healthy lungs, MC<sub>T</sub>S accumulated in the lungs of healthy macaques. Although MC<sub>T</sub>S increased in some lesions in the lungs of macaques with LTBI, the numbers of MC<sub>T</sub>s in macaques with PTB were significantly increased in all sites, including the granuloma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>), interstitium, vasculature, as well as bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue of PTB patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1J-L</xref>). Additionally, MC<sub>TC</sub>S were significantly increased within the granulomas of macaques with PTB compared to the lungs of macaques with LTBI and HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>), but did not differ at any other sites in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1M-O</xref>) compared to HCs. However, we did not observe any increase in these cells at other sites within the lung compared to healthy macaques. MC<sub>C</sub>s were not measurable in any region of the macaque lungs. Our data indicate that during LTBI, there is an accumulation of MC<sub>T</sub>s but not MC<sub>TC</sub>s. However, as the disease progresses to PTB, both MC<sub>TC</sub>s and additional MC<sub>T</sub>s are elevated, particularly within the granulomatous lesions.</p>

<title>Lung single-cell transcriptome in macaques with tuberculosis exhibits MC diversity</title>
<p>In the previous section, we found that tryptase protein expression on MCs was lower in LTBI, and as the disease progressed to PTB, MCs expressed chymase, either alone MC<sub>C</sub>s or in combination with tryptase, MC<sub>TC</sub>. To further validate whether this increase in tryptase and chymase protein expression was also reflected in the single-cell transcriptomes during PTB, LTBI, and HCs, we re-analyzed the MCs from our previously published data from NHPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Esaulova et al., 2021</xref>). These macaques were infected with 10 bacilli to generate LTBI, or with 100 bacilli for a progressive PTB infection, or were uninfected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The median duration of infection for the PTB macaques was 10 weeks, and the LTBI macaques underwent necropsy at a median of 23 weeks post-infection. We analyzed the single-cell transcriptomes of 500 MCs using unsupervised clustering and identified four distinct clusters. Three clusters (0, 1, and 3) belonged to the PTB group, while cluster 2 was found exclusively in LTBI and HC, with the majority of MCs coming from the PTB condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). All the MC clusters were positive for canonical markers such as <italic>FCER1A</italic> (high-affinity lgE receptor), <italic>MS4A2</italic> (lgE subunit), <italic>CD48</italic> (mast cell receptor), and negative for markers like <italic>ITGAX</italic> (macrophage/dendritic cell marker) (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>), with distinct differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). Reactome gene ontology analysis of cluster-specific DEGs revealed enrichment of cholesterol, TNF-α, and TGFβ signaling in LTBI, while oxidative phosphorylation, IFNγ signaling, and MYC signaling were enriched in the PTB group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Plotting the summed <italic>Ucell</italic> module scores revealed significant upregulation of IFNγ signaling, oxidative Phosphorylation, and Th2 signature in PTB (P &lt; 0.05), while LTBI and HC clusters showed enhanced TNF-α signaling (P &lt;0.05) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-G</xref>; <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2 C-F</xref>). These results indicate that MCs exhibited distinct transcriptomic profiles depending on the disease state, with MCs from LTBI and HC showing more metabolically active pathways, while MCs from PTB display a more pro-inflammatory signature.</p>

<p>Since we observed increased tryptase and chymase in MCs of PTB macaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we next examined the levels of tryptase and chymase genes within the single-cell dataset. As we were examining these genes across species, we observed considerable variation in sequence similarity and functional annotation of tryptase genes between humans and NHPs. While <italic>TPSG1</italic> (encoding γ tryptase) and <italic>TPSD1</italic> (encoding δ tryptase) share the gene name in humans and NHPs, the gene corresponding to the more widely expressed <italic>TPSAB1</italic> (encoding α and β1 tryptase) differs in NHPs. Based on phylogenetic similarity to human α and β tryptase, the NHP ortholog is often referred to as α-like or β-like (α/β) tryptase. However, their gene names differ, as they are still classified as putative proteins and not formally annotated with the same nomenclature as in humans. The putative tryptase genes in NHPs are annotated as <italic>LOC699599</italic> for <italic>Macaca (M). mulatta</italic> and <italic>LOC102139613</italic> for <italic>M.fasicularis</italic>. Examining these genes in the NHP single cell transcriptome dataset, we detected the expression of the γ and the putative α/βtryptase genes, but found no expression for δ tryptase. <italic>TPSG1</italic> was found to be expressed at low levels and only in a few MCs from the PTB group. In contrast, the putative α/β tryptase gene was expressed in MCs across all groups, with the highest expression in PTB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), consistent with our immunofluorescence data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). As expected, the chymase (encoded by <italic>CMA1)</italic> expressing cells were detected exclusively in the PTB group and were absent in LTBI and HCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). To confirm whether these <italic>CMA1</italic>-positive cells also co-expressed the putative α/β tryptase as well, we quantified cells expressing single and dual transcripts. This analysis revealed that most of the chymase-positive cells (243 cells) also expressed the putative α/β tryptase gene (183 cells), supporting our earlier observation of a dual tryptase chymase MC signature linked with PTB. In contrast, MCs from HC and LTBI groups showed expression of tryptase alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>).</p>
<p>To strengthen our findings, we validated MCs using an independent lung single-cell transcriptome from NHP <italic>(M.fasicularis)</italic>, collected at 4 weeks (higher bacterial load, more severe disease) and 10 weeks (low bacterial load, less severe disease) following low-dose <italic>Mtb</italic> Erdman infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gideon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Grimbaldeston et al., 2005</xref>). This dataset had 372 MCs at 4 weeks, and 7306 MCs at 10 weeks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). We examined the expression of chymase and several tryptase genes, including <italic>TPSG1, TPSD1</italic>, and <italic>LOC102140229</italic> (putative NHP ortholog for human <italic>TPSAB1)</italic>. While <italic>TPSD1</italic> expression was undetectable, the other tryptase genes showed high expression with a pronounced increase in chymase <italic>(CMA1)</italic> expression both at 4 and 10 weeks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). Similar to our transcriptomic scRNA seq dataset, we quantified MCs co-expressing <italic>LOC102140229</italic> and <italic>CMA1</italic>. Consistent with our data, <italic>CMA1</italic> and <italic>LOC102140229</italic> (the α/β -like tryptase ortholog) expressions were associated with severe disease, being significantly enriched in MCs from the higher-burden 4-week granulomas, (OR = 0.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−29</sup>, and OR= 1.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, respectively). Importantly, when restricting analysis to <italic>CMA1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells, the dual-positive <italic>CMA1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>LOC102140229</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> MC subset was proportionally more abundant in less severe, 10-week granulomas (OR = 0.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−9)</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>). This suggested that while chymase <italic>(CMA1)</italic> expression marked severe disease, the presence of the dual tryptas—chymase phenotype in less severe lesions, supported the idea that MC transcriptional diversity emerges in association with disease modulation This further supporting our observation of MC diversity with increasing dual tryptase and chymase signature associated with disease progression. Similar to our observations in <italic>M.mulatta</italic>, we quantified the DEGs and carried out Ucell scores in the MC subset from <italic>M.fascicularis</italic>.We observed that MC from high burden TB granulomas showed higher IFNγ signaling, oxidative phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N-O</xref>), similar to higher PTB scores seen in <italic>M.mulatta</italic>. However, unlike <italic>M.mulatta, M.fascicularis</italic> also showed increased TNF signaling in high-burden granulomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>). These results highlight that MCs in high-burden granulomas upregulated IFNγ, TNF, and metabolic programs, coupled with chymase expression, whereas less severe granulomas were enriched for tryptase-positive MCs. Although this mirrors our findings seen in in <italic>M.mulatta</italic>, we observed species-specific differences in how TNF signaling is distributed across disease states.</p>

<title>MC-deficient mice exhibit enhanced control of <italic>Mtb</italic></title>
<p>We next determined whether MCs are induced in response to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in mice, and characterized their accumulation early and later in infection. In our previous studies, we observed that innate cells such as innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) accumulate rapidly between days 5-10 post-infection, followed by neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes between days 10-15, and T cells by days 21 to 30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ardain et al., 2019</xref>).

To investigate the functional role of MCs in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, we utilized the MC-deficient mouse model, <italic>CgKitW</italic><sup><italic>Sh</italic></sup>. These mice carry spontaneous loss-of-function mutations in both alleles of the dominant <italic>white spotting</italic> (W) locus <italic>(i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., <italic>c-kit)</italic>, leading to impaired <italic>c-kit</italic> tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling resulting in dysregulated MC development, survival, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wolters et al., 2005</xref>). We infected <italic>CgKitW</italic><sup><italic>Sh</italic></sup> mice with low-dose aerosolized <italic>Mtb</italic> strain HN878 for early (50 days post infection, dpi) and later time points (100 dpi and 150 dpi) and compared them with C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) Mtb-infected mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

By 100 dpi, both DCs and neutrophils were decreased in <italic>CgKitW</italic><sup><italic>Sh</italic></sup> mice; however, these changes were not sustained at 150 dpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>). Across all time points, AMs and monocyte populations remained comparable between <italic>CgKitW</italic><sup><italic>Sh</italic></sup> and WT <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-F</xref>). Previous studies have implicated MCs in driving T cell responses (Elieh Ali <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Komi &amp; Grauwet, 2018</xref>), therefore, we next examined T cell responses induced post-infection. We found no differences in the activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell responses at 50 dpi however, by 100 dpi, both populations were significantly reduced at 100 dpi in <italic>CgKitW<sup>wh</sup> Mtb</italic>-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure S5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">E</xref>). This reduction extended to functional subsets, with fewer CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells producing IFNγ, as well as diminished dual TNF-α and IFNγ producing cells in the <italic>CgKitW</italic><sup><italic>Sh</italic></sup> <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice as compared to WT <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B-D</xref>). We did not find any significant differences in the CDS<sup>+</sup>T cells producing IFNγ, TNF-α, and dual IFNγ and TNF-α producing cells in the <italic>CgKitW</italic><sup><italic>Sh</italic></sup> <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5F-H</xref>). Finally, we measured cytokine responses in the lungs of <italic>CgKitW</italic><sup><italic>Sh</italic></sup> and WT <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice at 150 dpi. We found that pro inflammatory cytokines that direct monocyte/macrophage and T cell responses (G-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, MCP-1, TNF-α, and RANTES) were significantly lower in <italic>CgKitW</italic><sup><italic>Sh</italic></sup> <italic>Mtb</italic> infected lungs compared to WT <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> lungs. Similarly, chemokines driving neutrophil recruitment (MIP-1β, and MIP-2) were reduced in <italic>CgKitW</italic><sup><italic>Sh</italic></sup> <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice, whereas Th2 cytokines such as IL-13 did not differ between the two groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Together, these results provide evidence that MCs are induced following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, accumulate in the lung, and mediate immune responses that drive pathology and promote <italic>Mtb</italic> susceptibility and dissemination during chronic TB.</p>

<title>Transfer of MCs into lung airways promotes neutrophil accumulation and <italic>Mtb</italic> dissemination</title>
<p>To examine whether MCs can impact <italic>Mtb</italic> control and dissemination, we adoptively transferred bone marrow-derived MCs into the airways of WT mice, hereafter referred to as B6<sup>MC</sup> mice. A total of 5× l0<sup>4</sup> MCs were transferred, approximating the number of MCs present in the lungs of WT <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice at 100 dpi. Following transfer, mice were infected with <italic>Mtb</italic>, and we found that MCs were retained in the lungs of B6<sup>MC</sup> <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice up to 30 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Strikingly, B6<sup>MC</sup> <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice showed increased neutrophils frequencies and reduced RMs when compared with B6 <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">C</xref>). However, no differences in the total numbers of lung MCs, neutrophils, RMs or DCs were observed in B6 and B6<sup>MC</sup> groups (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). While the presence of additional MCs in the lungs did not alter the bacterial burden <italic>(Mtb</italic> CFU) and inflammation in the lungs, B6<sup>MC</sup> <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice showed a significant increase in the <italic>Mtb</italic> CFUs in the spleen, suggesting a role for MCs in promoting dissemination from the lungs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-F</xref>). Consistently, histological analysis revealed greater neutrophil infiltration in lung sections of B6<sup>MC</sup> <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice compared to WT <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">H</xref>), implicating MCs in driving neutrophil recruitment and potentially enhancing the systemic spread of <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The immune mechanism(s) that mediate the progression from LTBI to PTB are unclear. In this study, we identified MCs as an innate cell type that is overrepresented during PTB, transcriptionally expressed signatures associated with IFNγ, oxidative phosphorylation, and MYC signaling, and localized within mature TB granulomas. Importantly, using mice deficient in MCs, we showed a potential pathological role for MCs in mediating susceptibility to TB, thus providing MCs as a novel therapeutic target.</p>
<p>MCs have been shown to interact with <italic>Mtb</italic> through the GPI-anchored molecule CD48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Munoz et al., 2003</xref>), interaction with TLR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carlos et al., 2007</xref>), and potentially TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Mccurdy et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Mtb</italic> is also thought to be internalized by lipid rafts on MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Munoz et al., 2009</xref>), thus serving as a long-lasting reservoir for <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">da Silva et al., 2014</xref>). These in vitro studies have shown that MC exposure to <italic>Mtb</italic> results in degranulation of MCs, as well as the induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-Iβ. Consistently, another study using the same route of high-dose infection reported increased bacterial burden in both the lungs and spleen of MC-deficient Kit^W-sh/W-sh mice compared to wild-type C57BL/6 controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Villareal-Rivota et al., 2025</xref>). While these studies using a high-dose model of infection reported early induction of inflammatory mediators from MC within hours to days, our in vivo results using a physiological low dose of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection model showed that MCs accumulated between 21-30 days, coinciding with the onset of T cells in the lung. Interestingly, despite the accumulation of MCs in the lung at 30 dpi following low-dose aerosol infection, the impact of MC deficiency on <italic>Mtb</italic> control and inflammation in <italic>CgKitW</italic><sup><italic>Sh</italic></sup> mice was not evident until 100 dpi. This is similar to our published studies where we found that S100A8/9 deficiency resulted in reduced neutrophil lung accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Scott et al., 2020</xref>), resulting in improved <italic>Mtb</italic> control and improved TB disease, but after 100 dpi. However, this is in contrast to the role of eosinophils in TB, as eosinophil deficiency resulted in increased <italic>Mtb</italic> CFU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bohrer et al., 2021</xref>). MCs were the primary innate cell type that were defective in the lungs of <italic>CgKitW</italic><sup><italic>Sh</italic></sup> mice at baseline and throughout infection, and their absence was associated with better containment of <italic>Mtb</italic> in both lung and spleen, indicating a pathological role for MCs during chronic TB.</p>
<p>Our data also showed that MCs accumulated in the lungs ofC57BL/6 mice from 50 to 100 dpi, after which their numbers stabilized. This increased accumulation of MCs during chronic infection coincided with elevated infiltration of DCs and neutrophils. Importantly, we showed that enhancing MCs numbers through adoptive transfer in the lungs of WT <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice similarly promoted neutrophil accumulation and facilitated <italic>Mtb</italic> dissemination. This suggests that MCs are not merely a consequence of chronic inflammation, but active modulators capable of shaping immune cell dynamics early in infection. When present in sufficient numbers, MCs with their ability to promote neutrophil recruitment, can potentially influence the balance of protective versus pathological inflammation during TB. These results raise the possibility that MC accumulation during chronic infection serves to fine-tune the composition of the innate immune compartment in the lung. Whether this regulation is beneficial or detrimental to host control of <italic>Mtb</italic> remains to be explored. However, our data suggested that manipulating MC responses may offer a novel avenue for modulating immune dynamics in TB, particularly in the chronic phase, where inflammation must be tightly regulated to prevent tissue damage. Additionally, the reduced inflammation observed at 150 dpi is associated with decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit monocytes/macrophages, and T cells, and neutrophils. Overall, based on our results along with the current literature, we propose pathological roles for neutrophils and MCs, while other granulocytes, such as eosinophils, may mediate protective roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bohrer et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>MCs can release cytokines and chemokines, antimicrobial peptides, and granules upon pathogen sensing and to control pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Naqvi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Naqvi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Naqvi et al., 2020</xref>). In the context of <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure, MCs have been shown to undergo degranulation, including histamine and β-hexosaminidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Munoz et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, histamine-deficient mice showed decreased neutrophils, as well as proinflammatory cytokine production following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carlos et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, induction of degranulation following intratracheal <italic>Mtb</italic> infection resulted in reduced proinflammatory cytokines as well as reduced lung inflammation. Similarly, our study showed reduced DCs, neutrophils, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, in the lungs of MC-deficient <italic>Mtb-infected</italic> mice, along with reduced proinflammatory cytokines and lung inflammation at chronic time points. Thus, together with published work, MCs can potentially modulate neutrophils and other inflammatory mediators in high-dose models, as well as in a physiologically relevant <italic>Mtb</italic> infection model, leading to disease pathology. The exact mechanism by which MCs contribute to the pathology, dissemination, and promote <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is an area of future investigation.</p>
<p>At baseline, human lungs have been reported to primarily express tryptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Poto et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, we found that this is true for both macaque and human lungs in our study, where healthy lungs expressed MC<sub>T</sub>s. Additionally, we found that early granulomas and in LTBI we saw expression of MC<sub>TC</sub>s with a switch to more and accumulation of MCcs in late-stage granulomas. Chymase expression may modulate extracellular matrix components (FCM) such as fibronectin, leading to tissue remodeling, impacting cellular communication, and inducing cleavage for key cytokines such as IL-6, IL-13, IL-15, and IL-33, as well as TGF-p. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Pejler, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Waern et al., 2013</xref>). Studies have shown that tryptase can induce proliferation of fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, causing airway remodeling during diseased conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mogren et al., 2021</xref>). Tryptase can also inactivate a large range of peptides by cleaving specific substrates, such as fibrinogen, gelatin, pro-matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and complement factors, thus moderating inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Caughey, 2007</xref>). Based on our results from human and macaque lung, we hypothesize that MC<sub>TC</sub>S may synergize to drive responses induced by both pathways at early time points and possibly just by MC<sub>C</sub>s at later time points. Additional studies describing these subsets and testing their functional relevance in <italic>in vivo</italic> models are future steps in delineating the role of these subsets in TB. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed a differential activation state between the MCs that accumulate in lungs in PTB as compared to LTBI and HC in NHPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Esaulova et al., 2021</xref>). The MCs from PTB animals showed a closer resemblance to MC<sub>CS</sub>, characterized by higher IFN<italic>γ</italic>, metabolic activation, and chymase signatures, confirming that chymase expression is associated with disease severity. This association of chymase expression with disease severity was confirmed in an independent single-cell lung dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gideon et al., 2022</xref>), where the analysis revealed similar enrichment of chymase-expressing MCcs in granulomas with higher disease burden, accompanied by similar activation of IFN-<italic>γ</italic> and metabolic pathways. Metabolic activation of oxidative phosphorylation, as observed here, has been associated with activated MCs, and inhibiting mitochondrial ATP production reduced MC degranulation and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Paruchuru et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sharkia et al., 2017</xref>). This also suggests that MCs, which accumulate in the lungs in LTBI and HC, were not only lower in proportion but also less activated, meaning that TB-induced activation of MCs contributes to their pathogenic phenotype in disease. Our data aligned with previous observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Garcia-Rodriguez <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>, showing that chymase-expressing MCs accumulate in TB-induced lung lesions and may contribute to fibrotic processes surrounding granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Garcia-Rodriguez et al., 2021</xref>). We also observed an expansion of MC<sub>TC</sub>S in the PTB group in NHPs, mirroring the phenotypic shift from M<sub>CT</sub> to MC<sub>TC</sub> seen in human lung sections. While Garcia-Rodriguez <italic>et al</italic>. suggested this shift occurs in fibrotic areas and may reflect tissue remodeling, they did not demonstrate improved lung function. Although fibrosis was not directly measured in our study, these findings support the association of chymase-positive MCs with advanced, inflammatory disease, reinforcing their potential role in TB pathogenesis.</p>
<p>MCs are known to gear towards a Th2 signature with increased chymase expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Toru et al., 1998</xref>). This increase was reflected in MCs from the macaque lung, showing a high transcriptomic Th2 signature in PTB but not in clusters found in LTBI and HC. In essence, transcriptomics reflected the hyperactivated nature of the MCs in PTB, which might make them more pathological during infection. Although our <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse study showed a pathological role of MCs, significant secretion of Th2 cytokines was not seen, likely because the C57Bl/6 mouse model is prone towards Thl polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wakeham et al., 2000</xref>). MCs can release both preformed and de novo synthesized TNF-<italic>α</italic>, hence helping in early bacterial clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gordon &amp; Galli, 1991</xref>). Similarly, our study showed that the MCs from HC and LTBI individuals expressed higher levels of TNF-<italic>α</italic> and were in a less metabolically activated state (lower OXPHOS signature). So, additional studies will help in elucidating the mechanism through which MCs mediate pathological roles.</p>
<p>In summary, we demonstrated that the accumulation of chymase-producing MCs in PTB is a cross-species phenomenon that contributes to increased TB pathology and loss of TB control, thereby elucidating the pathological role of MCs in the control of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. By targeting MC pathways or signaling mechanisms, host-directed therapies (HDTs) hold the promise of enhancing the effectiveness of existing treatments and mitigating disease-related complications.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Gupta et al. investigates the role of mast cells (MCs) in tuberculosis (TB) by examining their accumulation in the lungs of M. tuberculosis-infected individuals, non-human primates, and mice. The authors suggest that MCs expressing chymase and tryptase contribute to the pathology of TB and influence bacterial burden, with MC-deficient mice showing reduced lung bacterial load and pathology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study addresses an important and novel topic, exploring the potential role of mast cells in TB pathology.</p>
<p>It incorporates data from multiple models, including human, non-human primates, and mice, providing a broad perspective on MC involvement in TB.</p>
<p>The finding that MC-deficient mice exhibit reduced lung bacterial burden is an interesting and potentially significant observation.</p>
<p>Results from a transfer experiment nicely substantiate the role of MCs in TB pathogenesis in mice.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The submitted manuscript aims to characterize the role of mast cells in TB granuloma. The manuscript reports heterogeneity in mast cell populations present within the granulomas of tuberculosis patients. With the help of previously published scRNAseq data, the authors identify transcriptional signatures associated with distinct subpopulations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors have carried out sufficient literature review to establish the background and significance of their study.</p>
<p>(2) The manuscript utilizes a mast cell-deficient mouse model, which demonstrates improved lung pathology during Mtb infection, suggesting mast cells as a potential novel target for developing host-directed therapies (HDT) against tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript requires significant improvement, particularly in the clarity of the experimental design, as well as in the interpretation and discussion of the results. Enhanced focus on these areas will provide better coherence and understanding for the readers.</p>
<p>(2) The results discussed in the paper add only a slight novel aspect to the field of tuberculosis. While the authors have used multiple models to investigate the role of Mast cells in TB, majority of the results discussed in the Figure 1-2 are already known and are re-validation of previous literature.</p>
<p>(3) The claims made in the manuscript are only partially supported by the presented data. However, additional extensive experiments are necessary to strengthen the findings and enhance the overall scientific contribution of the work.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>While most of the comments have been addressed by the authors, a few important concerns pertaining to the data interpretation remain unanswered.</p>
<p>(1) The discrepancy between published studies and the current study on function of mast cells during TB remains. The authors could not justify the reason behind differences in results obtained during Mtb infection in humans vs macaques.</p>
<p>(2) To address the concern regarding immune alterations in mast cells deficient mice, the authors carried out adoptive transfer of mast cells to WT mice. However, they do not observe any changes in mycobacterial lung burden and inflammation, diluting their conclusions throughout the study.</p>
<p>(3) Additionally, as the authors propose mast cells as players in LTBI to PTB conversion, the adoptive transfer experiment could be conducted in a low-dosage model of TB. This would aid in assessing its role in TB reactivation.</p>

<p>(2) Throughout the manuscript, the authors have mislabelled the legends for WT B6 mice and mast cell-deficient mice. As a result, the discussion and claims made in relation to the data do not align with the corresponding graphs (Figure 1B, 3, 4, and S2). This discrepancy undermines the accuracy of the conclusions drawn from the results.</p>

<p>This is the first study which has used mouse, NHP and human TB samples from Mtb infection to characterize and validate the role of MC in TB. We believe the current study provides significant novel insights into the role of MC in TB.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>In the study by Gupta et al., the authors report an accumulation of mast cells (MCs) expressing the proteases chymase and tryptase in the lungs of M. tuberculosis-infected individuals and non-human primates, as compared to healthy controls and latently infected individuals. They also MCs appear to play a pathological role in mice. Notably, MC-deficient mice show reduced lung bacterial burden and pathology during infection.</p>
<p>While the topic is of interest, the study is overall quite preliminary, and many conclusions are not wellsupported by the presented data. The reliance on three different models, each suggesting divergent outcomes, weakens the ability to draw definitive conclusions. Specifically, the claim that &quot;MCs (...) mediate cytokine responses to drive pathology and promote Mtb susceptibility and dissemination during TB&quot; is not substantiated by the data.</p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>(1) In human samples, the authors conclude that &quot;While MCTCs accumulated in early immature granulomas within TB lesions, MCCs accumulated in late granulomas in TB patients&quot; and that MCTs &quot;likely convert first to MCTCs in early granulomas before becoming MCCs in late mature granulomas with necrotic cores.&quot; However, Figure 1B shows the opposite. Furthermore, the assertion that MCTs &quot;convert&quot; into MCTCs is not justified by the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Corrections have been made to the figures to ensure clarity for the reader. We demonstrate accumulation of tryptase-expressing MCs in healthy individuals, while the dual tryptase and chymaseexpressing MCs were seen in early granulomas, and only chymase-associated MCs were observed in late granulomas depicting more pathology of the disease. We have removed the line as advised by the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 2 I and J, the panels do not demonstrate co-expression of chymase and tryptase in clusters 0, 1, and 3 in PTB samples, which contradicts the histology data. This discrepancy is left unaddressed and raises concerns about the conclusions drawn from Figures 1 and 2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We revisited the data and now show the coexpression of the dual expressing cells in the data (Figure 2H). This discrepancy stemmed from the crossspecies nature of the dataset. It turns out the there is a considerable diversity in sequence similarity and tryptase function between human and NHPs (Trivedi et al., 2007). We explain this in the section now (line 313-364). Briefly, while humans express TPSG1 (encoding  tryptase) and TPSD1 (encoding  tryptase) and have the same gene name in NHP, the gene name for more widely expressed TPSAB1(encoding  /  tryptase) is different for NHP and the gene names are not shared as they are still predicated putative protein. The putative genes from NHP that map to human TPSAB1 is LOC699599 for M. mulatta and LOC102139613 for M. fasicularis, respectively. Thus, looking for TPSAB1 gene yielded no result in our previous analysis but examining these orthologous gene names, now phenocopy the results we see in the histology data. To strengthen our findings, we have now analyzed an additional single-cell dataset from the lungs of NHP M. fasicularis (Figure 2J-L) and found the co-expression of chymase and tryptase, adding an important validation to our histological findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 2 serves more as a resource and contributes little to the core findings of the study. It might be better suited as supplementary material.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion; however, we believe that Figure 2 serves as an independent validation in a different species (NHP), showing heterogeneity in MCs across species in a TB model. The figure adds value as there are only a handful of studies (Tauber et al., 2023, Derakhshan et al., 2022, Cildir et al., 2021) but none in TB, describing MCs at single cell level, of which one is published from our group showing MC cluster in Mtb infected macaques (Esaulova et al., 2021). We feel strongly that dissecting MCs as specifically done here provides an important insight into the transcriptional heterogeneity of these cells linked to disease states. We have also added an additional NHP lung single cell dataset (Gideon et al., 2022) to complement our analysis, thus adding another validation, strengthening these findings. So, we believe in retaining the figure as an integral part of the main paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In lines 275-277, the data referenced should be shown to support the claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The text originally noted by the reviewer now appears in the revised manuscript at line 370-372 and the corresponding data has now been included as supplementary Figure S3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Figure 3B, the difference between the two mouse strains becomes non-significant by day 150 pi, weakening the overall conclusion that MCs contribute to the bacterial burden.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>At 100 dpi, MC-deficient mice exhibit lower Mtb CFU in both the lung and spleen, indicating improved protection. By 150 dpi, lung CFU differences are no longer significant; however, dissemination to the spleen remains reduced in MC-deficient mice. Thus, the overall conclusion that MCs contribute to increased bacterial burden remains valid, particularly with respect to dissemination. This conclusion is further supported by new data showing that adoptive transfer of MCs into B6 Mtb-infected mice increased Mtb dissemination to the spleen (Figure 5E).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Figures 3D and E are not particularly convincing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figures 3D and 3E illustrate lung inflammation in MC-deficient mice compared to wild-type which more distinctly show that MC-deficient mice exhibit significantly less inflammation at 150 dpi, supporting the role of MCs in driving lung.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Figures 4 and S3, the color coding in panels A-F appears incorrect but is accurate in G. This inconsistency is confusing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for noting this. The color coding has been corrected to ensure consistency across all figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In the mouse model, MCs seem to disappear during infection, in contrast to observations in human and macaque samples. This discrepancy is not discussed in the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important observation. In response, we performed a new analysis of lung MCs at baseline in wild-type and MC-deficient mice. Our data show that naïve wild-type lungs contain a small population of MCs, which is further reduced in MC-deficient mice. Following Mtb infection, MCs progressively accumulate in wild-type mice, whereas this accumulation is significantly impaired in MC-deficient mice. These new data are now included in Figure (Figure 4A) and also updated in the text (line 395-403).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) In lines 306-307, data should be shown to support the claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The text originally noted by the reviewer now appears in the revised manuscript at line 399-400 and the corresponding data has now been included as supplementary Figure S4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor comments</p>
<p>(1) What does &quot;granuloma-associated&quot; cells mean in samples from healthy controls?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this point. The language has been revised to accurately refer to cells in the lung parenchyma in the Figure 1, rather than “granuloma associated” cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In line 229, it is unclear what &quot;these cells&quot; refers to.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The phrase “these cells” refers to tryptase-expressing mast cells. This has now been clarified in the revised manuscript (line 276-277).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The citation of Figure 3A in lines 284-285 is misplaced in the text and should be corrected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The figure citation has been corrected in the text in the revised manuscript (lines 376-379).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The data presented in Figure 1 seems to be a re-validation of the already known aspects of mast cells in TB granulomas. While distinct roles for mast cells in regulating Mtb infection have been reported, the manuscript appears to be a failed opportunity to characterize the transcriptional signatures of the distinct subsets and identify their role in previously reported processes towards controlling TB disease progression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insight. While it was not our intent to investigate the bulk transcriptome, owing to the high number of cells required to get enough RNA for transcriptomic sequencing, it is technically challenging due to the low abundance of mast cells during TB infection (Figure 2). The motivation for Figure 2, that we utilized a more sensitive transcriptomic analysis to find the different transcriptional states in the distinct TB disease states. We believe that this analysis captures the essence of what the reviewer and provides meaningful insights into mast cell heterogeneity during TB.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The experiments lack uniformity with respect to the strains of Mtb used for experimentation. For eg: Mtb strain HN878 was used for aerosol infection of mice while Mtb CDC1551 was used for macaques. If there were experimental constraints with respect to the choice, the same should be mentioned.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The Mtb strain usage has been consistent within each species: HN878 for mice and CDC1551 for non-human primates (NHPs), in line with prior studies from our lab. The species-specific choice reflects the differences in pathogenicity of these strains in mice versus NHPs. CDC1551, which exhibits lower virulence, allows the development of a macaque model that recapitulates human latent to chronic TB when administered via aerosol at low to moderate doses (Kaushal et al., 2015; Sharan et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2025). In contrast, the more virulent HN878 strain leads to severe disease and high mortality in NHPs and is therefore not suitable for these models. Using CDC1551 in macaques provides a controlled and clinically relevant platform to study immunological and pathophysiological mechanisms of TB, justifying its use in the current study. This explanation has now been added to the manuscript method section (lines 109-114).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 84- 85, the authors state that &quot;Chymase positive MCs contribute to immune pathology and reduced Mtb control&quot;. Previous reports including Garcia-Rodriguez et al., 2021 associate high MCTCs with improved lung function. Additionally, in the macaques model of latent TB infection reported in the manuscript, the number of chymase-expressing MCs seems to significantly decrease. The authors should justify the same.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In Garcia-Rodriguez et al., 2021, chymase-expressing MCs accumulate in fibrotic lung lesions. Fibrosis is a result of excessive inflammation in TB infection and is associated with lung damage. Similarly, in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, higher density and percentage of chymase-expressing MCs correlate positively with fibrosis severity (Andersson et al., 2011). In our study, although fibrosis was not directly assessed, chymase-positive MCs increased in late lung granulomas, consistent with advanced inflammatory disease. Therefore, our conclusion that chymaseproducing MCs contribute to lung pathology is justified and aligns with prior observations.</p>

<p>(4) The manuscript would benefit from a brief description of the experimental conditions for the previously published scRNAseq data used in the current study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion, and the information has been included in the final manuscript (lines 294-297) and represented as Figure 2A.</p>

<p>(5) The authors have not mentioned the criteria used to categorize early and late granulomas in TB patients. A lucid description of the same is necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on reviewer’s comment the detailed categorization of early and late granulomas in TB patients is now included in the revised manuscript (line 256-260). Early granulomas: Discrete conglomerates of immune cells and resident stromal cells with defined borders and absence of central necrosis, and Late granulomas: Large and dense clusters of immune cells and resident cells with an evident necrotic center containing bacteria and dead neutrophils and lymphocytic infiltrating cells on the periphery of the necrotic center. MCs were measured in the periphery and inside early granulomas, while in the late granulomas, they were mainly quantified in the periphery.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors mention that &quot;While MCTCs accumulated in early immature granulomas within TB lesions, MCCs accumulated in late granulomas in TB patients&quot;. While this is evident from the representative, the quantification in Figure 1B seems to indicate otherwise.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The labeling in the quantitative analysis shown in Figure 1B has been corrected in the revised manuscript to accurately reflect the accumulation of MC<sub>TC</sub>s in early granulomas and MC<sub>C</sub>s in late granulomas.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The labelling followed in Figures 3, 4 and S2 do not match with the discussion. Such errors should be rectified to minimize any ambiguity within the text of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for noting this. The color coding has been corrected to ensure consistency across all figures.</p>

<p>(8) The mast cell deficient mice model has a differential number of immune cells at the site of granuloma as reported in the manuscript. This could contribute to the altered mycobacterial survival and inflammation cytokine production in the lung and hence might not be a direct effect of mast cell depletion. The authors can consider reconstituting mast cell populations to analyze the mast cell function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have adoptively transferred MCs into WT mice before Mtb challenge to assess if this would increase inflammation and Mtb CFU in the lung and spleen. Our results show that while lung inflammation was not impacted, we found that the dissemination to the spleen and the frequency of neutrophils in the lung were increased in WT mice that received MCs (Figure 5, lines 429-443).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Line 295- 297, the authors state &quot;MCs continued to accumulate in the lung up to 100 dpi in CgKitWsh mice, following which the MC numbers decreased at later stages&quot;. However, the quantification in Figure 4A does not reflect the same. This should be addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to the reviewers' comments, we conducted a new analysis of lung MCs at baseline, comparing wild-type and MC-deficient mice. The revised data show that MC-deficient mice have fewer mast cells at baseline compared to B6 mice. Furthermore, mast cell numbers increase during infection, peaking at 100 days post-infection (dpi) and subsequently stabilize by 150 dpi. The revised data has been included in Figure 4A and text line 395-403.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Additionally, while the scRNAseq data reflects a lower production of TNF in pulmonary TB granulomas, the mice deficient in mast cells are discussed to have a lower production of proinflammatory cytokines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Mast cells increasing and contributing to the TB pathogenesis is the theme of the paper and as such we see and increase in the IFNG pathway genes and similar reduction in the production of pro- inflammatory cytokines. The relative decrease in the TNF pathway gene expression can be reconciled by the fact that less TNF gene expression in PTB could also represent loss of Mtb control and increased pathogenesis (Yuk et al., 2024), which is maintained in the LTBI/HC clusters. Higher bacterial burden of Mtb can also decrease the host TNF production, which is in line with what we observe here (Olsen et al., 2016, Reed et al., 2004, Kurtz et al., 2006).</p>
