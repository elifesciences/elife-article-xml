<title>Abstract</title><p>About 70% of human cleavage stage embryos show chromosomal mosaicism, falling to 20% in blastocysts. Chromosomally mosaic human blastocysts can implant and lead to healthy new-borns with normal karyotypes. Studies in mouse embryos and human gastruloids have shown that aneuploid cells show proteotoxic stress, autophagy and p53 activation and that they are eliminated from the epiblast by apoptosis while being tolerated in the trophectoderm. These observations suggest a selective loss of aneuploid cells from human embryos, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this study we investigated the cellular consequences of aneuploidy in a total of 125 human blastocysts. RNA-sequencing of trophectoderm cells showed transcriptional signatures of activated p53 pathway and apoptosis, which was proportionate to the level of chromosomal imbalance. Immunostaining corroborated that aneuploidy triggers proteotoxic stress, autophagy, p53-signalling, and apoptosis independent from DNA damage. Total cell numbers were lower in aneuploid embryos, due to a decline both in trophectoderm and in epiblast/primitive endoderm cell numbers. While lower cell numbers in trophectoderm may be attributed to apoptosis, it appeared that aneuploidy impaired the second lineage segregation, particularly primitive endoderm formation. This might be reinforced by retention of NANOG in aneuploid embryos. Our findings might explain why fully aneuploid embryos fail to further develop and we hypothesize that the same mechanisms lead to removal of aneuploid cells from mosaic embryos. This hypothesis needs further study as we did not analyze chromosomal mosaic embryos. Finally, we demonstrated a few differences with previous findings in the mouse, emphasizing the need for human embryo research to understand the consequences of aneuploidy.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>These are the main changes made to the initial manuscript:
1.The RNA-seq data (Figures 1+2) is now FDR corrected and been reanalyzed. This has not affected the initial observations on the activation of p53 and apoptosis in aneuploid human embryos, as well as that the transcriptomic changes are driven by gene dosage effects.
2.We have included the transcriptome analysis of reversine-treated embryos in the supplementary data.
3.For validation of novel findings such as the presence of DNA-damage and the expression of DRAM1 in aneuploid embryos, we now include the stainings of 30 human blastocysts (Figure 3o-t). We found absence of DNA-damage in aneuploid embryos and that DRAM1 is increased in the TE but not the ICM of aneuploid embryos.
4.We re-analyzed the co-expression of CASP8/HSP70 in reversine-embryos as suggested by reviewer 1 and found that both proteins tend to be co-expressed.
5.We have added a new analysis of NANOG expression (Figure 4a,b) of the embryos used in Figure 3o-t and have found retention of NANOG protein in both the TE and ICM.
6.We have added 6 euploid and 4 aneuploid embryos to Figure 4l-s, which support the conclusions on the absence of autophagy activation in the ICM and failure of PrE formation in aneuploid embryos.
7.We have significantly changed the layout of the figures, revised the supplementary tables, added source data files and rewritten the discussion.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aneuploidy is common in human preimplantation embryos from both natural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">MunnÃ© et al., 2020a</xref>) and medically assisted reproduction cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chavez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chow et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fragouli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mertzanidou et al., 2013b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Popovic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Starostik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Voullaire et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Wells and Delhanty, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Depending on the study, up to 80% of human cleavage stage embryos are found to be aneuploid, of which 70% show chromosomal mosaicism, i.e., the presence of at least two cell lineages with different genomic content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Regin et al., 2022</xref>). The reasons behind this high rate of chromosomal abnormalities of mitotic origin is still largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">McCoy, 2017</xref>). One explanation is that cleavage-stage embryos have a weak spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) that is uncoupled of apoptosis until the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jacobs et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">VÃ¡zquez-Diez et al., 2019</xref>), in combination with an abundancy of transcripts of anti-apoptotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). Only after embryonic genome activation, the rapidly increasing expression of pro-apoptotic genes along with the full functionality of the SAC establishes the control of mitotic errors. Additionally, aneuploidy in human embryos originates from an erroneous first mitotic division through a prolonged prometaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Currie et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>It is by now well established that chromosomally mosaic embryos can result in healthy new-borns with normal karyotypes, implying a progressive and selective loss of aneuploid cells during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fragouli et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Greco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">MunnÃ© et al., 2020b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Viotti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). In the preimplantation embryo, several studies have shown that the proportion of aneuploid cells within the embryo decreases as from three days post fertilization (3dpf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fragouli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">van Echten-Arends et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Yang et al., 2021</xref>) with no apparent preferential allocation of aneuploid cells to either trophectoderm (TE) or inner cell mass (ICM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capalbo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Popovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Ren et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Starostik et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, the TE of mouse embryos treated with the SAC inhibitor reversine show a similar but statistically significant 6% enrichment for aneuploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, other studies on human embryos found that the TE contained a slightly higher number of aneuploid cells than the ICM, but without reaching statistical significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Griffin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Starostik et al., 2020</xref>). Lastly, aneuploid cells have also been found to be excluded as cell debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Orvieto et al., 2020</xref>) or allocated to the blastocoel cavity and to peripheral cells that do not participate in the formation of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Griffin et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>After implantation, aneuploid cells become progressively more frequent in the trophoblast lineage as compared to the epiblast (EPI) and primitive endoderm (PrE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Starostik et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that the trophoblast cells are more tolerant to aneuploidy, which is in line with the rate of 1-2% of confined placental mosaicism found in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kalousek and Vekemans, 1996</xref>). Large copy number variations appear to be mostly confined to placental lineages (Zamani Esteki et al., 2019) due to developmental bottlenecks occurring during the first lineage segregation which genetically isolate TE from ICM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coorens et al., 2021</xref>). Taken together, there is ample evidence supporting the selective elimination of aneuploid cells from the embryonic lineage during pre- and post-implantation development, while the extraembryonic tissues appear to be more tolerant to genetic imbalances.</p>
<p>From a cellular point of view, aneuploidy has two types of consequences: a generic response and one that depends on the specific aneuploidy. The first type of response is highly conserved and has been found from yeast and plants to mouse and human cells (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Santaguida and Amon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chunduri and StorchovÃ¡, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chunduri et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Krivega et al., 2022</xref>). Aneuploidy results in gene-dosage defects, leading to an unbalanced protein pool that induces the activation of the mechanisms to restore protein homeostasis, such as the chaperone system, the ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ariyoshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">DÃ¼rrbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Santaguida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Stingele et al., 2012</xref>). If these systems are overwhelmed, the accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins induces proteotoxic stress which is detrimental to the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Donnelly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huettel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ohashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Oromendia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Stingele et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Torres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Williams et al., 2008</xref>). Further, aneuploidy can cause replication stress, which in turn can lead to DNA-damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Passerini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Santaguida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Sheltzer et al., 2011</xref>), p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Santaguida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Thompson and Compton, 2010</xref>) and ultimately to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Santaguida and Amon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Regin et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>These mechanisms also appear to be active during early embryonic development and to have a lineage specific effect. In mice, clearance of aneuploid cells by apoptosis requires the activation of autophagy and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Singla et al., 2020</xref>). Aneuploid cells are only being eliminated by apoptosis in the ICM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>) and at similar rates in the EPI and the PrE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Singla et al., 2020</xref>). In a study using human 2D gastruloids with reversine-induced aneuploidy, apoptosis was only induced in differentiating but not in pluripotent cells, although aneuploidy did induce an increase in total nuclear p53 in both cell types. Similarly, as in the mouse, the aneuploid cells were eliminated by apoptosis from the embryonic germ layers but were tolerated in the TE-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Yang et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The type of aneuploidy and the percentage of aneuploid cells within a euploid/aneuploid mosaic embryo determine its developmental capacity. The viability of mouse embryos inversely correlates to the proportion of aneuploid cells, with 50% of euploid cells being sufficient to sustain normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>). This same threshold appears to apply to human embryos, where embryos with less than 50% of aneuploid cells have higher developmental potential than those containing more than 50%, albeit both performing worse than fully euploid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Viotti et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, whole chromosome gains and losses that are present in every cell of the human embryo are usually linked to lethality with the notable exception of trisomies 13 (Patau syndrome), 18 (Edwards syndrome) and 21 (Down syndrome), and sex chromosome abnormalities. The effects of these imbalances can manifest already during early embryo development (Fuchs Weizman et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Licciardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sanchez-Ribas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Shahbazi et al., 2020</xref>). Shahbazi <italic>et al</italic>. recently described the consequences of carrying specific meiotic aneuploidies on human embryo development using an in vitro implantation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Shahbazi et al., 2020</xref>). They showed that human embryos with trisomy 15, 16 and 21 and monosomy 21 readily all reached the blastocyst stage, and that monosomy 21 embryos arrested after implantation while trisomy 15 and 21 embryos developed further. Interestingly, trisomy 16 embryos showed a hypoproliferative trophoblast due to excessive CDH1 expression, a gene located on chromosome 16.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the cellular responses to complex aneuploidy during human preimplantation development, with a focus on stress response and lineage segregation events. We assessed previously unexplored general consequences of naturally acquired aneuploidies in human embryos with focus on impaired lineage segregation events.</p>

<p>All human embryos, unless stated otherwise, were warmed using the Vitrification Thaw Kit (Vit Kit-Thaw; Irvine Scientific, USA) and cultured in 25 ÂµL droplets of Origio Sequential Blast<sup>TM</sup> medium (Origio) at 37Â°C with 5% O<sub>2</sub>, 6% CO<sub>2</sub> and 89% N<sub>2</sub>. Embryos were graded before vitrification by experienced clinical embryologists according to Gardner and Schoolcraft criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gardner and Schoolcraft, 1999</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>We warmed vitrified human blastocysts (5-6dpf) after PGT (28 euploid and 22 aneuploid) or at 3dpf (n=11). Post PGT-embryos were left to recover for 2h in culture medium, after which they underwent a second TE biopsy. For the reversine experiment, we cultured the 3dpf embryos for 24h in culture medium supplemented with 0.5 ÂµM reversine (Stem Cell Technologies) and after wash-out we let them develop until 5dpf and subsequently took a biopsy. The concentration of 0.5 ÂµM reversine was chosen based on previous experiments in mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Singla et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Biopsy procedure</title>
<p>The zona pellucida was opened (15-25Âµm) on 4dpf using a Saturn Laser (Cooper Surgical). For PGT cycles, expanded good quality embryos were biopsied on 5dpf; early blastocysts were evaluated again for expansion on 6dpf. Briefly, embryos were transferred to HEPES buffered medium and biopsied on a Nikon inversed microscope equipped with a Saturn Laser. The herniated TE cells were then aspirated and cut using manual laser shoots. In case of sticking cells this was supported by mechanical cutting. After successful tubing, the blastocysts were vitrified using CBS-VIT High-Security straws (CryoBioSystem, LâAigle, France) with dimethylsulphoxide-ethylene glycol-sucrose as the cryoprotectants (Irvine Scientific Freeze Kit, Newtownmountkennedy, County Wicklow, Ireland) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Van Landuyt et al., 2011</xref>). The TE biopsy for RNA-sequencing (Experiment 1) was performed with the same procedure, cells were biopsied from the same opening in the zona pellucida.</p>

Count tables were generated using STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) (version 2.5.3) through mapping against the Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 patch release 10 (GRCh38.p10) combined with a general transfer format (GTF) file, both downloaded from the Ensembl database. The RNA-sequencing by Expectation Maximization (RSEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>) software (version 1.3.0) was used to produce the count tables.</p>
<p>Differential gene expression analysis was performed using R-studio (Version 1.1.456) with the edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Robinson et al., 2009</xref>) and limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) packages. We included genes with a count per million greater than 1 in at least two samples. The trimmed mean of M values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Robinson and Oshlack, 2010</xref>) algorithm was used for normalization. The normalized counts were then transformed in a log<sub>2</sub> fold-change (log<sub>2</sub>FC) table with their associated statistics. In each comparison, genes with a | log<sub>2</sub>FC | &gt; 1 and an FDR &lt; 0.05 were considered as significantly differentially expressed.</p>
<p>Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the GSEA software (version 4.3.2) from the Molecular Signature Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp</ext-link>). We generated a ranked gene list based on the normalized count matrix of the whole transcriptome that was detected after differential gene expression. The ranked gene list was then subjected to the GSEA function, and we searched the Hallmark and C2 library for significantly enriched pathways. Significance was determined using a cut-off value of 25% FDR. This cut-off is proposed in the user guide of the GSEA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideTEXT.htm">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideTEXT.htm</ext-link>) especially for incoherent gene expression datasets, as suggested by our PCAs, which allows for hypothesis driven validation of the dataset.</p>
<p>The copy number variation (CNV) analysis was inferred from our RNA-sequencing data set using inferCNV R package (version 1.7.1) (Inferring copy number alterations from tumor single cell RNA-Seq data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/inferCNV/wiki">https://github.com/broadinstitute/inferCNV/wiki</ext-link>&quot;). Our count table was used as input and compared to the reference set which in our case was the expression data of the euploid embryos.

<title>Gene dosage analysis</title>
<p>We calculated the total number of loci with imbalanced gene expression based on the genetic abnormalities identified during the PGT. For this, we used the number of coding loci per chromosomal region as listed in the ENSMBL database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ensemble.org">ensemble.org</ext-link>) and included both gains and losses, either mosaic or homogeneously present, and both full chromosomal aneuploidy as well as segmental abnormalities. The embryos were ranked based on the total number of imbalanced loci and separated into a low- and a high-imbalanced gene dosage group. The low-dosage group contained the embryos with the lowest 50<sup>th</sup> percentile in number of unbalanced loci, the high-dosage group the embryos with 50<sup>th</sup> percentile or higher.</p>

<p>Prior to fixation we removed the zona pellucida using pre-warmed to 37Â°C Acidic Tyrodeâs Solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 sec â 2 min and subsequently washed in PBS/2%BSA. Embryos were then fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min, washed three times in PBS/2%BSA for 5 min and then permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min followed by another washing cycle. We used PBS/2% BSA supplemented with 10% FBS for 1h to block non-specific protein binding. The embryos were then incubated overnight with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 9) diluted in blocking buffer at 4Â°C. The next day, they underwent another washing cycle using PBS/2%BSA and were then incubated with secondary antibodies (1:200, Supplementary Table 9) for 1h at room temperature. After washing, nuclei were stained using Hoechst 33342 (5Âµg/mL, Life Technologies) diluted in PBS/2%BSA for 15 min. For imaging we mounted the embryos on poly-L-lysine coated glass slides (Sigma-Aldrich) in 3ÂµL of PBS. To avoid flattening of the embryos we used Secure-Seal<sup>TM</sup> Spacers (9mm diameter, 0.12mm deep, Thermofisher) before putting the coverslips in place. For the experiments that required re-staining we imaged the embryos in 3ÂµL PBS/2%BSA in 18 well Âµ-Slides (Ibidi) and subsequently recuperated them. After recuperation we photobleached the embryos stained for CASP3/7 by using maximum laser power of the 488 nm channel and maximum size of the pinhole for 10 min. The embryos were then re-stained using rat anti-GATA4 primary antibody and the matching Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Supplementary Table 9) (to replace the CASP3/7 staining).</p>

<title>Human embryos with complex aneuploidy show gene dosage defects and transcriptomic signatures of p53 activation and apoptosis</title>
<p>We first tested for the presence of a common transcriptomic response to different complex aneuploidies. For this, we studied the transcriptome of a TE biopsy of fifty human blastocysts (5 or 6dpf) previously diagnosed by Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) as either euploid or as containing an aneuploidy of at least two whole chromosomes in all cases except for one embryo (further referred to as aneuploid, detailed karyotypes can be found in the Supplementary Table 1). The aneuploidy was presumed to have occurred during meiosis or during the first cleavage from zygote to the 2-cell stage, resulting in all or most of the cells of the TE biopsy containing the same genetic imbalances. We also included a TE sample of eleven human blastocysts that were treated with 0.5 ÂµM reversine from 3dpf to 4dpf, to induce complex mosaic aneuploidy (referred to as reversine-treated embryos). Of these, 14 euploid, 20 aneuploid and 11 reversine-treated embryos yielded good quality RNA-sequencing results.</p>
<p>Principal component analysis using all expressed genes revealed no clustering of the euploid, aneuploid or reversine-treated embryos into distinct groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). We used InferCNV (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/inferCNV/wiki">https://github.com/broadinstitute/inferCNV/wiki</ext-link>) to bioinformatically infer the chromosomal copy numbers based on the higher or lower expression of the genes located on chromosomes with gains or losses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>). We compared the inferred karyotypes to those obtained during PGT and found a match for 45/48 of the full chromosome aneuploidies, while euploidy was correctly predicted in all cases (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). These results show that aneuploidy in human blastocysts results in abnormal gene dosage effects. Of note, the karyotypes of the reversine-treated embryos could not be determined since this drug induces different aneuploidies in each cell, leading to mosaic TE biopsies. Also, the karyotypes of the 3dpf embryos were not determined by PGT before the reversine treatment. InferCNV detected only a trisomy 12 in one of the reversine-treated embryos, likely of meiotic or first-cleavage origin (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>).</p>

<p>Despite the abnormal gene dosage, but in line with the lack of clear clustering in the PCA, the differential gene expression analysis yielded 21 significantly upregulated and 2 downregulated genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). These findings are similar to those of other studies on the transcriptome of aneuploid human embryonic cells, which also found a few significantly deregulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fernandez Gallardo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Groff et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Martin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Maxwell et al., 2022</xref>). We next focused on pathway analysis based on a ranked gene list of the whole transcriptome. We found that cellular stress gene sets were positively enriched in the aneuploid samples, including the p53-pathway and apoptosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d-f</xref>). Gene sets related to metabolism, translation, mitochondrial function and proliferation, such as translation and ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation and MYC targets, were negatively enriched (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d-f</xref>).</p>
<p>When comparing reversine-treated versus euploid embryos we found 34 significantly upregulated and 22 significantly downregulated genes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 1d-f</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). The expression profile differed from that identified in the endogenously aneuploid embryos. Here, we found mitotic spindle, WNT-beta catenin signalling, KRAS signalling and lysosome gene sets to be positively enriched while oxidative phosphorylation, MYC targets, translation and ribosome were negatively enriched. We found no evidence for p53 activation or apoptosis. This suggests that naturally acquired aneuploidies of meiotic origin may elicit a different transcriptomic response than reversine-induced mitotic aneuploidies, with a differential induction of the p53 signalling pathway and apoptosis, and inhibition of proliferation.</p>

<title>High gene-dosage imbalances result in high p53 activation and apoptosis while low gene dosage imbalances induce pro-survival pathways</title>
<p>To test whether there is a relationship between the type of cellular stress signatures and the size of the chromosomal imbalances, as previously described in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">DÃ¼rrbaum and StorchovÃ¡, 2016</xref>), we categorized the aneuploid embryos into a low- and a high-imbalanced gene dosage group. This separation was based on the total number of coding loci that were affected by the aneuploidies (Supplementary Table 4). The low-dosage group contained the embryos under the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile when ranking the embryos from the lowest to the highest number of unbalanced loci. The high-dosage group contained the embryos with 50<sup>th</sup> percentile or higher. Principal component analysis showed that high-dosage embryos clustered separately from the euploid embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), with 65 significantly upregulated and 153 significantly downregulated genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, Supplementary Table 5). High dosage embryos showed a transcriptomic profile consistent with activation of the p53-pathway and apoptosis, while the unfolded protein response, DNA-repair, MYC targets, oxidative phosphorylation, translation and ribosome were inhibited (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c-e</xref>).</p>

<p>In contrast, low-dosage embryos lacked separation from the euploid embryos in the PCA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>) and only had one differentially expressed gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). While we still found aneuploidy related stress responses such as p53-pathway and apoptosis to be activated, we found also pro-survival gene sets such as MYC targets (Dang et al., 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), MTORC1 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hung et al., 2012</xref>), unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hetz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Zanetti et al., 2016</xref>) and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">SimÃµes-Sousa et al., 2018</xref>) to be enriched (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h-j</xref>). Low-dosage embryos showed no profiles of ribosome or translation impairment. Last, the plotting of the expression levels of genes in the p53 and apoptosis pathways show their progressive stronger induction or suppression from euploid to low and high dosage embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2k</xref>). This illustrates the association between the severity of the protein pool imbalance and the induction of the cellular stress response.</p>

<p>We next sought to corroborate the transcriptomic signatures of proteotoxic stress and autophagy. The number of puncta per cell of LC3B, and p62, as well as the intensity of HSP70 staining, as markers of autophagy and chronic protein misfolding, were significantly increased in both aneuploid and reversine-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f-j</xref>). We also tested for the colocalization of CASP8 and HSP70 at the individual cell level. We found that reversine-treated embryonic cells mainly co-express CASP8/HSP70, while the minority is single positive for either CASP8 or HSP70 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3k,l</xref>). These results show that although the transcriptomic profile of naturally occurring aneuploidies and reversine-treated embryos is moderately different (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c-f</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1d-f</xref>), the downstream protein response is similar.</p>
<p>One of the key activated pathways identified during the transcriptome analysis was p53-signalling. Thus, we sought to validate p53 activation by staining for the phosphorylation of Serine-15 on p53, which is phosphorylated upon stimuli such as DNA-damage and metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Loughery et al., 2014</xref>). We found that indeed aneuploid embryos showed a higher percentage of cells with activated p53 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3m,n</xref>). These differences did not reach significance when considering the ICM/EPI-OCT4-positive cells or TE OCT4-negative cells separately (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2a-c</xref>) probably due to insufficient statistical power.</p>
<p>We then stained an additional batch of embryos (Supplementary Table 6) for the double-strand break marker gH2AX, with the aim of determining if the p53 activation was DNA-damage mediated. As a control, we treated human embryos with the DNA-damage inducer Bleomycin and compared them to untreated embryos. All cells of Bleomycin treated embryos showed a pan-nuclear gH2AX pattern, while untreated embryos rarely showed cells containing foci (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3o</xref>). Euploid and aneuploid embryos showed similar fractions of cells with gH2AX foci or pan-nuclear staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3p,q</xref>), which did not change when dividing the aneuploid embryos into high and low dosage groups, (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3r</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, the transcriptome analysis showed significant upregulation in aneuploid and high-dosage aneuploid embryos of the gene <italic>DRAM1</italic> (DNA Damage Regulated Autophagy Modulator-1, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). DRAM1 is in the lysosomal membrane, and it increases autophagic flux and apoptosis after stress-induced p53 activation in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Crighton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Guan et al., 2015</xref>). We stained euploid and aneuploid embryos (Supplementary Table 6) for DRAM1 and NANOG and found that the expression of DRAM1 is increased specifically in the cytoplasm of aneuploid TE cells but not in the ICM (NANOG-positive cells, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3s,t</xref>).</p>

<title>Aneuploidy increases apoptosis in the trophectoderm and impairs lineage segregation events</title>
<p>We next investigated whether the stress responses to aneuploidy are cell-type specific, as shown in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Singla et al., 2020</xref>) and human 2D gastruloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Concretely, we aimed to study the consequences of aneuploidy during the first lineage segregation event to TE and ICM, and the second lineage segregation event to EPI and PrE.</p>
<p>We first immunostained euploid and aneuploid 5-6dpf human embryos for the pluripotency marker NANOG (Supplementary Table 6). NANOG protein was enriched in the nuclei of aneuploid TE and ICM cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>), which could suggest a delay in the exit from pluripotency in both lineages. We then co-stained 6-7dpf euploid and aneuploid blastocysts for OCT4, CASP3/7 and LC3B (Supplementary Table 7). Overall, we found lower cell counts in both the TE (OCT-negative cells) and in the OCT4-positive cells (ICM/EPI cells), <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c-e</xref>) of aneuploid embryos. This resulted in lower total cell numbers in aneuploid embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>), in line with our previous observation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). We found a higher percentage of nuclear CASP3/7 positive cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g,h</xref>) as well as a higher CASP3/7 mean intensity per cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g,i</xref>) specifically in the TE of aneuploid embryos. In contrast, not a single OCT4-positive cell of either the euploid or aneuploid embryos showed nuclear CASP3/7 signal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). Aneuploid embryos also showed a higher number of CASP3/7-positive micronuclei in the cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j,k</xref>). The lineage-specific response to aneuploidy also extended to presence of autophagy. The staining for LC3B showed that aneuploid embryos displayed overall increased levels of autophagy which was mainly taking place in the TE and not the ICM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4l-o</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, we observed that the counts of OCT4-positive cells in the aneuploid embryos distributed in two groups: one with very low counts and one with counts in the range of that of euploid embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that some of the aneuploid embryos had a delayed ICM development, with impairment of the second lineage segregation event. All blastocysts analyzed above were re-stained for GATA4 (PrE marker) and imaged together with OCT4 (ICM/EPI marker). We found that while all euploid embryos contained GATA4-positive cells, 39% of aneuploid embryos had no GATA4-positive cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4p,q</xref>). Furthermore, in those aneuploid embryos that contained GATA4-positive PrE cells, there was a significantly lower ratio of GATA4-positive to OCT4-positive/GATA4-negative cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4r</xref>). Categorization of the aneuploid embryos into a low- and a high-dosage group (Supplementary Table 8) showed that the higher the number of imbalanced loci, the lower the cell numbers in the TE and PrE but not in the EPI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4s</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that there are important differences in how the embryonic lineages respond to aneuploidy. While the TE is activating autophagy and apoptosis, this is not the case for the ICM/EPI. In turn, while in both lineages, aneuploidy appears to promote a delay in the downregulation of NANOG during differentiation, the ICM of high-dosage aneuploid embryos frequently has poor or no differentiation to PrE.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we studied the consequences of uniform complex aneuploidy in human preimplantation embryos. In our study we find that, while aneuploid embryos had lower cell numbers in both TE and ICM/EPI, the effect of aneuploidy was cell-type dependent. Aneuploid TE presented transcriptomic signatures of p53 signalling and apoptosis, and immunostaining of whole embryos showed that aneuploidy results in increased proteotoxic stress, autophagy, activated p53 independent from DNA-damage and subsequent apoptosis. In contrast, in the ICM, aneuploidy affects PrE formation.</p>
<p>Overall, our gene-expression results are in line with previously published RNA-sequencing studies on aneuploid human embryonic cells that identified transcriptional signatures consistent with an alteration of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Martin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Maxwell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Starostik et al., 2020</xref>), the cell cycle (Fuchs Weizman et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Licciardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Martin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Starostik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Vera-Rodriguez et al., 2015</xref>), deregulation of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Licciardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sanchez-Ribas et al., 2019</xref>), p53 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Licciardi et al., 2018</xref>) and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Groff et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Licciardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Martin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Maxwell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sanchez-Ribas et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that strength of these transcriptomic alterations is dependent of the number of imbalanced genes. These gene-dosage dependent effects of aneuploidy are akin to those extensively reported in human and mouse aneuploid cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">DÃ¼rrbaum and StorchovÃ¡, 2016</xref>). We found that higher numbers of aneuploid loci led to stronger induction of p53 target genes and apoptosis responses in the TE cells. Interestingly, high-dosage aneuploid embryos displayed an inhibited unfolded protein response, as also seen in aneuploid embryonic cells by another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fernandez Gallardo et al., 2023</xref>), while this pathway was activated in low dosage aneuploid embryos. These results suggest that while low-dosage aneuploid cells are trying to restore homeostasis by the unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hetz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">JÃ¤ger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Li and Zhu, 2022</xref>), high-dosage aneuploid cells are past this point and undergo apoptosis by p53 activation.</p>
<p>In the subsequent experiments, we found that aneuploid embryos showed increased signal of early (CASP8) and late (CASP3/7) caspases, indicating activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">McIlwain et al., 2013</xref>). The higher levels of p62 and LC3B we found in these embryos suggests that this activation of apoptosis results at least in part from a sustained interaction between p62, LC3B and CASP8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). In parallel, aneuploid embryos showed evidence of an activated p53 pathway, not only on a transcriptomic level, but also by presenting elevated levels of Serine 15 phosphorylated p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Loughery et al., 2014</xref>). This p53 activation has been previously observed on a transcriptomic level in another study on human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Licciardi et al., 2018</xref>) and was identified as a key mediator of aneuploidy-dependent apoptosis in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Singla et al., 2020</xref>). While ATM-mediated phosphorylation of p53 on S15 has been reported in cancer cell lines as a consequence of DNA damage during chromosome mis-segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Janssen et al., 2011</xref>), we found no evidence of increased levels of DNA-damage in our cohort of embryos. It is worth noting that studies on constitutionally aneuploid cell lines have shown contradicting results, with some studies finding p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Thompson and Compton, 2010</xref>) and others not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Tang et al., 2011</xref>). An alternative route for p53 activation is through p38, a sensor for cellular stress such as endoplasmic reticulum stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mishra and Karande, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Thompson and Compton, 2010</xref>). Metabolic alterations might also promote ATM mediated activation of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li et al., 2010</xref>) or phosphorylation on Serine 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). Our study also identified <italic>DRAM1</italic> as a significantly upregulated gene in aneuploid embryos. <italic>DRAM1</italic> is directly regulated by p53 and is not only able to regulate autophagic flux but it also regulates apoptosis, making it likely an important downstream effector of the p53-mediated effects of aneuploidy in human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Crighton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Guan et al., 2015</xref>). Lastly, it is worth considering that the complex abnormal human embryonic cells present in our sample might have been subjected to mitotic stress, as suggested by the enrichment of mitotic spindle pathway genes observed in the RNA-seq dataset. Mitotic stress might be induced by sustained proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>) and can further have contributed to p53 activation. Based on this evidence, we propose that the p53 activation we observed in the embryos with presumed meiotic aneuploidy is akin to that of constitutionally aneuploid cells, and not due to DNA-damage but to cellular stress caused by proteotoxic stress. Taken together, the increased levels of apoptosis we find in aneuploid embryos appear to be mediated at least by two pathways: the sustained p62/LC3B mediated response to unfolded proteins and by p53 activation as a response to cellular stress. An interesting observation from the apoptosis stainings is that aneuploid embryos contained increased numbers of CASP3/7 positive micronuclei. This is similar to findings in a non-human primate model showing that abnormal chromosomes can be encapsulated in micronuclei, which can subsequently be selectively eliminated from the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Daughtry et al., 2019</xref>). The presence of DNA in the cytoplasm has also recently been observed during live-imaging of human embryos, which occurs during blastocyst expansion due to nuclear DNA shedding (Domingo-Muelas <italic>et al</italic>., 2023). In human cleavage stage embryos these micronuclei have been shown to contain genetic material that originates from chromosome breakages due to replication fork stalling and DNA-damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Palmerola et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In the second part of our work, we focused on studying the lineage-specific response to complex aneuploidy, as the studies on reversine-treated mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Singla et al., 2020</xref>) and human 2D gastruloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Yang et al., 2021</xref>) also identified a cell-type specific effect of aneuploidy. In the mouse, aneuploid cells are eliminated by apoptosis in the EPI, while tolerated in the TE, and in human 2D gastruloids, aneuploid cells are eliminated in the post-gastrulation embryonic germ layers but tolerated in the TE. In the human embryo, the first lineage segregation is established at 5dpf, and the ICM and TE are marked by the differential expression of NANOG and GATA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gerri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Meistermann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">AllÃ¨gre et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Regin et al., 2023</xref>). We found that both aneuploid ICM and TE cells showed nuclear enrichment of NANOG, which can be suggestive of a delay or impairment of the first lineage segregation event, possibly due to failure or delay in the exit from pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>While we found increased apoptosis in the aneuploid TE, we found that the ICM/EPI had no CASP3/7 positive cells, despite showing lower cell numbers than the euploid ICM/EPI. These results are in line with the findings of Martin and colleagues, where the RNA-sequencing of TE and ICM samples showed disrupted regulation of apoptosis in mosaic aneuploid TE cells while the ICM showed primarily deregulated mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Martin et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, while the study of Victor et al also finds increased apoptosis in the aneuploid TE, some of their embryos did present CASP3/7 positive signals in the ICM. Further research will be needed to understand if the differences with our findings and those of Martin et al are related to technical or to biological factors. A potential explanation for the lack of apoptosis in the human ICM/EPI could be due to an uncoupling between aneuploidy-induced stress signals and apoptosis, as observed in human embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mantel et al., 2007</xref>). In this context, the lower cell numbers in the aneuploid ICM/EPI could be explained by other known effects of <italic>p53</italic> activation next to induction of apoptosis. First, <italic>p53</italic> activation can decrease cell proliferation, leading to lower cell numbers. Secondly, <italic>p53</italic> activation can downregulate <italic>NANOG</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelalim and Tooyama, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lin et al., 2005</xref>), potentially leading to loss of pluripotency and driving the cells to differentiation and out of the ICM/EPI.</p>
<p>Another observation was that while the aneuploid TE had increased levels of autophagy markers and DRAM1 expression, this did not reach statistical significance in the ICM/EPI. This aligns with work on human embryos showing absence of activation of p53-signalling and autophagy in the transcriptome of the ICM of mosaic human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Martin et al., 2023</xref>), but is in contrast with the reversine-treated mouse embryos and human gastruloids, showing increased autophagy and p53 signalling in the ICM lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Singla et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Next to a species-specific effect, it is possible that the difference between the mouse, human gastruloid and human studies are because the reversine treatment used had direct effects on p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">DâAlise et al., 2008</xref>; S Santaguida, 2010), leading to the activation of autophagy across the entire cells.</p>
<p>Finally, we found that in those embryos that had already undergone the second lineage segregation event, the aneuploid embryos had a significantly lower ratio of PrE (GATA4-positive) to EPI (OCT4-positive/GATA4-negative) cells than euploid embryos, suggesting that aneuploidy has a negative effect on PrE formation. Interestingly, recent work comparing the gene-expression of euploid and mosaic aneuploid embryos has also found that euploid embryos have a higher expression of the PrE marker <italic>SOX17,</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Martin et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>While in mice, apoptosis is common during PrE formation to eliminate misallocated cells through cell competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hashimoto and Sasaki, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Plusa et al., 2008</xref>), our data and that of others suggest that the human ICM rarely undergoes apoptosis, even in karyotypically aberrant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Martin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Victor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). While a possible explanation suggested by our NANOG stainings is that in aneuploid human embryos the PrE forms later due to retention of NANOG in the ICM and TE, the mechanisms behind this second lineage differentiation defect remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>When interpreting the results of this study, it is important to bear in mind that we identified the ICM/EPI as staining positive for OCT4 and the PrE as positive for GATA4. We confirmed that the embryos analysed were expanded blastocysts which had undergone the first lineage segregations, as OCT4 was restricted to the inner cells and absent in TE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Niakan and Eggan, 2013</xref>). The identity of human ICM and EPI cells is currently under vigorous debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Meistermann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Radley et al., 2022</xref>) and exclusive markers of either cell type are untested. Therefore, we cannot assign ICM or EPI identity to OCT4-positive cells with certainty. However, in blastocysts with GATA4-positive cells the second lineage segregation had occurred and PrE was established, and consequently we confidently assigned the EPI identity to OCT4-positive cells in these blastocysts. In GATA4-negative embryos OCT4-positive cells could be either ICM or EPI cells. Interestingly, we only found a single GATA4-positive cell lacking OCT4, supporting the hypothesis that PrE cells differentiate from EPI cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Meistermann et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations and there are some considerations to bear in mind. In this work, we did not analyse the transcriptome of the ICM, because the remaining embryos were used for immunostaining after TE biopsy, and we can therefore not draw any conclusions on the ICM transcriptome. We did not study embryos with the same type of aneuploidy and can thus not provide insight on chromosome-specific effects. Although some of our embryos carried genetic abnormalities in mosaic form as part of their complex karyotype (aneuploid/aneuploid mosaics), we did not study diploid/aneuploid mosaic embryos and can therefore not assert that these also activate the same cellular stress pathways in their aneuploid cells. Since these pathways are common to most cell types, our prediction would however be that they are activated in mosaic embryos too. The possibilities for functional studies and lineage tracing experiments in human embryos are very limited, which is why we can only present an observational study. Alternatively, in silico modelling data could be leveraged to address the roles of aneuploidy in blastocyst formation and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Nissen et al., 2017</xref>). The gene-expression analysis revealed that embryos with naturally acquired and induced aneuploidies had few deregulated pathways in common, with mainly the mitotic spindle genes being differentially expressed in both. Conversely, we used reversine to induce aneuploidy in the immunostaining experiments to increase the sample size, and the results showed that the reversine-induced aneuploidies elicited the same stress responses as aneuploidy. This suggests that while reversine-based models are very close, they may not fully mimic endogenous aneuploidy. An alternative is to use the SAC-inhibitor A3146, recently proposed by the Zernicka-Goetz group to induce low-degree aneuploidy in mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sanchez-Vasquez et al., 2023</xref>). Finally, our results on the activation of autophagy and proteotoxic stress are also limited by experimental constraints. We cannot rule out indirect activation of apoptosis mediated by autophagy due to the degradation of cell organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gump and Thorburn, 2011</xref>). Also, other upstream regulators of autophagy could be involved, such as the cGAS-STING pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Krivega et al., 2021</xref>). While we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Singla et al., 2020</xref>) used HSP70 as a marker for chronic protein misfolding, we cannot preclude that is also acts as a (temporary) suppressor of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway in aneuploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gabai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lanneau et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results show that while the same pathways appear to be activated in human and mouse embryos with complex aneuploidy, human embryos have a dosage-dependent and differential response when it comes to the downstream effect of these pathways in the different cell lineages. While the mouse readily depletes aneuploid cells by apoptosis specifically from the embryonic lineage before implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Singla et al., 2020</xref>), in the human embryo, apoptosis appears to be more active in the TE and aneuploidy negatively affects PrE formation in the ICM. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms by which human embryos respond to gene-dosage imbalances and may contribute to understanding how aneuploid cells are selectively eliminated in mosaic preimplantation embryos. Further research, especially by using human embryos with endogenous chromosomal mosaicism, will be needed to shed light on the interactions between proteotoxic stress, the p53 pathway and differentiation during early development, for which the most novel models of human embryo implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Deglincerti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kagawa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Shahbazi et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">2016</xref>) will prove to be of incalculable value.</p>

<p>A high fraction of cells in early embryos carry aneuploid karyotypes, yet even chromosomally mosaic human blastocysts can implant and lead to healthy newborns with diploid karyotypes. Previous studies in other models have shown that genotoxic and proteotoxic stresses arising from aneuploidy lead to the activation of the p53 pathway and autophagy, which helps eliminate cells with aberrant karyotypes. These observations have been here evaluated and confirmed in human blastocysts. The study also demonstrates that the second lineage and formation of primitive endoderm are particularly impaired by aneuploidy.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed the critical issues sufficiently. In particular, they improved the data analysis and added additional data from embryonal samples.</p>

<p>This study provides valuable insights into the cellular responses to complex aneuploidy in human preimplantation embryos. The authors have significantly expanded their sample size and conducted additional analysis and experiments to address previous concerns. The revised manuscript presents stronger evidence for gene dosage-dependent effects of aneuploidy on stress responses and lineage segregation. Overall, the findings contribute important knowledge to our understanding of how human embryos respond to chromosomal abnormalities.</p>
<p>Overall, the revision has substantially improved the manuscript and addressed the major concerns raised in the initial review.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This study has uncovered some important initial findings about cellular responses to aneuploidy through analysis of gene expression in a set of donated human embryos. While the study's findings are in general solid, some experiments lack statistical power due to small sample sizes. The authors should try to get much more insight with their data highlighting the novel findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the editor for considering our manuscript for publication at <italic>elife</italic>, and for the helpful and thorough reviews of our work. Based on the suggestions of the reviewers, we have carried out additional experiments, expanded the sample size and reanalyzed the data. This has resulted in a thoroughly revised manuscript and much improved work, which we are convinced meets the requirements to be published as a version of record. Of note, the experiments for the revision required the support by 2 additional researchers from our lab which are now coauthors.</p>
<p>These are the main changes made to the initial manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) The RNA-seq data (Figures 1+2) is now FDR corrected and been reanalyzed. This has not affected the initial observations on the activation of p53 and apoptosis in aneuploid human embryos, as well as that the transcriptomic changes are driven by gene dosage effects.</p>
<p>(2) We have included the transcriptome analysis of reversine-treated embryos in the supplementary data.</p>
<p>(3) For validation of novel findings such as the presence of DNA-damage and the expression of DRAM1 in aneuploid embryos, we now include the stainings of 30 human blastocysts (Figure 3o-t). We found absence of DNA-damage in aneuploid embryos and that DRAM1 is increased in the TE but not the ICM of aneuploid embryos.</p>
<p>(4) We re-analyzed the co-expression of CASP8/HSP70 in reversine-embryos as suggested by reviewer 1 and found that both proteins tend to be co-expressed.</p>
<p>(5) We have added a new analysis of NANOG expression (Figure 4a,b) of the embryos used in Figure 3o-t and have found retention of NANOG protein in both the TE and ICM.</p>
<p>(6) We have added 6 euploid and 4 aneuploid embryos to Figure 4l-s, which support the conclusions on the absence of autophagy activation in the ICM and failure of PrE formation in aneuploid embryos.</p>
<p>(7) We have significantly changed the layout of the figures, revised the supplementary tables, added source data files and rewritten the discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding the sample size of the study, it is important to emphasize that human embryos are ethically sensitive material and that those with the specific genetic content we used in this study are rare, limiting our ability to expand the sample size. For the revision, we have added 40 human blastocysts to our initial 85 embryos. Compared to similar and high-quality studies using human embryos, our study shows a relatively large sample size (n=125): Victor <italic>et al.</italic> 2021: 30 human blastocysts for immunostainings1; Martin <italic>et al.</italic> 2023: 14 human blastocysts2; Martin <italic>et al.</italic> 2024: 64 human blastocysts3; Domingo-Muelas <italic>et al.</italic> 2023: 23 human blastocysts4.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer#1(PublicReview):</bold></p>
<p>This study investigated an important question in human reproduction: why most fully aneuploid embryos is incompatible with normal fetal development. Specifically, the authors investigated the cellular responses to aneuploidy through analysis of gene expression in a set of donated human blastocysts. The samples included uniform aneuploid embryos of meiotic origin and mosaic aneuploid embryos from the SAC inhibitor reversine treatment. The authors relied mainly on low-input RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining. Pathway analysis with RNA-seq data of trophectoderm cells suggested activation of p53 and possibly apoptosis, and this cellular signature appeared to be stronger in TE cells with a higher degree of aneuploidy. Immunostaining also found some evidence of apoptosis, increased expression of HSP70 and autophagy in some aneuploid cells. With combinational OCT4 and GATA4 as lineage markers, it appeared that aneuploidy could alter the second lineage segregation and primitive endoderm formation in particular.</p>
<p>Although this study is largely descriptive, it generated valuable RNA-seq data from a set of aneuploid TE cells with known karyotypes. Immunostaining results in general were consistent with findings in mouse embryos and human gastruloids.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the thorough evaluation of our manuscript. We have implemented most of the suggestions, which have further strengthened the original findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While there is a scarcity of human embryo materials for research, the lack of single cell level data limits further extension of the presented data on the consequences of mosaic embryos.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not include single cell RNA-seq data of mosaic human embryos in our study because we focused on embryos diagnosed with complex meiotic abnormalities. Our hypothesis was that the cellular consequences of aneuploidy would be strongest in this type of aneuploidies and most evident to identify and would allow us to provide a basis for the mechanisms of elimination of aneuploid cells in human embryos. In the manuscript (lines 596-626) we acknowledge the limitations of the extrapolation of our results to mosaic embryos.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A major concern is that the gene list used for pathway analysis is not FDR controlled. It is also unclear how the many plots generated with the &quot;supervised approach&quot; were actually performed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the concerns about the fact that our differential expression gene list was not FDR but p-value ranked. We followed the suggestion of the reviewer and revised the RNAseq analysis and focused primarily on pathway analysis. We have also added the comparison between aneuploid and reversine treated embryos to the supplementary data and expanded the analysis of high dosage and low dosage embryos. Importantly, the new analysis has not changed the original finding that aneuploid embryos show hallmarks of p53 activation and apoptosis, and that these effects are gene dosage dependent. The manuscript now includes two completely revised and new figures 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Since we discarded the data generated from our previous approach, we do not use the term supervised approach anymore.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors also appear to have ignored the possibility that high-dosage group could have a higher mitotic defect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is indeed a possibility. In the discussion (lines 504-508) we have now incorporated the notion that the high dosage embryos could have higher mitotic defects, although our data cannot provide any evidence for this. Of note, the gene expression data shows that all aneuploid embryos (including low dosage and reversine embryos) equally show an enrichment for mitotic spindle pathway genes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Assuming a fully aneuploid embryo, why do only some cells display p53 and autophagy marker?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very good question, on which we can only speculate, but the answer likely lies in the diversity across cells of the same embryo.</p>
<p>Even in genetically homogenous tissues and cell cultures, individual cells can exhibit different levels of stress responses, such as p53 activation and apoptosis. This variation may be influenced by the local cellular environment, stochastic gene expression, or differences in cell cycle stages. Other studies on fully aneuploid human embryos could also not detect apoptotic responses in every cell1,3.</p>
<p>For instance, p53 activation differs even between cells that have a similar number of DNA breaks, and this activation is influenced by both cell-intrinsic factors and previous exposure to DNA damage5.</p>
<p>Cell cycle tightly regulates the response of cells to different stressors. For instance, cells in G1 or S-phase might be more sensitive to apoptosis signals6, while those in G2/M might escape this response temporarily7.  Autophagy is more induced in G1 and S phases, with reduced activity in G2 and M phases8.</p>
<p>Individual cells may also have different levels of success in the activation of the compensatory pathways, including the unfolded protein response, autophagy, or changes in metabolism, resulting in some cells adapting better than others.</p>
<p>The expression of p53 and the sensitivity to apoptosis could also be influenced by epigenetic differences between cells, which may alter their transcriptional response to aneuploidy. Even in a genetically identical population, cells can have different epigenetic landscapes, leading to heterogeneous gene expression patterns.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The conclusion about proteotoxic stress was largely based on staining of HSP70. It appears from Figure 3 d,h that the same cells exhibited increased HSP70 and CASP8 staining. Since HSP70 is known to have anti-apoptotic effect, could the increased expression of Hsp70 be an anti-apoptotic response?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our conclusion about proteotoxic stress was not solely based on HSP70 expression. We also stained for LC3B and p62, which are markers for autophagy and when highly expressed indirectly point towards underlying proteotoxic stress in the cells.</p>
<p>We reanalyzed the imaging of the stainings in the reversine-treated embryos, and found that the same cells were positive for both HSP70 and CASP8 staining while the minority was single positive (shown now in Figure 3k,l).</p>
<p>HSP70 does indeed not only unfold misfolded and aggregated proteins but does also have a function during cell survival and apoptosis9. HSP70 has been for instance found to inhibit the cleavage of Bid through active CASP8 within the extrinsic apoptosis pathway10. It is thus possible that it temporarily plays this role, and we have acknowledged this in the discussion (lines 623-626). On the other hand, the evidence points at an active apoptosis in the TE, with concomitant cell loss, so if HSP70 is indeed having an anti-apoptotic effect, it is having a limited impact.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>A high fraction of cells in early embryos carry aneuploid karyotypes, yet even chromosomally mosaic human blastocysts can implant and lead to healthy newborns with diploid karyotypes. Previous studies in other models have shown that genotoxic and proteotoxic stresses arising from aneuploidy lead to the activation of the p53 pathway and autophagy, which helps eliminate cells with aberrant karyotypes. These observations have been here evaluated and confirmed in human blastocysts. The study also demonstrates that the second lineage and formation of primitive endoderm are particularly impaired by aneuploidy.</p>
<p>This is a timely and potentially important study. Aneuploidy is common in early embryos and has a negative impact on their development, but the reasons behind this are poorly understood. Furthermore, how mosaic aneuploid embryos with a fraction of euploidy greater than 50 % can undergo healthy development remains a mystery. Most of our current information comes from studies on murine embryos, making a substantial study on human embryos of great importance. However, there are only very few new findings or insights provided by this study. Some of the previous findings were reproduced, but it is difficult to say whether this is a real finding, or whether it is a consequence of a low sample number. The authors could get much more insight with their data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the thorough evaluation of our manuscript and the valuable suggestions made in the private recommendations. We have expanded the sample size and have carried out additional experiments that have significantly improved the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Instead of using cut off to generate a list, the authors could just rank the entire detected transcriptome for GSEA. This method fits better the authors' intentions of &quot;primarily focused on pathway analysis.&quot; The cut-off value &quot;-log10(p-value)&lt;0.05&quot; is not correct. As we can see from the PCA plot, one would not expect many cut off defined DEGs at all. The most obvious transcriptome change is dosage dependent, as the authors cleared showed with InferCNV.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and agree that this was an important concern of the study. We have entirely revised the RNA-seq analysis based on the proposed approach (Figure 1 and 2, Supplementary Figure 1). Also, we have included the analysis of aneuploid versus reversine treated embryos, which has allowed us to determine the differences between naturally occurring chromosomal abnormalities and those that are induced using reversine (Supplementary Figure 1).</p>
<p>We first performed differential gene expression analysis using DESEq2 with a cut-off value for significantly differentially expressed genes of | log2FC | &gt; 1 and an FDR &lt; 0.05. Based on the PCAs and the low number of differentially expressed genes for all comparisons, besides high dosage versus euploid embryos, we focussed primarily on pathway analysis.</p>
<p>For that, based on the reviewerâs suggestion, we generated a ranked gene list using the GSEA software (version 4.2.2, MSigDatabase) based on the normalized count matrix of the whole transcriptome that was detected after differential gene expression. The ranked gene list was then subjected to the <italic>run GSEA</italic> function, and we searched the Hallmark and C2 library for significantly enriched pathways. Thus, we could generate normalized enrichment scores, allowing us to predict whether a pathway is activated or suppressed. The details of the new analysis are described in the Material and Methods section (lines 220-232). Significance was determined using a cut-off value of 25% FDR. This cut-off is proposed in the user guide of the GSEA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideTEXT.htm">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideTEXT.htm</ext-link>) especially for incoherent gene expression datasets, as suggested by our PCAs, which allows for hypothesis driven validation of the dataset.</p>
<p>Indeed, we found that the most important transcriptome changes are aneuploidy dosage dependent. High dosage embryos show signatures of cellular unfitness, while low-dosage embryos still seem to activate survival pathways (lines 349-364).</p>
<p>This new analysis did not only increase robustness of our results but also introduced novel findings, which pave the road for future studies.</p>
<p>The validity of our findings is supported by recent work by the Zernicka-Goetz lab. We found that hypoxia is upregulated in low dosage human aneuploid TE cells. In line with our data, the Zernicka-Goetz lab found in a mouse model of low degree chromosomal abnormalities that hypoxia inducible factor 1A (HIF1A) promotes survival of extraembryonic aneuploid cells by reducing levels of DNA damage11.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It would be very helpful if the authors could perform co-staining of multiple stress markers to better understand the origins of apoptosis and autophagy cells. In Fig 3d and 3h, it seems that the same reversine treated embryo was stained with CASP8, LC3B and HSP70. Is there any correlation between CASP8 and HSP70 at the single cell level? Is there any correlation between p53 and LC3B as the authors suggested, possibly through DRAM1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We decided to use the complex aneuploid embryos that were left at our facility for the validation of novel findings such as upregulation of DRAM1 and presence and consequences of DNA damage in aneuploid embryos. As suggested by the editor and the other reviewer we also added embryos to existing datasets to increase the sample size where necessary. Therefore, we did not include other co-stainingâs of multiple stress markers.</p>
<p>Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we reanalyzed the existing stainings and evaluated whether there is a correlation between CASP8 and HSP70 at the single cell level. The reversine-treated embryos were the only embryo group that was co-stained for both CASP8 and HSP70. We quantified the percentage of cells that were single or double positive for CASP8 and HSP70 and found a higher proportion of double positive cells than to single positives. Therefore, we concluded that there is indeed a correlation between both proteins at the single cell level in reversine-treated embryos and included this data in Figure 3k,l.</p>
<p>During the experiments for the revision, we found that the DRAM1 protein was upregulated in the cytoplasm of TE cells but not in the ICM of aneuploid embryos (Figure 3s,t), which validates the findings of the gene expression analysis. This data also supports our findings that autophagy is active in aneuploid TE cells while not significantly increased in aneuploid pluripotent ICM cells. Unfortunately, we could not stain LC3B and DRAM1 in the same embryo because the antibodies were raised in the same species.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) While &quot; the possibilities for functional studies and lineage tracing experiments in human embryos are very limited,&quot; the authors can leverage in silico modelling (ie, PMID: 28700688) to address the roles of aneuploidy in blastocyst formation and development. Is there any selfregulating mechanism underlying the ratios of PrE and EPI? Is apoptosis of ICM cells a natural process during PrE formation (PMID: 18725515)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is a very interesting proposal to use <italic>in silico</italic> modelling to address the roles of aneuploidy during human blastocyst formation and lineage segregation. Although this type of analysis would yield very important insights, we are not able to address this point of the revision due to lack of expertise for this type of analysis in our group, requiring setting up a collaboration with experts in this field.  In the discussion we proposed that future studies can leverage our data to be carried out in <italic>silico</italic> modelling and cited the proposed article (lines 608-610).</p>
<p>On the second part of the question, we would like to discuss the differences between mouse and human embryo studies. Parts of this were included in the discussion on the possible mechanisms of PrE elimination.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Is there a self-regulating mechanism for EPI/PrE formation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To extrapolate the knowledge on mouse development to human it is important to bear in mind that (1) human embryos are outbred, as compared to inbred super-fertile laboratory mouse strains and (2) the embryos are donated to research by subfertile couples, which could compromise the EPI/PrE ratios. For instance, Chousal and colleagues found that poor quality blastocysts have a reduced number of PrE cells12. In human embryos the proportion EPI and PrE cells is indeed highly variable (20%-60%) and while the number of EPI cells does not increase between dpf6 and 7, the number of PrE cells does grow13. We found a similar variable number of EPI and PrE in our study on the lineage segregation mechanisms in good quality human embryos, with an absolute number of EPI of 12.1Â±6.5 cells and 8.4Â±3.44 PrE cells14.</p>
<p>By comparison, in late mouse blastocysts, the ratio EPI/PrE cells is consistent (2/3)15. Overall, self-regulating mechanisms in the human embryo are not yet studied in detail due to the lack of possible functional testing.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Is apoptosis a natural process during PrE formation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, in mice apoptosis is a natural process during PrE formation to eliminate misallocated cells of the inner cell mass through cell competition16,17. Yet, in the human embryo there is no evidence of such mechanisms. Although apoptosis is present even in human blastocysts of good quality18, the origin of such apoptotic cells is now still shown, although suboptimal culture conditions are known to increase cellular fragmentation19. Conversely, our data and that of others1,2 supports the notion that the pluripotent inner cell mass in human embryos is more resistant to apoptosis than the trophectoderm, even in karyotypically aberrant cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The &quot;count tables generated from the raw data files&quot; could not be found in the source data files.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This slipped to our attention, we have added now the count tables to the source data files. Our apologies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Citations on aneuploidy literature were not done in a fully scholarly manner. It appears that authors selectively cite previous papers that are in support of their hypothesis but left out those with alternative conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize if we missed any literature that contradicts our findings, it is not intentional. We would be grateful if the reviewer could provide such references.</p>
<p>In the manuscript we describe the alignment and differences of key findings with several studies (listed below) and the limitations of our study are extensively described in lines 596626.</p>
<p>Our findings align with other work on these aspects:</p>
<p>- RNA-sequencing data2,20â26</p>
<p>- Gene dosage effects drive the transcriptome of the aneuploid human embryo27,28</p>
<p>- Aneuploid cells are cleared by sustained proteotoxic stress followed by p53 activation, autophagy and eventually apoptosis29â37.</p>
<p>- p53 is active in constitutional aneuploid cells38</p>
<p>- The ICM is less sensitive to apoptosis1,2</p>
<p>Our findings differ with other work on these points:</p>
<p>- p53 activation is independent from DNA-damage39</p>
<p>- p53 is active in constitutional aneuploid cells40,41</p>
<p>- Apoptosis is only present in the aneuploid TE of aneuploid cells in the embryo29,30,42</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>(1) The main problem is that there is no substantial novelty. The authors look at previously identified factors affected by chromosome gains and losses, but none of the new one from their analysis. Anything what could be potentially novel is not carefully analyzed (e.g. the difference between reversine-treated and aneuploid samples, or new potential candidates) or explained. This is really a pity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revision, we have further elaborated on the DNA damage aspect by staining for DNA double-stranded breaks and have validated DRAM1 as an activated downstream effector of p53. We have also added the analyses of the gene-expression of the reversine-treated embryos.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Some of the general statements on aneuploidy are confusing and often borderline generalized. E.g. introduction line 106: &quot;If this (proteotoxic stress) remains unresolved by the activation of autophagy...&quot; I am not aware of any publication suggesting that autophagy resolves proteotoxic stress in aneuploid cells. Citations that replication stress causes DNA damage in aneuploid cells are wrong. This link was first shown by Passerini et al. in 2016. etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clarified these statements in the introduction and added the proposed citations on replication stress that causes DNA damage in aneuploid cells (lines 95-108).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In the figures the authors show a representative image of aneuploid and diploid embryos. Given the aneuploid embryos have widely different karyotypes, it would be important to clarify which of the embryos has been actually shown. Similarly, in the heat maps it is not clear which line is which embryo. This would be very useful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the karyotypes of the aneuploid embryos to the images in figure 3 and 4. Since the heatmaps were removed from the figures we added the karyotypes to the PCAs in all figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors constantly state that aneuploid embryo accumulate more DNA damage, which is supported by some of their observations, e.g. the DNA damage response is upregulated. It would be great if they would validated this statements with testing some markers for DNA damage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that this was an important point and addressing it has revealed that our initial assumption was incorrect and has provided new interesting findings. From the revised RNA-seq analysis, we found only one pathway (DNA damage response TP53) to be activated in all aneuploid embryos (Fig.1e). The ATM pathway was also activated specifically in high-dosage embryos. Following this, we set to test if DNA damage was indeed increased in aneuploid embryos by staining for DNA double strand breaks with gH2AX.</p>
<p>First, we investigated the gH2AX expression in 5dpf embryos in which we induced DNAdamage with Bleomycin. We compared 6 untreated versus 6 Bleomycin treated human embryos (Fig. 3m) and found that gH2AX foci were rarely present in the untreated embryos and that all cells of the treated embryos showed a pan-nuclear gH2AX staining.</p>
<p>Second, we compared the presence of gH2AX foci in the TE (NANOG negative cells), ICM (NANOG positive cells) and the whole embryo of 7 euploid versus 11 aneuploid embryos. Interestingly, we found no differences in the number of gH2AX foci or pan-nuclear gH2AX nuclei between euploid and aneuploid embryos (Fig 3o). When dividing our aneuploid embryos into high and low dosage embryos we could also not account for differences. Our data now suggests that complex aneuploid human embryonic cells of meiotic origin do not contain more DNA-double strand breaks, precluding DNA-damage as the source of p53 activation. Last, in our previous experiment we found that phosphorylated S15p53 is increased in aneuploid embryos, supporting an active p53 pathway as suggested by our transcriptomic data. Since we could not find DNA-damage in aneuploid human embryos we speculate that p53 is phosphorylated on Serine15 through metabolic stress as suggested by Jones and colleagues43. We also argue that proteotoxic stress might induce p53 expression as proposed by Singla and colleagues29.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The source of embryos is only partially described in a figure legend. This should be expanded and described in the Materials and Methods section. The embryos are named, but this is nowhere explained. One can only assume that T is for trisomy and M is for monosomy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have divided the embryos into different experimental series (Experiment 1-4). This is now described in the Material and methods section (lines 157-175). Also, we have added the experiment number of each embryo to the supplementary tables and to the source data. The abbreviation for T = Trisomy and M= Monosomy was initially introduced in the last paragraph of the figure legend of figure 4.  We now added it to every panel.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Recent works from non-embryonic cells suggest that the cellular response to monosomy is different than the response to trisomy. Did the authors try to test this possible difference? For example, one could compare embryos M174/21, M2/19 and M17 with T2/10, T10/22 and T1/15/18/22.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Our RNA-seq. dataset consisted of three embryos that contained trisomies only and four embryos that contained monosomies only. When reanalyzing our data we found different transcriptomic responses between monosomic only and trisomic only cells. Compared to euploid cells, monosomy only cells activate mainly the p53pathway and protein secretion while translation, DNA replication, cell cycle G1/S, DNA synthesis and processing of DNA double strand breaks were inhibited. Trisomy only cells show activated oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome and translation while protein secretion, apoptosis and cell cycle are inhibited. These differences were confirmed by testing transcriptomic differences between trisomic versus monosomic cells. Our results are similar to studies on human embryos20,26 and other monosomic and trisomic cell lines44,45. However, the interpretation of these results is very limited by the small sample size and the comparison of monosomies and trisomies of different chromosomes. Thus, we decided to keep this analysis out of the manuscript.</p>

<p>On the protein level, next to the small sample size, our results were also limited by the fact that not all embryos were stained with the same combinations of antibodies. LC3B was the only protein for which all embryos were immunostained. Thus, other protein data could not be re-analyzed due to even lower sample sizes.</p>
<p>Below we have separated the LC3B puncta per cell counts into euploid, trisomies only, monosomies only and all other aneuploid embryos. We performed a Kruskal Wallis test with multiple comparisons. It is worth noticing that the difference between euploid and monosomies only (and those that contained both) was statistically significant, while the difference between euploid vs trisomies only and trisomies only vs monosomies only was not statistically significant. These differences contradict the studies on monosomic cell lines that found that proteotoxic stress and autophagy are not present and specific to trisomic cell lines. Here we also decided to keep this specific protein expression analysis out of the manuscript due to the above-mentioned limitations.</p>

<p>(7) Line 329: &quot;a trisomy 12 meiotic chromosomal abnormality in one reversine-treated embryo.&quot; What does it mean? Why meiotic chromosomal abnormality when the reversine treatment was administered 4 days after fertilization? In the discussion, the authors state &quot;presumed meiotic,&quot; but this should be discussed and described more clearly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since reversine induces mitotic abnormalities of different types leading to chromosomally mosaic embryos, we could not identify these induced abnormalities using inferCNV on the RNAseq of TE biopsies of said embryos. However, we were not aware of the karyotype of the embryos that were used for these experiments, as they were thawed after they had been cryopreserved at day 3 of development and had not been subjected to genetic testing.  This makes it possible that some of those embryos we used for the reversine experiments in fact carried endogenously acquired meiotic and mitotic chromosomal abnormalities. Since we are only able to detect by inferCNV aneuploidies homogeneously present in the majority of the cells of the sequenced biopsy, we only picked up this trisomy 12.  It is possible that this was not a meiotic abnormality but a miotic one originating at the first cleavage and present at a high percentage of cells in the blastocyst. At any rate, the exact origin of this aneuploidy has no further implications for the results of the study. We clarified this in the manuscript (lines 310-315).</p>

<p>(8) Line 422: &quot;The gene expression profiles suggest that the accumulation of autophagic proteins in aneuploid embryos is caused by increased autophagic flux due to differential expression of the p53 target gene DNA Damage Regulated Autophagy Modulator-1 (DRAM1), rather than by inhibition of autophagy (Supplementary Table 2).&quot; This is highly speculative, as the authors do not have any evidence to support this statement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To validate this finding we have now stained 7 euploid and 11 aneuploid embryos with a DRAM1 antibody. We found DRAM1 protein to be significantly enriched in the cytoplasm of TE cells but not in the ICM of aneuploid embryos when comparing with euploid embryos (Fig. 3s,t). This data is consistent with the finding that autophagy is increased in the TE and not the ICM of aneuploid human embryos. (Fig 4l-o). Potential implications of DRAM1 expression have been mentioned in the discussion.</p>

<p>(9) The figure legends are confusing. They are mixed up with the methods and some key information are missing.</p>

<p>(10) In Figure 1, what is the difference between &quot;activated&quot; and &quot;deregulated&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since we analyzed our RNA-seq dataset with the method proposed by reviewer 1 we now generated normalized enrichment scores. The terms activated and deregulated are thus not present anymore.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) The p62 images are not really clear. There might be more puncta (not obvious, though), but the staining intensity seems lower in the representative images.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not agree with the reviewer that there might be more p62 puncta (purple), however, we agree that it was not clearly visible from the pictures. Below we show an example of the counting mask (in green) of the aneuploid embryo from figure 3i, where one can clearly appreciate that all the puncta are captured by the counting mask. In this case, the software counted 1704 puncta. To further clarify, we now added a zoom of a randomly chose ROI of the p62 stainingâs to figure 3i.</p>

<p>(12) The authors claim that there are differences between lineages in response to aneuploidy, such as autophagy not being activated in the OCT4+ lineage, etc. However, the differences are very small and based on a small number of embryos. It is difficult to draw far-reaching conclusions based on a small number of experiments (Fig. 4n-r). The authors also claim in the Abstract that they demonstrated &quot;clear differences with previous findings in the mouse&quot;, which are however difficult to identify in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that our conclusions on figures 4l-o were based on a small number of embryos. We have increased as much as possible the sample size. This is challenging due to the constrictions in accessing human embryos, and especially the limited number of embryos with meiotic complex aneuploidy. We have performed immunostainings for LC3B, OCT4 and GATA4 of six additional euploid and four additional aneuploid human embryos. This did not change our overall findings that aneuploid embryos upregulate autophagy in the TE rather than the ICM (Figure 4l-o). After the inclusion of additional embryos, we removed our speculation from the manuscript that autophagy is present in ICM cells of already differentiated cells towards EPI/PrE.</p>
<p>We have rephrased the abstract to state that we highlight a few differences with previous findings in the mouse. Here we focused especially on the different transcriptomic response of reversine treated embryos, that aneuploid mouse embryos do not seem to suffer from lineage segregation errors and that the ICM of aneuploid human embryos lacks apoptosis while aneuploid mouse embryos show elimination from the EPI. Likewise, we highlighted the similar stress responses and that we could give novel insights into p53 mediated autophagy and apoptosis activation through DRAM1 in aneuploid TE cells but not the ICM.</p>
