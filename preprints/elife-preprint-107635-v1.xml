<title>Abstract</title><p>Neural circuits composed of multitudes of diverse synaptic connections self-organize during mammalian brain development. A balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic function is required for information processing by these neural circuits. Despite the importance of this balance, the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic assembly during circuit establishment remains unclear due to a lack of means to monitor both processes simultaneously. Here, we develop imaging approaches to visualize and track excitatory and inhibitory synapses concurrently. By applying these approaches, we find that despite continual dynamics, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic density remain at synchronized levels during synaptogenesis. These results support coordinated excitatory and inhibitory synapse assembly to maintain functional balance despite continual synaptic turnover.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Synapse assembly, maturation, and elimination require spatial and temporal coordination of several cell biological processes, beginning with pre- and postsynaptic recognition of combinatorial networks of cell surface receptors, adhesion molecules, and secreted factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. These extracellular networks subsequently initiate bi-directional signaling cascades that stabilize nascent synapses and recruit the corresponding functional machinery essential for diverse physiological synaptic parameters. Synapse elimination likely involves termination of these signals and disassembly of trans-synaptic adhesion complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. While increasing evidence supports this model, the dynamics of mammalian synapse assembly, together with the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory synapses during this process, remain incompletely understood due to the paucity of approaches to visualize these events in real time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A dynamic relationship between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic function is critical for computation by neural networks. Developmental imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory synapses contribute to neurological disorders, including autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, the pathophysiology of Rett syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, involves a reduction in spontaneous activity caused by an increase in synaptic inhibition over excitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a structural coordination between excitatory and inhibitory synapses and functional interactions between these synapses can maintain a constant excitatory/inhibitory ratio along the same dendritic tree<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. This raises the hypothesis that excitatory and inhibitory synapse assembly is coordinated to maintain a functional balance during development.</p>
<p>Despite these advances, several obstacles towards testing this hypothesis remain. First, approaches to simultaneously visualize interactions between mammalian pre- and postsynaptic compartments in real time over relatively long timescales with high spatiotemporal resolution remain lacking. Moreover, long-term time-lapse imaging parameters for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses concomitantly are limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Invertebrate systems enable global and long-term time-lapse imaging of circuit assembly <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. For example, recent advances using intravital imaging have enabled high content, long-term visualization of growth cones and filipodial dynamics during <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In mammalian systems, dendritic spines, structures associated with excitatory postsynaptic compartments, can also be visualized long-term during their formation and dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Studies using time-lapse two-photon microendoscopy in the CA1 region of live mice provided evidence for a remarkably dynamic turnover of dendritic spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. This was in contrast to studies in the neocortex, which found a higher level of spine stability, suggesting that different cell types may display different synaptic turnover rates to support their network functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To help address the dynamic interplay between excitatory and inhibitory synapse assembly in mammalian neurons, we generated long-term time-lapse imaging approaches to simultaneously monitor the dynamics of presynaptic Synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2 (Syb2), excitatory postsynaptic Homer1c, and inhibitory postsynaptic Gephyrin, which are routinely used to label pre- or postsynaptic compartments. These strategies enable examination of the dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic compartments, and their co-clustering into contacts. By applying these approaches, we observed that subsets of synapses are dynamic even in mature hippocampal neurons. Despite this, excitatory and inhibitory synapse levels remain balanced during synaptogenesis. Collectively, these approaches provide new insights into the dynamics and coordination of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic connections during mammalian circuit establishment.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>While canonical synaptic proteins are routinely used as markers of mature pre- or excitatory postsynaptic compartments, long-term live imaging both simultaneously has been challenging. Thus, we developed live imaging procedures to visualize excitatory synaptic dynamics over relatively long timescales (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref><bold>, S1</bold>). We started by generating a set of lentiviral reporters based on routinely used synaptic markers. Namely, these reporters included mClover3-Homer1c and HaloTag-Syb2 fusions. mClover3 is a brighter and more photostable version of the green fluorescent protein Clover<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and HaloTag is a self-labeling tag with a panel of versatile and highly stable fluorescent dyes available, including far red dyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. We examined these reporters in primary hippocampal cultures, a widely used reduced experimental system. We initially validated the proper localization of these reporters via co-staining hippocampal neurons for additional synaptic markers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-D</xref><bold>, S1</bold>). Hippocampal neurons transduced with HaloTag-Syb2 were live labeled with cell permeant JF646 HaloTag ligand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, and subsequently immunolabeled for endogenous synaptic markers. HaloTag-Syb2 co-localized with presynaptic Syn1/2, and co-clustered together with postsynaptic Homer1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A &amp; B</xref><bold>, S1A</bold>). mClover3-Homer1c exhibited higher co-localization another excitatory postsynaptic marker, SHANK2, compared to the inhibitory postsynaptic marker Gephyrin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C &amp; D</xref><bold>, S1B</bold>). These results support that these lentiviral reporters serve as reliable proxies for their respective synaptic compartments.</p>

</fig>
<p>We next tested their compatibility and efficacy for long term time-lapse imaging. Pre- and postsynaptic combinations (HaloTag-Syb2 with mClover3-Homer1) were transduced into primary hippocampal neurons together with lentivirally delivered mTagBFP2 as a cell marker. Cells were then labeled live for JF646 HaloTag ligand as before and imaged at DIV12-14, a point when excitatory synapse functional maturation peaks in primary hippocampal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Cells were imaged for 15-hrs total at 5-min intervals in a live cell incubation chamber with resonance scanning confocal microscopy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, Movie S1-3). This permitted stable imaging of labeled synaptic compartments, including co-clustered pre- and postsynaptic compartments, without detectable photobleaching.</p>
<p>These strategies captured nascent synapses assembling even in relatively mature primary hippocampal neurons, including HaloTag-Syb2-positive growth cones approaching and forming contacts with mClover3-Homer1c postsynaptic compartments along mTagBFP2-filled dendrites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These approaches visualized distinct populations of excitatory synapses that were stable during the 15-hr session, formed into co-clusters during imaging, or disassembled (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B &amp; C</xref>). We next developed a set of parameters to track and quantify individual mClover3-Homer1 puncta, HaloTag-Syb2 puncta, and Homer1:Syb2 co-clustered puncta over the 15-hr imaging period (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D &amp; E</xref>). Through our particle tracking, we were able to track all the pre- and post- synaptic compartments that persisted through the imaging period, as well as the compartments which existed only temporarily. These analyses highlight the dynamic nature of excitatory synapses over these timescales. Thus, these live imaging parameters enabled extended visualization and tracking of the interplay between pre- and postsynaptic compartments in live hippocampal neurons.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that excitatory synapses reach a peak steady state of functional maturation at approximately DIV12. Therefore, we examined excitatory synapses before (DIV6-8) and after (DIV 12-14) peak functional maturity in primary hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, Fig. S2, Movie S4 &amp; 5). In parallel, we developed puncta tracking quantifications to identify and follow individual puncta over time and monitor their track duration along mTagBFP2-labeled dendrites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, S2). Interestingly, many labeled synaptic puncta were fluid, with a majority of them exhibiting a track length between 20-120 minutes. Moreover, puncta were continuously formed or eliminated throughout the 15-hr imaging period (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>, Movie S4). Similarly to DIV6-8, synapses at DIV12-14 were highly dynamic. However, there was a shift in population toward longer track duration for functionally mature neurons, suggesting increased stability of synapse assembly dynamics (Fig. S2). Therefore, these reporters and approaches enable imaging and quantification of excitatory synapses that reveal distinct properties of synapse assembly at different stages of development.</p>

<p>We then generated constructs to facilitate visualization and tracking of inhibitory synapses over time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). To enable compatibility with our other tools, we generated a tdTomato-Gephyrin fusion protein encoded in lentivirus. This fluorescent fusion protein was highly co-localized with another inhibitory postsynaptic marker, GABARα1, but not the excitatory postsynaptic marker Homer1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We then co-infected primary neurons with tdTomato-Gephyrin, HaloTag-Syb2, and mTagBFP2, and conducted live imaging as before (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-E</xref>). These approaches effectively visualized presynaptic and inhibitory postsynaptic puncta, as well as synaptic co-clusters, over the 15-hr imaging period, and captured dynamic populations of inhibitory synapses, including stable, transiently formed, or eliminated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B &amp; C</xref>). Similar to our analyses of excitatory synapses, we applied puncta tracking approaches, which tracked and quantified these populations over the 15-hr session (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D &amp; E</xref>). Altogether, this enables long-term visualization of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in primary hippocampal neurons.</p>

<p>Given these reporters rely on overexpression of the fluorescently-labeled proteins, as a parallel approach, we also utilized recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in approaches to introduce tags into genomic loci within postmitotic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and Fig. S3 &amp; S4). We employed the TKIT (tandem knock-in with two guides) approach that enables introduction of tags into endogenous neuronal genomic loci with high efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Moreover, the TKIT labeling approach avoids the concern of variable indels in coding regions following CRISPR modification as observed with other approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Consistent with these studies, we found that this system robustly tagged endogenous GluA2 in primary hippocampal neurons (Fig. S3A &amp; B). Since we are focused on developing tagging strategies for commonly used pre- and postsynaptic markers, we implemented TKIT strategies for presynaptic Bassoon, excitatory postsynaptic Homer1c, and inhibitory postsynaptic Gephyrin, and generated AAVs encoding the respective sgRNAs/donor or Cas9.</p>

<p>We first tagged Bassoon in primary hippocampal cultures with an N-terminal HA tag (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-E</xref>, Fig. S4A). When we virally transduced cultures with HA-Bassoon donor and sgRNAs, we detected robust HA labeling only when Cas9 was also co-delivered. At DIV12-14, the HA staining overlapped with the staining for endogenous Bassoon (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B &amp; C</xref>). Endogenously tagged HA- Bassoon also co-localized with presynaptic Syn1/2, and formed co-clusters with postsynaptic Homer1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, E</xref>, Fig. S4A). Primary neurons harboring TKIT AAVs for HA tagging of Homer1c also displayed robust HA staining that co-localized with endogenous Homer1c only when Cas9 was co-delivered (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G &amp; H</xref>). Furthermore, HA-Homer1c co-localized with another excitatory postsynaptic protein, SHANK2, but was excluded from inhibitory postsynaptic sites detected by staining for Gephyrin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I, J</xref>, Fig. S4B). We used an analogous approach to tag endogenous Gephyrin with GFP, which was based on the design of Fang <italic>et al</italic>., 2020 but with further optimized sgRNAs. As expected, tagged Gephyrin co-localized to inhibitory synapses with high-fidelity and was excluded from excitatory synapses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K-O</xref>, Fig. S4C). Namely, GFP-tagged Gephyrin co-localized with endogenous Gephyrin and GABARα1, but not excitatory Homer1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M-O</xref>, Fig. S4C). Tagged mRNA transcripts were only detected when donor/sgRNA AAVs was co- delivered with Cas9 (Fig. S4D-F). Moreover, we estimated the overall efficiency of Homer1c and Gephyrin TKIT approaches using standard curve RT-qPCR, and found they modify approximately 5% of total transcripts (Fig. S4G). These CRISPR/Cas9 approaches build upon the original TKIT toolbox and provide systems to introduce tags and label endogenous presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins.</p>
<p>We subsequently used a new Gephyrin donor DNA to label this inhibitory postsynaptic protein with tdTomato for live imaging (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, Fig. S5). We then conducted time-lapse imaging as before in CRISPR-modified neurons co-transduced with mTagBFP2 cell fill at DIV12-14. Endogenously labeled Gephyrin puncta were monitored continuously for 15-hrs at 5-min intervals without appreciable photobleaching (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A &amp; B</xref>). Consistent with lentiviral reporters, these markers allowed us to detect distinct subpopulations of synapses, some of which were stable over the imaging session while others were highly dynamic (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). We subsequently tested the compatibility of lentiviral reporters with TKIT reporters. We introduced tdTomato-Gephyrin TKIT AAVs together with lentiviral HaloTag-Syb2 to simultaneously label presynaptic terminals and endogenous postsynaptic inhibitory compartments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C-F</xref>, Fig. S5). This enabled visualization and tracking of Syb2:Gephyrin co-clusters together with quantification of their density and mobility along mTagBFP2-labeled dendrites over time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C-F</xref>, Fig. S5A &amp; B). Collectively, this molecular toolbox highlights the dynamic nature of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in both developing and relatively established primary hippocampal neurons.</p>

<p>We next analyzed excitatory and inhibitory synapses concurrently in neurons transduced with mClover3-Homer1, tdTomato-Gephyrin, HaloTag-Syb2, and mTagBFP2 lentiviral reporters (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). We infected neurons at DIV1, and imaged the same cultures at DIV6-8 and DIV12-14 as before, and quantified the density of individual synaptic puncta as well as Syb2:Homer1c excitatory co-clusters and Syb2:Gephyrin inhibitory co-clusters over time. The presynaptic compartments labeled by HaloTag-Syb2 became less abundant as neurons matured, suggesting an elimination of presynaptic terminals (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B &amp; C</xref>). Despite this reduction in presynaptic inputs, the density of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic co-clusters remained at a steady state (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D &amp; E</xref>). Moreover, the density of inhibitory puncta we observed with these approaches aligned with our Gephyrin TKIT analyses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Given these observations, we next quantified the ratio of total Homer1c:Syb2 puncta or Gephyrin:Syb2 puncta, together with the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory co-clustered puncta at different times (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F-H</xref>). While the ratio of postsynaptic to presynaptic compartments increased over time, the overall ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synapses remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F-H</xref>). These results suggest that despite the dynamic environment, hippocampal neurons maintain a balanced equilibrium of excitatory and inhibitory synapses over time.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using live imaging approaches, we observed the interplay between pre- and postsynaptic compartments in primary neuron cultures over extended time periods. These results indicate that subsets of synapses are dynamic and continue to turnover even in relatively mature hippocampal neurons. Despite this turnover, excitatory and inhibitory synapses remain at a relative equilibrium over time. We postulate that intrinsic mechanisms synchronize excitatory and inhibitory synapse assembly during circuit development. Two potential models may explain this synchronization. Temporal coordination of intrinsic genetic programs may underlie synchronized assembly. Alternatively, there may be crosstalk between different synaptic subtypes in <italic>trans</italic> that maintains balance despite continual dynamics. These mechanisms may help balance excitation/inhibition and support the functional outputs of neural circuits.</p>
<p>Our approaches also display several inherent limitations which will require future advances to overcome. While we focused on canonical and widely used presynaptic and postsynaptic markers as proxies for synaptic compartments, our approaches do not assess the physical adhesive interaction between pre- and postsynaptic compartments. Combining our approaches with other systems relying on adhesion between pre- and postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules, such as SynView, GRASP, or SynapseShot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, will be important towards understanding further details of the dynamics of synapse assembly. Our approaches complement those based on trans-synaptic adhesion, considering the latter systems only exhibit signal after cell adhesion molecules contact, while our reporters can visualize synaptic components prior to forming a synapse. More generally, our observations support that some of the functional components of synapses are present in nascent pre- or postsynaptic compartments prior to their contact. Future studies combining our approaches with trans-synaptic adhesion reporters or genetically-encoded activity indicators including GEVIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> will help unravel the temporal sequences of synapse assembly and maturation.</p>
<p>Our live imaging was conducted in neuronal culture given its broad applicability and tractability for molecular studies. While this system provides a powerful and widely used reduced model for mechanistic questions, future advances will be necessary to employ these tools in combination <italic>in vivo</italic>. Considering our approaches relied on reporter expression or CRISPR/Cas9 genome modifications, both of which require time for protein buildup to detectable levels, we were unable to visualize the very early stages of postnatal synaptogenesis occurring shortly after culturing at DIV0. Synapses are thought to form in excess during postnatal development, followed by refinement and elimination of connections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Future advances will be required to assess these early events of postnatal synaptogenesis.</p>
<p>Our work establishes live imaging parameters that enable visualization of pre- and postsynaptic dynamics concurrently at high spatiotemporal resolution. Using these approaches, we observed that excitatory and inhibitory synapses are dynamic yet maintain a balanced equilibrium over time. Collectively, this work provides additional insights into the temporal aspects of how diverse synaptic connectivity generates synaptic networks.</p>

Prior to imaging, a pulse of 0.2 µM JF646 Janelia Fluor® HaloTagTag® Ligand (Promega #GA1120) in 300 µL of the conditioned growth medium was applied to the cells for 2 hrs, followed by returning the cells back to the remaining 700 µL conditioned media. Images were acquired using a Nikon A1-R Eclipse Ti confocal microscope in resonant scanning mode with a 60x objective (Nikon #MRD01605, CFI60 Plan Apochromat Lambda, N.A. 1.4) and perfect focus operated by NIS-Elements AR acquisition software. Laser intensities and acquisition settings were established for individual channels using optimal LUT settings. Live images were acquired using multipoint acquisition to collect several cells/dish in a 1 µm Z-stack every 5 min at 4X averaging during a 15 hr period (181 time frames total per cell) while normal growth conditions were maintained (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 90% humidity) using a Tokai Hit stage incubator (Tokai Hit STXG Incubation System).</p>

<title>Image analysis</title>
<p>Analysis was performed via NIS Elements. Prior to analyses, images from each cell were separated (Split Multipoints) and transformed to 2D (Unique Extended Depth of Focus (EDF)). In the NIS-Elements software, the synaptic compartments were identified as bright spots with ∼1 µm diameter, and the clusters with overlapping pre- and postsynaptic compartments were considered co-clustered synapses. GA3 analyses were used to count the total number of synaptic compartments/synapses per time frame. The NIS-Elements tracking function was used to estimate the number of timeframes an individual synaptic compartment/synapse lasted. A bright spot was considered persisting even if it disappeared for ≤3 timeframes (15 min), before it reappeared again in the same location. In addition, a fluctuation of one standard deviation from the position in the previous time frame was allowed. The NIS-Elements tracking algorithm is based on Jaqaman, K. <italic>et al</italic>., <italic>Nature Methods</italic> 2008<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. The algorithm generates frame-to-frame object linking, which works with a set of active tracks. An active track is established in the first frame. Then the algorithm goes through all of the time frames and extends the track. If there is no suitable link a gap is introduced. We used a Gap Closing of 3, which allows the algorithm to link until a gap length of 3-time frames, after which the track is terminated. A new puncta may initiate a new active track at any time during the imaging period as well. For analysis of Pearson’s correlation coefficient, the colocalization feature of NIS Elements was used to automatically calculate PCC for ROIs containing primary and secondary dendrites.</p>

<p>In this <bold>valuable</bold> study, the authors developed long-term imaging tools to simultaneously monitor the temporal and spatial dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory synapses and reported that excitatory and inhibitory synapses need to develop synergistically during synaptogenesis to maintain balance. While the analysis and quantification of the imaging data are <bold>incomplete</bold>, there is <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that the developed tools are feasible. If these tools can function stably in vivo, their applications will be much broader.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>By imaging the dynamics of synaptic proteins in cultured neurons, this study presents significant findings regarding the dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins during development. The evidence shows that the ratios of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins are stable during synapse development. This discovery advances our understanding of the complex mechanisms governing synapse formation. The strength of the evidence is robust, as it is supported by a combination of biological assays and endogenous labeling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This research sheds light on the dynamics of the excitatory and inhibitory synapses during development. It is crucial to understand that while excitatory synapses and inhibitory synapses are developed independently, the ratio of their number is relatively stable during development, maintaining a stable excitatory/inhibitory ratio.</p>
<p>Important findings and implications in the research include:</p>
<p>(1) Persistent Synapse Dynamics: Excitatory and inhibitory synapses remain highly dynamic even in mature neurons (DIV12-14), challenging the dogma that synaptic structures are stable after the synaptogenesis stage.</p>
<p>(2) Maintained E/I Balance: Despite ongoing synapse turnover (formation/elimination) and presynaptic terminal reduction, the overall density and ratio of excitatory-to-inhibitory synapses remain relatively stable during circuit maturation (Figure 7).</p>
<p>(3) Developmental Shifts: While presynaptic compartments decrease over time, postsynaptic sites increase, suggesting independent regulation of pre- and postsynaptic elements within a stable E/I framework.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study focuses on specific synaptic proteins within synapses, which may not fully represent the dynamics of other synaptic machinery; also, whether similar observations exist in vivo is still unknown. Further research is needed to explore the implications of these findings in more complex neuronal environments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The Garbett et al. identified a critical need to begin to understand the interplay between the assembly, maturation, and elimination of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. They also detail the lack of reliable tools to address this gap in knowledge. Here, the authors developed synaptic reporters expressed by lentiviruses (mClover3-Homer1c, HaloTag-Syb2, and tdTomato-Gephyrin). They combined these reporters with resonance scanning confocal imaging to measure synapses over a 15-hour period during neuron development and in mature neurons in primary hippocampal cultures. Using these reporters in the same neuron, the authors compared the ratios of postsynaptic excitatory and inhibitory specializations that co-localize with presynaptic terminals during development and in mature neurons and found that they are stable across time points. Finally, the authors developed CRISPR/Cas9 tools (TKIT) to knock-in endogenous fluorescent tags (GFP/tdTomato-Gephyrin) or epitope tags (HA-Bassoon and HA-Homer1) to begin to study synapse dynamics using endogenous proteins. I believe this paper highlights an important gap in knowledge and begins to offer methodologies to determine the dynamic coordination between excitatory and inhibitory synapses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The experiments are well-designed and carefully controlled.</p>
<p>(2) The authors carefully validated the reporter and TKIT constructs.</p>
<p>(3) The authors provide strong proof-of-principle for the use of the reporter constructs to track synapse formation, maintenance, and elimination over a 15-hour period.</p>
<p>(4) Ingenious use of technologies (reporters, TKIT, and resonance scanning confocal microscopy) to develop a platform for future studies of synapse dynamics.</p>
<p>(5) Strong evidence supporting that the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory synapses (those that oppose syb2) stays constant through development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, this is a well-executed study that develops tools to simultaneously image excitatory and inhibitory synapse dynamics and represents an important first step to address the fundamental question regarding the coordination between these two types of synapses.</p>
<p>Minor weaknesses of the manuscript include:</p>
<p>(1) The lack of a characterization of endogenous Homer1-positive excitatory synapses using TKIT.</p>
<p>(2) Discussion about other approaches to study excitatory and inhibitory synapses using endogenous proteins (e.g., intrabodies - FingR or nanobodies) should be included.</p>
<p>(3) The activity state of a neuron and/or a synapse might alter the dynamic properties (formation, maintenance, and/or elimination). A discussion on whether the overexpression of Homer1 and/or gephyrin might alter synapse/neuron activity would provide greater interpretability of the results. A discussion of the potential limitations and benefits of the reporter and TKIT approaches would be beneficial.</p>
<p>(4) A description and interpretation of the computational approach to calculate particle tracking would be helpful. I found that particle tracking figures, while elegant, are difficult to interpret.</p>

<p>In the present study, the authors describe the development of new tools and imaging strategies to assess the concomitant development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in dissociated neuron cultures. To this end, they generate fluorescently tagged constructs of excitatory and inhibitory synapse marker proteins using either conventional overexpression or CRISPR-based strategies. They then image these marker proteins over a timespan of 15 hours to assess synaptic dynamics at different developmental timepoints. Based on their data, they conclude that excitatory and inhibitory synapse development occur in concert to maintain a functional balance despite individual synapse turnover.</p>
<p>Overall, this study addresses an interesting question, i.e., the interplay between the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, which has important implications, particularly for neurodevelopmental disorders in which the balance of excitation and inhibition is disrupted. The experiments are technically solid and well-executed, and the individual images are highly compelling.</p>
<p>However, a number of aspects remain to be addressed in order for the study to support the claims made by the authors. First, the novelty aspect of the development of the fluorescently tagged synaptic proteins is unclear, since reporters of this nature are in routine use in many labs. Second, the analysis of the acquired images often seems incomplete, with only example images but no quantification shown, or the distinction between spatial and temporal dynamics appearing unclear. Third, given this incomplete analysis, the interpretations of the authors are not always convincingly supported by the data presented. In conclusion, substantial improvements are required to render the main messages of the study clear and compelling.</p>
