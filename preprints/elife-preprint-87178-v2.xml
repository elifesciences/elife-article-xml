<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Members of the SLC26 family constitute a conserved class of anion transport proteins, which encompasses uncoupled transporters with channel-like properties, coupled exchangers and motor proteins. Among the ten functional paralogs in humans, several participate in the secretion of bicarbonate in exchange with chloride and thus play an important role in maintaining pH homeostasis. Previously, we have elucidated the structure of murine SLC26A9 and defined its function as an uncoupled chloride transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter, Sawicka, &amp; Dutzler, 2019</xref>). Here we have determined the structure of the closely related human transporter SLC26A6 and characterized it as a coupled exchanger of chloride with bicarbonate and presumably also oxalate. The structure defines an inward-facing conformation of the protein that generally resembles known structures of SLC26A9. The altered anion selectivity between both paralogs is a consequence of a remodeled ion binding site located in the center of a mobile unit of the membrane-inserted domain, which also accounts for differences in the coupling mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), the conjugate base of carbonic acid, is a waste product of the citric acid cycle and an important buffer in the intra- and extracellular environment. Its transport across cellular membranes thus constitutes an important mechanism for the control of intracellular pH and the increased buffer capacity of bodily fluids and secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alka &amp; Casey, 2014</xref>). This process is mediated by distinct channels and secondary transporters, the latter comprising paralogs of the SLC4 and SLC26 families. The SLC26 transporters constitute an abundant class of anion transport proteins that are expressed in all kingdoms of life with a considerable degree of sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alper &amp; Sharma, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dorwart, Shcheynikov, Yang, &amp; Muallem, 2008</xref>). Homologs in prokaryotes and plants were classified as symporters, where the uptake of mono- and divalent anions is coupled to the import of either sodium ions or protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Geertsma et al., 2015</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang, Chen, &amp; Zhou, 2021</xref>). However, the transporters in animals show mechanistic differences. Among the ten functional SLC26 paralogs in humans, we find an astonishing mechanistic breadth. Family members function as either coupled anion exchangers, anion transporters with channel-like properties and in the case of SLC26A5 (Prestin), as a motor protein in cochlear outer hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alper &amp; Sharma, 2013</xref>). Among the paralogs which have retained their transport function, the distinction between coupled and uncoupled transporters is most pronounced. Whereas most family members operate as exchangers of different anions including the monovalent ions chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>), HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, iodide (I<sup>-</sup>) and formate and the divalent ions sulfate and oxalate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alper &amp; Sharma, 2013</xref>), the protein SLC26A9 functions as fast passive transporter of Cl<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dorwart, Shcheynikov, Wang, Stippec, &amp; Muallem, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>). Our previous study has characterized the structural and functional properties of the murine paralog of SLC26A9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>). The protein adopts a homodimeric architecture that is representative for the entire SLC26 family. Each subunit consists of a membrane-inserted transport domain (TM) followed by a cytoplasmic STAS domain, which together with the extended N-terminus mediates the bulk of the subunit interactions with few contacts in the membrane-inserted region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>). The TMs share a protein fold that was initially identified in the prokaryotic transporter UraA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lu et al., 2011</xref>), and that was later defined in the prokaryotic homologue SLC26Dg as common architecture for the entire family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Geertsma et al., 2015</xref>). In this architecture, the TM segregates into two separate motifs that adopt distinct roles during transport, respectively termed ‘core’ and ‘gate’ domains. The gate domain forms a contiguous rigid scaffold with the cytosolic STAS domain that remains static during transport. Conversely the mobile core domain harbors a selective anion binding site and acts as mobile unit during transport. The core domain alternately exposes the substrate site to different sides of the membrane as expected for a protein working by an elevator-type transport mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Drew &amp; Boudker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>). Despite its classification as membrane transporter, SLC26A9 mediates large channel-like chloride currents that saturate at high mM concentration and it efficiently discriminates against HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dorwart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>). Its function as a fast electrogenic chloride transporter and selection against HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is astonishing since several other family members have been classified as Cl<sup>-</sup>/ HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alper &amp; Sharma, 2013</xref>). One of the family members sharing this property is the protein SLC26A6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Knauf et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lohi et al., 2000</xref>). SLC26A6 is widely expressed in different tissues including the heart, kidney, pancreas and intestine (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wang, Wang, Wang, &amp; Tuo, 2020</xref>). Besides its function as a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter, it also plays an important role in the extrusion of oxalate to prevent the formation of kidney stones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Clark et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jiang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ohana, Shcheynikov, Moe, &amp; Muallem, 2013</xref>). Similar to SLC26A9, the protein acts in synergy with the chloride channel CFTR and was proposed to engage in direct interaction and mutual regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bertrand et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dorwart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shcheynikov, Ko, et al., 2006</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). The stoichiometry of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and oxalate transport by SLC26 is still controversial, as transport of both ions has been described in different studies as either electrogenic or electroneutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Clark et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kim, Myers, Sihn, Rafizadeh, &amp; Zhang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ohana, Yang, Shcheynikov, &amp; Muallem, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shcheynikov, Wang, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Xie, Welch, Mercado, Romero, &amp; Mount, 2002</xref>). This question is particularly pertinent in light of the divergent net charge of both substrates, with HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> being monovalent and oxalate divalent under physiological conditions. Consequently, the structural basis for the mechanistic distinction between the uncoupled SLC26A9 and the coupled SLC26A6 and the basis for their pronounced selectivity, with Cl<sup>-</sup> acting as common substrate of both proteins, has remained elusive. To address these open questions, we here present a thorough structural and functional characterization of the human transporter SLC26A6 combining cryo-electron microscopy with electrophysiology and liposomal transport assays. With respect to its overall structure, SLC26A6 closely resembles its paralog SLC26A9 although it shows a distinct transport mechanism. The protein mediates electroneutral Cl<sup>-</sup>/ HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and presumable electrogenic Cl<sup>-</sup>/oxalate exchange, which is in stark contrast to the uncoupled Cl<sup>-</sup> transport of SLC26A9. This is accomplished by an altered ion binding site located in the mobile core domain of the transmembrane transport unit.</p>

<title>Functional characterization of SLC26A6</title>
<p>We have previously characterized the transport properties of murine SLC26A9 by patch clamp electrophysiology and found comparatively large and selective Cl<sup>-</sup> currents. SLC26A9 currents were shown to reverse at the Nernst potential of the conducting anion, which distinguishes the protein as an uncoupled chloride transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). The high magnitude of these ohmic currents, which lack any time-dependence in response to voltage changes, originate from an unusually active protein that transports anions with channel-like properties (<xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). SLC26A9 shows a lyotropic permeability sequence that facilitates the transport of Cl<sup>-</sup>, isothiocyanate, I<sup>-</sup> and nitrate but not sulfate or HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). The inability to conduct HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is an exception in a family where most members work as transporters of this abundant anion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alper &amp; Sharma, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ohana et al., 2009</xref>). To investigate mechanistic differences between this passive Cl<sup>-</sup> transporter and its paralogs functioning as coupled antiporters, we have turned our attention towards the protein SLC26A6, which was proposed to mediate electrogenic Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ohana et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shcheynikov, Wang, et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, we initially attempted to use patch clamp electrophysiology in the whole-cell configuration to characterize its transport properties. However, unlike for SLC26A9, we did not detect specific currents that could be attributed to SLC26A6 in a wide voltage range. This was irrespective of whether we used symmetric Cl<sup>-</sup> solutions or asymmetric conditions, where the major anion in the extracellular solution was changed to HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>). To confirm the expression of SLC26A6 at the plasma membrane, we employed surface biotinylation and found a similar level as observed for its electrogenic paralog SLC26A9 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We thus concluded that the transporter would either be inactive, exceedingly slow or that transport would be electroneutral as a consequence of the strict 1:1 exchange of two monovalent anions.</p>

</fig>
<p>Consequently, we turned to <italic>in vitro</italic> assays where we have reconstituted SLC26A6 into proteoliposomes and monitored its activity with ion-selective probes (<xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>). Initially we investigated whether we would be able to detect any sign of uncoupled chloride flow by using a fluorometric assay based on the fluorophore ACMA. This assay monitors pH changes following the ionophore-mediated H<sup>+</sup> influx to compensate for the buildup of a membrane potential during Cl<sup>-</sup> uptake, which would enable us to observe transport even if the slow kinetics prevents characterization by electrophysiology (<xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>). In this way, we have previously monitored SLC26A9-mediated anion transport into proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>). However, in contrast to SLC26A9, no acidification was observed for SLC26A6, emphasizing that the transporter is either inactive or, alternatively, transport would be strictly coupled and electroneutral (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we were interested in whether Cl<sup>-</sup> would be exchanged by HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> by a mechanism where the charges of transported anions are balanced. To this end, we directly monitored Cl<sup>-</sup> influx into HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-loaded proteoliposomes using the fluorophore lucigenin, whose fluorescence is selectively quenched by the former anion (<xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>). In this assay, we found a robust time-dependent fluorescence decrease at high Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration, demonstrating its transport by SLC26A6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). The process did not require the addition of valinomycin to dissipate the membrane potential, thus underlining that transport is electroneutral. In the investigation of the Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration-dependence of transport, we found a saturation with an apparent K<sub>M</sub> of about 16-37 mM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1F</xref>). This indicated low affinity for the transported anion is in the same range as observed for Cl<sup>-</sup> transport in SLC26A9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we probed whether HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> itself would be a transported substrate. To this end, we employed a novel HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-selective europium probe and incorporated this probe within proteoliposomes to assay HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> influx (<xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Martínez-Crespo et al., 2021</xref>). The addition of 10 mM HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to the outside in presence of a symmetric 200 mM concentration of Cl<sup>-</sup> on both sides of the membrane caused a pronounced increase in luminescence that is well above the small non-specific signal observed in liposomes not containing any protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). This increase is substantially enhanced when using a reduced outside Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration of 50 mM to generate an outwardly directed driving force (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Together these experiments demonstrate that HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is a transported anion and that its import into proteoliposomes is coupled to the counterflow of Cl<sup>-</sup>. Taken together, our experiments underline the function of SLC26A6 as electroneutral coupled Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchanger.</p>
<p>Besides HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, SLC26A6 was also proposed to be involved in the transport of oxalate in exchange for Cl<sup>-</sup> and thus to participate in the excretion of this small divalent anion in both the intestine and kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Clark et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ohana et al., 2013</xref>). However, if assuming a coupled 1:1 stoichiometry as observed in case of Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchange, the transported charge would in this case no longer be balanced, thus converting an electroneutral into an electrogenic transport process. As there are no suitable fluorophores for the selective detection of oxalate and since the small dicarboxylic acid also interferes with the detection of Cl<sup>-</sup> by lucigenin, we decided to investigate whether a potentially electrogenic Cl<sup>-</sup>/oxalate exchange could be assayed with the fluorophore ACMA (<xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>). In these experiments, we found a robust decrease of the ACMA fluorescence upon the addition of extracellular oxalate to Cl<sup>-</sup>-loaded proteoliposomes containing SLC26A6, with the concentration dependence and saturation of the fluorescence decay further emphasizing a specific transport process (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). We also attempted to follow electrogenic Cl<sup>-</sup>/oxalate exchange by patch clamp electrophysiology in the whole cell configuration but did not measure pronounced currents that would be above background, likely due to the slow kinetics of the process (<xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1I</xref>). Together, our functional experiments characterize SLC26A6 as a strictly coupled transporter that exchanges Cl<sup>-</sup> with HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and presumably also oxalate at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio.</p>

<title>SLC26A6 structure</title>
<p>To reveal the molecular basis of the described transport properties of SLC26A6, we have determined its structure by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). A dataset of the protein purified in the detergent glycol-diosgenin (GDN) at 3.3 Å was of high quality and allowed for the unambiguous interpretation of the cryo-EM density by an atomic model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs2_2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In its organization, the SLC26A6 structure shows familiar features that have previously been observed in various eukaryotic family members of known structure including human and murine SLC26A9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>), SLC26A5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bavi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Butan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Futamata et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ge et al., 2021</xref>), SLC26A4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Liu et al., 2022</xref>) and the plant transporter AtSULTR4 (L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2_3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 3</xref>). The SLC26A6 subunit consists of a membrane-inserted unit (TM) followed by a cytoplasmic STAS domain. In the homodimeric protein, subunit interactions are predominantly formed by the domain-swapped cytoplasmic parts including an extended N-terminal region and the C-terminal STAS domain, whereas the few contacts between the transmembrane transport units are confined to the end of the terminal membrane-spanning helix α14 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). A region connecting secondary structure elements of the STAS domain (located between Cα1 and β4) termed the intervening sequence (IVS) is present in the characterized protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Previously, removal of this region increased both the stability and surface expression of a construct of the murine SLC26A9 while retaining its transport properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>). In the density, the N-terminal part of the IVS folds into an α-helix encompassing amino acids 569-593 (Cα<sup>IVS</sup>) whereas the following 61 residues are unstructured and thus not resolved in the density (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). On the C-terminus of the IVS, the density re-appears at Ser 655 at the region preceding β4, which interacts with Cα<sup>IVS</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, C</xref>). A generally similar arrangement was also observed in a full-length construct of human SLC26A9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chi et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In both structures, Cα<sup>IVS</sup> runs about parallel to the membrane plane and contacts the loop connecting α8 and α9 of the mobile core domain. This presumably influences its conformational preferences thereby potentially impacting transport (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-D</xref>).</p>

<title>The transmembrane domain</title>
<p>In the dimeric transporter, the two TMs share minimal contacts and thus supposedly function as independent units (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Consequently, we expect structural differences underlying the distinct transport properties of SLC26 paralogs to be manifested in this part of the protein. Like in other pro- and eukaryotic family members of known structure, the TMs of SLC26A6 consist of two topologically related repeats of seven transmembrane segments, which span the membrane with opposite orientation (<xref rid="figs2_3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 3B</xref>). Elements of both repeats are intertwined to form two segregated modules, a gate domain and a core domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The equivalence between the SLC26A9 and SLC26A6 conformations is illustrated in the overlay of the respective TMs whose Cα positions superimpose with an RMSD of 1.3 Å (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Both conformations represent inward-facing states of transporters presumably functioning by an alternate access mechanism. The substrate binding site located in the center of the core domain is accessible from the cytoplasm via a spacious aqueous cavity, whereas the extracellular exit is sealed by extended contacts between core and gate domains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, D</xref>, <xref rid="figs3_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). The resemblance between individual sub-domains even exceeds the overall similarity of the TM (with core- and gate domains superimposing with RMSDs of 1.13 Å and 1.2 Å, respectively) distinguishing them as largely independent units of a modular protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In the comparison of both paralogs, the gate domains do not show pronounced differences (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Together with the cytoplasmic STAS domains, which constitute the bulk of the dimer interface, these sub-domains form a contiguous rigid scaffold of the dimeric protein that presumably remains static during transport (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs3_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, both core domains represent the mobile elements of the protein (<xref rid="figs3_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref>). Each core domain carries a substrate binding site located in a pocket at the center of the unit facing the gate domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C, D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). The presumable location of a bound chloride ion is resolved in the structure of SLC26A6 at a low contour of the map (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2B</xref>). This position concurs with positions inferred from known structures of paralogs, which show binding of Cl<sup>-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to an equivalent location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Futamata et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ge et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Liu et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). The anion binding site is placed between the opposed short helices α3 and α10, which partly span the membrane and whose N-termini are aligned to face each other in the center of the core domain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Together with the side chains of surrounding residues, both α-helix termini form a selective anion binding site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-G</xref>, <xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). In complex with its bound cargo, the core domain is believed to shuttle as rigid unit between two extreme conformations where the binding sites are either exposed to the cytoplasm or the extracellular environment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, D, <xref rid="figs3_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>As carrier of the substrate binding site, the core domains presumably display the characteristic features accounting for the distinct functional properties of SLC26A6 and SLC26A9. Their conservation within the SLC26 family is illustrated in the comparison of the respective domains of SLC26A6 and SLC26A5 (Prestin) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A, C, D, E, G</xref>). Latter belongs to a protein that, instead of transporting ions, confers electromotility and which in the best defined structure (PDBID: 7LGU) resides in a distinct conformation where the substrate binding site has become buried between core and gate domain (leading to an RMSD of 2.9 Å for the entire TMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ge et al., 2021</xref>). Despite the functional and conformational differences, the core domains of SLC26A5 and SLC26A6 superimpose with an RMSD of only 1.13 Å, illustrating their close structural resemblance (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A, C</xref>). Both proteins share similar ion binding properties that extends to Cl<sup>-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, latter of which is not a substrate of SLC26A9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to the general similarity with SLC26A5, the comparison of the same units of SLC26A6 and SLC26A9 shows distinct features that likely underlie the differences in substrate selectivity and transport mechanism (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). These are confined to the conformation of α10, which at its N-terminus forms direct interactions with transported ions, whereas the remainder of the domain is very similar (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). The difference in the conformations of this short membrane-inserted helix can be approximated by a 12-14° rotation of α10 of SLC26A9 around an axis located at its C-terminal end towards α-helix 1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). The replacement of residues within the contact region of SLC26A9 in comparison to other family members acts to lower their side chain volume at the contact region between both helices (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-F</xref>). These include Ser 96 and Val 100 on SLC26A6, which are both replaced by glycines at equivalent positions in SLC26A9 (i.e., Gly 77 and Gly 81) and a substitution of Val 407, Gln 408 and Thr 411 by Ala 396, Val 397 and Ala 400 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-F</xref>). In addition to the described substitutions, there are also differences in the side chains surrounding the ion binding site, which together determine the size and polarity of the substrate binding pocket (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, G-I</xref>). These differences extend to Ser 401 of SLC26A6, which is replaced by an alanine in SLC26A9 (Ala 390), and most prominent, the large Arg 404 of SLC26A6, which is replaced by Val 393 in SLC26A9 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D-I</xref>, <xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1D-G</xref>). As a result, the pocket is considerably deeper in SLC26A9 compared SLC26A6, where it is delimited by the side chain of Arg 404 that interacts with the residues preceding α helix 3 to form the back side of the shallow binding site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-I</xref>, <xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1D-H</xref>). In addition to its structural role, Arg 404 likely also contributes to the stabilization of bound anions by coulombic interactions, with its guanidium group potentially engaging in direct interactions with bicarbonate or oxalate. The altered geometry of the site leads to the binding of Cl<sup>-</sup> deeper in the pocket in case of SLC26A9 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E, G-I</xref>, <xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1H</xref>) and presumably explains why bicarbonate interacts with SLC26A6 but not SLC26A9.</p>

<title>Structure-function relationships</title>
<p>Whereas our functional data has defined SLC26A6 as a coupled antiporter that exchanges Cl<sup>-</sup> with HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and presumably also oxalate with equimolar stoichiometry, its structure has revealed the architecture of a transport protein in an inward-facing conformation. The transport properties are presumably determined by the detailed organization of the mobile core domain. This protein module shows pronounced structural differences compared to the equivalent unit of the uncoupled transporter SLC26A9, resulting in a remodeled anion binding site, which in SLC26A6 is lined by a conserved basic residue (i.e., Arg 404) that is shared by most but not all mammalian paralogs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1G</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We thus decided to mutate this position to the amino acid found in SLC26A9 and to characterize the transport properties of the SLC26A6 mutant R404V. This mutation is well-tolerated and does not interfere with protein integrity as judged by its expression level and biochemical properties. We initially investigated whether SLC26A6 R404V would conduct ions as a consequence of compromised coupling properties and thus studied the protein by patch-clamp electrophysiology. In whole-cell patch clamp experiments, we detected small currents in symmetric Cl<sup>-</sup> solutions, which are low compared to SLC26A9, despite the comparable expression of the mutant at the cell-surface (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-E</xref>). Irrespective of their magnitude, which is not significantly higher than SLC26A6 WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, D</xref>), these currents are indicative for the capability of the mutant to mediate electrogenic Cl<sup>-</sup> transport at low rates. We thus turned to our proteoliposome-based ACMA assay to confirm that side chain replacement has indeed conferred the ability to SLC26A6 to pass downhill Cl<sup>-</sup> transport (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). After demonstrating uncoupled chloride transport, we tested whether the mutant has retained its ability of mediating coupled Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchange using the fluorophore lucigenin but did not find pronounced Cl<sup>-</sup> flux in this case (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, H). Together our data suggest that the mutation of a conserved basic position in the ion binding site has compromised the ability of SLC26A6 to mediate coupled Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchange and instead facilitated uncoupled Cl<sup>-</sup> transport with slow kinetics. While these findings underline the importance of Arg 404 for anion interactions and coupling, they also emphasize that the mutation of a single residue is insufficient to confer the complete functional phenotype of SLC26A9 as a fast uncoupled Cl<sup>-</sup> conductor. Nevertheless, our results further underline the importance of the anion binding site in SLC26 transporters for the transport mechanism of its members.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By combining structural data obtained by cryo-EM with electrophysiology and transport assays, our study has elucidated the previously unknown architecture of SLC26A6, defined its transport properties and revealed the features that underlie the mechanistic distinction to the paralog SLC26A9. By using a novel HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> selective europium probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Martínez-Crespo et al., 2021</xref>), we have directly demonstrated the transport of this important physiological anion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). We have further clarified the controversy concerning the stoichiometry of anions transported by SLC26A6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ohana et al., 2009</xref>). In the case of Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport, we detect a strict equimolar exchange of anions binding to a conserved site in the mobile core domain of the transmembrane transport unit (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B, H</xref>). Although not shown unambiguously, we assume an analogous mechanism also for Cl<sup>-</sup>/oxalate exchange. Consequently, transport would be electroneutral in case of the monovalent HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and electrogenic in case of the divalent oxalate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-H</xref>), which was already proposed in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernova et al., 2005</xref>). Regarding their function, SLC26A6 and SLC26A9 show different features with respect to substrate selectivity and coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ohana et al., 2009</xref>). Remarkably, both proteins are capable of interacting with Cl<sup>-</sup> with similar mM affinity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>). However, they do this via distinct interactions in equivalent binding regions. In SLC26A9, Cl<sup>-</sup> binds in a deep pocket with low field strength, whereas the same pocket is shallower in SLC26A6, where a conserved arginine (Arg 404) increases the positive electrostatic potential and thus likely stabilizes the bound anion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4H, I</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Together with the presence of additional residues at the binding site (i.e., Ser 401 at the N-terminal end of α11), the captured Cl<sup>-</sup> in SLC26A6 thus can rely on a larger density of polar interactions (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). The same site likely also provides a suitable environment for HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and oxalate, neither of which are substrates of SLC26A9 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A, H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dorwart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>). A similar anion interaction observed in SLC26A6 is also found in the paralogs SLC26A4 (Pendrin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Liu et al., 2022</xref>) and SLC26A5 (Prestin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Futamata et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ge et al., 2021</xref>), which both share a similar substrate preference. The similarity between the core domains of SLC26A6 and Prestin is remarkable in light of the altered function of the latter, which is no longer capable of transporting ions and instead operates as motor protein in cochlear outer hair cells of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>). While to some degree Prestin undergoes comparable conformational changes as other family members, as illustrated in the close relationship between occluded conformations of SLC26A9 and SLC26A5, the full transition into an outward-facing conformation to release the bound anion to the extracellular environment appears to be prohibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bavi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ge et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Besides the absence of a residue carrying a positive charge, the altered binding site in SLC26A9 is also a consequence of concerted replacements of interacting amino acids on α1 and α10, which change the immediate environment of the bound ion and allow for a reorientation of the partly inserted helix α10 whose N-terminus contributes part of the interactions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Collectively, these changes presumably lead to the altered ion selectivity. The importance of the described anion binding site for the transport mechanism is illustrated in the point mutation R404V in SLC26A6. The replacement of this basic residue, which was considered a hallmark in the distinction between SLC26A9 and other family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>), has compromised coupled Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchange and instead mediates uncoupled Cl<sup>-</sup> transport, although with considerably slower kinetics than in SLC26A9 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B-G</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p>
<p>From a mechanistic viewpoint SLC26A9 and SLC26A6 are distinguished by the sequence of conformations that together define the transport cycle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In the uncoupled SLC26A9, the transporter is able to transition between inward- and outward facing states at a high rate, which underlies the pronounced currents observed in patch clamp experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). The same change of the access in an unloaded conformation is kinetically unfavorable in the coupled exchanger SLC26A6, as illustrated in the lack of current in electrophysiological recordings and the absence of a Cl<sup>-</sup> leak in a vesicle-based assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B-D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>). The basis for the distinctive kinetic features of both paralogs is currently still unclear, and we do at this stage not exclude the existence of a leaky channel-like conformation in SLC26A9. Such a conformation could potentially promote Cl<sup>-</sup> flow across a continuous aqueous pore without obligatory protein movement, although there is currently no structural evidence for its existence. The nature of the energy barrier, which prevents the shuttling of the unloaded state of SLC26A6 and other paralogs with similar functional phenotype (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the transporters SLC26A1-4) has thus far remained elusive. It is likely that conformational changes are dictated by interactions between the mobile core domain with the immobile gate domain, which are both believed to operate as semi-independent entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Geertsma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>). Remarkably, both units bury a similar contact area in the inward-facing conformations of SLC26A6 and SLC26A9 and do not exhibit pronounced differences in their interactions (<xref rid="figs3_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Additional contacts in SLC26A6 are established with the structured N-terminal part of the IVS region of the STAS domain of the interacting subunit, which appear to further stabilize the observed inward-facing conformation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Similar interactions have also been found in the full-length transporter SLC26A9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chi et al., 2020</xref>), which, next to the increased surface expression, could account for the strongly increased activity observed in the construct SLC26A9<sup>T</sup> where the IVS sequence of the protein was removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>). Besides the effect of the IVS, also the truncation of the C-terminus of SLC26A9 might have contributed to this high activity. The unstructured C-termini of family members are weakly conserved and in case of SLC26A6 and SLC26A9, they contain a PDZ binding motif at their end, which is believed to tether either transporter to potential partners such as the anion channel CFTR via interacting scaffolding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shcheynikov; Ko, et al., 2006</xref>). In the isoform b of SLC26A9, a C-terminal extension was located in the aqueous cavity leading to the substrate binding site in the inward-facing conformation of SLC26A9, thereby locking the transporter in the observed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chi et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="figs2_3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 3A</xref>). There is no similar extension found in any SLC26A6 isoforms, and the role of this interaction in a cellular environment is currently unclear, although it hints at a possible regulation in SLC26A9. Collectively our study has provided novel insight into the structural basis of substrate selectivity and the mechanistic distinction between uncoupled and coupled transporters of the SLC26 family and thus provides a foundation for future investigations.</p>

<caption><p>Transport mechanism. Features of the anion binding site (left) and kinetic schemes (right) of two SLC26 paralogs with distinct functional properties. (<bold>A</bold>) The coupled antiporter SLC26A6 mediates the strict stoichiometric exchange of Cl<sup>-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and presumably also of oxalate. The protein readily cycles between inward- and outward-facing conformations in substrate-loaded states, whereas the transition in an unloaded state is kinetically disfavored. The binding of different anions is facilitated by a large but shallow binding site with high field-strength. (<bold>B</bold>) The uncoupled Cl<sup>-</sup> transporter SLC26A9 has a narrower substrate selectivity where both Cl<sup>-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> are not among the transported ions. Uncoupled Cl<sup>-</sup> transport is likely mediated by a mechanism that allows the rapid transition of the unloaded transporter between inward- and outward-facing conformations. The transported ion binds to a site with low field-strength. A similar mechanism, although with slower kinetics, is mediated by a point mutant of SLC26A6 where a conserved Arg of the binding site is replaced by a Val, the corresponding residue found in SLC26A9.</p></caption>

<p>The open reading frame of human SLC26A6 (isoform 3, GenBank accession number: <underline>BC017697</underline>) and mouse SLC26A9 (GenBank accession number: <underline>BC160193</underline>) was amplified from a cDNA clone (Source BioScience) and cloned into into a pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen) modified to be compatible with the FX-cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Geertsma &amp; Dutzler, 2011</xref>). The truncated murine SLC26A9 construct (SLC26A9<sup>T</sup>) was generated as previously detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Walter et al., 2019</xref>). All FX-modified expression constructs contained a C-terminal C3 protease cleavage site, venus YFP, myc-tag and streptavidin-binding protein (SBP). As a consequence of FX cloning, expressed constructs include an additional serine at the N-terminus and an alanine at the C-terminus. Following C3-cleavage, SLC26A6 carries a seven residues long C-terminal extension (of sequence ALEVLFQ). For the generation of the hSLC26A6 point mutant R404V, the QuickChange (Aligent) mutagenesis method was used with the following primers: Forward: 5’-GCT CTA TGT CTG TGA GCC TGG TAC-3’ and Reverse: 5’-GTA CCA GGC TCA CAG ACA TAG AGC-3’.</p>

<title>Liposome Reconstitution</title>
<p>For liposome reconstitutions using the [Eu.L1<sup>+</sup>] bicarbonate-selective probe, lipid preparation was performed on the same day as protein purification. POPC:Cholesterol lipids (7:3 w/w ratio, Avanti) were pooled in a round-bottom flask and initially dried under N<sub>2</sub> flow to form a lipid film. Lipids were further dried under vacuum for 1 h prior to re-hydration with [Eu.L1<sup>+</sup>] buffer (50 µM [Eu.L1<sup>+</sup>], 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). The resulting suspension was gently sonicated and stirred for 2 h to generate a homogeneous mixture. Ten freeze-thaw cycles were performed to generate multilamellar liposomes before extrusion 29 times through x2 polycarbonate 400 nm filters to give unilamellar liposomes.</p>
<p>For protein incorporation, 10 µl aliquots of 10% Triton X-100 were added in order to destabilize liposomes and permit protein incorporation. After reaching a plateau of the light scattering measured at 540 nm, 4 additional aliquots of Triton X-100 were added. The number of additions required for destabilization did not vary between reconstitutions. After the formation of destabilized liposomes, purified SLC26A6 was added at a lipid-to-protein ratio (LPR) of 50:1. To counteract [Eu.L1<sup>+</sup>] probe leakage, an additional equimolar 50 µM [Eu.L1<sup>+</sup>] was added. The subsequent mixture was gently rotated at RT for 20 min prior to the addition of 250 mg SM-2 Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) per 5 ml of sample. The sample was then incubated for 30 min at RT prior to incubation at 4 °C. Bio-Bead additions were performed over a three-day period every 24 h. Biobeads were removed by gravity filtration and the sample was used immediately for assay measurements.</p>
<p>For liposome reconstitution for the Lucigenin and ACMA assays, a similar procedure was used with the following adjustments. POPE:POPG lipids (3:1 w/w) were first pooled in a round-bottom flask and washed with diethyl ether prior to drying under N<sub>2</sub> for 1.5 h. Lipids were then resuspended to 20 mg/ml in 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl prior to sonication to form a homogeneous mixture. After three freeze-thaw cycles, the sample was frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at -80 °C until further use. Purified SLC6A9<sup>T</sup> was incorporated utilizing the triton-destabilisation method previously detailed at a LPR of 80:1 (w/w). Both SLC26A6 wildtype and the R404V mutant were incorporated at a 50:1 (w/w) ratio. Successful incorporation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE gel quantification. For all reconstitution procedures, mock empty liposomes lacking any purified protein were generated using the same protocols.</p>

<title>[Eu.L1<sup>+</sup>] Bicarbonate Transport Assay</title>
<p>For all measurements of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport, buffers were degassed to remove atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. After Bio-Bead removal via gravity filtration, proteoliposomes were pelleted and the excess [Eu.L1<sup>+</sup>] probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Martínez-Crespo et al., 2021</xref>) was removed by two ultracentrifugation and resuspension steps in symmetric outside buffer (200 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Where 50 mM external NaCl was required, liposomes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in symmetric internal buffer (50 µM [Eu.L1<sup>+</sup>], 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Liposomes were further subjected to five freeze-thaw cycles and extruded 29 times using 400 nm polycarbonate filters. Two ultracentrifugation and resuspension-wash steps in asymmetric external buffer (50 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) were performed before the final resuspension in asymmetric external buffer.</p>
<p>For measurements of electroneutral Cl<sup>-</sup>/ HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchange, 100 µl of SLC26A6 proteoliposomes were added to a 96-well flat bottom black plate (Greiner). Prior to measurement, liposome samples were gently bubbled under N<sub>2</sub> for 2 min to remove atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and residual HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> from samples. Following the recording of a baseline emission for 20 fluorometric excitation/emission cycles (lasting 0.5 s each) using a Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro microplate reader, 10 mM HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was added to the liposomes. Normalized [Eu.L1+] emission (excitation = 332, emission= 617) was determined following the lysis of liposomes by addition of 0.4 % Triton X-100 after cycle 300. Time gating of the recorded emission was performed using a 150 µs lag-time between excitation and signal integration with an overall 850 µs integration time. HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport was measured in the presence of both, a four-fold NaCl gradient (200 mM inside/50 mM outside) and symmetrical conditions (200 mM inside/200 mM outside).</p>

<p>To compare the uncoupled chloride conduction properties of SLC26A6 and SLC26A9, proteoliposomes were prepared with an internal buffer concentration of 50 mM Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Proteoliposomes were sonicated in 20 µl aliquots to form unilamellar vesicles prior to dilution into 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) assay buffer (2 µM ACMA, 75 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). 100 µl aliquots were added to a 96-well plate and after a baseline measurement period for 13 excitation/emission cycles (0.5 s per cycle), the protonophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was added to dissipate the membrane potential and permit transporter-mediated anion-movement. ACMA fluorescence (excitation = 412 nm and emission = 482 nm), as a determinant of Cl<sup>-</sup> transport mediated H<sup>+</sup> influx, was measured using the Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro Plate Reader over 495 s or using the Tecan Spark Plate reader over 1,800 s. Data were normalized to the point of CCCP addition.</p>
<p>To measure electrogenic oxalate transport, the same protocol was applied with the following exception: SLC26A6 liposomes consisted of an internal concentration of 150 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and an external concentration of 9.4-150 mM oxalate, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. 40 µl aliquots were added to a to a black 384-well plate (Greiner) and ACMA fluorescence was measured on a TECAN Spark Plate Reader over 1,200 s.</p>

Ultracentrifugation was performed twice and resuspension in lucigenin assay buffer was performed to remove excess exterior lucigenin. 40 µl aliquots were transferred to a black 384-well plate and after 20 cycles (0.2 s per cycle), 0 to 240 mM NaCl diluted in assay buffer was added. Quenching of lucigenin fluorescence (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 505 nm) was measured as a determinant of Cl<sup>-</sup> influx for 300 cycles prior to lysis by 0.4% Triton X-100.

<p>Patch pipettes were formed from pulled and polished borosilicate glass capillaries (OD = 1.5 mm, ID = 0.86 mm, Sutter). When backfilled with 150 mM CsCl, patch pipettes yielded a resistance of between 2-4 MΩ. For voltage-clamp experiments, currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and digitized using a Digidata 1440A A/D converter. Signals were filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz prior to acquisition with Clampex 10.6 (Molecular Devices). A voltage step protocol using a holding potential of 0 mV for 0.2 s was performed prior to 20 mV incremental voltage steps. The voltage steps ranged from -100 mV to +100 mV before returning to 0 mV. Recorded cell capacitance upon break-in varied between 10-30 pF with series resistance &lt;10 MΩ. Calculated liquid junction potentials (JPCalcW, Molecular Devices) never surpassed 5 mV.</p>

All movies were subjected to patch motion correction. Following patch CTF estimation, high quality micrographs were identified based on relative ice thickness, CTF resolution estimation and total full frame motion. 1,749,907 particles were picked following the generation of 2D templates for automated template picking. Subsequently, picked particles were binned 2.4x using a box-size of 360 pixels for 2D classification (pixel size 1.56 Å/pixel). Following three rounds of 2D classification, classes were selected that displayed general structural features characteristic for the SLC26 family in various orientations. From this, 256,581 particles were used to generate a ‘good’ ab initio reconstruction and a portion of rejected particles (16,030 particles) were used to generate a ‘junk’ reconstruction. 967,713 selected particles from 2D classification were subjected to heterogenous refinement using the selected good reconstruction as a ‘template’ and the junk reconstruction as a ‘decoy’. After several rounds of heterogenous refinement, the selected 507,174 particles and associated heterogeneously refined map were subjected to multiple rounds of non-uniform refinement with imposed C2 symmetry. Following iterative rounds of non-uniform and local CTF refinement, a reconstruction at a nominal resolution of 3.55 Å was generated. These particles were then subjected to a 4-class ab initio reconstruction for further sorting resulting in one good map composed of 173,834 particles. Particles were re-extracted with a bin-1 pixel size of 0.651 Å/pixel using a 432 pixel-sized box and subjected to non-uniform refinement prior to a final 3-class ab initio reconstruction resulting in a single high quality map comprised of 93,169 particles. Multiple rounds of non-uniform refinement and local CTF refinement were performed. Finally, the resultant reconstruction maps were sharpened with the DeepEMhancer tool using the HighRes deep-learning model (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2021). The quality of the map was analyzed with 3DFSC (Tan et al., 2017) for FSC validation and local resolution estimation.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> manuscript combines cryo-EM and a suite of <bold>compelling</bold> whole cell and proteoliposome transport assays to establish the mechanism and structure of the full-length human SLC26A6 chloride/bicarbonate exchangers, including the first partial view of the previously unresolved IVS region of an SLC26 STAS domain. In combination with prior studies on additional SLC26 paralogs, including the SLC26A9 paralog initially reported by the same group, the study provides broadly relevant insights into the mechanistic diversity of the SLC26 transporters. This study is of interest to the biophysics community and the field of membrane transport.</p>

<p>Tippett et al present whole cell and proteoliposome transport data showing unequivocally that purified recombinant SLC26A6 reconstituted in proteoliposomes mediates electroneutral chloride/bicarbonate exchange, as well as coupled chloride/oxalate exchange unassociated with detectable current. Both functions contrast with the uncoupled chloride conductance mediated by SLC26A9. The authors also present a novel cryo-EM structure of full-length human SLC26A6 chloride/anion exchanger. As part of the structure, they offer the first partial view of the STAS domain previously predicted to be unstructured. They further define a single Arg residue of the SLC26A6 transmembrane domain required for coupled exchange, mutation of which yields apparently uncoupled electrogenic chloride transport mechanistically resembling that of SLC26A9, although of lower magnitude. The authors further apply to proteoliposomes for the first time a still novel approach to the measurement of bicarbonate transport using a bicarbonate-selective Europium fluorophor. The evidence strongly supports the authors' claims and conclusions, with one exception.</p>
<p>The manuscript has numerous strengths:</p>
<p>As a structural biology contribution, the authors extend the range of SLC26 structures to SLC26A6, comparing it in considerable detail to the published SLC26A9 structure, and presenting for the first time the structure of a portion of the STAS IVS domain of SLC26A6 long considered unstructured.</p>
<p>The authors also apply a remarkably extensive range of creative technical approaches to assess the functional mechanisms of anion transport by SLC26A6, among them the first application of the novel, specific bicarbonate sensor Eu-L1+ to directly assess bicarbonate transport in reconstituted proteoliposomes. The authors also present the first (to this reviewer's knowledge) functional proteoliposome reconstitution of chloride-bicarbonate exchange mediated by an SLC26 protein. They define a residue in surrounding the anion binding pocket which explains part of the difference in anion exchange coupling between SLC26A6 and SLC26A9. In the setting of past conflicting results, the current work also contributes to the weight of previous evidence demonstrating that SLC26A6 mediates electroneutral rather than electrogenic Cl-/HCO3- exchange.</p>
<p>Each of these achievements constitutes a significant advance in our understanding.</p>
<p>The paper has only a few weaknesses:</p>
<p>One is an incomplete explanation of the mechanistic determinants of anion exchange coupling in SLC26A6 vs. uncoupled anion transport by SLC26A9.</p>
<p>A second weakness is the inconsistent, technique-dependent detection of SLC26A6- mediated electrogenic chloride/oxalate exchange. In particular whole cell currents attributable to SLC26A6 in SLC26A6-expressing HEK293 cells in an oxalate bath could not be detected, whereas robust, saturable Cl- efflux into oxalate solution from proteoliposomes reconstituted with recombinant SLC626A6 was detectable by AMCA fluorescence decay. This discrepancy was attributed to the relative sensitivities and/or signal-to-noise ratios of the assays.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript represents an important advance in our understanding of the SLC26 protein family and of coupled vs uncoupled carrier-mediated anion transport.</p>

<p>The eleven paralogs of SLC26 proteins in humans exhibit a remarkable range of functional diversity, spanning from slow anion exchangers and fast anion transporters with channel-like properties, to motor proteins found in the cochlear outer hair cells. In this study, the authors investigate human SLC26A6, which functions as a bicarbonate (HCO3-)/chloride (Cl-) and oxalate (C2O42-)/Cl- exchanger, combining cryo-electron microscopy, electrophysiology, and in vitro transport assays. The authors provide compelling evidence to support the idea that SLC26A6's exchange anions at equimolar stoichiometry, leading to the electroneutral and electrogenic transport of HCO3-/ Cl- and C2O42-/Cl-, respectively. Furthermore, the structure of SLC26A6 reveals a close resemblance to the fast, uncoupled Cl- transporter SLC26A9, with the major structural differences observed within the anion binding site. By characterizing an amino acid substitution within the SLC26A6 anion binding site (R404V), the authors also show that the size and charge variance of the binding pocket between the two paralogs could, in part, contribute to the differences in their transport mechanisms.</p>
<p>This is a well-executed study, and the strength of this work lies in the reductionist, in vitro approach that the authors took to characterize the transport process of SLC26A6. The authors used and developed an array of functional experiments, including two electrogenic transport assays - a fast kinetic (electrophysiology) and a slow-kinetic (fluorescent-based ACMA) - and two electroneutral transport assays, probing for Cl- (lucigenin) and HCO3- (europium), which are well executed and characterized. The structural data is also of high quality and is the first structure of an SLC26 coupled anion exchanger, providing essential information for clarifying our understanding of the functional diversity between the SLC26 family of proteins.</p>

<p>The mechanistically diverse SLC26 transporters play a variety of physiological roles. The current manuscript establishes the SLC26A6 subtype as electroneutral chloride/bicarbonate exchanges and reports its high-resolution structure with chloride bound.</p>
<p>The claims in this manuscript are all well-supported by the data. Strengths include the comprehensive functional analysis of SLC26A6 in reconstituted liposome vesicles. The authors employ an array of assays, including chloride sensors, a newly developed fluorescent probe for bicarbonate, and assays to detect the electrogenicity of anion exchange. With this assortment of assays, the authors are able to establish the anion selectivity and stoichiometry of SLC26A6. Another strength of the manuscript is the functional comparison with SLC26A9, which permits fast, passive chloride transport, in order to benchmark the SLC26A6 activity. The structural analysis, including the assignment of the chloride binding site, is also convincing. The structural details and the chloride binding site are well-conserved among SLC26s. Finally, the authors present an interesting discussion comparing the structures of SLC26A5, SLC26A6, and SLC26A9, and how the details of the chloride binding site might influence the mechanistic distinctions between these similar transporters.</p>

<p>The following is the authors' response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewers for their positive remarks, which we have addressed in detail below and which we have considered in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors claim several times to have documented electrogenic chloride/oxalate exchange mediated by human SLC26A6. However, they fail to detect whole cell currents in SLC26A6-expressing HEK293 cells in oxalate bath, despite robust, saturable Cl- efflux from proteoliposomes into extracellular oxalate solution, as detected by AMCA fluorescence decay.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We interpret the low, and essentially non-detectable currents for Cl-/oxalate exchange as a consequence of the slow kinetics of transport. This lack of sensitivity is not unusual for electrogenic secondary-active transport processes recorded by patch-clamp electrophysiology in mammalian cells, which renders the recording in large <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes by two-electrode voltage clamp the preferred method for such investigations. In contrast to the non-detectable activity in electrophysiology, the pronounced signal in the ACMA assay reflects the influx of H+ as a consequence of the negative membrane potential established by the influx of the divalent anion oxalate, which we assume to occur in exchange with the monovalent Cl-.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Instances in the manuscript include:</p>
<p>Abstract Line 17 overstates the paper's findings as &quot;we have characterized SLC26A6 as a strictly coupled exchanger of chloride with either bicarbonate or oxalate&quot;. To the extent that &quot;strictly coupled&quot; implies 1:1 stoichiometry, the authors conclude Cl-/bicarbonate exchange is electroneutral based on its lack of exchange current. In contrast, the lack of Cl/oxalate exchange current does not lead the authors to the same conclusion of electroneutrality for Cl-/oxalate exchange. The data presented do not measure the stoichiometry of Cl-/oxalate exchange.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that our ACMA experiments do not strictly discriminate between coupled and uncoupled oxalate transport. However, it should be emphasized that, assuming that transport proceeds by an alternate access mechanism, uncoupled oxalate transport would require the change of the unloaded transporter between inward- and outward-facing conformations, which was shown to be unfavorable in Figure 1D.</p>
<p>We have reworded the sentence in the abstract to:</p>
<p>“Here we have determined the structure of the closely related human transporter SLC26A6 and characterized it as a coupled exchanger of chloride with bicarbonate and presumably also oxalate.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 264 claims that &quot;the paper's functional data has defined SLC26A6 as a coupled transporter that exchanges Cl- with either HCO3- or oxalate at equimolar stoichiometry.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have changed the sentence to:</p>
<p>“Whereas our functional data has defined SLC26A6 as a coupled antiporter that exchanges Cl- with HCO3- and presumably also oxalate with equimolar stoichiometry…”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In lines 299-302, the authors claim to have &quot;detected strict equimolar exchange of anions&quot;...leading to the reasonable conclusion of electroneutral Cl-/HCO3- exchange and the reasonable but unsupported conclusion of coupled Cl/oxalate exchange.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have reworded the sentence to:</p>
<p>“In the case of Cl-/HCO3- transport, we detect a strict equimolar exchange of anions binding to a conserved site in the mobile core domain of the transmembrane transport unit (Figure 4B, H). Although not shown unambiguously, we assume an analogous mechanism also for Cl-/oxalate exchange.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 505-508 in Methods claim that the AMCA proteoliposome assay &quot;measured electrogenic oxalate transport.&quot; However, the assay documented extracellular oxalate- dependent anion transport that was most simply interpreted as coupled exchange.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The assay has detected H+ uptake into proteoliposomes as a consequence of electrogenic anion influx. In these experiments, oxalate is the only anion on the outside of vesicles and it requires to be transported to be able to observe any fluorescent change. The claim of electrogenic oxalate transport is thus justified. As described above, the assay does under the applied conditions not discriminate between uncoupled and coupled oxalate transport, however uncoupled oxalate transport would require the conformational change of an unloaded transporter, which was shown to be kinetically disfavored.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In contrast, other parts of the manuscript acknowledge that the evidence presented falls short of documenting stoichiometric chloride/oxalate exchange.</p>
<p>Results Line 151 sets out to &quot;investigate a potentially electrogenic Cl-/oxalate exchanger. Similarly, results line 160 conservatively claims that Cl-/oxalate exchange occurs &quot;presumably&quot; with a 1:1 stoichiometry. This more accurate language needs to be used throughout the paper, replacing the more absolute but unjustified descriptions summarized earlier above.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now introduced the requested clarifications throughout.</p>

That paper (already cited) might be referred to more explicitly in connection to the authors' current findings of electroneutral Cl-/HCO3- exchange by human SLC26A6 as well as their inability to detect human SLC26A6-mediated Cl-/oxalate exchange current in HEK-293 whole cell recordings.</p>

<p>We now have included the reference in the discussion:</p>
<p>“Consequently, transport would be electroneutral in case of the monovalent HCO - and electrogenic in case of the divalent oxalate (Figure 1E-H), which was already proposed in a previous study (Chernova et al., 2005).   We also want to re-emphasize that the inability to measure discernable currents does not necessarily imply that the transport might not be electrogenic as, due to their slow kinetics, transport-mediated currents might be below the detection limit of patch-clamp electrophysiology.”</p>

<p>-  It would be helpful if the authors briefly clarify the depiction/scheme of the hypothetical SLC26A6 outward-facing conformation. Is this gleaned from a prior structure of a related SLC family or distant homolog? Functional data? Biochemical/biophysical data? As well, I would also recommend labeling this within the figure (Figure 3-figure supplement 1D labeling, for instance - inward, hypothetical outward).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned in the legend of Figure 3-figure supplement 1D, the outward conformation is hypothetical. We have also now mentioned this in the title. The displayed outward- conformation was constructed by manually moving the area depicting the core domain relative to the fixed gate domain.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  Have the authors attempted to block SLC26A6-mediated transport with the addition of a known inhibitor, such as niflumic acid? I understand that this may be technically challenging, but it would strengthen the transport assay data, especially in Figure 5D with the ACMA assay testing the SLC26A6 R404V mutant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have not attempted to block the currents by addition of niflumic acid.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  It could be helpful to the reader to move the schematics in Figure 1-figure supplement 1C into Figure 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now displayed the schematics illustrating the principle of the respective transport assays next to the data in Figure 1, but kept Figure 1-figure supplement 1C for a more detailed description of the assays.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  Figure 3-figure supplement 1D legend, should be &quot;hypothetical&quot; instead of &quot;hypothetic.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have introduced the correction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  I might consider coloring the Cl- ion something that is distinct from the model colors that are used in the figures (see Figure 4 and Figure 4-figure supplement 1). This would help to clarify Figure4-figure supplement 1H, where I believed that the Cl- ions at first were from the SLC26A6 model at first glance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have used the green color for chloride throughout the manuscript and would prefer to keep it that way for consistency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  Labeling in Figure 5 legend (E, F) do not match the Figure (F,G). The description of the ACMA assay is absent from the figure legend (the real Figure 5E).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This has been corrected.</p>

<p>None.  This  is  a  well-done  manuscript  and  I  have  no  further  suggestions.</p>
