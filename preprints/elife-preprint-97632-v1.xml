<title>Abstract</title><p>Excessive drinking poses serious health risks and is closely associated with oxidative damage. The KEAP1-NRF2-ARE axis serves as the primary antioxidant system. However, the existing small molecule inhibitors are all covalently bound to KEAP1, meaning that once bound, they are not easily dissociated, while continuous inhibition of KEAP1 exhibits severe side effects. In this study, BLI, CETSA, Pull-down, Co-IP and HDX-MS assay analysis were conducted to detect the KEAP1 binding behavior of natural product, capsaicin (CAP), both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in GES1 cells. The ethanol-induced acute gastric mucosal damage rat model was also established to determine the therapeutic effect of CAP. We demonstrated that CAP ameliorated mitochondrial damage, facilitated the nuclear translocation of NRF2, thereby promoting the expression of downstream antioxidant response elements, HO-1, Trx, GSS and NQO1 in GES1 cells. Subsequently, CAP could directly bind to KEAP1 and inhibit the interaction between KEAP1 and NRF2. While in the KEAP1-knockout 293T cells, CAP failed to activate NRF2 expression. It was also found that CAP non-covalently bound to Kelch domain and allosterically regulated three regions of KEAP1: L342-L355, D394-G423 and N482-N495. To enhance drug solubility and delivery efficiency, we designed IR-Dye800 modified albumin coated CAP nanoparticle. The nanoparticles significantly alleviated the gastric mucosal inflammation and activated the NRF2 downstream genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our work provided new insights that CAP is a safe and novel NRF2 agonist by allosterically regulating KEAP1, which may contribute to the development of lead drugs for oxidative stress-related illness, e.g. aging, cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<label>1</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ethanol (EtOH), commonly referred to alcohol in everyday life, is a fascinating ingredient found in beer, wine, and liquor. Excessive drinking poses great health risks and causes about 3 million deaths per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In 2016, the largest share of all deaths caused by alcohol consumption worldwide was due to digestive disorders (21.3%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Alcohol causes oxidative damage to gastric mucosa. Persistent and intensified oxidative stress, particularly reactive oxygen species (ROS), induces DNA damage, protein oxidation, and lipid peroxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Subsequently, it causes gastrointestinal dysfunction, chronic atrophic gastritis, and is closely related to the occurrence of gastric cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Natural products are key sources of drugs or lead compounds for treating major diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.Previous reports have shown that the incidence rate of gastric ulcer in Indians and Malaysians is quite low. Chili peppers appear more frequently in the cuisine of these two countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This raises doubts about whether chili peppers can alleviate gastric mucosal damage and further alleviate gastric ulcers. Currently, experiments conducted in rats have demonstrated that red pepper/capsaicin (CAP) had significant protective effects on ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage, and the mechanism may be related to the promotion of vasodilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, increased mucus secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, it is noteworthy that whether the antioxidant activity of CAP works has not been fully investigated.</p>
<p>The key transcription factor, Nuclear Factor erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (NRF2), is conventionally anchored in the cytoplasm by its binding partner, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). And the KEAP1-NRF2 signaling pathway is a fundamental line of defense against oxidative challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. More and more researchers focused on the development of non-covalent binding agents with KEAP1, which represents lower side effects and higher commercial value, but success stories are rare.</p>
<p>In this study, ethanol induced acute oxidative damage models were established <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the effects of CAP pretreatment on KEAP1-NRF2-ARE signaling cascade were verified. Conclusively, we used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to identify the allosteric regulatory sites after CAP treatment. CAP may emerge as a pioneering direct inhibitor of the KEAP1-NRF2 interaction, which also offering an in-depth understanding of its antioxidative defense mechanism.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Capsaicin protects GES-1 from oxidative stress</title>
<p>The molecular formula of CAP (PubChem CID: 1548943) was provided in <bold>Supplemental Figure 1a</bold>. Initially, an oxidative stress model was established in human gastric mucosal epithelial (GES-1) cells. According to the <italic>Lancet</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, WHO recommendation and US Standard Drink Sizes, that daily alcohol consumption should be limited to 1-2 standard cups/day (1 standard cup is equivalent to 10-14 g of pure ethanol in different countries), so cell models were tested at a similar concentration of 5%. A dose-dependent decline in cell viability upon exposure to EtOH was observed, with viability decreasing to approximately 50% after 1.5 hours of treatment with 5% EtOH <bold>(Supplemental Figure 1b)</bold>. To evaluate the protective effects of CAP, GES-1 model cells with pretreated with CAP for 2.5 hours before introducing EtOH. Results revealed that a pretreatment with 8 μM CAP significantly enhanced cell viability to 93.84% <bold>(Supplemental Figure 1c)</bold>. Notably, further increases in CAP concentration did not augment the protective effect, possibly due to cytotoxicity at higher concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup><bold>(Supplemental Figure 1d)</bold>. Then, three CAP concentrations (2, 8, and 32 μM) and three EtOH concentrations (0.5%, 3.5%, and 5%) on GES-1 were further valuated to establish a stable cell model <italic>in vitro</italic> <bold>(Supplemental Figure 1e-g)</bold>. Moreover, we assessed EtOH-induced apoptosis and found that the percentage of apoptotic cells was reduced from 28.85% to 13.95% in the group pretreated with 8 μM CAP, compared to the EtOH-only group <bold>(Supplemental Figure 1h)</bold>.</p>
<p>Then the morphological changes in GES-1 cells were examined. Cells in the EtOH-only group displayed a rounded morphology and showed a marked tendency for aggregation. In contrast, cells that were pretreated with 2 μM and 8 μM CAP largely retained their characteristic cellular shape <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>)</bold>. Then, we assessed ROS production using DCFH-DA staining. The EtOH-only group exhibited elevated levels of ROS, as indicated by increased green fluorescence, while the phenomenon was substantially diminished in CAP-pretreated groups <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>)</bold>. Flow cytometric analyses further corroborated this trend, revealing that intracellular ROS levels consistently declined (from 83.1±3.59% to 60.23±12.67% and finally to 48.9±5.55%) with incremental dosages of CAP (0, 2, and 8 μM) <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>)</bold>. To evaluate the impact of CAP on intracellular redox homeostasis, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. Our findings demonstrated that SOD levels were significantly upregulated following CAP treatment <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>)</bold>, while MDA production was markedly reduced <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>)</bold>. Collectively, these results suggest that CAP effectively attenuates ROS levels and modulates redox balance in GES-1 cells exposed to EtOH.</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>Capsaicin activates the NRF2/ARE signaling pathway</title>
<p>With analytical techniques such as network pharmacology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and single-cell sequencing, researchers identified pivotal target proteins implicated in the precursory lesions of gastric cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Based on the network targets analysis, CAP played a networked and modular role, including pathways and biological processes related to ROS, inflammation and immune <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>)</bold>. However, the specific mechanism of ROS regulation by CAP was still unclear, so we carried out proteomic analyses to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A comprehensive overview of these DEGs was presented in the heat map. Utilizing stringent criteria for statistical significance (Fold change ≥ 1.2, P value ≤ 0.05), analysis revealed that 120 proteins were significantly up-regulated, while 65 were down-regulated following CAP treatment <bold>(Supplementary Figure 2a)</bold>. Subsequent Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed on this pool of 185 DEGs <bold>(Supplementary Figure 2b and 2c)</bold>. As anticipated, the top-ranked terms in the ’Molecular Function’ category of the GO analysis included ’antioxidant activity’ (GO: 0016209) and ’oxidoreductase activity’ (GO: 0016491). Genes corresponding to these functional categories were highlighted in the volcano plot <bold>(Supplemental Figure 2d)</bold> and annotated in the heat map <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h</xref>)</bold>. Intriguingly, our findings demonstrated a significant elevation in the expression of key antioxidant-related proteins, such as glutathione synthase (GSS), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and thioredoxin (TXN, also known as Trx). These proteins were associated with previously reported antioxidant response elements (AREs) and function as downstream targets of the transcription factor NRF2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. We speculate that CAP may activate the NRF2-ARE signaling pathway in oxidative stress models.</p>
<p>To substantiate the hypothesis, we discovered that CAP notably augmented the expression levels of NRF2 and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1, also known as HO-1) in GES-1 cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1i</xref>)</bold>, which is a downstream gene regulated by NRF2. Concurrently, the elevated expression levels of GSS and Trx proteins, which were also downstream targets of NRF2, further validated by the proteomic analysis <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1j</xref>)</bold>. A grayscale quantification of these pivotal proteins was elaborated in <bold>Supplementary Figure 2e-h</bold>. Recognizing NRF2’s role as a transcriptional regulator, we further scrutinized the transcript levels of these essential target genes: TXN, HMOX1, and NQO1. It’s worth mentioning that NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) is also a classic target gene of NRF2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assays demonstrated that CAP significantly amplified the transcription of these antioxidant-associated genes <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1k</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>In a parallel experiment involving a hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced oxidative stress model in human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC), CAP pretreatment similarly boosted the transcription and protein expression levels of NRF2 and its downstream genes of TXN, HMOX1, and NQO1 <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1l</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1m</xref>)</bold>. A grayscale quantification of these pivotal proteins was also elaborated in <bold>Supplementary</bold> <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>. These collective findings suggested that CAP’s role in ROS mitigation was not confined to a specific cell type and it was worth exploring the underlying mechanisms.</p>

<label>2.3</label><title>Capsaicin promotes NRF2 to translocate into nucleus</title>
<p>Furthermore, we proceeded to investigate the subcellular localization of NRF2 following CAP pretreatment. Our findings revealed that CAP effectively facilitated the translocation of NRF2 into the nucleus. Specifically, 52.29% of NRF2 fluorescence was co-localized with the nuclear dye DAPI, as determined by analyses across three randomly selected fields of view for each sample group <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>)</bold>. To corroborate this observation, we conducted a nucleoplasm separation assay to quantify the expression levels of NRF2 in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>)</bold>. Grayscale analysis of the immunoblotting data further corroborated that the nuclear accumulation of NRF2 augmented with increasing concentrations of CAP treatment <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<label>2.4</label><title>Capsaicin inhibits the degradation of NRF2</title>
<p>NRF2 is known to undergo proteasomal degradation, so we employed PS-341, a renowned proteasome inhibitor, to selectively impede the 20S proteasome. Our data revealed that PS-341 independently elevated NRF2 expression levels. Moreover, when cells were co-incubated with both PS-341 and CAP, the overall NRF2 levels rose even further, which suggesting a synergetic effect of CAP and PS-341 on inhibiting NRF2 degradation and the mechanism of CAP may differ from that of PS-341 <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>To delve deeper into whether CAP influences the degradation phase of protein synthesis, we utilized actinomycin (CHX), a recognized inhibitor of protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref></bold>, CHX treatment led to a rapid decline in NRF2 protein levels, making it nearly undetectable approximately 30 minutes after addition. Conversely, NRF2 levels remained noticeably stable when co-incubated with CAP, implying that CAP may prolong the half-life of NRF2. These findings strengthen the notion that CAP boosts NRF2 stability by hindering its proteolytic degradation. In alignment with existing literature, which posits that K48 ubiquitination facilitates NRF2 degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, we carried out ubiquitin immunoprecipitation experiments. These indicated a modest reduction, approximately 17.57%, in K48 ubiquitination of NRF2 following CAP treatment <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<p>The mitochondria serve as the primary intracellular source of ROS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Initial exploratory studies focused on NRF2’s role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Our findings revealed a 21.76% decrease in average mitochondrial branch length following EtOH treatment. Remarkably, CAP pretreatment appeared to preserve the structural integrity of the mitochondria in GES-1 cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>)</bold>. We subsequently turned our attention to the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, ΔΨm), a key factor in sustaining mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and the subsequent production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Exposure to 5% EtOH for 10 minutes or to the positive control CCCP for 20 minutes led to comparable declines in ΔΨm, affecting approximately 30% of cells. Notably, pretreatment with 8 μM CAP ameliorated this reduction in ΔΨm <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2k</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2l</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>Typically, diminished levels of ATP serve as a hallmark of compromised mitochondrial function. To investigate this, we employed a luminescence detector to quantify both extracellular and intracellular ATP concentrations. The extracellular ATP levels surged to approximately three times in EtOH-only group than those of the control, while a corresponding sharp decrease was observed in intracellular ATP concentrations <bold>(Supplementary Figure 3a)</bold>. In striking contrast, CAP pretreatment effectively stabilized intracellular ATP levels, maintaining them at 96.65% of their original concentration <bold>(Supplementary Figure 3b)</bold>. Building on these observations, we assessed the end product of the glycolytic pathway, lactate (LA), as well as the transcription levels of key metabolic enzymes—pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). CAP treatment resulted in significant downregulation of both LA and the aforementioned enzymes, suggesting a potential metabolic reprogramming from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation <bold>(Supplementary Figure 3c-3f)</bold>. Previous studies have demonstrated that CAP can directly bind to and inhibit the activity of PKM2 and LDHA, subsequently attenuating inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Therefore, our findings highlighted the role of CAP in maintaining mitochondrial function and further reducing oxidative stress.</p>

<label>2.7</label><title>Knockout of KEAP1 affects the action of CAP</title>
<p>To investigate whether KEAP1 functions as a key target for the antioxidant properties mediated by CAP, KEAP1-knockout (KO) 293T cell lines were generated and performed validation studies using western blot <bold>(Supplementary Figure 4a)</bold>. Initially, we observed that CAP significantly activated the NRF2 and HO-1 in wild-type 293T cells, leading to a pronounced increase in cell viability <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>).</bold> This finding was consistent with observations made in GES-1 and UC-MSC cells. However, in KEAP1-KO cells, an innate resilience to oxidative stress was evident, likely due to the constitutive activation of endogenous NRF2 and its downstream effector, HO-1. As a result, the CCK8 assay revealed no significant differences in cell viability between the groups <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3i</xref>)</bold>, corroborating previous studies that KEAP1-KO mice exhibited reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.

<p>To probe the specific CAP-binding sites on KEAP1, we utilized computational docking and all-atom simulations, to map the positioning of possible CAP-interacting residues within the surface pockets of KEAP1, with particular focus on the Kelch domain responsible for NRF2 interaction <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref> and Supplementary Figure 5a)</bold>. The most energetically favorable model demonstrated that the vanillyl headgroup of CAP was inserted into the Kelch channel, while its flexible hydrocarbon chain remained at the periphery of the NRF2-Kelch interface. Based on this docking model, we hypothesized that the CAP binding pocket partially overlapped with the KEAP1-NRF2 interacting interface <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>)</bold>. Hence, we modeled interactions between NRF2 and Kelch in the presence of CAP using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.</p>
<p>When CAP associated with Kelch, the NRF2-Kelch complex was disrupted <bold>(Supplementary Figure 5b and 5c and supplementary videos 1 and 2)</bold>. Indeed, for the NRF2-Kelch complex, the average distance between the D29 of NRF2 and the R415 of Kelch kept around 1.20 nm, indicating stable bindings throughout the 100 ns trajectory. For the NRF2-CAP-Kelch complex, however, the average distance fluctuated to 2.87 nm, resulting in dissociated NRF2 around the Kelch domain <bold>(Supplementary Figure 5d and 5e)</bold>. Our simulations corroborated with the experimental observation that CAP can function as protein-protein interface inhibitors.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the majority of previously identified KEAP1 inhibitors were known to enact covalent modifications on the cysteine residues of KEAP1, thereby disrupting the interactions between KEAP1-Cul3 and KEAP1-NRF2, and consequently activating the downstream NRF2-ARE signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, we introduced the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) into the cell culture. Existing literature suggests that KEAP1’s active cysteines can be covalently altered by electrophilic agents like CN-2F, and such modifications are generally reversible in the presence of DTT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Additionally, the effectiveness of catechol moieties in NRF2 activation is often neutralized by pre-treatment with DTT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. However, our results indicated that the CAP-induced elevation of NRF2 expression levels was not inhibited by DTT <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>To further investigate whether CAP also forms covalent bonds with key cysteine residues on the KEAP1 surface, we targeted our scrutiny towards the functionally critical cysteines, such as Cys151, Cys273 and Cys288<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Employing tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), we assessed the molecular weights of KEAP1 samples following incubation with CAP and found no evidence of CAP-induced modifications <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>, and Supplementary Figure 6a-6d)</bold>. These results suggested that although CAP bound directly to KEAP1, it did not do so through covalent interaction.</p>

<label>2.10</label><title>CAP binds KEAP1 at allosteric sites</title>
<p>According to the results of molecular docking and dynamic simulation, we purified both the wild type Kelch domain (WT) and the mutated variant (Mut) of Kelch proteins. The mutated version involved substitutions at residues Y334A, R380A, N382A, N414A, R415A, Y572A, and S602A (the orthostatic site), which are residues reported to engage NRF2 and classic Keap1 inhibitors. Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) revealed that the binding affinity between CAP and the Kelch domain (WT) was 31.45 μM with R<sup>2</sup>=0.99 <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>)</bold>. Intriguingly, the mutated Kelch domain (Mut) exhibited diminished, but still appreciable, affinity for CAP with a K<sub>D</sub> of 102.4 μM with R<sup>2</sup>=0.98 <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>).</bold> Our biophysical examinations suggested the orthostatic NRF2-binding pocket was not entirely responsible for CAP-binding. Indeed, the Kelch (Mut)-Flag protein failed to pull down any NRF2 from cellular lysates, but it still interacted with CAP <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>)</bold>. These collective findings suggest that the CAP-binding pocket and the NRF2-binding interface on KEAP1 may be different from each other, implicating CAP as an allosteric modulator of KEAP1. This specificity may arise from the interaction between the vanillyl headgroup of CAP and the main chain atoms of the Kelch domain, which appears to be largely unaffected by NRF2 binding <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>)</bold>. The crystal structures depicting the binding sites between previously identified ligands and the Kelch protein (PDB: 4IQK and 5FNQ) were illustrated on the left-hand side of <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref></bold>. In contrast, the right-hand side revealed our discovery of the binding sites between CAP and the Kelch protein, which were very inconsistent with previous reports. Here, to explore the potential mechanism of allosteric regulation of the Kelch domain with CAP, we performed HDX-MS assays. The addition of CAP led to an increase in the hydrogen-deuterium exchange rate in about three regions of Keap1, L342-L355, D394-G423, and N482-N495, suggesting their conformational changes. It is noteworthy that amino acid residues N414 and R415 are located in the D394-G423 region, which are the key residues for the interaction with NRF2, and CAP binding may lead to their changes, thus CAP may have weakened the interaction between KEAP1 and NRF2 by way of allosteric regulation <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f</xref>).</bold> These insights suggested that CAP could potentially represent a novel class of NRF2 agonists.</p>

Notably, the size distributions of HSA@CAP and IR-HSA@CAP nanoparticles were remarkably consistent. The former exhibited an average particle size of 139.27 ± 7.49 nm <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>)</bold>, while the latter registered at approximately 160.97 ± 14.78 nm <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6e</xref>)</bold>. In terms of Zeta-potential, the HSA@CAP nanoparticles displayed an increase to −4.16 ± 0.78 mV post-formation, as compared to native HSA, which had a potential of −15.45 ± 1.40 mV. Interestingly, this Zeta-potential returned to a value of −10.55 ± 0.50 mV upon integration with IRDye800 in the IR-HSA@CAP <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6f</xref>)</bold>.</p>

The data revealed that CAP was predominantly processed through the gastrointestinal tract, exhibiting notable localization within the stomach <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6j</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6k</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>The administration of either CAP or IR-HSA@CAP alone did not result in noticeable damage to the gastric tissues, in contrast to the control group. However, significant hemorrhaging and erosion were evident in gastric tissues exposed to EtOH <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>, left)</bold>. Utilizing the Guth scoring system, we quantitatively assessed the Gastric Mucosa Ulcer Injury (UI) index. The average UI index in the EtOH group soared to 36.0, signifying acute tissue damage. On the other hand, remarkable reductions in the UI index were observed in both the CAP and IR-HSA@CAP pretreatment groups, registering at 7.0 and 5.3 respectively. These levels were roughly on par with the Rebamipide group, which had a UI index of 9 <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>, right)</bold>. These findings align well with our expectations. Notably, the effective dose of CAP (1 mg/kg) was substantially lower than that of Rebamipide (100 mg/kg), underscoring the potential advantages of CAP. Additionally, while the HSA-pretreated group did exhibit some attenuation of gastric mucosal injury, the reduction was not statistically significant (UI=17.7). This suggested that CAP was the principal active component responsible for the observed effects in the IR-HSA@CAP nanoparticles.</p>

<p>Subsequently, we quantified the extent of pathological damage using H&amp;E staining coupled with the Masuda scoring system, wherein a higher index reflects more severe tissue damage. The pathological damage index registered at 6.3 in the EtOH-only group, while the HSA-treated group showed a slightly lower index at 4.7. The CAP-treated group further reduced this index to 3.7. Remarkably, the employment of either IR-HSA@CAP nanoparticles or Rebamipide led to a substantial decline in pathological damage, with both treatments registering an identical index of 1.7 <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>)</bold>. These results demonstrate that the therapeutic efficacy of IR-HSA@CAP nanoparticles surpassed that of either CAP or HSA administered individually. Specifically, the reduction in tissue damage was 1.77-fold greater than that achieved with CAP alone and 2.88-fold greater compared to HSA alone.</p>
<p>To evaluate the capability of CAP to inhibit the EtOH-induced augmentation of ROS levels in gastric tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>, we conducted dihydroethidium (DHE) staining on cryo-sectioned gastric specimens. Pre-treatment with either CAP or IR-HSA@CAP nanoparticles substantially mitigated ROS production, with reductions of 45.42% and 36.99% respectively, compared to the EtOH-only group <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7c</xref>)</bold>. Concurrently, MDA assays underscored that IR-HSA@CAP nanoparticles efficaciously curtailed lipid peroxidation levels in the gastric tissues by an approximate 72.82% <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref>)</bold>. Additionally, CAT activity in the tissues was bolstered by 31.85% following treatment with IR-HSA@CAP nanoparticles (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref>)</bold>. Further molecular investigation involving reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays disclosed that CAP treatment markedly elevated the expression levels of intracellular HMOX1 and NQO1 genes, approximating a two-fold increase <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7f</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we scrutinized the modulatory effects of IR-HSA@CAP on the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway. Our findings, substantiated through immunohistochemistry <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8a-8c</xref>)</bold> and western blot analyses <bold>(Supplementary Figure 8j-8m)</bold>, revealed that pre-treatment with IR-HSA@CAP led to a significant upregulation of Nrf2 expression. Concurrently, IR-HSA@CAP pre-treatment also stimulated elevated expression levels of HO-1 and Trx. These collective observations suggest that IR-HSA@CAP was capable of orchestrating the Nrf2/ARE signaling axis, thereby providing a rapid and effective modulatory mechanism for oxidative stress and homeostatic balance. To delve deeper into the anti-inflammatory potential of our treatment strategy, we analyzed homogenized gastric tissue samples for the expression profiles of various chemokines and inflammatory mediators. Intriguingly, pre-treatment with either CAP or IR-HSA@CAP elicited a marked suppression in the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and CXCL1, while simultaneously augmenting the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8d</xref>).</bold> Not surprisingly, IR-HSA@CAP played a better anti-inflammatory effect.

<p>Finally, we assessed the biosafety of IR-HSA@CAP in rats through continuous oral administration over a one-week period <bold>(Supplementary Figure 8a)</bold>. No significant alterations were observed in the organ indices for either the liver or spleen (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8b and 8c)</bold>. Comprehensive blood biochemical analyses further revealed that varying concentrations of IR-HSA@CAP exerted no deleterious impact on hepatic function, as indicated by levels of ALT, AST, and T-Bil <bold>(Supplementary Figure 8d-f)</bold>, or on renal function, as evidenced by measurements of BUN, CRE, and UA <bold>(Supplementary Figure 8g-i)</bold>. These collective findings underscore the high biosafety profile of the IR-HSA@CAP nanoparticles.</p>

<label>3</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>CAP, a natural small molecule derived from chili peppers, has been identified and verified to modulate the KEAP1-NRF2-ARE pathway in our study. This signaling plays a key role in several cancerous and non-cancerous diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is a promising therapeutic target for combatting free radical damage associated with numerous conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, chronic kidney disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, cardiovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, cancer and aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, the scientific community has tirelessly sought molecules capable of activating NRF2. Hu et al. reported the first small-molecule inhibitor of the Keap1-Nrf2 PPI from a high-throughput screen (HTS) in 2013<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Davies and co-workers began with a crystallographic screen of approximately 330 fragments and developed KI-696 as a nanomolar KEAP1-NRF2 PPI inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. A spectrum of NRF2 agonists, both natural and synthetic, covalent and non-covalent, have been unveiled. However, Kim T. Tran et al. reported that many compounds are difficult to synthesize and the binding activity of half of the compounds cannot be demonstrated convincingly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Practical application faces two primary challenges. First and foremost, covalent modifications to KEAP1 pose a noteworthy concern regarding “off-target” effects owing to their electrophilic properties. These effects have the potential to impact various other cellular proteins, impeding their commercial success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Furthermore, unregulated activation of NRF2 can inadvertently foster cancer progression by shielding malignant cells and bolstering their proliferation, metastatic potential, and resistance to therapeutic interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent advancements have been geared towards the development of direct inhibitors for the KEAP1-NRF2 interaction, drawing significant attention from the scientific community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Interestingly, our research unequivocally identifies the non-covalent interaction between CAP and KEAP1. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a KEAP1-dependent NRF2 agonist, has progressed positively in phase III clinical trials. The recognition that DMF’s minimal side effects stem from its dual mode of action—both covalently modifying reactive cysteines and non-covalently activating NRF2 via the Kelch domain of KEAP1—has marked a pivotal milestone in the development of drugs targeting KEAP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We found that at lower concentrations, CAP effectively bound with the Kelch domain <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>)</bold> and activated NRF2, subsequently promoting the expression of downstream antioxidant genes <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1i-1m</xref>)</bold>. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies, we observed almost no adverse reactions. Additionally, Merritt, J.C. et al. reported that CAP at high concentrations possesses potent anti-cancer properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. This aligns with our CCK8 experimental findings that heightened CAP concentrations curtailed cell viability <bold>(Supplementary Figure 1c and 1d)</bold>. The duality of pharmacological impact of CAP remains a topic of discussion. The interplay and mechanisms between CAP’s varying modes in both regular and cancerous cells, which underlie its antioxidant and anticancer actions, are intricate and warrant further exploration.</p>
<p>Notably, to date, no natural product has been confirmed as a direct inhibitor of the KEAP1-NRF2 interaction. In our findings, the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) between CAP and Kelch was reported as 31.45 μM <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>)</bold>, a relatively weak association compared with ML334 (K<sub>D</sub>=1 μM) and some synthetically designed peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. However, the KEAP1-NRF2 interaction was significantly inhibited by CAP <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>)</bold>. Of particular significance and surprise, our investigation revealed that CAP and Kelch establish interactions at allosteric sites. Furthermore, HDX-MS was first used to identify the potential allosteric regulatory site of KEAP1 by natural small molecule. In particular, the deuterium exchange of the new peptide (D394-G423) we found was significantly increased, and it was also present in a newly screened natural small molecule and Kelch (data not shown). Our comprehensive analysis of the CAP-KEAP1 binding dynamics, particularly the unique mode of interaction with Kelch, offers valuable insights for the development of innovative NRF2 activators.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, several concerns warrant further examination. The impact of CAP on the gastric mucosa, as evidenced in animal studies, is contingent upon its dosage and duration of administration. A low dose of CAP applied short-term can mitigate indomethacin-induced gastric microhemorrhage. Conversely, a high dose applied prophylactically over an extended period does not confer this benefit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. It was similarly observed in our studies, where the effective concentration window for natural CAP is a little narrow. For individuals with pre-existing gastric conditions, the epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa might exhibit heightened sensitivity to CAP. This not only diminishes its protective capability but might also exacerbate ulcer severity. Concurrently, the IR-HSA@CAP NPs we employed demonstrated prompt gastric release <italic>in vivo</italic>, underscoring the superior attributes of nanomedicine. This could amplify the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potency of CAP, thereby resulting in enhanced therapeutic outcomes. Yet challenges persist, not least the inability to achieve a treatment that targets the stomach exclusively. Considering ongoing research into nanomaterials for CAP, there’s scope to further refine CAP’s delivery strategy from a pharmacological standpoint.</p>
<p>In summary, the present study provides evidence that CAP effectively mitigates oxidative stress through the activation of NRF2 and its non-covalent binding to KEAP1’s Kelch domain. The unique binding site between CAP and Kelch sets it apart from the commonly reported small molecule inhibitors, hinting at its potential as a novel class of NRF2 agonists. Moving forward, the development of derivatives inspired by CAP holds promise as a compelling avenue for the creation of therapeutic agents aimed at attenuating oxidative damage.</p>

Then, 1 μM pepsin solution was added for digestion. At 2 minutes, the sample was placed into a Thermo-Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system autosampler for injection.</p>
<p>For LC-MS/MS analysis, the peptides were separated by a 20 min gradient elution at a flow rate 115 µl/min with a Thermo-Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system, which was directly interfaced with a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer. Peptides were separated on a reverse phase column (Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column 1.7 µm, 2.1*50 mm, Waters, UK). Mobile phase consisted of 1% formic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of 100% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid. The Q Exactive mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent acquisition mode using Xcalibur 2.0.0.0 software and there was a single full-scan mass spectrum in the orbitrap (350-2000 m/z, 70,000 resolution). The mass spectrometer was operated at a source temperature of 250 °C and a spray voltage of 3.0 kV. Peptic peptides were identified using an in-house Proteome Discoverer (Version PD1.4, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA).</p>
<p>The search criteria were as follows: no enzyme was required; two missed cleavage was allowed; precursor ion mass tolerances were set at 20 ppm for all MS acquired in an orbitrap mass analyzer; and the fragment ion mass tolerance was set at 0.02 Da for all MS2 spectra acquired. The peptide false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using Percolator provided by PD. When the q value was smaller than 1%, the peptide spectrum match (PSM) was considered to be correct. FDR was determined based on PSMs when searched against the reverse, decoy database. Peptides only assigned to a given protein group were considered as unique. The false discovery rate (FDR) was also set to 0.01 for protein identifications. The deuterium exchange levels were determined by subtracting the centroid mass of undeuterated peptide from the centroid mass of deuterated peptide using HDExaminer (Version PD1.4, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study suggests that capsaicin nanoparticle administration in rats activates the transcription factor Nrf2 by directly binding to its repressor KEAP1, leading to cytoprotective gene induction, and preventing alcohol-induced gastric damage, an avenue to treat alcoholism-related gastric disorders. The evidence is currently <bold>incomplete</bold> as there is no experimental proof that capsaicin exerts its cytoprotective effects via Nrf2, and not via any of its multiple known pharmacological effects. In particular, Nrf2-deficient mice should be used to show that Nrf2 is causal to the cytoprotective effect, and better controls should be provided for the direct KEAP2-capsaicin interaction, given the high concentrations used.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper by Gao et al. describes the effect of capsaicin on the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway. The authors carried out a set of in vitro experiments that addressed the mechanisms of the protective effect of capsaicin on ethanol-induced cytotoxicity. They also conducted in vivo studies in rats focusing on ethanol-induced gastric mucosal oxidative damage. The authors conclude that capsaicin activates NRF2, which leads to the induction of cytoprotective genes, preventing oxidative damage. This effect has already been shown, and it is well established that capsaicin activates NRF2, but what can be novel in the paper is the demonstration that capsaicin may directly bind to KEAP1 and that it is a noncovalent modification of the Kelch domain. The authors also designed new albumin-coated capsaicin nanoparticles, which were tested for the therapeutic effect in vivo. Apart from novelty concerns, the manuscript may be potentially interesting, but in my opinion, it is not fully technically sound, which weakens the strength of the evidence.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>For studies investigating capsaicin binding to KEAP1, the authors used capsaicin concentrations that are toxic to cells (Figures S1D and 4F, G). In vivo studies were performed only in 3 rats per group. The T-test was used for the comparison of more than two groups. Given the well-known issues with the specificity of the NRF2 antibody, the authors should provide appropriate controls, especially for IF and IHC staining.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors wanted to show that capsaicin can disrupt the interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2 by directly binding to Keap1 at an allosteric site. The resulting stabilization of Nrf2 would protect CAP-treated gastric cells from alcohol-induced redox stress and damage as well as inflammation (both in vitro and in vivo).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>One major strength of the study is the use of multiple methods (CoIP, SPR, BLI, deuterium exchange MS, CETSA, MS simulations, target gene expression) that consistently show for the first time that capsaicin can disrupt the Nrf2/Keap1 interaction at an allosteric site and lead to stabilization and nuclear translocation of Nrf2.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One major weakness of the study is that plausibility is taken as proof for causality. The finding that capsaicin directly binds to Keap1 and releases Nrf2 from its fate of degradation (in vitro) is taken for granted as the sole explanation for the observed improved gastric health upon alcohol exposure (in vivo). There is no consideration or exclusion of any potential unrelated off-target effect of capsaicin, or proteins other than Nrf2 that are also controlled by Keap1.</p>
<p>Another point that hampers full appreciation of the capsaicin effect in cells is that capsaicin is not investigated alone, but mostly in combination with alcohol only.</p>
<p>Bottom Line:</p>
<p>Overall, the authors are convincing that capsaicin (although weakly) binds to Keap1 and releases Nrf2 from degradation. With this, the authors provide a significant finding with marked relevance for the redox/Nrf2 as well as natural products /hit discovery communities. Moreover, the employed toolbox of different complementary methodologies can set the bar for future PPI inhibitor studies. The translation of this novel finding in a biological setting (alcohol-stressed gastric cells) still leaves some open questions and concerns. These concerns mainly arise from lacking control experiments and/or somewhat biased conclusions from the obtained data sets.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper by Gao et al. describes that capsaicin (CAP) might act as a novel NRF2 agonist capable of suppressing ethanol (EtOH)-induced oxidative damage in the gastric mucosa by disrupting the KEAP1-NRF2 interaction. Initially, the authors established and validated a cell model for EtOH-induced oxidative stress which they used to experiment with different CAP concentrations and to determine changes in a variety of parameters such as cell morphology, ROS production, status of redox balance to mitochondrial function, amongst others.</p>
<p>The proposed mechanism by which CAP activates NRF2 and mitigates oxidative stress is thought to be via non-covalent binding to the Kelch domain of KEAP1. A variety of assays such as BLI, CETSA, Pull-down, Co-IP, and HDX-MS were employed to investigate the KEAP1 binding behavior of CAP both in vitro and in GES1 cells. Consequently, the authors developed in vivo nanoparticles harboring CAP and tested those in a rat model. They found that pretreatment with the CAP-nanoparticles led to significant upregulation of NRF2 and subsequent effects on pro- (suppression of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and CXCL1) and anti-inflammatory (activation of IL-10) cytokines pointing to a resolved state of inflammation and oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work comprises a comprehensive approach with a variety of in vitro assays as well as cell culture experiments to investigate CAP binding behaviour to KEAP1. In addition, the authors employ in vivo validation by establishing an ethanol-induced acute gastric mucosal damage rat model and providing evidence of the potential therapeutic effect of CAP.</p>
<p>The study further provides novel insights into the mode of CAP action by elucidating the mechanism by which CAP promotes NRF2 expression and downstream antioxidant target gene activation.</p>
<p>The design of IR-Dye800 modified albumin-coated CAP nanoparticles for enhanced drug solubility and delivery efficiency demonstrates a valuable practical application of the research findings.</p>
<p>In summary, the study's findings suggest that CAP could be a safe and novel NRF2 agonist with implications for the development of lead drugs for oxidative stress-related diseases. Collectively, the data support the significance and potential impact of CAP as a therapeutic agent for oxidative stress-related conditions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms and in vivo effects of CAP, further clinical studies are needed to validate its efficacy and safety in human subjects. The study primarily focuses on the acute effects of CAP on ethanol-induced gastric mucosa damage. Long-term studies are necessary to assess the sustained therapeutic effects and potential side effects of CAP treatment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the study primarily focuses on the interaction between CAP and the KEAP1-NRF2 axis in the context of ethanol-induced gastric mucosa damage. It may be beneficial to explore the broader effects of CAP on other pathways or conditions related to oxidative stress. CAP has been known for its interaction with the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel and subsequent NRF2 signaling pathway activation. Those receptors are also expressed within the gastric mucosa and could potentially cross-react with CAP leading to the observed outcome. Including experiments to investigate this route of activation could strengthen the present study.</p>
<p>While the design of CAP nanoparticles is innovative, further research is needed to optimize the nanoparticle formulation for enhanced efficacy and targeted delivery to specific tissues.</p>
<p>Addressing these weaknesses through additional research and clinical trials can strengthen the validity and applicability of CAP as a therapeutic agent for oxidative stress-related conditions.</p>
