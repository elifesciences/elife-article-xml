<title>Abstract</title><p>Ammonia is a morphogen in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and is known to arise from the catabolism of proteins and RNA. However, we show that extracellular adenosine deamination catalyzed by adenosine deaminase related growth factor (ADGF), is a major source of ammonia and demonstrate a direct role of ammonia in tip organizer development. The tip formed during early development in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> is functionally similar to the embryonic organizer of higher vertebrates. <italic>adgf</italic> mutants fail to establish an organizer and this could be reversed by exposing the mutants to volatile ammonia. Interestingly, bacteria physically separated from the <italic>adgf<sup>−</sup></italic> mounds in a partitioned dish also rescues the mound arrest phenotype suggesting a cross kingdom interaction driving development. Both the substrate, adenosine and the product, ammonia regulate <italic>adgf</italic> expression, and <italic>adgf</italic> acts downstream of the histidine kinase <italic>dhkD</italic> in regulating tip formation. Thus, the consecutive transformation of extracellular cAMP to adenosine, and adenosine to ammonia are integral steps during <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development. Remarkably, in higher vertebrates, <italic>adgf</italic> expression is elevated during gastrulation and thus adenosine deamination may be an evolutionarily conserved process driving organizer development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During early embryonic development, organizers play an important role in patterning and directing the differentiation of surrounding cells into specific tissues and organs. The embryonic organizer establishes the developmental polarity in vertebrates and similarly, the mound/slug tip in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> act as organizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Rubin and Robertson, 1975</xref>) playing a pivotal role in guiding collective cell migration and patterning. Despite numerous investigations on <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> tip formation, the processes by which the tip establishes and maintains the primary developmental axis remains elusive. Gaining insights into the mechanisms regulating tip organizer function will offer a valuable understanding of the orchestrated cell movements and intricate processes underlying development.</p>
<p>Study of the social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> has helped us to better understand many fundamental problems about development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Annesley and Fisher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Müller-Taubenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Dunn et al., 2018</xref>; Martín-González et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Huber et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> has demonstrated its value in a range of applications, including the investigation of human diseases ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Eichinger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Müller-Taubenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Storey et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> are free living, amoeboid, soil protists and alternate their life cycle between unicellular and multi- cellular stages. The amoebae prey on bacteria and upon starvation, the cells aggregate gradually forming a tipped multicellular mound. The mound further develops to form a slug which undergoes differentiation and morphogenesis to form a fruiting body consisting of a dead stalk supporting a ball of spores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Raper, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Kessin, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Diffusible molecules such as cAMP, adenosine, ammonia, and a chlorinated hexaphenone ‘differentiation-inducing factor’ (DIF) regulate multicellular development in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bloom and Kay, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">Williams, 1988</xref>; Gross, 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Mahadeo and Parent, 2006</xref>; Shu et al., 2006). The gradient of these morphogens along the slug axis determines the cell fate, either as prestalk (pst) or as prespore (psp) cells. cAMP regulates PKA activity, adenosine signaling, and morphogenetic cell movements to control tip development in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Mann and Firtel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Siegert and Weijer, 1995</xref>). Adenosine, a by-product of cAMP hydrolysis, acts as an inhibitory morphogen suppressing additional tip formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schaap and Wang, 1986</xref>), however the mechanism involved in tip formation is not completely understood.</p>
<p>Adenosine deaminase (ADA) or its isoforms regulate adenosine homeostasis by catalysing the breakdown of adenosine to generate inosine and ammonia, and are conserved among bacteria, invertebrates, vertebrates including mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cristalli et al., 2001</xref>). Two isoforms of ADA are known in humans including ADA1 and ADA2 and ADGF shares a structural similarity to ADA2. ADA2 is associated with the activation of lymphocytes that play a role in the immune response to infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Marone et al., 1980</xref>). Absence of ADA2 activity results in the build-up of deoxyadenosine and its phosphorylated metabolite, dATP that is toxic to lymphoid precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Notarangelo, 2016</xref>). Consequently, complete ADA2 deficiency is characterized by lymphopenia and severe combined immuno-deficiency disorder (SCID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gaspar, 2010</xref>). The loss-of-function mutations in <italic>adgf/ada2</italic> in humans also manifest in a variety of vascular and inflammatory symptoms, including early-onset of stroke and systemic vasculopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>ada2</italic> disruption in mice leads to liver dysfunction and perinatal mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Wakamiya et al., 1995</xref>) and transgenic overexpression of ADA2 in mice results in aberrant heart and kidney development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Riazi et al., 2005</xref>). Absence of <italic>adgf/ada2</italic> in frogs manifests in reduced body size with altered polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Iijima et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, six ADGFs have been identified and are reported to promote cell proliferation by depleting extracellular adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c152">Zurovec et al., 2002</xref>). Loss of function of <italic>adgfA</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> promotes melanotic tumour formation and larval death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Dolezal et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, tRNA adenosine deaminase 3 (<italic>tad3</italic>) is necessary for telomere length homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bose et al., 2020</xref>). Adenosine deaminases are known to interact with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP), CD26 (cluster of differentiation 26) expressed on T-cells and the adenosine receptor, A2AR (expressed on dendritic cells) to facilitate cell-cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Moreno et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, <italic>adgf</italic> plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell proliferation and development in several organisms.</p>
<p>Four isoforms of ADA are annotated in the <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Eichinger et al., 2005</xref>) including adenosine deaminase (<italic>ada</italic>; DDB_G0287371), adenosine deaminase acting on tRNA-1 (DDB_G0278943), adenosine deaminase tRNA-specific (DDB_G0288099) and adenosine deaminase-related growth factor (<italic>adgf</italic>; DDB_G0275179), and their role in growth and development is not known. In this study, we examined the role of <italic>adgf</italic> during multicellular development in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and demonstrate that ammonia derived from adenosine deamination is directly involved in tip organizer development.</p>

<title>Differential regulation of <italic>adgf</italic> expression during growth and development</title>
<p>To verify the blasticidin <italic>(bsr)</italic> insertion in <italic>adgf <sup>-</sup></italic>, a diagnostic PCR was carried out and the integration was validated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), and qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the absence of <italic>adgf</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In vertebrates, adenosine deaminases are expressed in a tissue specific manner to control growth and development. To know if <italic>adgf</italic> expression is differentially regulated during development in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, qRT-PCR was performed using RNA obtained from different stages of development. The time point of analysis includes 0 h, 8 h, 12 h, 16 h, 20 h and 24 h. <italic>adgf</italic> expression peaks at 16 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) implying an important role for <italic>adgf</italic> later in development. At this time point, the expression of the other three isoforms of ADA were not significantly different from WT, suggesting that they do not compensate for the loss of <italic>adgf</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Dictyostelium</italic> ADGF shares a strong structural similarity with human ADA2</title>
<p>The <italic>D. discoideum adgf</italic> gene is predicted to encode a protein of 543 long amino acids and belongs to the metallo-transferase superfamily (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), containing a ADA domain and an N- terminal domain similar to human ADA2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).

<p><italic>D. discoideum</italic> ADGF (DdADGF) shares 37.47% identity with human ADA2. ADGF is present in other social amoeba, sharing a sequence similarity of 59.5% with <italic>Dictyostelium fasciculatum</italic>, 61.2% with <italic>Dictyostelium pupureum,</italic> 53.6% with <italic>Dictyostelium lacteum</italic> and 62.1% with <italic>Polysphondylium pallidum</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org">www.uniprot.org</ext-link>). Multiple sequence alignment reveals the presence of an N-terminal signal sequence characteristic of extracellular proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) and conserved histidine and glutamine residues in the active site of both <italic>D. discoideum</italic> ADGF and human ADA2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>The phylogenetic relation of ADGF to the classic ADA subfamily has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Maier et al., 2005</xref>). To determine the evolutionary relationship of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> ADGF with that of other organisms, a phylogenetic analysis was carried out and the alignment was created using MEGAX software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). The evolutionary history of ADGF was inferred using a Maximum Likelihood approach with Bootstrap analysis (100 iterations) as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Felsenstein (1985)</xref>. The resulting phylogenetic tree indicated that DdADGF is closely related to the ADGF proteins of other Dictyostelid members, including D. purpureum, Heterostelium pallidum, and Cavenderia fasciculata. <italic>D. discoideum</italic> ADGF forms a distinct clade, likely representing a distant relative of its vertebrate homolog (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Additionally, the structure of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> ADGF was predicted by homology modeling with AlphaFold (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/">https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/</ext-link>), using the crystal structure of human ADA2, CECR1 (Cat eye syndrome critical region protein 1) as a template (PDB-3LGD) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F-H</xref>). Alignment of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> ADGF with human ADA2 yielded an RMSD value of 1.003 Å, indicating strong structural similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Eidhammer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Koehl, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>adgf</italic> controls aggregate size in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic></title>
<p>To understand the role of <italic>adgf</italic> during <italic>D. discoideum</italic> development, mutant lines with lesions in the gene <italic>adgf</italic> were plated at a density of 5x10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> on non-nutrient phosphate buffered agar plates (pH 6.4) and monitored thereafter. In comparison to WT (37.6 ± 2.7 mm<sup>2</sup>), the aggregates of <italic>adgf<sup>−</sup></italic> were larger in size (62.6 ± 5.4 mm<sup>2</sup>; p value = 0.0003), and thus the number of aggregates formed by the mutants were fewer (39.67 ± 3.703) than the WT (67.00 ± 2.543) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To determine the pathways that are affected impairing the tissue size in the mutant, RNA expression of countin (<italic>ctn</italic>) and small aggregates (<italic>smlA</italic>) were examined and their levels were found to be reduced significantly compared to controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Countin factor (CF) regulates group size by reducing the expression of cell-cell adhesion proteins cadherin (<italic>cadA</italic>) and contact site A (<italic>csaA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Siu et al., 1985</xref>). The expression of <italic>cadA, csaA</italic> and cell-cell adhesion were also quantified and the mutants displayed enhanced <italic>cadA</italic> and <italic>csaA</italic> expression and higher cell-to-cell contacts than the WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>) suggesting that <italic>adgf</italic> regulates the overall size of the aggregates.</p>

<p>cAMP chemotaxis significantly influences cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Konijn et al., 1967</xref>) and to know if chemotaxis is impaired in the mutant, an under-agarose chemotaxis assay was carried out.

After 3.5 h of the addition of ADA enzyme (10 U) to the buffered solution containing adenosine, a full rescue was observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), strongly indicating that volatile ammonia generated from adenosine deamination alone is rescuing the defect.

<p>ADA catalyses the conversion of adenosine/deoxy adenosine respectively to inosine/ deoxy inosine.

<title><italic>Dictyostelium</italic> ADGF is likely to be secreted growth factor</title>
<p>Multiple sequence alignments, experiments with conditioned media and cell type reconstitution with WT suggests that ADGF is a secreted molecule.

The human ADA2 enzyme belongs to the novel family of ADGF and crystal structure of ADA2 reveal the presence of a catalytic- and two unique ADA2-specific domains with novel folds, responsible for protein dimerization and interaction with cell surface receptors. Furthermore, the presence of a number of N-glycosylation sites, conserved disulfide bond, and a signal peptide in ADA2 indicate that ADA2 is specifically adapted to function in the extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c150">Zavialov et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Enhanced cell adhesion influences cohesion and can impact the mound size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Roisin-Bouffay et al., 2000</xref>).

<title>Role of ammonia during <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development</title>
<p>During early development in <italic>Dictyostelium,</italic> ammonia is known to inhibit aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Schindler and Sussman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Williams et al., 1984</xref>), affect aggregate territory size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Thadani et al., 1977</xref>), aggregate density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Feit, 1988</xref>), cell fate (Gross et al., 1988), culmination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Davies et al., 1993</xref>), and fruiting body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Lonski, 1976</xref>). Ammonia is essential for differentiation in submerged clumps (Sternfeld and David, 1979) and favours prolonged slug migration called ‘slugging’ over culmination and influences psp over pst differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Newell et al., 1969</xref>). Ammonia plays a crucial role in orienting cell masses and accelerating the movement of aggregating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bonner et al., 1986</xref>). Enzymatic removal of ammonia causes the quick transition from slug to fruiting thus controlling the morphogenetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Schindler and Sussman, 1977</xref>). By suppressing DIF biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Neave et al., 1983</xref>), ammonia favors psp over pst development in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Davies et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Riley and Barclay, 1990</xref>). Further, ammonia prevents the developmental transition of slugs to fruiting bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bradbury and Gross, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">Wang and Schaap, 1989</xref>). It is interesting to note that ammonia induces tip development (as in <italic>adgf</italic> mutants), but subsequently, tips move away from a source of ammonia. Migration of slugs/ fruiting bodies away from ammonia, reflects a process by which fruiting bodies position themselves from other structures to increase the possibility of spore dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Kosugi and Inouye, 1989</xref>). Ammonia by enhancing the collective movement of cells is believed to exert negative chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bonner et al., 1986</xref>). Ammonia is known to inhibit tip formation in slugger mutants, but in strains such as NC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Gee et al., 1994</xref>), ammonia exerts no effect on tip formation as in AX4 (data not shown). The highly acidic, autophagic vesicles in pst cells (Gross, 2009) are believed to catalyze the breakdown of proteins and RNA, also generating ammonia.</p>
<p>ADGF and its substrate, adenosine could serve as a localized source of ammonia. Indeed, cells carrying high ATP, its derivatives cAMP (Bargoda et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Singer et al., 2019</xref>) and adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schaap and Wang, 1986</xref>), end up in the tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Hiraoka et al., 2022</xref>). Further, 5’- nucleotidase promoter activity is high in pstAB cells (Ubeidat et al., 2002) that significantly covers the tip region suggesting high adenosine levels in the tip. However, extracellular 5’-AMP can be derived from multiple sources such as hydrolysis of cAMP, ATP and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Carpousis et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>As a gas, ammonia can diffuse generating a gradient; high in the slug front compared to the posterior. Our results (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) also show that the amount of ammonia released from adenosine is in the same order of magnitude as that from other sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c149">Yoshino et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>adgf</italic> mutants, ammonia levels may not be sufficient enough to neutralize the acidic vesicles and hence, NR staining is intense in the pst region and the ALCs (Bonner, 1952). Thus, excess acidification if not neutralized may lead to mound arrest and if ammonia acts on the acidic vesicles, then, collective migration of cells leading to tip formation may be favoured.</p>
<p>Ammonia is crucial in regulating differentiation, metabolism, and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Liu et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Stein et al., 2013</xref>).

However, some of these experiments use ammonium carbonate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Schindler and Sussman, 1977</xref>), or ammonium chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Williams et al., 1984</xref>), as a source of ammonia and the possibility of carbonate and chloride ions interfering with development cannot be ruled out. In slugs, ammonia is shown to exert very little effect on cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Schaap et al., 1995</xref>). In <italic>Dictyostelium mucoroides,</italic> high ammonia levels are known to block the production of extracellular cAMP. The effect of volatile ammonia on aggregation seems to be species specific notably in <italic>P. violaceum, P. pallidum, and D. mucoroides</italic> resulting in wider aggregation territories, while it was not observed in other species such as <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and <italic>D. purpureum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bonner and Hoffman, 1963</xref>).</p>
<p>Adenylate cyclase (AC) activity is regulated by various factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Steer, 1975</xref>). At physiological levels, ammonium ions increase AC activity in the rat brain by 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c148">Yeung et al., 1989</xref>), but lowered its activity in the liver by about 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c141">Wiechetek et al., 1979</xref>). Ammonia has been shown to increase the activity of AC-G in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> sori (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Cotter et al., 1999</xref>). High ammonia levels by altering the pH, can affect the activity of numerous enzymes whose activity is pH dependent and thus the activity of AC can be impacted by pH variations. <italic>adgf</italic> mutants with low ammonia levels have reduced cAMP levels and a gradual increase in ammonia, cause a steady but significant increase in <italic>aca</italic>A expression. In other systems (Rat brain), ammonia is known to interact with manganese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Rivera-Mancía et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Lu et al., 2020</xref>) and this divalent cation is known to increase <italic>aca</italic>A expression in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Loomis et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Khachatrian et al., 1987</xref>). Possibly, ammonia interacts with metal ions like manganese to form ‘ammine complexes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Lipkowski and Galus, 1973</xref>), particularly in aqueous environments or under specific conditions where the appropriate ligands are available and enhances cAMP levels thus rescuing the mound defects of the mutant.</p>
<p>The decision between the formation of the tip (pst cells) and the ALCs are controlled by the tip’s production of ammonia, which prevents the migration of ALCs towards the tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Sternfeld and David, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Feit et al., 1990</xref>). Consistent with this observation, our results show that <italic>adgf</italic> mutant lines that have low ammonia levels exhibit enhanced <italic>ecmA</italic> and <italic>ecmB</italic> marker expression. Mutants impaired in DIF-1 synthesis fail to develop pst-O cells in the slug and subsequently also fail to form the basal disc in the fruiting body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Thompson and Kay, 2000</xref>). Similar to our observations of cells with high adenosine occupying the tip of the slug, cells with high ATP (that degrades to adenosine) levels, also end up in the centre of the tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Hiraoka et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Tip organizer development in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> depends on the differentiation and appropriate sorting of pst and psp cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Kay et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c145">Williams et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Saxe et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">Williams, 2006</xref>), a process that relies on signaling of different morphogens including cAMP, adenosine, DIF and ammonia (Bloom and Kay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">Williams, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Riley and Barclay, 1990</xref>; Gross et al., 1994; 2006). These morphogens modify one another’s effects, and determine the choice of the differentiation pathway as well as the spatial arrangement of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bloom and Kay, 1988</xref>). Thus, the rescue of the <italic>adgf</italic> mutant upon exposure to ammonia is likely due to cAMP signaling and cell-cell contact.</p>

<title>Possible reasons for reduced cAMP levels in the <italic>adgf</italic> mutant</title>
<p>The increased expression of PDE’s (intra and extracellular) and reduced ACA expression could well explain the lower cAMP levels in the mutant. ADA significantly regulates adenosine levels, thus reducing the activation of adenosine-mediated receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Van Haastert, 1983</xref>). Two classes of adenosine receptors including adenosine alpha- and beta-receptors are known to be expressed in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Theibert and Devreotes, 1984</xref>). When adenosine concentrations are high, beta- receptors bound with adenosine inhibit the binding of cAMP to its receptors, thereby inhibiting cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Newell, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Van Haastert, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Theibert and Devreotes, 1984</xref>). High adenosine levels in the <italic>adgf</italic> mutant may also reduce cAMP levels via a similar mechanism.</p>
<p><italic>adgf</italic> activity is likely to be different between pst and psp cells as reconstitution with different cell types shows that cells with low adenosine and high ammonia levels end up in psp while cells with excess adenosine and low ammonia attain pst cell fate.

<title>Distorted cAMP waves in mutant</title>
<p>Collective cell movement within mounds is essential for cell sorting and the progression from mounds to finger structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Kellerman and McNally, 1999</xref>). In WT mounds, cAMP waves propagate in a spiral pattern, while in mutants, waves propagate in a concentric circular pattern. Initially, cAMP waves appear as concentric circles that, upon symmetry breaking, form spiral waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Siegert and Weijer, 1995</xref>). With successive wave propagation, the circular ring distorts, and one end curls toward the pulsatile center, creating a spiral wave around the organizing center. In <italic>adgf</italic> mutants, however, defective cAMP relay prevents this transition, likely due to lower cAMP levels. A surge in phosphodiesterase inhibition is thought to regulate this shift from concentric to spiral wave propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Palsson and Cox, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The mound/slug tip of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> generates cAMP pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Traynor et al., 1992</xref>), and is known to suppress additional tip formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Farnsworth, 1973</xref>).

<p>High extracellular cAMP at the slug front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Singer et al., 2019</xref>) is expected to generate high adenosine, which however could arise from other sources and thus ammonia levels are expected to be higher in the slug front compared to the back.

It is important to note that ammonia is known to promote psp than pst differentiation. Although ammonia is likely to be formed from several sources in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, a critical threshold concentration of ammonia may be necessary for tip development.

Previous work in other systems have found ADA to be interacting with CD 26 (dpp IV) (Tanaka, 1993) and docking DdADGF with AprA (dpp8) (Figure S8B) also support the observations. However, adding ADA inhibitor to <italic>aprA</italic> mutant (dpp8), show no effect on the phenotype (data not shown).</p>
<p>Organisms from different kingdoms often interact in complex ways such as symbiosis, predation, competition etc., which can have significant effects on ecosystem dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Helgason et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Harrison, 2005</xref>). Such interactions are often mediated through volatiles affecting the physiology of each other just like the bacterial volatiles affecting the development of <italic>Dictyostelium.</italic> However, it needs to be ascertained if this particular volatile is ammonia.</p>

<title>Genes involved in autophagy and tipped mound formation do not show altered expression in the mutant</title>
<p>Autophagy helps maintain cellular homeostasis by promoting the breakdown of damaged proteins and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Mizushima et al., 2008</xref>), and ammonia is recognised to be a diffusible regulator of autophagy in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Eng et al., 2010</xref>). To investigate if autophagy is impaired in the mutant, the expression of autophagy markers <italic>atg8</italic> and <italic>atg18</italic> were examined and there was no discernible change in the expression levels when compared to WT (Figure S9A). The tipless to tipped mound transition as well as late developmental gene expression is regulated by <italic>gbf</italic>A, a G-box binding factor (GBF). However, in the <italic>adgf</italic> mutant the <italic>gbf</italic>A expression levels were comparable with no significant difference between the WT at 16 h (Figure S9B). Without the assay for autophagy as well as assay for GBF activity, these expression studies alone are not conclusive to rule out the role of these factors in tip formation.</p>

<title>ADA does not deaminate cytokinin</title>
<p>ADA is known to interact with 5’AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Hanif et al., 2022</xref>) and in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, 5′-AMP serves as a direct precursor of cytokinin, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Taya et al., 1978</xref>). Although docking studies suggest that binding of ADGF with cytokinins (zeatin, dihydrozeatin, isopentenyl adenine) is moderate, (data not shown), we carried a functional assay by mixing cytokinin and ADA with KK2 buffer in one side of the Petridish and found no rescue of the mutant (Figure S10) in such conditions suggesting no functional activity between ADA and cytokinin.</p>

<title>Plausible routes of caffeine action rescuing the mound arrest phenotype</title>
<p>The <italic>adgf</italic> mound arrest could be rescued by the addition of the adenosine antagonist, caffeine but treatment with the <italic>pde4</italic> inhibitor, IBMX failed to rescue the mound arrest. Caffeine is known to reduce adenosine levels in blood plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Conlay et al., 1988</xref>) and also increase ammonium levels in urine samples of rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bernheim and Bernheim, 1945</xref>). Thus, the mound rescue upon caffeine treatment may be a result of reduced adenosine and increased ammonia levels. With respect to caffeine action on cAMP levels, the reports are contradictory. Caffeine has been reported to increase adenylate cyclase expression thereby increasing cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Hagmann, 1986</xref>) whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alvarez-Curto et al., (2007)</xref> found that caffeine reduced intracellular cAMP levels in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>.

The cell homogenate was agitated on a rotary shaker at 4 °C for 15 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min in a cold microfuge tube. The supernatant was subjected to the ADA assay. This ADA test detects inosine, generated from adenosine break down through a multi-step reaction. The intermediate formed combines with the probe to produce uric acid, which is quantified at OD 293 nm.

Adenosine quantification involves the use of ADA and after a series of enzymatic reactions, an intermediate is formed which reacts with the adenosine probe generating a fluorescent product. Using a spectrofluorometer (Perkin Emer, USA; λEx = 544 nm/λEm = 590), the fluorescence intensity can be measured which is proportional to the concentration of adenosine (Perkin Emer, USA; λEx = 544 nm/λEm = 590).

For the ammonia assay, 1 ml of assay reagent was mixed thoroughly with either 100 µl of samples or standards, incubated for 5 min at RT, and the absorbance was measured at 340 nm. Then, 10 µl of L-glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) solution was added to each cuvette, and after a 5-min incubation at 25 °C, the absorbance was measured again at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer (Eppendorf, Germany). In the presence of GDH, ammonia combines with α- ketoglutaric acid and reduced NADPH to produce L-glutamate and oxidised NADP+.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study identifies a protein called adenosine deaminase-related growth factor (ADGF) as a key regulator of tip formation in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. The authors <bold>convincingly</bold> show that ADGF catalyses the formation of ammonia from adenosine, allowing ammonia to initiate tip formation, and then elucidate pathways upstream and downstream from ADGF. The authors discuss the intriguing possibility that mammalian ADGF may also similarly regulate development.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work shows that a specific adenosine deaminase protein in Dictyostelium generates the ammonia that is required for tip formation during Dictyostelium development. Cells with an insertion in the ADGF gene aggregate but do not form tips. A remarkable result, shown in several different ways, is that the ADGF mutant can be rescued by exposing the mutant to ammonia gas. The authors also describe other phenotypes of the ADGF mutant such as increased mound size, altered cAMP signaling, and abnormal cell type differentiation. It appears that the ADGF mutant has defects in the expression of a large number of genes, resulting in not only the tip defect but also the mound size, cAMP signaling, and differentiation phenotypes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data and statistics are excellent.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The key weakness is understanding why the cells bother to use a diffusible gas like ammonia as a signal to form a tip and continue development. The rescue of the mutant by adding ammonia gas to the entire culture indicates that ammonia conveys no positional information within the mound. By the time the cells have formed a mound, the cells have been starving for several hours, and desperately need to form a fruiting body to disperse some of themselves as spores, and thus need to form a tip no matter what. One can envision that the local ammonia concentration is possibly informing the mound that some minimal number of cells are present (assuming that the ammonia concentration is proportional to the number of cells), but probably even a minuscule fruiting body would be preferable to the cells compared to a mound. This latter idea could be easily explored by examining the fate of the ADGF cells in the mound - do they all form spores? Do some form spores? Or perhaps the ADGF is secreted by only one cell type, and the resulting ammonia tells the mound that for some reason that cell type is not present in the mound, allowing some of the cells to transdifferentiate into the needed cell type. Thus elucidating if all or some cells produce ADGF would greatly strengthen this puzzling story.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Lack of details on the developmental time course of ADGF activity and celltype type-specific differences in ADGF expression. The absence of measurements to show that ammonia addition to the null mutant can rescue the proposed defects in cAMP signaling.

<p>Diffusion of a gas can affect the signalling process of the entire colony of cells and will be quicker than other signaling mechanisms. A number of findings suggest that ammonia acts as both a local and long-range regulatory signal, integrating environmental and cellular cues to coordinate multicellular development. Ammonia serves as a crucial signalling molecule, influencing both multicellular organization and differentiation in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (Francis, 1964; Bonner et al., 1989; Bradbury and Gross, 1989). By raising the pH of the intracellular acidic vesicles of prestalk cells (Poole and Ohkuma, 1981; Gross et al, 1983), and the cytoplasm, ammonia is known to increase the speed of chemotaxing amoebae (Siegert and Weijer 1989; Van Duijn and Inouye, 1991), triggering multicellular movement (Bonner et al., 1988, 1989) to favor tipped mound development. The slug tip is known to release ammonia while the slime sheath at the back of the slug prevents diffusion thus maintaining high ammonia levels to (Bonner et al., 1989) promote pre-spore differentiation (Newell et al., 1969). Ammonia has been found to favor slug migration rather than fruiting (Schindler and Sussman, 1977) and thus, tip-derived ammonia may stimulate synchronized development of the entire colony. The tip exerts negative chemotaxis towards ammonia, potentially directing the slugs away from each other to ensure equal spacing of fruiting bodies (Feit and Sollitto, 1987).</p>
<p>Ammonia released in pulses acts as a long-distance signalling molecule between colonies of yeast cells indicating depletion of nutrient resources and promoting synchronous development (Palkova et al., 1997; Palkova and Forstova, 2000). A similar mechanism may be at play to influence neighbouring <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> colonies. Furthermore, ammonia produced in millimolar concentrations (Schindler and Sussman, 1977) may also ward off predators in soil as observed in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> symbionts of leaf-cutting ants to inhibit fungal pathogens (Dhodary and Spiteller, 2021). Additionally, ammonia may be recycled into amino acids, within starving <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells to supporting survival and differentiation as observed in breast cancer cells (Spinelli et al., 2017). Therefore, using a diffusible gas like ammonia as a signalling molecule is likely to have bioenergetic advantages. Ammonia is a natural metabolic byproduct of amino acid catabolism and other cellular processes, making it readily available without requiring additional energy for synthesis. Instead of producing a dedicated signalling molecule, cells can exploit an existing by-product for developmental regulation.</p>

<p>(2) The rescue of the mutant by adding ammonia gas to the entire culture indicates that ammonia conveys no positional information within the mound.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ammonia is known to influence rapid patterning of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells confined in a restricted environment (Sawai et al., 2002). Both neutral red staining (a marker for prestalk and ALCs) (Fig. S2) and the prestalk marker <italic>ecmA/ ecmB</italic> expression (Fig. 8C) in the <italic>adgf</italic> mutants suggest that the mounds have differentiated prestalk cells but are blocked in development. The mound arrest phenotype can be reversed by exposing the <italic>adgf</italic> mutant mounds to ammonia.</p>
<p>Based on cell cycle phases, there exists a dichotomy of cell types, that biases cell fate to prestalk or prespore (Weeks and Weijer, 1994; Jang and Gomer, 2011). Prestalk cells are enriched in acidic vesicles, and ammonia, by raising the pH of these vesicles and the cytoplasm (Davies et al 1993; Van Duijn and Inouye 1991), plays an active role in collective cell movement (Bonner et al., 1989). Thus, ammonia reinforces or maintains the positional information by elevating cAMP levels, favouring prespore differentiation (Bradbury and Gross, 1989; Riley and Barclay, 1990; Hopper et al., 1993).</p>

<p>(3) By the time the cells have formed a mound, the cells have been starving for several hours, and desperately need to form a fruiting body to disperse some of themselves as spores, and thus need to form a tip no matter what.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>When the <italic>adgf</italic> mutants were exposed to ammonia just after tight mound formation, tips developed within 4 h (Fig. 6). In contrast, <italic>adgf</italic> mounds not exposed to ammonia remained at the mound stage for at least 30 h. This demonstrates that starvation alone is not sufficient to drive tip development and ammonia serves as a cue that promotes the transition from mound to tipped mound formation.</p>
<p>Many mound arrest mutants are blocked in development and do not proceed to form fruiting bodies (Carrin et al., 1994). Furthermore, not all the mound arrest mutants tested in this study were rescued by ADA enzyme (Fig. S3 A), and they continue to stay as mounds without dispersing as spores, suggesting that mound arrest in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> can result from multiple underlying defects, whereas ammonia is an important factor controlling transition from mound to tip formation.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>A fraction of <italic>adgf</italic> mounds form bulkier spore heads by the end of 36 h as shown in Fig. 3. This late recovery may be due to the expression of other ADA isoforms. Mixing WT and <italic>adgf</italic> mutant cell lines results in a slug with the mutants occupying the prestalk region (Fig. 9) suggesting that WT ADGF favours prespore differentiation. However, it is not clear if ADGF is secreted by a particular cell type, as adenosine can be produced by both cell types, and the activity of three other intracellular ADAs may vary between the cell types. To address whether <italic>adgf</italic> expression is cell type-specific, we will isolate prestalk and prespore cells, and thereafter examine <italic>adgf</italic> expression in each population.</p>
<p>ADGF activity is likely to be higher in the tip to remove excess adenosine, the tip-inhibiting molecule (Wang and Schaap, 1985). Moreover, our results show that <italic>adgf<sup>-</sup></italic> cells with high adenosine preferentially migrate to the prestalk rather than the prespore region when mixed with WT cells. Ammonia generated from adenosine deamination could thus drive tip development and prespore differentiation.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>ADGF expression was examined at 0, 8, 12, and 16 h (Fig. 1), and the total ADA activity was assayed at 12 and 16 h (Fig. 4). As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now included the 12 h data (Fig. 4A) to provide additional insights into the kinetics of ADGF activity. The <italic>adgf</italic> expression was found to be highest at 16 h and hence, the ADA assay was carried out at that time point. However, the ADA assay will not exclusively reflect ADGF activity since it reports the activity of the three other isoforms as well.</p>
<p>A fraction of <italic>adgf<sup>-</sup></italic> mounds form bulkier spore heads by the end of 36 h as shown in Fig. 3. This late recovery may be due to the expression of the other ADA isoforms. Mixing WT and <italic>adgf</italic> mutant cell lines results in a slug with the mutants occupying the prestalk region (Fig. 9), suggesting that WT <italic>adgf</italic> favours prespore differentiation.</p>
<p>However, it’s not clear if ADGF is secreted by a particular cell type, as adenosine can be produced by both cell types, and the activity of the other three intracellular ADAs may vary between the cell types. To address whether <italic>adgf</italic> expression is cell typespecific, we will isolate prestalk and prespore cells, and thereafter examine <italic>adgf</italic> expression in each population.</p>
<p>ADGF activity is likely to be higher in the tip to remove excess adenosine, the tipinhibiting molecule (Wang and Schaap, 1985). Moreover, our results show that <italic>adgf<sup>-</sup></italic> cells with high adenosine preferentially migrate to the prestalk rather than the prespore region when mixed with WT cells.</p>

<p>(2) The absence of measurements to show that ammonia addition to the null mutant can rescue the proposed defects in cAMP signalling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The cAMP levels were measured at two time points 8 h and 12 h in the mutant. The <italic>adgf</italic> mutant has lower ammonia levels (Fig. 6), diminished <italic>acaA</italic> expression (Fig. 7) and reduced cAMP levels (Fig. 7) in comparison to WT at both 12 and 16 h of development. Since ammonia is known to increase cAMP levels (Riley and Barclay, 1990; Feit et al., 2001)<italic>,</italic> addition of ammonia addition to the mutant is likely to increase <italic>acaA</italic> expression, thereby rescuing the defects in cAMP signalling.</p>

<p>(3) No direct measurements in the dhkD mutant to show that it acts upstream of adgf in the control of changes in cAMP signalling and tip formation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The histidine kinases <italic>dhkD</italic> and <italic>dhkC</italic> are reported to modulate phosphodiesterase RegA activity, thereby maintaining cAMP levels (Singleton et al., 1998; Singleton and Xiong, 2013). By activating RegA, <italic>dhkD</italic> ensures proper cAMP distribution within the mound, which is essential for the patterning of prestalk and prespore cells, as well as for tip formation (Singleton and Xiong, 2013). Therefore, ammonia exposure to <italic>dhkD</italic> mutants is likely to regulate cAMP signalling and thereby tip formation. We will address this issue by measuring cAMP levels in the dhkD mutant.</p>
