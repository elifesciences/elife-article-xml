<title>Abstract</title><p>m6A is the most widespread mRNA modification and is primarily implicated in controlling mRNA stability. Fundamental questions pertaining to m6A are the extent to which it is dynamically modulated within cells and across stimuli, and the forces underlying such modulation. Prior work has focused on investigating <underline>active</underline> mechanisms governing m6A levels, such as recruitment of m6A writers or erasers leading to either ‘global’ or ‘site-specific’ modulation. Here, we propose that changes in m6A levels across subcellular compartments and biological trajectories may result from <underline>passive</underline> changes in gene-level mRNA metabolism. To predict the intricate interdependencies between m6A levels, mRNA localization, and mRNA decay, we establish a differential model ‘m6ADyn’ encompassing mRNA transcription, methylation, export, and m6A-dependent and independent degradation. We validate the predictions of m6ADyn in the context of intracellular m6A dynamics, where m6ADyn predicts associations between relative mRNA localization and m6A levels, which we experimentally confirm. We further explore m6ADyn predictions pertaining to changes in m6A levels upon controlled perturbations of mRNA metabolism, which we also experimentally confirm. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of m6ADyn in the context of cellular heat stress response, where genes subjected to altered mRNA product and export also display predictable changes in m6A levels, consistent with m6ADyn predictions. Our findings establish a framework for dissecting m6A dynamics and suggest the role of passive dynamics in shaping m6A levels in mammalian systems.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>In this revision, we addressed reviewer feedback by conducting additional experiments and clarifying key aspects of the manuscript. Notably, we performed nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation experiments on WTAP-depleted cells during a heat shock time course. These results revealed that while m6A levels were reduced, the observed mRNA localization changes persisted, further supporting that m6A is not a primary driver of these shifts and that observed changes in m6A level are rather a result of the changes in mRNA metabolism.
Textual changes were made to emphasize the passive regulation of m6A through transcriptional induction and changes in export.
Further computational code has been supplied in Supplementary Table 1 allowing an implementation of m6ADyn.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification in mammalian mRNA. Initially discovered five decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Desrosiers et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Perry and Kelley, 1974</xref>), research into this modification was catalyzed with the advent of transcriptome-wide detection methodologies, namely m6A-seq/m6A-meRIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). These methods rely on the immunoprecipitation of m6A-containing RNA fragments, followed by high-throughput sequencing and facilitate the extent of m6A methylation stochiometry on the m6A-site, -gene (m6A-GI) and sample level (m6A-SI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dierks et al., 2021</xref>). m6A has been implicated in most steps of mRNA fate and the disruption of the m6A-methylation machinery has critical manifestations in diverse systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Batista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">2014</xref>). Nonetheless, the most consistently observed molecular outcome of m6A is cytoplasmic mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lasman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Uzonyi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zaccara and Jaffrey, 2020</xref>), mediated via cytoplasmic ‘m6A readers’ of the YTH family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), m6A appears to be the predominant driver of mRNA stability, explaining roughly 30% of the variation in mRNA half-lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dierks et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Uzonyi et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>A fundamental question pertaining to m6A is the extent to which it is dynamically modulated within cells (i.e., across subcellular compartments) and across biological stimuli (such as stress responses). In both cases, the literature to date supports the notion that, at first approximation, the m6A methylome is fixed, and yet that m6A levels may be subjected to changes across both dimensions. Specifically, m6A profiles were found to be qualitatively similar across highly different cell types, developmental stages and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schwartz et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, changes in m6A levels -often at only a minority of sites - have been reported across diverse systems, ranging from cellular responses to diverse stressors, infection, disease, and during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Knuckles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lichinchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Su et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, in considering m6A levels across different compartments within cells, studies have consistently found m6A levels across chromatin-associated, nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic mRNA fractions to be very similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, slightly higher levels within the chromatin-associated fraction in comparison to the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ke et al., 2017</xref>) were observed in one study, contrasting with a more recent study finding reduced m6A levels in chromatin-associated RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yang et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>m6A deposition is catalyzed via a megadalton ‘m6A-writer’ complex, in which METTL3 acts as the catalytic component. m6A is to a considerable extent hard-coded, governed by the presence of the m6A consensus motif (‘DRACH motif’) and distance from splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Garcia-Campos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">He et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Luo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Uzonyi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). In light of a ‘hard-coded’ deposition baseline, it is interesting to dissect how dynamics in m6A level across compartments or biological stimuli can be achieved. The vast majority of the literature has focused on ‘active’ dynamics, wherein changes in m6A levels were proposed to be a consequence of changes in deposition or removal of m6A at specific sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hess et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Knuckles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Su et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, in the context of other types of marks, ‘passive’ dynamics have been established, in which changes in the level of a modification are not caused by direct deposition or removal but instead result from shifts in metabolism affecting the molecules that carry these modifications. For example, 5mC DNA methylation during early development is primarily thought to be regulated passively via cell division, whereby each division results in a two-fold dilution of the DNA 5mC content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mayer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rougier et al., 1998</xref>). It is thus intriguing to speculate that m6A deposition might, too, be shaped by passive mechanisms. Nonetheless, a complicating factor in the context of m6A (with respect to 5mC or other instances of classic passive dynamics) is that the methylation mark itself shapes the metabolism of the transcript harboring it. Considering the well-characterized role of m6A in triggering mRNA degradation, m6A levels, therefore, have the potential of being governed by what we term ‘semi-passive’ dynamics, wherein m6A <italic>actively</italic> triggers the decay of transcripts harboring it, thereby <italic>passively</italic> altering m6A levels. Under such a model, m6A levels, mRNA decay and subcellular RNA localization are intricately coupled.</p>
<p>We previously established an approach, m6A-seq2, allowing to capture m6A level either for a specific site (m6A-site score) or a metric capturing the overall methylation for a whole gene body (m6A gene index’, m6A-GI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dierks et al., 2021</xref>). Inspired by several instances in which we observed gene-level changes in m6A and where such relationships were manifested differently across different subcellular compartments, we explored whether changes in m6A levels can be attributed to semi-passive dynamics. We establish a model capturing key steps in the life cycle of an mRNA. Despite the simplicity of the model and the fact that it does not allow any site-specific active reshaping of m6A levels, it predicts ample modulation of m6A levels, and captures relationships between mRNA localization, mRNA half-lives and m6A levels that could be confirmed based on experimental data. We propose that m6A dynamics, when present, are attributable in part to semi-passive regulation, wherein changes in mRNA metabolism impact the susceptibility of a transcript to m6A-dependent decay, thereby altering m6A levels.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Previous studies have explored active mechanisms via which m6A levels could be modulated. We sought to examine whether changes in m6A could be passive consequences of changes in mRNA metabolism. The motivation for exploring this model was the realization that m6A levels both <italic>reflect</italic> and <italic>drive</italic> mRNA intracellular metabolism. Specifically, we considered a simple model wherein (1) m6A promotes mRNA decay, and (2) such decay occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm. This model intuitively links m6A levels and mRNA localization (nucleus/cytoplasm) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). On the one hand, under this model, changes in m6A <italic>cause</italic> changes in intracellular mRNA distribution: An increase in cytosolic m6A level of a given gene will trigger selective decay of cytoplasmic m6A harboring transcripts <italic>causing</italic> increased nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios of the gene. On the other hand, under this model, changes in mRNA localization will lead to changes in m6A levels: An increase in relative nuclear abundance of an mRNA leads to decreased cytoplasmic m6A-dependent degradation, thereby increasing overall m6A levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Thus, under these model assumptions, m6A levels, cytoplasmic decay, and subcellular localization are deeply intertwined, with changes in m6A driving and reflecting mRNA metabolism.</p>

<p>To model the complex interplay between m6A levels, mRNA localization, and mRNA stability, we established ‘m6ADyn’, a differential-equation-based model. In m6ADyn, a transcript is produced in the nucleus at a rate of ⍺, gets exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm at a rate of β, where it is degraded at the rate of γ. To capture the difference in the metabolism of m6A-containing and non-containing mRNA, we established two sets of parameters: ⍺<sup>A</sup>, β<sup>A</sup> and γ<sup>A</sup> representing production, export and decay of nonmethylated transcripts, respectively, and ⍺<sup>m6A</sup>, β<sup>m6A</sup> and γ<sup>m6A</sup> representing these rates for methylated counterparts. Throughout our simulations, unless indicated otherwise, we assumed (1) that the export rates of methylated and unmethylated transcripts were identical (β<sup>A</sup> = β<sup>m6A</sup>), and we will therefore refer to these rates as β, and (2) that the fate of methylated mRNA differed from that of its unmethylated counterparts exclusively in increased susceptibility to cytoplasmic decay, which was implemented by multiplying the unmethylated decay rate (γ<sup>A</sup>) by a constant (γ<sup>m6A</sup> = S * γ<sup>A</sup>, with S &gt; 1). Under steady state conditions (e.g. under normal growth conditions), the model equations can be solved analytically to determine mRNA and m6A levels in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>).</p>
<p>m6ADyn further enables us to determine the full dynamical response of mRNA and m6A levels under non steady state conditions. For instance, m6ADyn allows us to explore how the modulation of parameters governing export rate or cytoplasmic m6A-dependent decay <italic>impacts</italic> m6A levels. Increasing either m6A-dependent cytoplasmic degradation (γ<sup>m6A</sup>) or export (β) leads to reduced m6A levels - the former due to depletion of m6A harboring transcripts, and the latter due to increased levels of m6A-harboring mRNAs in the cytoplasm, rendering them susceptible to m6A-dependent decay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c, left</xref>). In parallel, m6ADyn also allows evaluation of how different aspects of metabolism are <italic>impacted</italic> by m6A levels. For example, increasing the m6A deposition rate (⍺<sup>m6A</sup>) leads to increased relative nuclear localization, and given that nuclear m6A-harboring transcripts are not subject to selective decay, this leads to an increase in overall m6A levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c, right</xref>). Thus, m6ADyn allows us to determine how m6A levels drive and reflect mRNA metabolism.</p>
<p>We note that the assumptions made by m6ADyn are reductionist and possibly over-simplistic, given that m6A has been tied, among others, to production, transcription termination, nuclear decay, and export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Knuckles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Slobodin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), all of which are either not parameterized by m6ADyn or not assumed to be different between m6A harboring and non-harboring transcripts (of note: we do expand m6ADyn, below, to test a subset of these). Yet, despite its simplicity, the predictions of this framework are in many cases non-intuitive, and modeling them provides an opportunity to explore which aspects of m6A dynamics can or cannot be explained using only the above-described simple and well-supported assumptions.</p>

<title>Testing m6ADyn predictions under steady state conditions</title>
<p>We sought to assess the extent to which relationships predicted by m6ADyn under steady state conditions are supported by experimental data. We began with two predictions on how mRNA metabolism impacts m6A levels. A first prediction of m6ADyn concerns heterogeneity in m6A levels across sub-cellular fractions: m6ADyn predicts that <italic>nuclear m6A levels</italic> per gene would be invariably higher than the corresponding <italic>cytoplasmic levels</italic>, given the selective removal of m6A harboring transcripts from the cytoplasm (γ<sup>m6A</sup> = S*γ<sup>A</sup>, with S &gt; 1). In m6ADyn, nuclear and cytoplasmic m6A can be analytically calculated for each gene in each compartment, defined as the fraction of transcripts harboring m6A divided by the overall number of transcripts in that compartment (Material and Methods Eq. 2-3). To confirm this experimentally, we fractionated NIH3T3 cells into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions in duplicates and applied m6A-seq2 to all samples, following which we calculated m6A levels at the sample level and gene levels (m6A-SI &amp; m6A-GI) across both compartments. Consistent with m6ADyn predictions, we found that m6A levels were higher in the nuclear fraction both at the sample and at the gene level, with the vast majority of genes (∼82%) exhibiting higher methylation levels in the nucleus (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). These trends were also recapitulated in an independent experiment performed in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>A second prediction of m6ADyn concerns heterogeneity in m6A levels between genes: m6ADyn predicts that <italic>m6A levels</italic> across the entire cell are higher in genes that are relatively more abundant in the nucleus, given that they are least susceptible to m6A-dependent decay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b, left</xref>). To assess whether this could be experimentally confirmed, we performed RNA-seq on nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions derived from WT and METTL3KO mESCs, which allowed the transcriptome-wide estimation of relative nuclear:cytoplasmic localization. Correlating the WT fractionation data against a previously acquired dataset capturing m6A levels per gene in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dierks et al., 2021</xref>) revealed that indeed m6A levels were higher in more nuclear localized genes, consistent with m6ADyn predictions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b right</xref>). We made similar observations also in NIH3T3 and in HEK293T cells for which we acquired fractionation data, confirming the robustness of these results (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1c, f</xref>). To control for potential technical covariates in antibody-based mapping, we additionally used previously published dataset of 40109 m6A sites, captured at single-nucleotide resolution, identified via GLORI, an antibody independent method relying on resistance of m6A sites to chemical deamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). We aggregated the signal stemming from individual m6A sites within a gene into a GLORI-gene index (GLORI-GI) (Materials &amp; Methods). A comparison of GLORI-GIs with our m6A-seq-derived m6A-GIs showed a high correlation of R = 0.71 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1d</xref>), supporting the robustness of m6A-GIs. Moreover, GLORI-GIs were higher in more nuclear genes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1e</xref>), consistent with our observations on the basis of m6A-GIs.</p>
<p>We next sought to assess m6ADyn predictions relating to how changes in m6A levels affect mRNA localization and stability. We first focused on mRNA subcellular localization. m6ADyn predicts that loss of methylation (as in Mettl3 KO conditions) in genes that are highly methylated in wild-type conditions would lead to increased cytoplasmic presence (and hence reduced nuclear:cytoplasmic levels), whereas such an effect would be less pronounced in poorly methylated genes. Consistently with this model prediction, a comparison of localization in WT and m6A-depleted mESCs revealed that loss of m6A results in an increased propensity for highly methylated genes to become cytoplasmic (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Notably, relationships between m6A levels and localization have previously served as potential indications of m6A impacting nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Edens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lesbirel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>). The results demonstrate that even when assuming identical export rates between m6A-containing and non-containing transcripts, substantial differences in m6A gene level can be explained solely by differences in subcellular localization and finally through cytoplasmic decay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b-c</xref>).</p>
<p>A final set of predictions of m6ADyn concerns m6A-dependent decay. m6ADyn predicts that (1) cytoplasmic genes will be more susceptible to increased m6A mediated decay, and (2) more methylated genes will undergo increased decay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d left</xref>). To explore these predictions, we relied - in addition to the above-described fractionation and m6A-seq2 measurements - also on previously published Actinomycin D (ActD) based mRNA stability measurements in WT and Mettl3 KO mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ke et al., 2017</xref>). For both experimental data, and model simulations, mRNA half-lives (HL) were acquired via linear modeling of the logarithmic decrease in mRNA levels over the timecourse following transcriptional inhibition (Material &amp; Methods). Strikingly, the experimental data supported the dual, impact of m6A levels and localization on mRNA stability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d, right</xref>). This trend could also be recapitulated in HEK293T, when using available m6A-seq, subcellular fractionation, and mRNA stability measurements following treatment HEK293T cells with either STM2457 (a small molecule inhibitor of METTL3) or mock (DMSO) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1g</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yankova et al., 2021</xref>). In our previous studies, we were able to attribute roughly 25% of the variability in mRNA half-lives to m6A levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dierks et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Uzonyi et al., 2023</xref>). Here, however, analyzing this relationship through the lens of subcellular localization revealed that among cytoplasmic genes - most susceptible to m6A-dependent decay - the association between localization and m6A is substantially stronger, with 44% of the variability in METTL3-dependent decay being attributable to m6A levels. Conversely, among nuclear genes this relationship is substantially weaker (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.19). These trends are qualitatively predicted by m6ADyn (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>) and were further recapitulated using HEK293T measurements (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1h</xref>).</p>
<p>We next sought to assess whether alternative models could readily predict the positive correlation between m6A and nuclear localization and the negative correlations between m6A and mRNA stability. First, we assessed how nuclear decay might impact these associations by introducing nuclear decay as an additional rate, δ. We found that both associations were robust to this additional rate (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2a-c</xref>). Next, we sought to assess how m6A-facilitated export (β<sup>m6A</sup> = 10 * β<sup>A</sup>) might impact the predictions by the model. Given the selective depletion of m6A from the nucleus, due to the facilitated export of the methylated transcript from the nucleus, the associations between m6A and nuclear localization were reversed (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2a-c</xref>). This model is, therefore, inconsistent with measurements. Finally, we also assessed an inverse model wherein m6A is inhibitive of export (β<sup>m6A</sup> = 0.1 * β<sup>A</sup>). This model recovers the positive association between m6A and nuclear localization but gives rise to a positive association between a gene’s m6A level and its stability - again contrasting with measurements (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2a-c</xref>). Thus, among the tested models, only ones in which m6A negatively impacts stability allow qualitatively recovering both the association with localization and with stability.</p>

<title>Testing m6ADyn predictions upon perturbations of mRNA metabolism</title>
<p>Next, we sought to assess m6ADyn predictions for how perturbations of mRNA metabolism impact m6A levels. m6ADyn predicts that decreasing production values (i.e. decreasing ⍺ rates) results in a decrease in m6A levels. Moreover, m6ADyn predicts that the rate at which m6A levels decrease is inversely correlated with mRNA stability, i.e. that m6A levels will decrease faster in more short-lived genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). To test this prediction, we employed m6A-seq2 to monitor m6A levels along a 6h-time course following the treatment of mESC cells with ActD. Consistent with the m6ADyn predictions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b, left</xref>), gene-level measurements of m6A displayed a subtle yet consistent decrease in m6A levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b, right</xref>). This drop was also observed at the sample level (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3a</xref>), consistent also with previously reported mass-spec-based measurements that showed a decrease in m6A/A ratio following ActD treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, treatment of MCF7 cells with Camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase inhibitor that stalls RNAPII elongation, thereby reducing production rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Listerman et al., 2006</xref>), led to reduced m6A levels, in this case with much more dramatic effect sizes on both the sample and gene-levels (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3b</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). As predicted by m6ADyn (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d, left</xref>), the decrease in m6A was stronger in genes with lower half-lives (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d, right</xref>). Consistently, following both ActD and CPT administration, we observed that the decrease in m6A levels was inversely proportional to the stability of the genes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3c</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To further test predictions of m6ADyn, we next sought to perturb m6A-dependent decay to assess whether predictions of m6ADyn following perturbations of γ<sup>m6A</sup> could be experimentally confirmed. m6A-Dyn predicts that elimination of m6A-dependent decay (e.g. γ<sup>m6A</sup> = γ<sup>A</sup>) will result (1) in increased overall methylation levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>) and (2) in decreased nuclear/cytoplasm localization due to stabilization of cytoplasmic transcripts. Moreover, this impact on stabilization would be predicted to be stronger for the more methylated genes. Given that m6A-mediated decay is primarily thought to be mediated via the three cytoplasmic YTHDF proteins (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lasman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zaccara and Jaffrey, 2020</xref>), we next conducted a triple knockdown of the YTHDF proteins in NIH3T3 cells followed by whole-cell m6A-seq2 measurements and subcellular fractionation coupled with RNA-sequencing. While the knockdown substantially reduced RNA levels of YTHDF1 and YTHDF2, it did not reduce YTHDF3 levels(<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3d</xref>). Nonetheless, there was an overall increase, albeit subtle, in m6A levels on the gene and sample levels (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3e</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>). Moreover, as anticipated by m6ADyn, we noted a reduction in the nuclear/cytoplasmic levels of more highly methylated genes following this perturbation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>). These analyses thus support the relevance of m6ADyn for interpreting dynamic changes in m6A levels following alterations in mRNA metabolism. Nonetheless, the relatively subtle observed effect sizes hint at limitations of the model and/or at pleiotropic effects induced by the metabolic perturbations (see Discussion).</p>

<title>Changes in m6A levels in the biological response to heat stress are secondary to changes in mRNA metabolism</title>
<p>Finally, we tested whether our model can serve as a framework for exploring how altered mRNA metabolism during a biological response leads to alterations in m6A levels. The cellular response to heat shock is well-documented to be associated with significant alterations in mRNA metabolism, characterized by a pronounced decrease in global export and an increase in the production of heat-stress response (HSR) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mahat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shalgi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Trinklein et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">2004b</xref>). Additionally, the cellular heat shock response has been implicated in differential m6A methylation of heat shock response genes (HSR-gene) at hundreds of m6A sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Knuckles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Both the increase in mRNA production rates and the reduction in export are predicted by m6ADyn to result in increasing m6A levels, thereby rendering heat shock an attractive model for testing to what extent observed changes in m6A levels could be directly explained by changes in mRNA metabolism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We first sought to confirm previous findings pertaining to the heat-shock-induced export block. We applied a single-molecule FISH protocol using a poly(dT) probe directed against poly(A) mRNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We assessed global changes in mRNA localization in cells grown under normal conditions (non-heat shock, NHS) at 37℃, cells subjected to 1.5 hours of heat shock at 43℃ (heat shock, HS) and cells in recovery at 37℃ for 1 hour and 4 hours, following the stress. We observed a dramatic increase in the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio of mRNA upon heat stress treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b-c</xref>), consistent with previously documented nuclear retention of mRNA upon heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shalgi et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>We next applied m6A-seq2 to a heat stress and recovery time course. The experiment was performed in primary MEF cells, in biological triplicates, using the same time points as in the FISH measurements with the addition of an early time point 45 minutes following heat shock (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). We obtained m6A-GIs for ∼8100 genes expressed at sufficient levels across all samples. In general, m6A levels across genes were highly correlated between all time points, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that m6A is, to a considerable extent, a constitutive feature of the mRNA. Nonetheless, subtle quantitative differences were apparent (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>). To capture the most dominant trends in m6A levels along this time course, we performed a PCA analysis on the m6A-GIs of all samples in the time course. The first principle component (‘PC1’) captured a continuous increase (or decrease) of m6A methylation along the heat stress time course (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>). We hence use PC1 below as an unbiased metric for ranking genes based on whether they undergo induced m6A levels over time (‘high PC1’) or reduced (‘low PC1’). While this manuscript focuses primarily on m6A levels per gene, we confirmed the change of m6A methylation during the heat shock time course with SCARLET for three chosen m6A sites in genes that showed a dynamic increase in m6A upon heat stress (high PC1 genes) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4b</xref>).</p>
<p>We next sought to understand whether – consistently with m6ADyn predictions – the changes in m6A levels could be linked with differences in mRNA subcellular localization during heat stress. We monitored relative subcellular localization over the course of heat stress via fractionation of cells into nuclear and cytosolic fractions, followed by RNA sequencing. Remarkably, we observed that the genes undergoing increased methylation upon heat stress (‘high PC1 genes’) became dramatically more nuclear during heat stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref>). Conversely, the genes with decreased methylation (‘low PC1 genes’) exhibited a reversed trend (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref>). Overall, PC1 loading of genes and nuclear:cytoplasmic fractionation display a correlation of R = 0.4 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4c</xref>). To exclude m6A as a driver of these mRNA metabolic changes, we performed an siRNA mediated knockdown of WTAP, a component of the m6A-’writer’ complex and shown to be an effective target for transcriptome-wide m6A depletion. siWTAP treated cells were subjected to a heat shock time course experiment followed by transcriptional profiling in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. We found that genes with high PC1 values in the WT experiment showed a similar trend of increased nuclear abundance upon heat stress also in the siWTAP treated cells, suggesting that m6A is unlikely to be the driver of these changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure 4e</xref>). These results thus tie alterations in m6A levels to alterations of subcellular localization induced during heat stress and are consistent with the notion that disrupted export during heat stress could underlie the systematic increase in m6A levels observed in heat stress.</p>
<p>In our analysis of the dataset and attempting to understand why only certain genes exhibit induced m6A levels than others, we made two observations: First, high PC1 genes (displaying induced m6A levels during heat stress) tend to have substantially higher turn-over rates (shorter half-lives) in comparison to low PC1 genes. Second, we observed that high PC1 genes become more nuclear upon heat stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref>).To assess whether differences in nuclear localization upon export block, combined with differences in m6a-dependent half-lives between genes were sufficient to account for observed differences in m6A levels under heat stress conditions, we used m6ADyn to predict changes in methylation levels following a global reduction of export (down to 10% of steady-state export rates). We observed that METTL3-dependent half-life and Nuc:Cyt ratio of genes following export block were conditionally independent of each other, with each of them individually (and both of them additively) negatively correlating with extent of m6A induction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4g, left</xref>). Remarkably, highly similar trends were observed when analyzing the experimental dataset in a similar manner, binning genes based on their METTL3-dependent stability and based on their relative Nuc:Cyt localization after 90 minutes heat-stress treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4g, right</xref>). This analysis thus highlights how the complex interaction between diverse aspects of RNA metabolism and m6A levels can be captured by m6ADyn.</p>
<p>A closer inspection of high PC1 genes (in which m6A is induced during the cellular stress response) revealed that these were enriched in ‘cellular stress response’ gene ontology, comprising classical heat stress response (HSR-) genes such as Hspa1a, Hspb1, Hsp1d, Hsp1e, Hsph1 and Dnajb1 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4e</xref>). An analysis of Pro-seq data, which evaluates RNA Pol II occupancy as a proxy for transcriptional rate in MEFss during heat stress, confirmed that genes that showed the highest transcriptional induction are genes that have a high PC1 loading, i.e. show increased m6A level upon heat stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4h</xref>). This was of interest to us, as a prediction of m6ADyn is that increased production rates will result in increased m6A levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). We, therefore, sought to validate that the increased methylation observed in these genes was indeed a consequence of their transcriptional induction. We reasoned that perturbing Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the central transcription factor governing the heat stress response, could allow assessing whether the increased m6A levels in HSF1-transcriptionally induced targets are truly attributed to increased production or potentially due to some other mode of regulation. To explore this, we applied m6A-seq2 to a heat stress time course in HSF1-KO primary MEFs. We first confirmed that also within this dataset, HSF1-independent genes displayed similar m6A methylation dynamics as observed in the WT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4i, bottom</xref>). In stark contrast, while HSF1 target genes remained expressed at basal levels also within HSF1-KO cells, their m6A dynamics were completely lost (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4i, top</xref>). Consistently, fractionation experiments in HSF1 KO cells revealed that HSF1 target genes were no longer enriched in the nucleus, in stark contrast to the HSF-independent counterparts. Furthermore, fractionation experiments of heat-stress treated HSF1 KO cells followed by RNA-seq confirmed that the HSF1-target genes do not experience an increase in nuclear enrichment during heat stress, unlike in the wild-type cells. Conversely, HSF1-independent genes demonstrate a similar increase in nuclear enrichment in both HSF1-KO and wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4j</xref>). These analyses thus demonstrate that the m6A increase observed within HSF1-target genes is a consequence of the transcriptional induction, in line with m6ADyn predictions that induced production should be sufficient to lead to increased m6A levels.</p>
<p>To summarize, our results indicate that during the heat stress response, m6A accumulates within a large set of genes, primarily within targets that undergo increased nuclear localization. This is likely primarily due to a block in export, but - in a subset of genes - due to increased transcription. In both cases, the impact on nuclear:cytoplasmic levels and on m6A levels are captured well by the m6ADyn framework. These results thus highlight the utility of the m6ADyn framework in capturing and predicting m6A dynamics in the context of a complex cellular response.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Until recently, the rules governing the selectivity of m6A deposition were shrouded in mystery. In the absence of an understanding of how m6A deposition is governed, we also lacked a framework for considering rules governing m6A dynamics. Consequently, diverse models were proposed for both aspects, typically relying on some form of ‘active’ recruitment of the methyltransferase complex and/or of m6A erasers to target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Knuckles et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lichinchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Patil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Su et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, it was uncovered that m6A deposition could, to a considerable extent, be attributed to simple exclusion (“100-nt rule”), wherein m6A is installed by default at all eligible consensus motifs, unless they are within ∼100 nt of a splice junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Uzonyi et al., 2023</xref>) in which case their deposition is inhibited by the exon-junction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">He et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Luo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Uzonyi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we propose that changes in m6A levels, across compartments or upon stimuli, may be similarly predictable via a simple model, wherein they may be attributable - at least in part - to changes in mRNA metabolism. Under this model, no changes in active deposition or removal of methylation from specific sites are needed in order to explain changes in m6A levels, which instead merely reflect consequences of m6A-driven mRNA metabolism.</p>
<p>Passive, rather than active, control over m6A levels is somewhat reminiscent of the passive control over DNA methylation in mammalian systems. DNA methylation, like RNA methylation, is controlled by ‘writer’ enzymes, and can be reversed via ‘erasers’, hence rendering the ‘active’ model a viable and attractive one. Nonetheless, considering the dramatic dynamics to which DNA methylation is subject in the germline, these are mediated primarily passively, by dilution of DNA methylation over the course of cellular divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rougier et al., 1998</xref>). Our findings also connect with recent findings in neural cells, revealing that differences in relative mRNA localization within cell bodies vs neurites could, to a considerable extent, be attributed to the stability of the mRNA. While mRNA localization in neurons had been primarily thought to be governed actively, via specific RNA binding proteins involved in directing mRNAs to their target locations, this study thus proposed a passive model, wherein the inherent stability of an RNA plays a role in determining its relative localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Loedige et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The tight - yet indirect - interconnectedness of m6A with mRNA metabolic rates (e.g. production and degradation) highlights the need to exercise caution in the interpretation of experiments along these dimensions. In previous studies, it was often hypothesized that changes observed in m6A levels are likely to be predominantly attributed to active recruitment of methylases or demethylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Knuckles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Su et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Our study points at the possibility that such changes may be passive in nature, and attributed to changes in mRNA metabolism, including differences in production, export or decay. Similarly, in previous studies involving perturbation of the m6A pathway were often found to result in diverse changes on the composition (e.g. selective expression of certain splice isoforms) and in the subcellular whereabouts of the transcriptome, based on which the possibility of a direct and causal connection with m6A was hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wen et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings raise the possibility that such changes in m6A methylation levels could, at least in part, be mediated by the redistribution of mRNAs secondary to loss of cytoplasmic m6A-dependent decay. Nonetheless, m6ADyn should only be considered as a framework for testing parsimonious assumptions, and cannot rule out previously proposed mechanisms regarding the impact of m6A on mRNA metabolism or the mechanisms governing m6A dynamics. For instance, we tested whether experimental measurements would be consistent with m6A-facilitated export, and found that under this scenario experimental measurements are not consistent with predictions (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2a-c</xref>). While this may suggest that m6A does not impact export, contrasting a number of studies on the topic, it could also in principle be consistent with a more complex model wherein m6A both impacts both export and mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Edens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lesbirel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>). Under such complex scenarios predictions of m6ADyn become a quantitative outcome of the relative impact of m6A on different processing steps, no longer lending themselves to qualitative interpretation. It is also important to highlight that incorporating a general nuclear degradation parameter into m6ADyn appeared to enhance the agreement between the model and some of the observations. In particular, it strengthened the negative correlation between m6A gene levels and total mRNA half-life, suggesting that while the overall outcomes remain largely unchanged, nuclear decay may contribute meaningfully to the dynamics of m6A-mediated regulation. We mostly chose to proceed with the simpler version of the model, as it effectively captures the key dynamics and allows a more intuitive understanding of the model’s predictions (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2a-c</xref>).</p>
<p>While the power of m6ADyn lies in its conceptual simplicity, some of its key caveats also lie therein. First, our exploration of m6ADyn is simulation-based: Predictions of m6ADyn are explored using randomly sampled alpha, beta and gamma rates. Being able to experimentally estimate these parameters per gene would allow obtaining quantitative predictions for how m6A levels in each gene would be impacted by changes in production, export and degradation rates. While systematic acquisition of rates capturing different steps in RNA metabolism has been challenging, this is an area marked by recent advances on the basis of metabolic labeling combined with subcellular fractionation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Müller et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Smalec et al., 2022</xref>). Second, m6ADyn operates on the assumption of a binary methylation state for genes (methylated vs. unmethylated). This simplification overlooks the likely reality of discrete methylation states for all transcripts of a gene with multiple m6A sites, wherein the susceptibility of a gene to m6A-mediated decay may be a function of its overall m6A levels. Third, m6ADyn may be over-simplistic in many of its assumptions on mRNA metabolism and outcomes of m6A. mRNA metabolism encompasses more than only production, methylation, nuclear export and decay. Nuclear decay, for example, could also play a major role in some cases, although several previous studies have found its role to generally be negligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Müller et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Smalec et al., 2022</xref>). Alternatively, localization with specialized non-membranous subcellular compartments such as P or TIS granules could also impact the susceptibility of transcripts to m6A-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cougot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>). M6ADyn also does not account for nuclear envelope breakdown during cell division, which would redistribute transcripts between nucleus and cytoplasm. M6ADyn may also be over-simplistic with respect to its assumptions regarding the roles played by m6A. While m6ADyn only considers the well-established role of m6A in controlling cytoplasmic stability, m6A has also been implicated in a range of additional steps on the mRNA life cycle including splicing, nuclear degradation and export. Thus, while the ability of m6ADyn to predict diverse changes in m6A between and across compartments is indicative of its utility, it should not be interpreted as evidence ruling out the existence or relevance of regulatory levels that are not captured as part of m6ADyn.</p>
<p>In line with the above, we wish to highlight several results in which m6ADyn predictions were not fully, or not at all, supported. First, ActD treatment (perturbation of production) and knockdown of the three YTHDF proteins (perturbation of m6A-dependent decay) both resulted in only relatively subtle alterations in m6A levels. Second, there were two predictions pertaining to the relationship between nuclear/cytoplasmic localization and m6A levels for which we were unable to obtain experimental support in the context of production and YTHDF perturbations. (i) Inhibition of production is predicted by m6ADyn to lead to a stronger decrease in m6A levels for cytoplasmic genes than for nuclear counterparts, which we do not observe experimentally (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5a</xref>). (ii) Inhibition of m6A-dependent decay is predicted by m6ADyn to lead to a stronger increase in m6A levels in more cytoplasmic genes, in comparison to more nuclear counterparts, which we also do not observe experimentally (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5b</xref>). Third, the quantitative discrepancy between the relatively mild decrease in m6A levels following ActD treatment versus the much more dramatic decrease following CPT treatment is not accounted for by m6ADyn. Finally, also the correlation between degradation rates and the decrease of m6A level was more pronounced following CPT treatment in comparison to ActD treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2d</xref>). These inconsistencies may partially be accounted for by experimental limitations, such as insufficient knockdown of the YTH proteins (or additional factors promoting m6A decay), or complex pleiotropic effects on mRNA metabolism being invoked secondary to the treatment of cells via different lethal inhibitors. Alternatively, these inconsistencies may also reflect oversimplified assumptions of m6ADyn regarding m6A metabolism and the mRNA life cycle.</p>
<p>To conclude, it is important to highlight that changes in m6A levels, both across subcellular compartments and across stimuli, are relatively rare, and typically also subtle. Our findings suggest that many of these changes, when present, may be accounted for by changes in mRNA metabolism, rather than by active control over m6A at specific sites.</p>

<title>‘m6ADyn’ model calculation</title>
<p>m6ADyn is a differential equation-based model for simulating mRNA metabolism. In m6ADyn, transcripts are produced in the nucleus at a production rate (⍺), exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm at an export rate (β), and degraded in the cytoplasm at a decay rate (γ). Separate sets of rates are defined for non-m6A-harboring transcripts (⍺<sup>A</sup>, β<sup>A</sup> and γ<sup>A</sup>) and m6A-harboring transcripts (⍺<sup>m6A</sup>, β<sup>m6A</sup> and γ<sup>m6A</sup>). Unless specified otherwise, in our implementations and simulations, the decay rate for m6A-harboring transcripts is assumed to be higher than that of non-m6A-harboring transcripts (γ<sup>m6A</sup> &gt;γ<sup>A</sup>), while the export rates for both transcript types are assumed to be equal (β<sup>A</sup> = β<sup>m6A</sup>).</p>

<p>For the derivation of nuclear and cytoplasmic transcript abundances outside of steady-state conditions, the R package ’MOSAIC’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pruim et al., 2017</xref>) was used to simulate changes in transcript levels over time. This package was also employed to simulate stability rates by fitting a linear model to m6ADyn-derived log-transformed mRNA levels along a time course following the inhibition of transcription (⍺<sup>A</sup>=⍺<sup>m6A</sup>=0), thereby mimicking an experiment based on transcriptional inhibition.</p>
<p>For the simulation of genes, the required rates (⍺<sup>A</sup>, ⍺<sup>m6A</sup>, β, γ) were sampled independently. The rates were drawn from a gamma distribution, which, by default, was set with a rate parameter of 1 and a shape parameter of 1, unless specified otherwise. Unless stated otherwise, export rates (β) were assumed to be equal for both methylated and unmethylated transcripts (β<sup>A</sup>=β<sup>m6A</sup>), while degradation rates for methylated transcripts were set to be higher by a factor (S) of ten (γ<sup>m6A</sup> = 10 * γ<sup>A</sup>). An example of such a simulation was provided in R code and included in Source Code 1.</p>

<title>m6ADyn with nuclear degradation</title>
<p>To simulate the effects of nuclear degradation, nuclear decay (δ) was introduced as an additional rate parameter. The inclusion of this parameter resulted in minor modifications to the equations, accounting for the degradation of transcripts within the nucleus alongside production, export, and cytoplasmic decay rates.

<p>This study presents a <bold>fundamental</bold> finding on how levels of m6A levels are controlled, invoking a consolidated model where degradation of modified RNAs in the cytoplasm plays a primary role in shaping m6A patterns and dynamics, rather than needing active regulation by m6A erasers and other related processes. The evidence is <bold>compelling</bold> through its use of transcriptome-wide data and mechanistic modeling. Relevant for any reader with an interest in RNA metabolism, this new framework consolidates previous observations and highlights the importance of careful experimentation for evaluation m6A levels.</p>

<p>Here, the authors propose that changes in m6A levels may be predictable via a simple model that is based exclusively on mRNA metabolic events. Under this model, m6A mRNAs are &quot;passive&quot; victims of RNA metabolic events with no &quot;active&quot; regulatory events needed to modulate their levels by m6A writers, readers, or erasers; looking at changes in RNA transcription, RNA export, and RNA degradation dynamics is enough to explain how m6A levels change over time.</p>
<p>The relevance of this study is extremely high at this stage of the epitranscriptome field. This compelling paper is in line with more and more recent studies showing how m6A is a constitutive mark reflecting overall RNA redistribution events. At the same time, it reminds every reader to carefully evaluate changes in m6A levels if observed in their experimental setup. It highlights the importance of performing extensive evaluations on how much RNA metabolic events could explain an observed m6A change.</p>

<p>Dierks et al. investigate the impact of m6A RNA modifications on the mRNA life cycle, exploring the links between transcription, cytoplasmic RNA degradation and subcellular RNA localization. Using transcriptome-wide data and mechanistic modelling of RNA metabolism, the authors demonstrate that a simplified model of m6A primarily affecting cytoplasmic RNA stability is sufficient to explain the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of methylated RNAs and the dynamic changes in m6A levels upon perturbation. Based on multiple lines of evidence, they propose that passive mechanisms based on the restricted decay of methylated transcripts in the cytoplasm play a primary role in shaping condition-specific m6A patterns and m6A dynamics. The authors support their hypothesis with multiple large-scale datasets and targeted perturbation experiments. Overall, the authors present compelling evidence for their model which has the potential to explain and consolidate previous observations on different m6A functions, including m6A-mediated RNA export.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript works with a hypothesis where the overall m6A methylation levels in cells is influenced by mRNA metabolism (sub-cellular localization and decay). The basic assumption is that m6A causes Mrna decay and this happens in the cytoplasm. They go on to experimentally test their model to confirm its predictions. This is confirmed by sub-cellular fractionation experiments which shows high m6A levels in the nuclear RNA. Nuclear localized RNAs have higher methylation. Using a heat shock model, they demonstrate that RNAs with increased nuclear localization or transcription, are methylated at higher levels. Their overall argument is that changes in m6A levels is rather determined by passive processes that are influenced by RNA processing/metabolism. However, it should be considered that erasers have their roles under specific environments (early embryos or germline) and are not modelled by the cell culture systems used here.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a thought-provoking series of experiments that challenge the idea that active mechanisms of recruitment or erasure are major determinants for m6A distribution and levels.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here, the authors propose that changes in m6A levels may be predictable via a simple model that is based exclusively on mRNA metabolic events. Under this model, m6A mRNAs are &quot;passive&quot; victims of RNA metabolic events with no &quot;active&quot; regulatory events needed to modulate their levels by m6A writers, readers, or erasers; looking at changes in RNA transcription, RNA export, and RNA degradation dynamics is enough to explain how m6A levels change over time.</p>
<p>The relevance of this study is extremely high at this stage of the epi transcriptome field. This compelling paper is in line with more and more recent studies showing how m6A is a constitutive mark reflecting overall RNA redistribution events. At the same time, it reminds every reader to carefully evaluate changes in m6A levels if observed in their experimental setup. It highlights the importance of performing extensive evaluations on how much RNA metabolic events could explain an observed m6A change.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is essential to notice that m6ADyn does not exactly recapitulate the observed m6A changes. First, this can be due to m6ADyn's limitations. The authors do a great job in the Discussion highlighting these limitations. Indeed, they mention how m6ADyn cannot interpret m6A's implications on nuclear degradation or splicing and cannot model more complex scenario predictions (i.e., a scenario in which m6A both impacts export and degradation) or the contribution of single sites within a gene.</p>
<p>Secondly, since predictions do not exactly recapitulate the observed m6A changes, &quot;active&quot; regulatory events may still play a partial role in regulating m6A changes. The authors themselves highlight situations in which data do not support m6ADyn predictions. Active mechanisms to control m6A degradation levels or mRNA export levels could exist and may still play an essential role.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s appreciation of our findings and their implications, and are in full agreement with the reviewer regarding the limitations of our model, and the discrepancies in some cases - with our experimental measurements, potentially pointing at more complex biology than is captured by m6ADyn. We certainly cannot dismiss the possibility that active mechanisms may play a role in shaping m6A dynamics at some sites, or in some contexts. Our study aims to broaden the discussion in the field, and to introduce the possibility that passive models can explain a substantial extent of the variability observed in m6A levels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) &quot;We next sought to assess whether alternative models could readily predict the positive correlation between m6A and nuclear localization and the negative correlations between m6A and mRNA stability. We assessed how nuclear decay might impact these associations by introducing nuclear decay as an additional rate, δ. We found that both associations were robust to this additional rate (Supplementary Figure 2a-c).&quot;</p>
<p>Based on the data, I would say that model 2 (m6A-dep + nuclear degradation) is better than model 1. The discussion of these findings in the Discussion could help clarify how to interpret this prediction. Is nuclear degradation playing a significant role, more than expected by previous studies?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important point, which we’ve now clarified in the discussion. Including nonspecific nuclear degradation in the m6ADyn framework provides a model that better aligns with the observed data, particularly by mitigating unrealistic predictions such as excessive nuclear accumulation for genes with very low sampled export rates. This adjustment addresses potential artifacts in nuclear abundance and half-life estimations. However, we continued to use the simpler version of m6ADyn for most analyses, as it captures the key dynamics and relationships effectively without introducing additional complexity. While including nuclear degradation enhances the model's robustness, it does not fundamentally alter the primary conclusions or outcomes. This balance allows for a more straightforward interpretation of the results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors classify m6A levels as &quot;low&quot; or &quot;high,&quot; and it is unclear how &quot;low&quot; differs from unmethylated mRNAs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this observation. We analyzed gene methylation levels using the m6A-GI (m6A gene index) metric, which reflects the enrichment of the IP fraction across the entire gene body (CDS + 3UTR). While some genes may have minimal or no methylation, most genes likely exist along a spectrum from low to high methylation levels. Unlike earlier analyses that relied on arbitrary thresholds to classify sites as methylated, GLORI data highlight the presence of many low-stoichiometry sites that are typically overlooked. To capture this spectrum, we binned genes into equal-sized groups based on their m6A-GI values, allowing a more nuanced interpretation of methylation patterns as a continuum rather than a binary or discrete classification (e.g. no- , low- , high methylation).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors explore whether m6A changes could be linked with differences in mRNA subcellular localization. They tested this hypothesis by looking at mRNA changes during heat stress, a complex scenario to predict with m6ADyn. According to the collected data, heat shock is not associated with dramatic changes in m6A levels. However, the authors observe a redistribution of m6A mRNAs during the treatment and recovery time, with highly methylated mRNAs getting retained in the nucleus being associated with a shorter half-life, and being transcriptional induced by HSF1. Based on this observation, the authors use m6Adyn to predict the contribution of RNA export, RNA degradation, and RNA transcription to the observed m6A changes. However:</p>
<p>(a) Do the authors have a comparison of m6ADyn predictions based on the assumption that RNA export and RNA transcription may change at the same time?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this point. Under the simple framework of m6ADyn in which RNA transcription and RNA export are independent of each other, the effect of simultaneously modulating two rates is additive. In Author response image 1, we simulate some scenarios wherein we simultaneously modulate two rates. For example, transcriptional upregulation and decreased export during heat shock could reinforce m6A increases, whereas transcriptional downregulation might counteract the effects of reduced export. Note that while production and export can act in similar or opposing directions, the former can only lead to temporary changes in m6A levels but without impacting steady-state levels, whereas the latter (changes in export) can alter steady-state levels. We have clarified this in the manuscript results to better contextualize how these dynamics interact.</p>

<p>(b) They arbitrarily set the global reduction of export to 10%, but I'm not sure we can completely rule out whether m6A mRNAs have an export rate during heat shock similar to the non-methylated mRNAs. What happens if the authors simulate that the block in export could be preferential for m6A mRNAs only?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting suggestion. While we cannot fully rule out such a scenario, we can identify arguments against it being an exclusive explanation. Specifically, an exclusive reduction in the export rate of methylated transcripts would be expected to increase the relationship between steady-state m6A levels (the ratio of methylated to unmethylated transcripts) and changes in localization, such that genes with higher m6A levels would exhibit a greater relative increase in the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (Nuc:Cyt) ratio. However, the attached analysis shows only a weak association during heat stress, where genes with higher m6A-GI levels tend to increase just a little more in the Nuc:Cyt ratio, likely due to cytoplasmic depletion. A global reduction of export (β 10%) produces a similar association, while a scenario where only the export of methylated transcripts is reduced (β^m6A 10%) results in a significantly stronger association (Author response image 2). This supports the plausibility of a global export reduction. Additionally, genes with very low methylation levels in control conditions also show a significant increase in the Nuc:Cyt ratio, which is inconsistent with a scenario of preferential export reduction for methylated transcripts (data not shown).</p>

<p>(c) The dramatic increase in the nucleus: cytoplasmic ratio of mRNA upon heat stress may not reflect the overall m6A mRNA distribution upon heat stress. It would be interesting to repeat the same experiment in METTL3 KO cells. Of note, m6A mRNA granules have been observed within 30 minutes of heat shock. Thus, some m6A mRNAs may still be preferentially enriched in these granules for storage rather than being directly degraded. Overall, it would be interesting to understand the authors' position relative to previous studies of m6A during heat stress.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer suggests that methylation is actively driving localization during heat shock, rather than being passively regulated. To address this question, we have now knocked down WTAP, an essential component of the methylation machinery, and monitored nuclear:cytoplasmic localization over the course of a heat shock response. Even with reduced m6A levels, high PC1 genes exhibit increased nuclear abundance during heat shock. Notably, the dynamics of this trend are altered, with the peak effect delayed from 1.5h heat shock in siCTRL samples to 4 hours in siWTAP samples (Supplementary Figure 4). This finding underscores that m6A is not the primary driver of these mRNA localization changes but rather reflects broader mRNA metabolic shifts during heat shock. These findings have been added as a panel e) to Supplementary Figure 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(d) Gene Ontology analysis based on the top 1000 PC1 genes shows an enrichment of GOs involved in post-translational protein modification more than GOs involved in cellular response to stress, which is highlighted by the authors and used as justification to study RNA transcriptional events upon heat shock. How do the authors think that GOs involved in post-translational protein modification may contribute to the observed data?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>High PC1 genes exhibit increased methylation and a shift in nuclear-to-cytoplasmic localization during heat stress. While the enriched GO terms for these genes are not exclusively related to stress-response proteins, one could speculate that their nuclear retention reduces translation during heat stress. The heat stress response genes are of particular interest, which are massively transcriptionally induced and display increased methylation. This observation supports m6ADyn predictions that elevated methylation levels in these genes are driven by transcriptional induction rather than solely by decreased export rates.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(e) Additionally, the authors first mention that there is no dramatic change in m6A levels upon heat shock, &quot;subtle quantitative differences were apparent,&quot; but then mention a &quot;systematic increase in m6A levels observed in heat stress&quot;. It is unclear to which systematic increase they are referring to. Are the authors referring to previous studies? It is confusing in the field what exactly is going on after heat stress. For instance, in some papers, a preferential increase of 5'UTR m6A has been proposed rather than a systematic and general increase.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. In our manuscript, we sought to emphasize, on the one hand, the fact that m6A profiles are - at first approximation - “constitutive”, as indicated by high Pearson correlations between conditions (Supplementary Figure 4a). On the other hand, we sought to emphasize that the above notwithstanding, subtle quantitative differences are apparent in heat shock, encompassing large numbers of genes, and these differences are coherent with time following heat shock (and in this sense ‘systematic’), rather than randomly fluctuating across time points. Based on our analysis, these changes do not appear to be preferentially enriched at 5′UTR sites but occur more broadly across gene bodies (potentially a slight 3’ bias). A quick analysis of the HSF1-induced heat stress response genes, focusing on their relative enrichment of methylation upon heat shock, shows that the 5'UTR regions exhibit a roughly similar increase in methylation after 1.5 hours of heat stress compared to the rest of the gene body (Author response image 3). A prominent previous publication (Zhou et al. 2015) suggested that m6A levels specifically increase in the 5'UTR of HSPA1A in a YTHDF2- and HSF1-dependent manner, and highlighted the role of 5'UTR m6A methylation in regulating cap-independent translation, our findings do not support a 5'UTR-specific enrichment. However, we do observe that the methylation changes are still HSF1-dependent. Off note, the m6A-GI (m6A gene level) as a metric that captures the m6A enrichment of gene body excluding the 5’UTR, due to an overlap of transcription start site associated m6Am derived signal.</p>

Using transcriptome-wide data and mechanistic modelling of RNA metabolism, the authors demonstrate that a simplified model of m6A primarily affecting cytoplasmic RNA stability is sufficient to explain the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of methylated RNAs and the dynamic changes in m6A levels upon perturbation. Based on multiple lines of evidence, they propose that passive mechanisms based on the restricted decay of methylated transcripts in the cytoplasm play a primary role in shaping condition-specific m6A patterns and m6A dynamics. The authors support their hypothesis with multiple large-scale datasets and targeted perturbation experiments. Overall, the authors present compelling evidence for their model which has the potential to explain and consolidate previous observations on different m6A functions, including m6A-mediated RNA export.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript works with a hypothesis where the overall m6A methylation levels in cells are influenced by mRNA metabolism (sub-cellular localization and decay). The basic assumption is that m6A causes mRNA decay and this happens in the cytoplasm. They go on to experimentally test their model to confirm its predictions. This is confirmed by sub-cellular fractionation experiments which show high m6A levels in the nuclear RNA. Nuclear localized RNAs have higher methylation. Using a heat shock model, they demonstrate that RNAs with increased nuclear localization or transcription, are methylated at higher levels. Their overall argument is that changes in m6A levels are rather determined by passive processes that are influenced by RNA processing/metabolism. However, it should be considered that erasers have their roles under specific environments (early embryos or germline) and are not modelled by the cell culture systems used here.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a thought-provoking series of experiments that challenge the idea that active mechanisms of recruitment or erasure are major determinants for m6A distribution and levels.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript is very clear and well-written. However, some arguments are a bit difficult to understand. It would be helpful to clearly discriminate between active and passive events. For example, in the sentence: &quot;For example, increasing the m6A deposition rate (⍺m6A) results in increased nuclear localization of a transcript, due to the increased cytoplasmic decay to which m6A-containing transcripts are subjected&quot;, I would directly write &quot;increased relative nuclear localization&quot; or &quot;apparent increase in nuclear localization&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this careful observation. We have modified the quoted sentence, and also sought to correct additional instances of ambiguity in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, it is important to ensure that all relationships are described correctly. For example, in the sentence: &quot;This model recovers the positive association between m6A and nuclear localization but gives rise to a positive association between m6A and decay&quot;, I think &quot;decay&quot; should be replaced with &quot;stability&quot;. Similarly, the sentence: &quot;Both the decrease in mRNA production rates and the reduction in export are predicted by m6ADyn to result in increasing m6A levels, ...&quot; should it be &quot;Both the increase in mRNA production and...&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This sentence was difficult for me to understand: &quot;Our findings raise the possibility that such changes could, at least in part, also be indirect and be mediated by the redistribution of mRNAs secondary to loss of cytoplasmic m6A-dependent decay.&quot; Please consider rephrasing it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We rephrased this sentence as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 2d: &quot;A final set of predictions of m6ADyn concerns m6A-dependent decay. m6ADyn predicts that (a) cytoplasmic genes will be more susceptible to increased m6A mediated decay, independent of their m6A levels, and (b) more methylated genes will undergo increased decay, independently of their relative localization (Figure 2d left) ... Strikingly, the experimental data supported the dual, independent impact of m6A levels and localization on mRNA stability (Figure 2d, right).&quot;</p>
<p>I do not understand, either from the text or from the figure, why the authors claim that m6A levels and localization independently affect mRNA stability. It is clear that &quot;cytoplasmic genes will be more susceptible to increased m6A mediated decay&quot;, as they always show shorter half-lives (top-to-bottom perspective in Figure 2d). Nonetheless, as I understand it, the effect is not &quot;independent of their m6A levels&quot;, as half-lives are clearly the shortest with the highest m6A levels (left-to-right perspective in each row).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The two-dimensional heatmaps allow for exploring conditional independence between conditions. If an effect (in this case delta half-life) is a function of the X axis (in this case m6A levels), continuous increases should be seen going from one column to another. Conversely, if it is a function of the Y axis (in this case localization), a continuous effect should be observed from one row to another. Given that effects are generally observed both across rows and across columns, we concluded that the two act independently. The fact that half-life is shortest when genes are most cytoplasmic and have the highest m6A levels is therefore not necessarily inconsistent with two effects acting independently, but instead interpreted by us as the additive outcome of two independent effects. Having said this, a close inspection of this plot does reveal a very low impact of localization in contexts where m6A levels are very low, which could point at some degree of synergism between m6A levels and localization. We have therefore now revised the text to avoid describing the effects as &quot;independent.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The methods part should be extended. For example, the description of the mRNA half-life estimation is far too short and lacks details. Also, information on the PCA analysis (Figure 4e &amp; f) is completely missing. The code should be made available, at least for the differential model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this point and expanded the methods section on mRNA stability analysis and PCA. Additionally, we added a supplementary file, providing R code for a basic m6ADyn simulation of m6A depleted to normal conditions (added Source Code 1).</p>

<p>(4) Figure 4e, f: The authors use a PCA analysis to achieve an unbiased ranking of genes based on their m6A level changes. From the present text and figures, it is unclear how this PCA was performed. Besides a description in the methods sections, the authors could show additional evidence that the PCA results in a meaningful clustering and that PC1 indeed captures induced/reduced m6A level changes for high/low-PC1 genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added passages to the text, hoping to clarify the analysis approach.</p>

<p>(5) In Figure 4i, I was surprised about the m6A dynamics for the HSF1-independent genes, with two clusters of increasing or decreasing m6A levels across the time course. Can the model explain these changes? Since expression does not seem to be systematically altered, are there differences in subcellular localization between the two clusters after heat shock?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A general aspect of our manuscript is attributing changes in m6A levels during heat stress to alterations in mRNA metabolism, such as production or export. As shown in Supplementary Figure 4d, even in WT conditions, m6A level changes are not strictly associated with apparent changes in expression, but we try to show that these are a reflection of the decreased export rate. In the specific context of HSF1-dependent stress response genes, we observe a clear co-occurrence of increased m6A levels with increased expression levels, which we propose to be attributed to enhanced production rates during heat stress. This suggests that transcriptional induction can drive the apparent rise in m6A levels. We try to control this with the HSF1 KO cells, in which the m6A level changes, as the increased production rates are absent for the specific cluster of stress-induced genes, further supporting the role of transcriptional activation in shaping m6A levels for these genes. For HSF1-independent genes, the HSF-KO cells mirror the behavior of WT conditions when looking at 500 highest and lowest PC1 (based on the prior analysis in WT cells), suggesting that changes in m6A levels are primarily driven by altered export rates rather than changes in production.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Among the HSF1 targets, Hspa1a seems to show an inverse behaviour, with the highest methylation in ctrl, even though expression strongly goes up after heat shock. Is this related to the subcellular localization of this particular transcript before and after heat shock?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Upon reviewing the heat stress target genes, we identified an issue with the proper labeling of the gene symbols, which has now been corrected (Figure 4 panel i). The inverse behavior observed for Hspb1 and partially for Hsp90aa1 is not accounted for by the m6ADyn model, and is indeed an interesting exception with respect to all other induced genes. Further investigation will be required to understand the methylation dynamics of Hspb1 during the response to heat stress.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this point and added two publications with a very recent one, both showing that chromatin-associated nascent RNA has less m6A methylation</p>

<p>The manuscript is perhaps a bit too long. It took me a long time to get to the end. The findings can be clearly presented in a more concise manner and that will ensure that anyone starting to read will finish it. This is not a weakness, but a hope that the authors can reduce the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have respectfully chosen to maintain the length of the manuscript. The model, its predictions and their relationship to experimental observations are somewhat complex, and we felt that further reduction of the text would come at the expense of clarity.</p>
