<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMs) is characterized by activated electroencephalogram (EEG) and muscle atonia, accompanied by vivid dreams. REMs is homeostatically regulated, ensuring that any loss of REMs is compensated by a subsequent increase in its amount. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the homeostatic control of REMs are largely unknown. Here, we show that GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus (POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons) are crucial for the homeostatic regulation of REMs. POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons are most active during REMs, and inhibiting them specifically decreases REMs. REMs restriction leads to an increased number and amplitude of calcium transients in POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons, reflecting the accumulation of REMs pressure. Inhibiting POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during REMs restriction blocked the subsequent rebound of REMs. Our findings reveal a hypothalamic circuit whose activity mirrors the buildup of homeostatic REMs pressure during restriction and that is required for the ensuing rebound in REMs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>REMs is homeostatically regulated as demonstrated in various species including mice, rats, cats and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Siegel and Gordon, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beersma et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benington et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Endo et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rechtschaffen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Franken, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shea et al., 2008</xref>). REMs restriction leads to an increased homeostatic need for REMs. During the subsequent recovery sleep, the amount of REMs is increased to compensate for the amount lost during restriction. While seminal dissection studies indicate a pontine origin of REMs, recent studies have revealed that neural populations in the hypothalamus, midbrain, amygdala and medulla regulate REMs by promoting or inhibiting REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Clément et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jego et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hayashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Van Dort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Weber et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Torontali et al., 2019</xref>). However, we do not have a clear understanding about the homeostatic mechanisms regulating REMs and which brain regions integrate homeostatic REMs pressure.</p>
<p>The preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA) is crucial for sleep regulation. The POA contains neurons that become activated during sleep and that are sufficient and necessary for sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Von Economo, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nauta, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">McGinty and Sterman, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sallanon et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sherin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Szymusiak et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kroeger et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, POA GABAergic neurons projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus (POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons) form a subpopulation of sleep-active POA neurons, and promote sleep when optogenetically activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chung et al., 2017</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that c-Fos expression in the POA is increased in REMs restricted rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gvilia et al., 2006</xref>). However, the molecular identity of POA neurons that become activated during heightened REMs pressure and whether their activity is necessary for homeostatic REMs regulation remains largely unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, using fiber photometry, we found that POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons become gradually activated during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMs) before the onset of REMs and are most active during REMs. Optogenetic inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons significantly decreased REMs. We therefore hypothesized that the POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons are well suited to encode homeostatic pressure for REMs. Using fiber photometry recordings combined with REMs restriction, we show that the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons significantly increased during periods of heightened REMs pressure. Optogenetic inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during REMs restriction prevented the subsequent increase of REMs during recovery sleep. Our findings identify a hypothalamic circuit regulating the homeostatic need for REMs.</p>

<p>To monitor the population activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> during spontaneous sleep, we performed fiber photometry recordings. GAD2-Cre mice were injected with retrograde adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding Cre-inducible GCaMP8s (AAVretro-FLEX-jGCaMP8s) into the TMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>), and an optic fiber was implanted into the POA (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). The calcium activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons was significantly higher during REMs compared with that during wake and NREMs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref></bold>; detailed statistical results are shown in <bold>Figure legends</bold> and <bold><xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We further analyzed the activity changes of the POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during NREMs→REMs or NREMs→wake transitions. We found that the calcium activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during NREMs→ REMs transitions becomes significantly increased 40 s before the REMs onset and remains elevated throughout REMs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). During NREMs→wake transitions, the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons started rising 10 s before the wake onset and remained elevated for 10 s after the onset (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). The ΔF/F activity gradually increased throughout NREMs episodes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Given that both the θ and σ (6-9 and 10.5-16 Hz) power increased preceding the REMs onset (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>), we investigated the relationship between the POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neuron activity and the spectral composition of the EEG in more detail (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref></bold>). We used a linear regression model to predict the current POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neural activity based on the preceding and following spectral EEG features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Weber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schott et al., 2023</xref>). We found that the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons is preceded by an increase in the θ and σ power and reduction in the δ (0.5-4.5 Hz) power (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref></bold>). These changes in the EEG are characteristic for the stage of NREMs preceding REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gottesmann, 1996</xref>) and their correlation with the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons is consistent with a role of these neurons in promoting NREMs to REMs transitions.</p>
<p>In a complementary experiment, we monitored the calcium activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN axonal fibers. GAD2-Cre mice were injected with AAV-FLEX-GCaMP6s into the POA and an optic fiber was implanted into the TMN (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref></bold>). Similar to the activity found for POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons using retrograde AAVs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref></bold>), POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN fibers were most active during REMs (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>, C</bold>). During NREMs, the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN axonal fibers gradually increased before transitioning to REMs (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref></bold>), demonstrating that the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN axonal fibers closely resembles that of cell bodies. In summary, these results demonstrate that the activity in POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons increases prior to the onset of REMs episodes, following an increase in the θ and σ power in the EEG.</p>
<p>The TMN contains histamine neurons (TMN<sup>HIS</sup>), and previous studies showed that POA<sup>GAD2</sup> neurons innervate TMN<sup>HIS</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Saito et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with previous electrophysiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Steininger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vanni-Mercier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">John et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Takahashi et al., 2006</xref>), we found in photometry recordings that TMN<sup>HIS</sup> neurons are highly active during wake and less active during NREMs and REMs (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A-C</xref></bold>). Consistent with this, the activity of TMN<sup>HIS</sup> neurons became significantly activated after the transition from NREMs or REMs to wakefulness (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref></bold>). The TMN<sup>HIS</sup> neuron activity gradually decreased during NREMs episodes (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref></bold>), possibly as a result of inhibitory inputs from POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chung et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Inhibiting POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons reduces REMs</title>
<p>To examine whether POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons regulate REMs, we optogenetically inhibited these neurons using the bistable chloride channel SwiChR++ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berndt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Smith et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Stucynski et al., 2022</xref>). GAD2-Cre mice were bilaterally injected with retrograde AAVs encoding Cre-inducible SwiChR++ (AAVretro-DIO-SwiChR++-eYFP) or eYFP (AAVretro-DIO-eYFP) into the TMN followed by bilateral optic fiber implantation into the POA (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). We compared SwiChR++ and eYFP recordings with and without laser stimulation (473 nm, 2 s step pulses at 60 s intervals for 3 h, zeitgeber time [ZT] 2-5). SwiChR++-mediated inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons reduced the amount of REMs compared with recordings without laser stimulation in the same mice and eYFP mice with laser stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C</xref></bold>). The overall time spent in wake and NREMs was not altered by SwiChR++-mediated inhibition (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, S3A, B</xref></bold>) suggesting that POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neuron activity specifically regulates the amount of REMs.</p>

<p>Next, we compared the spectral composition of the EEG throughout recordings with or without laser stimulation in SwiChR++ and eYFP mice. During REMs, SwiChR++-mediated inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons increased the δ and σ power in the EEG compared with SwiChR++-without laser and eYFP-laser groups (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3C</xref></bold>). The δ, θ, and σ power in the EEG during NREMs and wake was indistinguishable between SwiChR++ and eYFP groups (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated the effect of sustained inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons on the following 3 h recording without laser stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). Despite the reduction of REMs during the laser stimulation in SwiChR++ mice (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>), there were no differences in the amount of REMs, NREMs, and wake between SwiChR++ and eYFP groups during the post laser recordings (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E, S3E, F</xref></bold>), suggesting that the loss of REMs during SwiChR++-mediated inhibition was not followed by a homeostatic increase in REMs. Taken together, we first demonstrated that SwiChR++-mediated inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons reduced the amount of REMs, supporting a necessary role of these neurons in REMs regulation. Second, the lost amount of REMs was not compensated for in the subsequent sleep suggesting that their activity is involved in the homeostatic regulation of REMs.</p>

<title>POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons exhibit an increased number of calcium transients during REMs restriction</title>
<p>To probe whether the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons changes during periods of high REMs pressure resulting from REMs restriction, we performed fiber photometry recordings combined with a closed-loop REMs restriction protocol (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). To detect the onset of REMs, we adapted a previously applied automatic REMs detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Weber et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Stucynski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schott et al., 2023</xref>). Briefly, the animal’s brain state was classified based on real-time analysis of the EEG/EMG signals. As soon as a REMs episode was detected, a small vibrating motor attached to the animal’s head was turned on to terminate REMs by briefly awakening the animal (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cardis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Osorio-Forero et al., 2023</xref>). Compared with the baseline recordings from the same mice during the same circadian time, we found that 6 h of REMs restriction (ZT 1.5-7.5) significantly reduced the amount of REMs and duration of REMs episodes, while increasing their frequency (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>, D-F</bold>). The number of motor activations gradually increased as mice tried to enter REMs more frequently, indicating the accumulation of REMs pressure (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref></bold>). Before the onset of the motor vibration, we found a clear increase in the EEG θ band reflecting NREMs to REMs transitions (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C</xref></bold>). We also investigated the effects of REMs restriction on the spectral composition of the EEG. We found an increased δ power for REMs during restriction (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4G</xref></bold>). During rebound (ZT 7.5-8.5), the amount of REMs was significantly increased compared with that during the same circadian time due to an increased frequency of REMs episodes (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4H-K</xref></bold>), compensating for the amount of REMs lost during restriction.</p>

<p>During REMs restriction, we observed an increased number of calcium transients in the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons as the REMs pressure increased (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref></bold>). To detect and quantify these transients, we applied an algorithm previously applied to detect calcium events in fiber photometry recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Antila et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). Using fiber photometry, we monitored the population activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during the last hour of REMs restriction (ZT 6.5-7.5, referred as Restr.) and the first hour of REMs rebound (ZT 7.5-8.5, referred as Reb.) and compared it with the activity during baseline recordings of the same mice on separate days at the same circadian time (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref></bold>). To restrict REMs, we used a motor (ZT 1.5-5.5) as previously described or gently pulled a string attached to the animal’s head (ZT 5.5-7.5) during the photometry recordings (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). We verified that REMs was adequately restricted (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref></bold>). During restriction, the number of calcium transients of the POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons was significantly increased compared with that during baseline recordings (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). In particular, the number of calcium peaks was significantly elevated during NREMs, likely reflecting an increased pressure to transition to REMs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). As the duration of REMs episodes was largely reduced as a result of the restriction (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref></bold>), the number of peaks during REMs was not changed.</p>
<p>We further examined the amplitude of calcium transients during both NREMs and REMs. During REMs restriction, the amplitude of NREMs and REMs calcium transients was significantly higher compared with that during the circadian baseline (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, E</xref></bold>) and remained elevated during NREMs in the rebound phase (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F, G</xref></bold>). Overall, these findings show that during periods of high REMs pressure, the POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons exhibit an increased number of calcium transients with higher amplitude compared with that during baseline levels suggesting that the activity of these neurons may reflect the heightened homeostatic need for REMs.</p>

<title>Inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during REMs restriction reduces the REMs rebound</title>
<p>To investigate whether the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons encodes REMs pressure and consequently facilitates the subsequent rebound in REMs, we optogenetically inhibited these neurons during the last 3 h of REMs restriction. GAD2-Cre mice were bilaterally injected with retrograde AAVs encoding Cre-inducible SwiChR++ (AAVretro-DIO-SwiChR++-eYFP) or eYFP (AAVretro-DIO-eYFP) into the TMN followed by bilateral optic fiber implantation into the POA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>). Mice underwent REMs restriction (6 h, ZT 1.5-7.5), and laser stimulation (2 s step pulses at 60 s intervals) was applied during the last 3 hours (ZT 4.5-7.5), when the REMs pressure was highest (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref></bold>). During restriction, SwiChR-mediated inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons decreased the percentage of REMs and reduced the frequency of REMs episodes with marginal significance (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6A, B</xref></bold>). We found that inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during REMs restriction resulted in a reduced amount of REMs during the rebound compared with that in eYFP mice (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, F, G, S6D, E</xref></bold>). Thus, inactivating POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during heightened REMs pressure not only decreased the amount of REMs, but also prevented its homeostatic rebound during the following recovery sleep.</p>

<p>Finally, we examined the spectral composition of the EEG during the REMs restriction. We found that inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during REMs restriction reduced the REMs δ power, NREMs θ and σ power compared with that in eYFP mice with laser stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6C</xref></bold>). The reduced θ and σ power during NREMs could result from less attempts to enter REMs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref></bold>). During rebound, there were no significant differences in EEG δ, θ and σ power during REMs and NREMs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6F</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Taken together, inhibiting POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during REMs restriction significantly decreased the amount of REMs and blocked the subsequent rebound in REMs. Our data suggest that the heightened activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during sleep encodes the increased need for REMs and consequently plays an important role in the homeostatic response to REMs restriction.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates a role of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons in the homeostatic regulation of REMs. Using fiber photometry, we showed that the POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons become activated throughout NREMs before transitioning to REMs, while being most active during REMs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). Sustained optogenetic inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons reduced the overall amount of REMs, and the loss of REMs was not compensated during the subsequent recovery sleep (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). During the period of high REMs pressure, POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons exhibited an increased number of calcium transients with elevated amplitude (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). Optogenetic inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during REMs restriction attenuated the subsequent rebound of REMs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). Our results suggest that the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons reflects an increased need for REMs in the form of enhanced calcium transients and is required for the rebound following the loss of REMs.</p>
<p>The TMN contains histamine-producing neurons and antagonizing histamine signaling causes sleepiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Watanabe et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Panula et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lin et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bayliss et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Haas et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with our photometry recordings (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref></bold>), electrophysiological recordings demonstrate that TMN<sup>HIS</sup> neurons are most active during wakefulness and less active during NREMs and REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Steininger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vanni-Mercier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">John et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Takahashi et al., 2006</xref>). Throughout NREMs, the activity of TMN<sup>HIS</sup> neurons gradually decreased while that of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons showed an opposite pattern (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2E</xref></bold>), which is likely in part the result of direct synaptic inputs from the POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons to TMN<sup>HIS</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Saito et al., 2018</xref>). TMN<sup>HIS</sup> neurons in turn inhibit putative sleep-active POA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Mutual inhibition between TMN<sup>HIS</sup> and POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons may explain their antagonistic activity pattern revealed in our fiber photometry recordings.</p>
<p>While many studies have focused on the role of the POA in regulating NREMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sherin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Szymusiak et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lu et al., 2000</xref>; Zhang et al., 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kroeger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ma et al., 2019</xref>), previous <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiological studies found that the majority of sleep-active neurons in the POA are most active during REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Osaka and Matsumura, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Antila et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, recent fiber photometry recordings demonstrated that GABAergic neurons in the POA and their subtypes expressing cholecystokinin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, tachykinin 1 or galanin are most active during REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Miracca et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). Deleting the NMDA receptor GluN1 subunit in the POA reduced REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Miracca et al., 2022</xref>), and in line with this, sustained optogenetic inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons specifically decreased REMs. Consistent with these studies, our findings also support an important role of the POA in REMs regulation and, in addition, provide evidence that these neurons are also part of the homeostat regulating REMs.</p>
<p>A previous study showed that the number of c-Fos positive POA neurons is positively correlated with the amount of REMs in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lu et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, REMs restriction led to an increase in the number of POA neurons expressing c-Fos, which was correlated with the number of attempts to enter REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gvilia et al., 2006</xref>). Together with our findings that the number of calcium transients of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons increased during REMs restriction and that inhibition of these neurons blocked the following REMs rebound, these results support a crucial role of the POA in the homeostatic regulation of REMs. For the future, it would be interesting to test whether POA neurons projecting to other postsynaptic areas are also involved in the homeostatic regulation of REMs. A previous study showed that POA neurons projecting to REMs-regulatory pontine regions including the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, locus coeruleus (LC) and dorsal raphe nucleus express increased levels of c-Fos after periods of dark exposure that increased REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lu et al., 2002</xref>). However, the number of c-Fos positive POA neurons projecting to the LC was not increased upon REMs restriction, suggesting that this subpopulation may not be involved in the homeostatic regulation of REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Verret et al., 2006</xref>). Besides the TMN, the POA also projects to other REMs-regulatory regions such as the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) and lateral hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Steininger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Saito et al., 2018</xref>). Particularly, the projections to the vlPAG are of interest for future research, as GABAergic neurons in this area have been previously implicated in the homeostatic regulation of REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hayashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Weber et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The cellular mechanisms underlying the elevated activity of POA neurons during high REMs pressure are unknown. Sleep-promoting neurons in the dorsal fan-shaped body of <italic>Drosophila</italic> display increased intrinsic neuronal excitability in response to sleep need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Donlea et al., 2014</xref>). The elevated activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during heightened REMs pressure may similarly be the result of an increased excitability. Given that the POA is also involved in the homeostatic regulation of NREMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sherin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Szymusiak et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gong et al., 2004</xref>; Zhang et al., 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lu et al., 2000</xref>), it would be interesting to study how different POA subpopulations integrate the homeostatic need for NREMs and REMs.</p>
<p>Together, we have demonstrated a role of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons in the homeostatic regulation of REMs. REMs disturbances are observed in a variety of psychiatric disorders such as depression and PTSD and often precede their clinical onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ross et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gottesmann and Gottesman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Germain, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Palagini et al., 2013</xref>). Elucidating the circuit mechanisms underlying the homeostatic regulation of REMs may provide novel therapeutic targets to specifically regulate and normalize REMs in these psychiatric disorders to alleviate associated symptoms and potentially slow down their progression.</p>

<title>Surgical procedures</title>
<p>All procedures followed the IACUC guidelines for rodent survival surgery. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1-2%) during the surgery, and placed on a stereotaxic frame (Kopf) while being on a heating pad to maintain body temperature. The skin was incised and small holes were drilled for virus injections and implantations of optic fibers and EEG/EMG electrodes.</p>
<p>For fiber photometry experiments to image POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref><bold>, 3</bold>), pGP-AAV-Syn-FLEX-jGCaMP8s-WPRE was injected (Nanoject II, Drummond Scientific) into the TMN (300 nl; AP -2.4 mm; ML -1 mm; DV -5.4 to -5.2 mm, relative to bregma) and an optic fiber (400 μm diameter) was implanted into the POA (AP 0.2 mm; ML -0.6 mm; DV -5.2 mm). For imaging the POA<sup>GAD2</sup> →TMN axonal fibers (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref></bold>), pAAV-Syn-FLEX-GCaMP6s-WPRE-SV40 was injected into the POA (300 nl) and an optic fiber was implanted into the TMN. To image TMN<sup>HIS</sup> neurons (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref></bold>), pAAV-Syn-FLEX-GCaMP6s-WPRE-SV40 was injected into the TMN (300 nl) and an optic fiber was implanted into the TMN.</p>

<p>All mice were implanted with electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) electrodes. EEG signals were recorded with stainless steel wires attached to two screws, located in the skull on top of the parietal (AP -2 mm; ML 2 mm) and frontal cortex (AP 1.7 mm; ML 0.6 mm). A reference screw was inserted on top of the cerebellum. Two EMG electrodes were inserted into the neck musculature. The incision was closed with suture and the EEG/EMG electrodes and optic fibers were secured to the skull using dental cement (A-M Systems). We performed optogenetic and fiber photometry experiments at least 4 wks after surgery.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were removed and fixed overnight in 4% PFA in PBS and then stored in 30% sucrose in PBS. Brains were embedded with OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek) and frozen. 40 μm sections were cut using a cryostat (Thermo Scientific HM525 NX) and directly mounted onto glass slides. Brain sections were washed in PBS for 5 min, permeabilized using PBST (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min, and incubated in blocking solution (5% normal donkey serum in 0.3% PBST; 017-000-001, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h. Brain sections were incubated with chicken anti-GFP antibody (1:1,000; GFP8794984, Aves Lab) in the blocking solution overnight at 4°C. The following morning, sections were washed in PBS and incubated for 3 h with the donkey anti-chicken secondary antibody conjugated to a green Alexa fluorophore 488 (1:500; 703-545-155, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 2 h. Afterwards, sections were washed with PBS followed by counterstaining with Hoechst solution (#33342, Thermo Scientific). Slides were coverslipped with mounting medium (Fluoromount-G, Southern Biotechnic) and imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Microscope, Leica DM6B; Camera, Leica DFC7000GT; LED, Leica CTR6 LED) to verify virus expression and optic fiber placement. Animals were excluded if no virus expression is detected or the virus expression/optic fiber tips were not properly localized to the targeted area.</p>

<title>Polysomnographic recordings</title>
<p>All sleep recordings were performed in a cage to which the animal had been habituated for several days. All recordings were performed during the light phase between 8 am and 5 pm (ZT1-10) in sound-attenuating chambers. For sleep recordings, EEG and EMG signals were recorded using an RHD2132 amplifier (Intan Technologies, sampling rate 1 kHZ) connected to an RHD USB interface board (Intan Technologies). For fiber photometry experiments, a calcium signal was recorded using an RZ5P amplifier (Tucker-Davis Technologies, sampling rate 1.5 kHz). EEG and EMG signals were referenced to a ground screw located on top of the cerebellum. At the start of each sleep recording, EEG and EMG electrodes were connected to flexible recording cables via small connectors. To determine the brain state of the animal, we first computed the EEG and EMG spectrogram for sliding, half-overlapping 5 s windows, resulting in 2.5 s time resolution. To estimate within each 5 s window the power spectral density (PSD), we performed Welch’s method with Hanning window using sliding, half-overlapping 2 s intervals. Next, we computed the time-dependent δ (0.5 to 4 Hz), θ (5 to 12 Hz), σ (12 to 20 Hz), and high γ (100 to 150 Hz) power by integrating the EEG power in the corresponding ranges within the EEG spectrogram. In addition, we calculated the ratio of the θ and δ power (θ/δ) and the EMG power in the range of 50 to 500 Hz. For each power band, we used its temporal mean to separate it into a low and high part (except for the EMG and θ/δ ratio, where we used the mean plus one standard deviation as threshold). REMs was defined by a high θ/δ ratio, low EMG, and low δ power. NREMs was defined by high δ power, a low θ/δ ratio, and low EMG power. In addition, states with low EMG power, low δ power, but high σ power were scored as NREMs. Wake was defined by low δ power, high EMG power and high γ power (if not otherwise classified as REMs). Our automatic algorithm that has been previously used in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Weber et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Antila et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Smith et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Stucynski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schott et al., 2023</xref>) has 90.256 % accuracy compared with the manual scoring by expert annotators. We manually verified the automatic classification using a graphical user interface visualizing the raw EEG and EMG signals, EEG spectrograms, EMG amplitudes, and the hypnogram to correct for errors, by visiting each single 2.5 s epoch in the hypnograms. The software for automatic brain state classification and manual scoring was programmed in Python (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tortugar/Lab/tree/master/PySleep">https://github.com/tortugar/Lab/tree/master/PySleep</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Fiber photometry</title>
<p>Prior to the recording, the optic fiber and EEG/EMG electrodes were connected to flexible patch cables. For calcium imaging, a first LED (Doric lenses) generated the excitation wavelength of 465 nm and a second LED emitted 405 nm light, which served as control for bleaching and motion artifacts. 465 and 405 nm signals were modulated at two different frequencies, 210 and 330 Hz respectively. Both lights traveled through dichroic mirrors (Doric lenses) before entering a patch cable attached to the optic fiber. Fluorescence signals emitted by GCaMP8s or GCaMP6s were collected by the optic fiber and traveled via the patch cable through a dichroic mirror and GFP emission filter (Doric lenses) before entering a photoreceiver (Newport Co.). Photoreceiver signals were relayed to an RZ5P amplifier and demodulated into two signals using the Synapse software (Tucker-Davis Technologies), corresponding to the 465 and 405 nm excitation wavelengths. To analyze the calcium activity, we used custom-written Python scripts. First, both signals were low-pass filtered at 2 Hz using a 4th order digital Butterworth filter. Next, we fitted the 405 nm to the 465 nm signal using linear regression. Finally, the linear fit was subtracted from the 465 nm signal to correct for photobleaching and/or motion artifacts, and the difference was divided by the linear fit yielding the ΔF/F signal. Both the fluorescence signals and EEG/EMG signals were simultaneously recorded using the RZ5P amplifier. Fiber photometry recordings were excluded if the signals suddenly shifted, likely due to a loose connection between the optic fiber and patch cable.</p>

<title>Optogenetic manipulation</title>
<p>Sleep recordings were performed during the light phase (ZT2-8). Mice were tethered to bilateral patch cables connected with the lasers and a flexible recording cable to record EEG/EMG signals. The recording started after 30 min of habituation. For optogenetic inhibition experiments, 2 s step pulses (1-3 mW, 60 s intervals) were generated by a blue laser (473 nm, Laserglow) and sent through the optic fiber (200 um diameter, Thorlabs) connected to the ferrule on the animal’s head for 3 h (ZT2-5). TTL pulses to trigger the laser were controlled using a Raspberry Pi, which was controlled by a custom-programmed user interface programmed in Python. Following sustained inhibition, an additional 3 h (ZT5-8) recording was performed without laser stimulation (post-laser session). Baseline recordings were performed (without laser stimulation, ZT2-5), and counterbalanced across mice and days to avoid potential order effects. For each mouse, we collected 2-3 baseline and laser recordings each.</p>

<title>REMs restriction</title>
<p>We employed an automatic REMs detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Weber et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Stucynski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schott et al., 2023</xref>) and used a small vibrating motor to terminate/restrict REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cardis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Osorio-Forero et al., 2023</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/luthilab/IntanLuthiLab">https://github.com/luthilab/IntanLuthiLab</ext-link>). A small vibrating motor (DC 3V Mini Vibration Motor, diameter: 10mm, thickness: 3mm, BOJACK) with a soldered lobster claw clasp was attached to a small wire hook secured in the dental cement of each mouse head. The motors had cables that were connected to a Raspberry Pi which controlled the motor onset and offset.</p>
<p>The automatic REMs detection algorithm determined whether the mouse was in REMs or not based on real-time spectral analysis of the EEG/EMG signals. The onset of REMs was defined as the time point where the EEG θ/δ ratio exceeded a threshold (mean + 1 std of θ/δ), which was calculated from the same mouse using previous recordings. As soon as a REMs episode was detected, the small vibrating motor turned on to terminate REMs and consequently woke up the mouse. The motor vibrated until the REMs episode was terminated, i.e. when the θ/δ ratio dropped below its mean value or if the EMG amplitude surpassed a threshold (mean + 0.5 std of amplitude). All REMs restriction experiments started at ZT1.5 and lasted until ZT7.5. Following the restriction, motors were turned off and mice were permitted to enter recovery sleep.</p>
<p>To monitor the calcium activity during REMs restriction using fiber photometry, we performed manual REMs restriction to avoid potential motion artifacts caused by the vibrating motor that could interfere with the integrity of the fiber photometry signals. Briefly mice underwent a 4 h automatic REMs restriction protocol as described above. During the last 2 h of restriction, REMs was detected manually based on the EEG and EMG signal by an experimenter who gently pulled on a string attached to the hook secured in the dental cement of the mouse head. To avoid potential photobleaching, the recording was performed during the last 1 h of REMs restriction and 1 h of REMs rebound. Each mouse also underwent a baseline recording on a separate day. The order of REMs restriction and baseline recordings were varied to minimize the impact of the experimental sequence on the results.</p>
<p>We also performed automatic REMs restriction combined with optogenetic inhibition. Each mouse underwent REMs restriction for 6 h, and we continuously delivered 2 s step pulses (1-3 mw, 473 nm, Laserglow) at 60 s intervals during the last 3 h of restriction (ZT4.5-7.5). Following REMs restriction, the recovery sleep was recorded.</p>

<title>Analysis of ΔF/F activity at brain state transitions and during NREMs</title>
<p>To calculate the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons relative to brain state transitions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), we aligned the ΔF/F signals for transitions across all mice relative to the time point of the transition (t = 0 s). For each NREMs→ REMs or NREMs→Wake transition, we ensured that the preceding NREMs episodes lasted for at least 60 s, only interrupted by short awakenings (≤ 20 s). To determine the time point at which the activity significantly started to increase or decrease, we used the first 10 s of NREMs as baseline. For REMs→Wake and Wake→NREMs transitions, the preceding REMs or Wake episode was at least 30 s long. Using one-way rm ANOVA, we tested whether the activity (downsampled to 10s bins) within each 10 s bin was significantly modulated throughout the transition (from -60 to 30 s). Finally, using pairwise t-tests with Holm-Bonferroni correction, we determined the time bins for which the activity significantly differed from the baseline bin (activity for bin -60 to -50 s). The time point for a given 10 s bin was set to its midpoint. To account for multiple comparisons, we divided the significance level (α = 0.05) by the number of comparisons (Bonferroni correction). To analyze the activity throughout NREMs, we normalized the duration of all NREMs episodes and the corresponding ΔF/F signals to the same length.</p>

<title>Spectrotemporal correlation analysis</title>
<p>To identify features of the EEG spectrogram associated with POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN calcium activity, we adapted a receptive field model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Weber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schott et al., 2023</xref>) to predict POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neural activity from the spectrogram. Intuitively, we estimated a spectrotemporal filter using linear regression that predicts for each time point the POA<sup>GAD2</sup> →TMN calcium response. In more detail, we first computed the EEG spectrogram <italic>E(f<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>j</sub>)</italic> using 2 s windows with 80 % overlap, resulting in a time resolution <italic>dt</italic> of 400 ms. Each spectrogram frequency was normalized by its mean power across the recording, and the parameter <italic>E(f<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>j</sub>)</italic> specifies the relative amplitude of frequency <italic>f<sub>i</sub></italic> for time point <italic>t<sub>j</sub></italic>. We then downsampled the ΔF/F response using the same time resolution as for the spectrogram, and extracted all time bins with REMs, NREMs or wake for analysis.</p>
<p>To predict the calcium response, the EEG spectrogram was linearly filtered with the kernel <italic>H(f<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>l</sub>)</italic>. In analogy to receptive fields estimated using similar approaches for sensory neurons, we used the term “spectral field” for <italic>H(f<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>l</sub>)</italic>. The spectral field can be described as the set of coefficients that optimally relate the neural activity at time <italic>t<sub>j</sub></italic> to the EEG spectrogram at time <italic>t<sub>j +</sub> <sub>l</sub></italic>, where <italic>l</italic> represents the lag between the time points of the spectrogram and the neural response. The estimated frequency components of <italic>H(f<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>l</sub>)</italic> ranged from <italic>f<sub>1</sub></italic> = 0.5 Hz to <italic>f<sub>nf</sub></italic> = 20 Hz, while the time axis ranged from -<italic>n<sub>T</sub></italic> * <italic>dt</italic> = -50 s to <italic>n<sub>T</sub></italic> * <italic>dt</italic> = 50 s. Thus, <italic>H(f<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>l</sub>)</italic> comprises <italic>n<sub>f</sub></italic> frequencies and 2 * <italic>n<sub>T</sub></italic> + 1 time bins over a window from -50 to +50 seconds relative to the neural response. The convolution of the EEG spectrogram with the spectral field can be expressed as

<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="554341v1_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
The scalar parameter <italic>r</italic> denotes a constant offset, and <italic>r</italic><sup>^</sup>(<italic>t<sub>j</sub></italic>) denotes the predicted neural response. The optimal spectral field <italic>H(f<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>l</sub>)</italic> minimizes the mean-squared error between the predicted and measured neural response at time <italic>t<sub>j</sub></italic>. To account for the large number of estimated parameters, we included a regularization term in the error function, which penalizes large kernel components and therefore guards against overfitting of the model. The spectral field for each recording was estimated using 5-fold cross-validation to determine the regularization parameter (λ) that optimized the average model performance on the test sets. Kernels were averaged across all recordings for individual animals; the spectrotemporal correlation in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> represents the mean spectral field across all mice.</p>

<title>Power spectral density and power estimation</title>
<p>The power spectral density (PSD) of the EEG was computed using Welch’s method with the Hanning window for sliding, half-overlapping 2 s intervals. To calculate the power within a given frequency band, we approximated the corresponding area under the spectral density curve using a midpoint Riemann sum. To compute the EMG amplitude, we calculated the PSD of the EMG and integrated frequencies between 5 - 100 Hz. To test whether laser stimulation changed the spectral density during a specific brain state, we determined for each mouse the δ, θ or σ power for that state with and without laster. To compare the PSD between experimental and control mice, we calculated the δ, θ, and σ power with and without laser stimulation for each mouse and normalized the power values with laser by the power obtained for epochs without laser.</p>

<title>Detection of calcium transients</title>
<p>To detect calcium transients, we first filtered the ΔF/F signal with a zero-lag, 4th order digital Butterworth filter with cutoff frequency of 1/20 Hz. Next, prominent peaks in the signal were detected using the function scipy.find_peaks provided by the open source Python library scipy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scipy.org">https://scipy.org</ext-link>). As parameter for the peak prominence, we used 0.15 * distance between the 1st and 99th percentile of the distribution of the ΔF/F signal. A transient was defined as occurring during NREMs and REMs, if the peak overlapped with NREMs or REMs respectively. The calcium transient amplitude was calculated by using the values 10 s preceding the peak and subtracting that from the peak values at 0 s.</p>

<title>Statistical tests</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using the python modules (scipy.stats, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scipy.org">https://scipy.org</ext-link>; pingouin, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pingouin-stats.org">https://pingouin-stats.org</ext-link>) and Prism v9.5.0.0 (GraphPad Software Inc). We did not predetermine sample sizes, but cohorts were similarly sized as in other relevant sleep studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jego et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). All data collection was randomized and counterbalanced. All data are reported as mean <underline>+</underline> s.e.m. A (corrected) p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all comparisons. Data were compared using unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests, paired <italic>t</italic>-tests, one-way ANOVAs, or two-way ANOVAs followed by multiple comparisons as appropriate. The statistical results for the figures are presented in the <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>, and Figure legends.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This paper identifies GABA cells in the preoptic hypothalamus which are involved in REM sleep rebound (the increase in REM sleep) after selective REM sleep deprivation. By calcium photometry, these cells are most active during REM, and show more claim signals during REM deprivation, suggesting they respond to &quot;REM pressure&quot;. Inhibiting these cells ontogenetically diminishes REM sleep. The optogenetic and photometry work is carried out to a high standard, the paper is well-written, and the findings are interesting.</p>
<p>Points that could be addressed or discussed:</p>
<p>
1. The circuit mechanism for REM rebound is not defined. How do the authors see REM rebound as working from the POAGAD2 cells? Although the POAGAD2 does project to the TMN, the actual REM rebound could be mediated by a projection of these cells elsewhere. This could be discussed.</p>
<p>2. The &quot;POAGAD2 to TMN&quot; name for these cells is somewhat confusing. The authors chose this name because they approach the POAGAD2 cells via retrograde AAV labelling (rAAV injected into the TMN). However, the name also seems to imply that neurons (perhaps histamine neurons) in the TMN are involved in the REM rebound, but there is no evidence in the paper that this is the case. Although it is nice to see from the photometry studies that the histamine cells are selectively more active (as expected) in NREM sleep (Fig. S2), I could not logically see how this was a relevant finding to REM rebound or the subject of the paper. There are many other types of cells in the TMN area, not just histamine cells, so are the authors suggesting that these non-histamine cells in the TMN could be involved?</p>
<p>3. It is a puzzle why most of the neurons in the POA seem to have their highest activity in REM, as also found by Miracca et al 2022, yet presumably some of these cells are going to be involved in NREM sleep as well. Could the same POAGAD2-TMN cells identified by the authors also be involved in inducing NREM sleep-inhibiting histamine neurons (Chung et al). And some of these POA cells will also be involved in NREM sleep homeostasis (e.g. Ma et al Curr Biol)? Is NREM sleep rebound necessary before getting REM sleep rebound? Indeed, can these two things (NREM and REM sleep rebound) be separated?</p>
<p>4. Is it possible to narrow down the POA area where the GAD2 cells are located more precisely?</p>
<p>5. It would be ideal to further characterize these particular GAD2 cells by RT-PCR or RNA seq. Which other markers do they express?</p>

<p>Maurer et al investigated the contribution of GAD2+ neurons in the preoptic area (POA), projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), to REM sleep regulation. They applied an elegant design to monitor and manipulate the activity of this specific group of neurons: a GAD2-Cre mouse, injected with retrograde AAV constructs in the TMN, thereby presumably only targeting GAD2+ cells projecting to the TMN. Using this set-up in combination with technically challenging techniques including EEG with photometry and REM sleep deprivation, the authors found that this cell-type studied becomes active shortly (≈40sec) prior to entering REM sleep and remains active during REM sleep. Moreover, optogenetic inhibition of GAD2+ cells inhibits REM sleep by a third and also impairs the rebound in REM sleep in the following hour. Despite a few reservations or details that would benefit from further clarification (outlined below), the data makes a convincing case for the role of GAD2+ neurons in the POA projecting to the TMN in REM sleep regulation.</p>
<p>The authors found that optogenetic inhibition of GAD2+ cells suppressed REM sleep in the hour following the inhibition (e.g. Fig2 and Fig4). If the authors have the data available, it would be important to include the subsequent hours in the rebound time (e.g. from ZT8.5 to ZT24) to test whether REM sleep rebound remains impaired, or recovers, albeit with a delay.</p>
<p>REM sleep is under tight circadian control (e.g. Wurts et al., 2000 in rats; Dijk, Czeisler 1995 in humans). To contextualize the results, it would be important to mention that it is not clear if the role of the manipulated neurons in REM sleep regulation hold at other circadian times of the day.</p>
<p>The effect size of the REM sleep deprivation using the vibrating motor method is unclear. In FigS4-D, the experimental mice reduce their REM sleep to 3% whereas the control mice spend 6% in REM sleep. In Fig4, mice are either subjected to REM sleep deprivation with the vibrating motor (controls), or REM sleep deprivations + optogenetics (experimental mice). The control mice (vibrating motor) in Fig4 spend 6% of their time in REM sleep, which is double the amount of REM sleep compared to the mice receiving the same treatment in FigS4-D. Can the authors clarify the origin of this difference in the text?</p>
