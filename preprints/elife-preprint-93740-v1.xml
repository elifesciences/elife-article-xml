<title>Abstract</title><p>When and under which conditions antibiotic combination therapy decelerates rather than accelerates resistance evolution is not well understood. We examined the effect of combining antibiotics on within-patient resistance development across various bacterial pathogens and antibiotics.</p>
<p>We searched CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed for (quasi)-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from database inception to November 24<sup>th</sup>, 2022. Trials comparing antibiotic treatments with different numbers of antibiotics were included. A patient was considered to have acquired resistance if, at the follow-up culture, a resistant bacterium was detected that had not been present in the baseline culture. We combined results using a random effects model and performed meta-regression and stratified analyses. The trials’ risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool.</p>
<p>42 trials were eligible and 29, including 5054 patients, were qualified for statistical analysis. In most trials, resistance development was not the primary outcome and studies lacked power. The combined odds ratio (OR) for the acquisition of resistance comparing the group with the higher number of antibiotics with the comparison group was 1.23 (95% CI 0.68-2.25), with substantial between-study heterogeneity (<italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic> =77%). We identified tentative evidence for potential beneficial or detrimental effects of antibiotic combination therapy for specific pathogens or medical conditions.</p>
<p>The evidence for combining a higher number of antibiotics compared to fewer from RCTs is scarce and overall, is compatible with both benefit or harm. Trials powered to detect differences in resistance development or well-designed observational studies are required to clarify the impact of combination therapy on resistance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antibiotics are one of the most significant advances in modern medicine, prescribed to treat various bacterial infections in both humans and animals and prevent infections, such as surgical site infections or opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). However, this medical breakthrough is at risk due to the rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance and an inadequate pipeline of new antibiotics. This disturbing trend threatens to undermine the effectiveness of antibiotics and poses a severe challenge to public health worldwide.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) Hence, we need a more prudent use of antibiotics, and where antibiotics are needed, we need treatment strategies that reduce the risk that resistance emerges or spreads. Different strategies for the optimal use of antibiotics have been investigated theoretically and empirically.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) Antibiotic combination therapy, i.e., the simultaneous administration of several antibiotics, is frequently discussed as a promising strategy for avoiding resistance evolution.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) Importantly, it is the standard of care for some bacterial pathogens, such as <italic>H. pylori</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), or <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). However, it is unclear whether the effect of combination therapy on resistance is consistent for different pathogens.</p>
<p>There are several motivations for the use of antibiotic combination therapy, including to broaden the antibiotic spectrum in empirical treatment and reducing antibiotic resistance development.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) The simultaneous occurrence of resistance mutations to multiple drugs is less likely than resistance to single drugs. Combination therapy should, therefore, reduce the development of resistance.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) This expectation is supported by viral infections such as HIV, where multiple point mutations are required for resistance to combination antiviral therapy. However, it is less clear to what extent this reasoning extends to antibiotic therapy, where the same mechanism can facilitate bacterial survival against multiple antibiotics,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) and where horizontal transfer of resistance may occur. Indeed, the benefit of combining antibiotics for reducing resistance is debated for bacterial infections.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) Using more antibiotics overall could lead to more resistance, as overall antibiotic consumption correlates with resistance.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>)</p>
<p>Two meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta-lactam monotherapy to beta-lactam and aminoglycoside combination therapy found no differences in resistance development.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) However, the effect of combining antibiotics on within-patient resistance development across many bacterial pathogens and various antibiotic combinations has not been addressed. Even though within-patient antibiotic resistance development is rare, it may contribute to the emergence and spread of resistance. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to (i) test the effect of antibiotic combination therapy on within-patient resistance development and (ii) evaluate which factors affect the performance of combination therapy, as e.g. pathogen identity, treatment design and resistance assessment.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The search identified 3082 articles, which decreased to 1837 after deduplication. A total of 488 studies were eligible for full-text review, of which 41 studies qualified for inclusion. The screening of the citations of the 41 studies identified one additional eligible study, for a total of 42 studies, 40 RCTs and two quasi-RCTs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>) Twenty-nine studies could be included in the meta-analysis; 13 were excluded due to zero events in both treatment arms.</p>

<p>The included studies were published between 1977 and 2021, with a median publication year of 1995 and few recent studies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2 A</xref>). The development of antibiotic resistance was typically not the main outcome: only nine studies (21%) explicitly defined a resistance outcome (SI p 6). Consequently, most studies did not have the statistical power to detect a large effect on within-patient resistance development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2 B</xref>, SI p 14). Twenty-two (52%) focused on a specific pathogen species (resistant <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>H. pylori</italic>, Mtb, methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) or pathogen group (MAC, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> subsp. <italic>enterica</italic> serotype Thyphi, or <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> subsp. <italic>enterica</italic> serotype Parthypi A).</p>

<p>The five most frequent reasons for antibiotic administration were treatment or prophylaxis of urinary tract infections (UTIs) (6 studies, 14%), MRSA (5 studies, 12%), <italic>H.</italic> pylori, MAC, and prophylaxis for blood cancer patients with four studies (10%) respectively. Twenty-three of the included studies (55%) compared treatment arms that with at least one administered antibiotic in common; the remaining studies compared treatment arms with no overlap in administered antibiotics (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). For the outcome acquisition of resistance, only two of all 42 studies had a low overall risk of bias according to the risk of bias assessment. Twelve (29%) were at high risk of bias, 28 (67%) at moderate risk of bias (SI p 3).</p>
<p>The overall pooled OR for acquisition of resistance comparing a lower number of antibiotics versus a higher one was 1.23 (95% CI 0.68 – 2.25), with substantial heterogeneity between studies (<italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic> =77.4%). The latter OR was compatible with the OR for <italic>de novo</italic> emergence of resistance (pooled OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.34 – 1.59; <italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic>=77%). Since the results for the two resistance outcomes are comparable, our focus in the following is on the acquisition of resistance (details on emergence of resistance can be found in the SI p 2, p 4, p 8).</p>
<p>Stratified analyses revealed that a higher number of antibiotics performed better than a lower number in case of <italic>H. pylori</italic>, (pooled OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 – 0.55; <italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic> =41.7%, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>), and <italic>MAC</italic> (pooled OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 – 0.52; <italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic> =26.8%, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>), but worse in case of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (pooled OR 3.42, 95% CI 1.03 – 11.43; <italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic>=1.54%, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, a lower number of antibiotics performed better than a higher number if the compared treatment arms had no antibiotics in common (pooled OR 4.73, 95% CI 2.14 – 10.42; <italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic>=37%, SI p 7). In contrast, when restricting the analysis to studies with at least one common antibiotic in the treatment arms are pooled there was little evidence of a difference (pooled OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.28 – 1.07; <italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic> =74%, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>). When considering only resistance measurements of antibiotics common to both treatment arms instead of all resistance measurements, the arm with a higher number of antibiotics shows a benefit in comparison to the one with fewer (pooled OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 – 0.81; <italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic>=75%, SI p 6). If the study measured the acquisition of resistance of both gram negative and positive bacteria, fewer antibiotics performed better (pooled OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.08 – 10.58; <italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic>=38.35%, SI p 5). Other sub-group analyses did not show any harm or benefit of using a higher number of antibiotics. The results for all subgroup analyses are presented in the supplement (SI p 4). The multi-model inference for our meta-regression showed that the only significant factor influencing the outcome acquisition of resistance is whether at least one common antibiotic was used in the comparator arms (for details see SI p 8).</p>

<p>The inspection of the funnel plot and the modified Egger’s test showed no indication of a publication bias (SI p 4). The results were largely robust to the choice of the random effects model (SI p 8). The probability of the secondary outcome &quot;alterations of the prescribed treatment due to adverse events&quot;, was higher using more antibiotics in comparison to fewer (pooled OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.12 – 2.31; <italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic>=5%; SI p 10). In 15 studies (36%), the proportion of patients with alterations of the prescribed treatment due to adverse events was reported, with three studies (20%) reporting zero cases in both treatment arms. All other analyses of secondary outcomes showed no indication of harm or benefit of treating with a higher number of antibiotics (SI p 9).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We performed a meta-analysis of RCTs and quasi-RCTs not limited to a particular bacterial species, specific condition, or antibiotic combinations to assess the effect of antibiotic combination therapy on within-patient resistance development. Our analysis could not identify any benefit or harm of using a higher or a lower number of antibiotics regarding within-patient resistance development. However, we found some evidence that combining antibiotics may be beneficial or harmful for specific pathogens or infection types. Acquisition of resistance was rarely a primary objective of the included RCTs. Hence, they were typically not designed to detect differences in resistance development between treatment arms and underpowered for this endpoint. Therefore, the absence of evidence does not mean that there is convincing evidence for the lack of an effect of using more or fewer antibiotics on resistance development but rather highlights a knowledge gap. This is remarkable given that the general rise of resistance is an increasing concern(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>) and a priority area for health policy and public health.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>)</p>
<p>Our analysis showed that combining antibiotics reduced resistance development for <italic>H. pylori</italic> or MAC, in line with the current standard of care.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>) Surprisingly, we found only two studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria for Mtb(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), which may be considered the prime example of effective antibiotic combination therapy. The limited number of Mtb studies may be because antibiotic administration commonly varies during Mtb treatment, which conflicted with our inclusion criteria that necessitated a consistent treatment regimen for susceptibility measurements (see SI, page 2). Both eligible Mtb studies were excluded from the analysis due to the absence of any events in either treatment arm.</p>
<p>Our main result, the absence of a general effect of combining antibiotics on resistance development, aligns with the two previous meta-analyses.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) With 42 trials in our systematic review and 29 in the meta-analysis, our study provided a comprehensive assessment of the effect of antibiotic combination therapy on within-patient resistance. Whereas previous meta-analyses focused on a combination of specific antibiotic classes and included fewer than ten studies each, our study aimed to assess the general effect of combining antibiotics on resistance evolution across different bacterial pathogens. By including trials with different antibiotic combinations and bacterial pathogens, we increased clinical and statistical heterogeneity. We accounted for many sources of heterogeneity using stratification and meta-regression, but analyses were limited by missing information and sparse data.</p>
<p>Our findings have implications for the design of future studies of resistance development. Generally, the development of resistance within a patient is a rare event. However, even small differences could be relevant at the population level. To obtain reliable estimates of such differences and to better understand the factors influencing them, very large RCTs would be needed, which systematically investigate the development of antibiotic resistance and include resistance testing of each administered antibiotic. To better evaluate the effect of combination therapy, especially more RCTs would be needed where the basic antibiotic treatment is consistent across both treatment arms, i.e. the antibiotics used in both treatment arms should be identical, except for the additional antibiotic added in the comparator arm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). As such RCTs are costly and associated with high hurdles, the analysis of cohort studies could be an alternative approach. Over 25 years ago, Fish et al. published a systematic summary of prospective observational studies reporting data on resistance development, including antibiotic combination therapy.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>) Similarly, today, relevant cohort studies could be analysed collaboratively using various modern statistical methods to address confounding by indication and other biases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>).</p>
<p>The main strength of this study is its comprehensive and systematic approach. For one, it allowed identifying a knowledge gap regarding the effect of antibiotic combination therapy on resistance development. Further, our study highlights several issues in the evidence base evaluating antibiotic combination therapy and resistance development. The included trials did not always test for susceptibility against all administered antibiotics (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Some antibiotics might have had reduced potency or were ineffective due to pre-existing resistance mutations. Furthermore, in studies where treatment was not targeted against a specific pathogen, some antibiotics may have been inactive against the causative pathogen due to intrinsic resistance. Indeed, one of the reasons for using combination therapy is to broaden the bacterial spectrum for empirical therapy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), which could contribute to an increased risk of antibiotic resistance spread.</p>
<p>Our study had several limitations. First, despite our systematic search, we might have missed relevant studies. Since resistance development is typically not a primary endpoint and often not reported systematically, relevant trials are challenging to identify. Our search strategy aimed to identify a broad range of trials considering resistance development. However, as a trade-off, our search strategy might have missed trials addressing a specific medical condition or drug combination. Second, our systematic review and meta-analysis included many older studies that did not follow the relevant reporting guidelines(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), thereby hampering data extraction and potentially introducing bias. Third, it is often challenging to discern the specific mechanisms by which resistance develops based on the data from clinical trials. This includes distinguishing whether resistance arises <italic>de novo</italic>, if the pathogen acquires resistance through horizontal gene transfer, if the patient becomes newly infected with a resistant pathogen, or if the pathogen was present but undetected at the beginning of treatment. These scenarios can impact the effectiveness of combination therapy. For example, combination therapy may be more likely to select any pre-existing resistant pathogens compared to monotherapy due to the use of multiple antibiotics. We addressed some of this heterogeneity by employing two different measures of resistance (see SI, page 2). Furthermore, the variation in standards that classify bacteria as susceptible or resistant adds another layer of heterogeneity alongside the technical limitations in detecting resistance development.</p>
<p>In conclusion, combination therapy offers potential advantages and disadvantages regarding resistance evolution and spread. On the one hand, combination therapy typically increases the genetic barrier to resistance, and it has become the standard therapy for pathogens notorious for resistance evolution. Therefore, combination therapy remains a plausible candidate strategy to slow down resistance evolution. On the other hand, combination therapy generates selection pressure for resistance to multiple antibiotics simultaneously and could, therefore, accelerate resistance evolution – especially in the microbiome. Given the critical nature of this context, it is profoundly disconcerting that there is a lack of evidence elucidating the impact of combining antibiotics on the development of resistance</p>

<title>Inclusion criteria and search strategy</title>
<p>We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the evidence on the effect of antibiotic combination therapy on resistance development. We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs comparing treatments with a higher number of antibiotics to treatments with a lower number of antibiotics. Studies were classified as quasi-RCTs if the allocation of participants to study arms was not truly random. We did not consider antiseptics or compounds supporting the activity of antibiotics, such as beta-lactam inhibitors as antibiotics itself. Whereas the antibiotic substances administered within one treatment arm had to be the same for all patients, the antibiotics could differ between treatment arms. We required baseline and follow-up cultures with resistance measurements to determine the treatment impact on resistance. We considered only antibiotic treatment regimens fixed for the period between two resistance measurements. Hence, we excluded sequential and cycling regimens.</p>
<p>We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception up to 24.11.2022, using keywords, medical subject headings (MeSH), and EMTREE terms related to bacterial infection, antibiotics, combination therapy, resistance and RCTs. We excluded complementary and alternative medicine and bismuth. The search strategy is detailed in the SI (p 26). After a systematic deduplication process,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>) VNK (or CW) and BS independently screened the titles and abstracts, and, if potentially eligible, the full texts. Any discrepancies between VNK (or CW) and BS were discussed and resolved. At full-text screening, we excluded articles that were not accessible in English or German. We screened the references of eligible studies and the trials included in two previous meta-analyses.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) We followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>) and registered our protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42020187257).</p>

<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>We used two definitions for the primary outcome resistance. A broader definition, “acquisition of resistance”, and a stricter “<italic>de novo</italic> emergence of resistance” definition, where the latter is a subset of the former. A patient was considered to have acquired resistance if, at the follow-up culture a resistant bacterium was detected that was not present in the baseline culture. <italic>De novo</italic> emergence of resistance was defined as the detection of a resistant bacterium that was present at baseline but sensitive. Additional secondary outcomes included mortality from all causes and infection, treatment failure overall, treatment failure due to resistance, treatment change due to adverse effects, and acquisition/<italic>de novo</italic> emergence of resistance against non-administered antibiotics. The SI (p 2, p 18) provides further details.</p>

<title>Data extraction and analysis</title>
<p>VNK (or CW) and BS independently extracted all study data using a standardised form (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/gwefy/?view_only=f6a4c1f4c79241038b203bd03c8e1845">https://osf.io/gwefy/?view_only=f6a4c1f4c79241038b203bd03c8e1845</ext-link>). The data extracted included the proportion of patients who developed the two primary outcomes and the secondary outcomes and study characteristics such as type of trial (RCT or quasi-RCT), follow-up and treatment duration, number of antibiotics in the treatment arms, type of antibiotic, and presence of comorbidities. Any discrepancies in data extraction were discussed and resolved.</p>
<p>We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing a higher with a lower number of antibiotics for each study. We combined ORs using a modified version of the Simmonds and Higgins random effects model.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>) If a study had more than two eligible treatment arms, they were merged for statistical analysis. Studies with zero events in both treatment arms were excluded from the statistical analysis. We used subgroup analyses and meta-regressions with multi-model inference to examine the influence of pre-specified variables on summary ORs. Variables included whether the antibiotic(s) used in the arm with the lower number of antibiotics are also part of the arm(s) with the higher number of antibiotics, the number of antibiotics administered, the age of the antibiotics (time since market entry), the administration of other non-antibiotic drugs, whether participants had specific comorbidities or were in intensive care, gram-status of the tested pathogens, and the length of antibiotic treatment and follow-up. We extended our predefined analysis regarding the reason for antibiotic treatment/type of pathogen, which was initially restricted to only <italic>H. pylori</italic> and Mtb, as we found enough studies to stratify by other conditions/pathogens. We furthermore performed post-hoc subgroup analyses to examine the following factors: treatment of resistant pathogens, additional antibiotic administration besides the fixed treatment, and the way of antibiotic administration (SI p 14).</p>
<p>Between study heterogeneity was estimated with <italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic>, using the criteria for <italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic>specified in Higgins et al. for classifying the degree of heterogeneity.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>) CW and BS assessed each study’s quality for the main outcomes using the Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2, SI p 7).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>) To assess publication bias, we visually inspected the funnel plot and a modified Egger’s test (SI p 10). We performed sensitivity analyses on the model choice (SI p 8), and risk of bias (SI p 9), and performed a post-hoc trial sequential analysis (SI p 17). Statistical analyses and visualisations were done in R (version 4.2.1) using packages <italic>metafor</italic> and <italic>MuMIn</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>)</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The investigators have performed a state-of-the art systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that may help to answer the research question: if administration of multiple antibiotics simultaneously prevents antibiotic resistance development in individuals. The amount of studies eligible for analysis is very low, and within that low number, there is huge variability in bug-drug combinations studied and most studies had a high risk of bias, further limiting the capability of meta-analysis to answer the research question. In addition, based on I2 values there is also huge statistical heterogeneity between outcomes of studies compared, further limiting the predictive value of meta-analysis. In fact, the only 2 studies meeting all eligibility criteria addressed the treatment of mycobacterium tuberculosis, for which the research question is hardly applicable. The authors, therefore, conclude that &quot;our analysis could not identify any benefit or harm of using a higher or a lower number of antibiotics regarding within-patient resistance development.&quot; Apart from articulating this knowledge gap, the findings will not have consequences for patient care, but may stimulate the scientific community to better address this research question in future studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether the frequency of emergence of resistance is different if combination antibiotic therapy is used compared to fewer antibiotics. The review shows that there is currently insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion due to the limited sample size. High-quality studies evaluating appropriate antimicrobial resistance endpoints are needed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>

The strengths of the manuscript are that the article addresses a relevant research question that is often debated. The article is well-written and the methodology used is valid. The review shows that there is currently insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion due to the limited sample size. High-quality studies evaluating appropriate antimicrobial resistance endpoints are needed. I have several comments and suggestions for the manuscript.</p>

Weaknesses of the manuscript are the large clinical and statistical heterogeneity and the lack of clear definitions of acquisition of resistance. Both these weaknesses complicate the interpretation of the study results.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>
My main concern about the manuscript is the extent of both clinical and statistical heterogeneity, which complicates the interpretation of the results. I don't understand some of the antibiotic comparisons that are included in the systematic review. For instance the study by Paul et al (50), where vancomycin (as monotherapy) is compared to co-trimoxazole (as combination therapy). Emergence (or selection) of co-trimoxazole in S. aureus is in itself much more common than vancomycin resistance. It is logical and expected to have more resistance in the co-trimoxazole group compared to the vancomycin group, however, this difference is due to the drug itself and not due to co-trimoxazole being a combination therapy. It is therefore unfair to attribute the difference in resistance to combination therapy. Another example is the study by Walsh (71) where rifampin + novobiocin is compared to rifampin + co-trimoxazole. There is more emergence of resistance in the rifampin + co-trimoxazole group but this could be attributed to novobiocin being a different type of antibiotic than co-trimoxazole instead of the difference being attributed to combination therapy. To improve interpretation and reduce heterogeneity my suggestion would be to limit the primary analyses to regimens where the antibiotics compared are the same but in one group one or more antibiotic(s) are added (i.e. A versus A+B). The other analyses are problematic in their interpretation and should be clearly labeled as secondary and their interpretation discussed.</p>
<p>Another concern is about the definition of acquisition of resistance, which is unclear to me. If for example meropenem is administered and the follow-up cultures show Enterococcus species (which is intrinsically resistant to meropenem), does this constitute acquisition of resistance? If so, it would be misleading to determine this as an acquisition of resistance, as many people are colonized with Enterococci and selection of Enterococci under therapy is very common. If this is not considered as the acquisition of resistance please include how the acquisition of resistance is defined per included study. Table S1 is not sufficiently clear because it often only contains how susceptibility testing was done but not which antibiotics were tested and how a strain was classified as resistant or susceptible.</p>
<p>Line 85: &quot;Even though within-patient antibiotic resistance development is rare, it may contribute to the emergence and spread of resistance.&quot;</p>
<p>
Depending on the bug-drug combination, there is great variation in the propensity to develop within-patient antibiotic resistance. For example: within-patient development of ciprofloxacin resistance in Pseudomonas is fairly common while within-patient development of methicillin resistance in S. aureus is rare. Based on these differences, large clinical heterogeneity is expected and it is questionable where these studies should be pooled.</p>
<p>Line 114: &quot;The overall pooled OR for acquisition of resistance comparing a lower number of antibiotics versus a higher one was 1.23 (95% CI 0.68 - 2.25), with substantial heterogeneity between studies (I2=77.4%)&quot;</p>
<p>
What consequential measures did the authors take after determining this high heterogeneity? Did they explore the source of this large heterogeneity? Considering this large heterogeneity, do the authors consider it appropriate to pool these studies?</p>

<p>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The investigators have performed a state-of-the art systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that may help to answer the research question: if administration of multiple antibiotics simultaneously prevents antibiotic resistance development in individuals. The amount of studies eligible for analysis is very low, and within that low number, there is huge variability in bug-drug combinations studied and most studies had a high risk of bias, further limiting the capability of meta-analysis to answer the research question. In addition, based on I2 values there is also huge statistical heterogeneity between outcomes of studies compared, further limiting the predictive value of meta-analysis. In fact, the only 2 studies meeting all eligibility criteria addressed the treatment of mycobacterium tuberculosis, for which the research question is hardly applicable. The authors, therefore, conclude that &quot;our analysis could not identify any benefit or harm of using a higher or a lower number of antibiotics regarding within-patient resistance development.&quot; Apart from articulating this knowledge gap, the findings will not have consequences for patient care, but may stimulate the scientific community to better address this research question in future studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<p>The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether the frequency of emergence of resistance is different if combination antibiotic therapy is used compared to fewer antibiotics. The review shows that there is currently insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion due to the limited sample size.

I don't understand some of the antibiotic comparisons that are included in the systematic review.

It is therefore unfair to attribute the difference in resistance to combination therapy. Another example is the study by Walsh (71) where rifampin + novobiocin is compared to rifampin + co-trimoxazole. There is more emergence of resistance in the rifampin + co-trimoxazole group but this could be attributed to novobiocin being a different type of antibiotic than co-trimoxazole instead of the difference being attributed to combination therapy. To improve interpretation and reduce heterogeneity my suggestion would be to limit the primary analyses to regimens where the antibiotics compared are the same but in one group one or more antibiotic(s) are added (i.e. A versus A+B). The other analyses are problematic in their interpretation and should be clearly labeled as secondary and their interpretation discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the presence of statistical and clinical heterogeneity in our overall analysis. The decision to pursue this comprehensive examination was predefined in our previously published study protocol (PROSPERO CRD42020187257) and driven by our interest whether, despite some differences, we could either identify an overarching effect of combination therapy on resistance or identify factors that explain potential differences of the effect of combination therapy across pathogens/drugs. We indeed, find that heterogeneity is high, however identifying the driving factors of this heterogeneity is difficult as evidence is limited.</p>
<p>We carried out several subgroup analyses, e.g. explicitly focusing on specific pathogen groups and medical conditions or exploring heterogeneity in treatment arms (figure 3, supplementary materials section 6). However, it is important to highlight that the number of studies available for these subgroup analyses was low. Additionally, recognizing the high heterogeneity within treatment arms, we performed a subgroup analysis focusing solely on resistances of antibiotics common to both arms (supplementary material section 6.1.8; which would avoid comparisons such as the one between vancomycin and co-trimoxazole raised by the reviewer). Unfortunately, this also revealed substantial heterogeneity. While we aimed to address heterogeneity through these subgroup analyses, limitations arose due to the number of studies meeting specific criteria and the nature of data provided by these studies.</p>
<p>Moreover, regarding the concern on interpretation of co-trimoxazole as combination therapy, we acknowledge the confusion surrounding its classification as one or two antibiotics. Despite the common contemporary view of co-trimoxazole as a single antibiotic, we chose to consider it as two antibiotics due to historical practices, as observed in Black et al. (1982), where trimethoprim was compared to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. We recognize that this decision may lead to confusion and we consider conducting a further sensitivity analysis in the future version of this manuscript, exploring the possibility of considering co-trimoxazole as a single antibiotic. We agree that the slight trend of less antibiotics performing better overserved for MRSA, should not be over interpreted as this is driven by the two studies Walsh et al 1993 and Paul et al 2015 as pointed out by the reviewer. In lines 183-186 we discuss this issue that for better evaluation of antibiotic combination therapy, more studies which use identical antibiotics (i.e. A versus A+B) are needed. We will try to clarify and highlight this in the future version of the manuscript.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this potential ambiguity. Our definition of “acquisition of resistance” is agnostic to bacterial species and hence intrinsically resistant species can be included if they were only detected during the follow-up culture by the studies. We will clarify this in the definition of “acquisition of the resistance” in the manuscript (see l. 259-260). However, it was not always clear from the studies which pathogens were acquired or whether intrinsically resistant species were not reported. Therefore, we rely on the studies' specifications of resistant and non-resistant without further classifying data into intrinsic and non-intrinsic resistance. The outcome “acquisition of resistance” can be seen more of a risk assessment for having any resistant bacterium during or after treatment. In contrast, the outcome “emergence of resistance” is more rigorous, demanding the same species to be measured as more resistant during or after treatment.</p>

<p>Table S1 is not sufficiently clear because it often only contains how susceptibility testing was done but not which antibiotics were tested and how a strain was classified as resistant or susceptible.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Table S1, we omitted the listing of antibiotics for which susceptibility testing was performed, as this information is already presented in the main text (Table 1). However, we agree that linking this information better in a future version would benefit the understanding. Given the variability in methods used to assess resistance and the variability in drugs, the comparability of breakpoints is limited. Hence, we decided not to provide further details on this aspect so far.</p>

<p>We agree that our formulation neglects differences in prevalence of within-host resistance emergence depending on bug-drug combinations. We will correct this in our upcoming version. (i.e. we will correct our statement to: “Within-patient antibiotic resistance development, even if rare, can contribute to the emergence and spread of resistance.”)</p>

<p>Thank you for highlighting this lack of clarity. In our upcoming version, we will emphasize the sub-analyses conducted to explore heterogeneity (i.e., figure 3 and supplementary materials section 6). Nevertheless, these analyses faced limitations due to the scarcity of evidence and the data provided by the studies. Given the lack of appropriate evidence, it is hard to identify the source of heterogeneity. The decision to pool all studies was pre-specified in our previously published study protocol (PROSPERO CRD42020187257) and was motivated by the question whether there is a general effect of combination therapy on resistance development or identify factors that explain potential differences of the effect of combination therapy across bug-drug combinations.</p>
