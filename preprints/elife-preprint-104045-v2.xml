<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The function of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (<italic>hTERT</italic>) in the synthesis and maintenance of chromosome ends, or telomeres, is widely understood. Whether and how telomeres, on the other hand, influence <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation is relatively less studied. We found <italic>hTERT</italic> was transcriptionally altered depending on telomere length (TL). This resulted from TL-dependent binding of TRF2 between telomeres and the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter. <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter-bound TRF2 was non-telomeric and did not involve the looping of telomeres to the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter. Cell lines from different tissue types (fibrosarcoma (HT1080), colon cancer (HCT116), and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), engineered for either telomere elongation/shortening gave increase/decrease in <italic>hTERT</italic>, respectively. Mechanistically, we show <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter-bound non-telomeric TRF2 recruits the canonical PRC2-complex inducing repressor histone H3K27-trimethylation in a TL-dependent fashion. This was further supported by TL-dependent promoter activity from an exogenously inserted <italic>hTERT</italic> reporter. Increase in TL over days followed by gradual decline, resulted in activation followed by repression of <italic>hTERT</italic> in a concerted manner, further implicating TL as a key factor for <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation. Notably on reprogramming primary fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), TRF2 loss from the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter was evident along with telomere elongation and <italic>hTERT</italic> upregulation. Conversely, on telomere shortening in iPSCs, <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter-bound TRF2 was restored with marked reduction in <italic>hTERT</italic> further supporting the causal role of TL in <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription. Mechanisms of tight control of <italic>hTERT</italic> by TL shown here are likely to have major implications in telomere-related physiologies, particularly, cancer, ageing and pluripotency.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures comprising guanine-rich DNA sequences at the end of linear chromosomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The catalytic subunit of the ribonucleoprotein telomerase, <underline>h</underline>uman <underline>te</underline>lomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is necessary for replicating telomeric repeats to maintain telomeres(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Most cancer cells, in contrast to normal adult somatic cells, maintain telomeres through reactivation of <italic>hTERT</italic> (∼90% of cancers); alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is used in other cases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). <italic>hTERT</italic> therefore is tightly regulated at the epigenetic, transcriptional and translational levels(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of <italic>hTERT</italic> in the synthesis and maintenance of telomeres has been extensively studied(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Relatively recent work suggests how telomeres, on the other hand, might affect <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation. Physical looping of telomeres reported as the <underline>T</underline>elomeric <underline>P</underline>osition <underline>E</underline>ffect-<underline>o</underline>ver-long-<underline>d</underline>istance (TPE-OLD) was shown to extend up to 10 Mb of telomeres (sub-telomeric). The resulting telomeric heterochromatinization gave TL-dependent repression of sub-telomeric genes. The <italic>hTERT</italic> loci(∼1.2 Mb away from telomeres) was shown to be repressed through (TPE-OLD)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>); loss of looping in short telomeres induced <italic>hTERT</italic>. Notably, another conceptually distinct mechanism of TL-dependent gene regulation was reported which influenced genes spread throughout the genome: expression of genes distal from telomeres (for instance 60 Mb from the nearest telomere) was altered in a TL-dependent way, but without physical telomere looping interactions. First, non-telomeric binding of TRF2 was found to be extensive (&gt;20,000 sites), spread across the genome including promoters, and affected the epigenetic regulation of genes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).Second, the shortening or elongation of telomeres led to the release or sequestration of telomeric TRF2, respectively, thereby increasing or decreasing the availability of TRF2 at non-telomeric promoters and affecting gene expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The telomeric sequestration-dependent partitioning of telomeric versus non-telomeric TRF2 was proposed as the <underline>T</underline>elomere-<underline>S</underline>equestration-<underline>P</underline>artitioning (TSP) model, linking global gene regulation to telomeres (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Further, we found promoter-bound TRF2, not associated with telomeres (or non-telomeric), repressed <italic>hTERT</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Based on these, here we tested the hypothesis non-telomeric TRF2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter was TL-dependent. If so, this would molecularly link telomeres to <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation.</p>

    <caption><title>Graphical representation of the Telomere Sequestration Partitioning (TSP) model.</title>
        <p>The binding of TRF2 outside of telomeric regions (non-telomeric) is dependent on telomere length. When telomeres shorten, the occupancy of TRF2 at telomeres diminishes, resulting in increased TRF2 binding at non-telomeric sites. This shift in TRF2 distribution triggers epigenetic modifications at promoters showing telomere-dependent gene regulation.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Findings show TRF2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter increased with telomere shortening and downregulated <italic>hTERT</italic>. Conversely, reduced promoter TRF2 on telomere elongation upregulated <italic>hTERT</italic>; consistent with TSP described above. This was clear in multiple cell types engineered for either telomere elongation or shortening. An artificially inserted <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter (&gt;40 Mb from telomere) showed TRF2-dependent and telomere-sensitive regulation, confirming the mechanism to be independent of physical telomere looping. For a temporal model, we elongated telomeres using doxycycline (dox) inducible cells and stopped elongation after a desired time. TRF2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter decreased as telomeres elongated over several days, and increased again with telomere shortening when dox treatment was stopped. Together, these show a heretofore unknown mechanism of telomere-dependent regulation of <italic>hTERT</italic>, the sole enzyme necessary for synthesizing telomeres, revealing a cellular feedback machinery connecting telomeres and <italic>hTERT</italic> expression.</p>

<title>Telomere elongation upregulates <italic>hTERT</italic> through non-telomeric TRF2</title>
<p>To test if telomere length (TL) of cells affected TRF2 occupancy at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter, we first elongated telomeres in cancer cells under isogenic backgrounds (termed as <underline>S</underline>hort <underline>T</underline>elomere, ST or <underline>L</underline>ong <underline>T</underline>elomere, LT cells hereon). We used HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080-ST) or the TL-elongated version HT1080-LT (with constitutive expression of <italic>hTERT</italic> and the RNA component <italic>hTERC</italic>; previously characterized by others and us, see Methods)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). TL difference between HT1080-ST/LT was confirmed by flow cytometry (FACS, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and qPCR based method, Supplementary Fig 1A, and telomerase activity in Supplementary Fig 1B). Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of TRF2 gave significantly reduced occupancy of TRF2 on the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter in HT1080-LT compared to HT1080-ST cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, ChIP-qPCR spanning 0-300 bp upstream of transcription start site (TSS)).</p>

<p>TRF2-dependent H3K27 trimethylation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), including at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), was reported earlier by us: TRF2 silencing reduced the H3K27me3 mark at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter along with an increase in <italic>hTERT</italic> expression in the different cell lines tested(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Here, we asked if TRF2-dependent <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation was TL-sensitive. With TL elongation, the H3K27me3 mark was significantly reduced in HT1080-LT relative to the ST cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). As expected from reduced promoter H3K27 trimethylation, <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription was enhanced by &gt;3 folds in HT1080-LT relative to ST cells; 3’UTR-specific primers were used to distinguish from exogenously expressed <italic>hTERT</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>To rule out any effect of exogenous <italic>hTERT</italic> (HT1080-LT cells above) we sought to elongate telomeres in an <italic>hTERT-</italic>independent way. Using a reported method, telomeres were elongated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with guanine-rich telomeric repeat (GTR) oligonucleotides (characterized by others and us, see Methods; termed MDA-MB-231-ST/LT; TL difference quantified using FACS, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, and qPCR based method, Supplementary Fig 1A, and telomerase activity in Supplementary Fig 1B)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). MDA-MB-231-LT cells had lower TRF2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter compared to MDA-MB-231-ST cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Accordingly, H3K27 trimethylation at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter was reduced and <italic>hTERT</italic> upregulated by ∼3-folds in MDA-MB-231-LT compared to MDA-MB-231-ST cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C-D</xref>). Together, TL-sensitive regulation of <italic>hTERT</italic> was consistent in both HT1080 and MDA-MB-231 cells on telomere elongation.</p>

<title>Telomere shortening increased promoter TRF2 suppressing <italic>hTERT</italic> expression</title>
<p>As an alternative model, instead of elongation, we shortened TL in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells (with a higher average TL (∼5.6 kb) compared to HT1080 (∼4.5 kb) or MDA-MB-231 (∼3 kb) cells)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Two different methods were used for TL shortening:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(a) <italic>hTERT</italic>-independent, telomere-specific sgRNA guided CRISPR-Cas9 to trim telomeres (see Methods, scheme in Supplementary Fig 1C) or (b) depletion of the <italic>hTERC</italic> RNA (see Methods, TLs in HCT116-ST/LT quantified using FACS; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, and qPCR based method, Supplementary Fig 1A, and telomerase activity in Supplementary Fig 1B). The ST cells in both TL-shortened models had higher TRF2 binding on the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter compared to the HCT116-LT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Also, we found a higher repressor H3K27me3 mark at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter, as expected from increased TRF2, in ST compared to its LT counterpart in both the HCT116 models (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). As expected, an increase in the H3K27me3 repressor mark at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter resulted in &gt;2-fold reduced <italic>hTERT</italic> expression in ST relative to the HCT116-LT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
Previously, enhanced H3K27 trimethylation from TRF2-dependent binding of the RE1-silencing factor (REST) and EZH2 (the catalytic component of the PRC2 repressor complex) was reported at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Here we asked if the TL-sensitive H3K27 trimethylation resulted from altered REST/EZH2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter.</p>
<p>ChIP of REST showed enhanced occupancy at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter in ST relative to HT1080-LT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). EZH2 binding was also higher at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter in ST compared to HT1080-LT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). Similarly, in MDA-MB-231 cells, REST and EZH2 occupancy at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter was lower in LT compared to ST cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E-F</xref>). Further, an increase in REST and EZH2 binding at the hTERT promoter in ST relative to LT cells was clear in the HCT116-ST/LT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E-F</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Artificially inserted <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter is telomere sensitive</title>
<p>To further test TL-sensitive <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter activity we used a reporter cassette comprising 1300 bp of the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter upstream of the <italic>gaussia luciferase</italic> (<italic>Gluc</italic>) gene. The reporter was inserted at the CCR5 safe-harbour locus, 46 Mb away from the nearest telomere, using CRISPR in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>). TL in HEK293T cells was shortened using telomere-specific sgRNA guided CRISPR-Cas9 to trim telomeres (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>, see Methods, scheme in Supplementary Fig 1C). Higher TRF2 binding at the inserted <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter in ST compared to the HEK293-LT cells was clear (ChIP-qRT primers specific to the CCR5-<italic>hTERT</italic> insert were used; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>, I). Consistent with this, H3K27me3 deposition was relatively high in ST cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2J</xref>), and the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter-driven Gluc reporter activity was reduced in the ST relative to the LT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2K</xref>). Together, these show TL-dependent <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation through non-telomeric TRF2 as a likely intrinsic mechanism.</p>

<title>Temporally elongated or shortened telomeres up or downregulate <italic>hTERT</italic></title>
<p>We next studied the effect of time-dependent (temporal) TL elongation/shortening, <italic>i.e.</italic>, TL increase followed by a decrease in a continuous way. For this, we made stable HT1080 cells with doxycycline-inducible hTERT. Following induction of hTERT and telomerase activity (Day 0), we checked TL through days 6/8/10/16 and 24 (Supplementary Fig 2A left panel). Gradual increase in TL to &gt;5-fold by Day 10 (relative to Day 0) was evident; beyond Day 10 despite dox induction (and relatively high telomerase activity) further TL elongation was not seen (Supplementary Fig 2A-B left panels; ++/-- denotes presence/absence of dox, respectively).</p>
<p>For detailed analysis we focused on days 0,10 and 24 as representative time points; with discontinuation of dox after Day 10 (Dox-HT1080, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Following the withdrawal of dox after Day 10, TL returned to roughly within 1.6-fold of the initial (Day 0) state by Day 24 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> and Supplementary Fig 2A left panel).</p>

<p>TRF2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter decreased at Day 10 with TL elongation. Conversely, as TL shortened beyond Day 10, TRF2 occupancy on the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter was regained on Day 24; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Notably, this showed TRF2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter to be temporally controlled as a function of TL. Second, this further showed that <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter-bound TRF2 was non-telomeric because telomere-associated TRF2 would increase with TL elongation (and looping), instead of decrease as seen here.</p>
<p>We then examined the occupancy of REST and EZH2 at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter at days 0, 10, and 24: decrease in occupancy of both REST and EZH2 on Day 10, relative to Day 0, followed by an increase on Day 24 was clear (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>).</p>
<p>Accordingly, H3K27me3 deposition at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter was lower on Day 10 compared to Day 0, followed by an increase on Day 24 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). Taken together, clearly REST and EZH2 binding, and H3K27me3 occupancy were as expected from a decrease/increase in TRF2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter as TL increased and then receded.</p>
<p>Consistent with this, expression of the endogenous <italic>hTERT</italic> (using 3’UTR specific qRT-PCR primers) increased by Day 10 from Day 0 levels, and was significantly reduced by Day 24 compared to the Day 10 levels although not reduced to the Day 0 state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>), supporting the role of TL elongation in inducing or TL shortening in suppressing <italic>hTERT</italic>.</p>
<p>We considered a second temporal model using stable MDA-MB-231 cells with dox-inducible hTERT to exclude the possibility of cell-type-specific effects. After dox induction, we followed TL elongation/shortening and telomerase activity (through days 4/8/10 and 14, Supplementary Fig 2A-B, right panel; ++/-- denotes presence/absence of dox, respectively). Like HT1080 cells, here also TL elongated till Day 10 and beyond Day 10, the presence of dox showed no further elongation in TL (data not shown). Like the HT1080 cell model dox was withdrawn at Day 10, however, in the case of MDA-MB-231 cells TL shortened to roughly the initial (Day 0) state by Day 14; in a relatively short timeframe than what was noted for HT1080 cells (Supplementary Fig 2A, right panel).</p>
<p>For detailed analysis here we selected days 0, 10 with dox, withdrawal of dox at Day 10 (consistent with the HT1080 cell model), and thereafter Day 14 (given the enhanced reduction in TL in MDA-MB-231 compared to HT1080 cells) as representative time points (Dox-MDA-MB-231); <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>). TL elongated to ∼2-folds by Day 10; and receded to approximately initial (Day 0) length by Day 14 after stopping dox at Day 10 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3I</xref>).</p>
<p>Decrease in TRF2 binding, and corresponding reduced REST, EZH2 and the H3K27me3 mark at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter were clear on Day 10 relative to Day 0 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3J-M</xref>). Promoter TRF2, REST and EZH2 occupancy, including H3K27 trimethylation, was regained in the subsequent time point of Day 14, relative to the Day 10 levels, as expected from TL shortening after Day 10 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3J-M</xref>). Accordingly, we noted endogenous <italic>hTERT</italic> transcript followed TL elongation/shortening: increased progressively till Day 10, and subsequently reduced gradually at Day 14 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3N</xref>). Cell-type specific differences in the experimental models, for instance relatively low regain of TRF2 occupancy at the final time day points, Day 14 in MDA-MB-231 compared to Day 24 HT1080 cells, other than relatively enhanced pace of shortening in MDA-MB-231 cells vis-à-vis HT1080 cells on dox withdrawal were interesting to note. Nevertheless, taken together, data from two independent models of temporally altered TL, further supported promoter TRF2-binding mediated <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation to be TL-dependent.</p>

<p>Low promoter TRF2 binding and reduced H3K27 trimethylation in cells with either -124 or - 146 G&gt;A mutations within the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter-reporter inserted at the CCR5 locus was clear from earlier work(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).

<title>Telomere length regulates <italic>hTERT</italic> expression in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)</title>
<p>To test the effect of TL on <italic>hTERT</italic> expression in a physiological setting where telomeres elongate or shorten, we used fibroblast cells along with corresponding induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Primary foreskin (FS) fibroblasts were reprogrammed to pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (see Methods, scheme in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>, characterization data for iPSC in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). <italic>hTERT</italic> mRNA expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>), telomerase activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>) and relative telomere length (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>), were confirmed, and as expected were higher in the iPSCs compared to parent FS fibroblast cells.

TRF2 occupancy in the iPSCs with longer telomeres was found to be lower on the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter in comparison to parent fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>). Further, occupancy of REST (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G</xref>) and the repressor complex protein, EZH2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7H</xref>) was reduced in the pluripotent stem cells. Corresponding to the reduced levels of TRF2 occupancy and resultant lower binding of the REST/PRC2 complex on the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter in the iPSCs, the repressor mark, H3K27me3 was significantly lower relative to FS Fibroblast cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7I</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we asked if TL played a causal role in <italic>hTERT</italic> expression. That is, whether TL change in iPSCs influenced TRF2 occupancy at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter and its subsequent impact on <italic>hTERT</italic>. We used the telomere-specific sgRNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 to trim telomeres (as reported earlier) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). This resulted in a population of iPSCs with short telomeres (’iPSC-ST’; ∼50% reduction in TL; see Methods, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7J, K</xref>). A comparison of TRF2 occupancy between iPSC-ST cells and unaltered iPSCs revealed a marked increase in TRF2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter (∼3-fold) in the telomere-shortened cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7L</xref>). As expected from this based on the above findings, we observed an increase (of 1.5-fold) in the deposition of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in iPSC-ST cells compared to unaltered iPSCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7M</xref>). Further, consistent with these, <italic>hTERT</italic> was significantly reduced in iPSC-ST cells relative to unaltered iPSCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7N</xref>). Taken together, these demonstrate how <italic>hTERT</italic> repression results of TL shortening through non-telomeric TRF2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Relatively long telomeres induced permissive chromatin at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter. Conversely, shorter telomeres led to closed chromatin at the promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E-F</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D, E, K, L</xref>). This resulted in telomere-dependent <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription in multiple cell types/models as in: (a) short/long telomere HT1080, HCT116, MDA-MB-231 cells, and primary FS fibroblast along with corresponding derived iPSC; (b) temporal TL elongation with subsequent shortening; (c) TL-dependent transcription from artificially inserted <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter; (d) and, tumour cells grown <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice. Mechanistically, TRF2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter decreased/increased with TL elongation/shortening respectively, affecting TRF2-dependent recruitment of epigenetic modulators REST and the PRC2 repressor complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The resulting loss/gain in the repressor histone H3K27 trimethylation up or down-regulated <italic>hTERT</italic> respectively, as is shown in the following scheme (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>).

<p>The overwhelming understanding, particularly in cancer cells, suggests that the reactivation of <italic>hTERT</italic> drives telomere elongation/maintenance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). On the other hand, however, the possibility that telomeres conversely might impact the regulation of <italic>hTERT</italic> remains unclear. To test this, here we focused on two contexts: cancer cell lines engineered to modify telomere length (TL) and cellular reprogramming where TL changes are evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Multiple lines of evidence support the causal role of telomeres in <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation. (a) TL elongation, by exogenous <italic>hTERT</italic>, or independent of <italic>hTERT</italic> (using G-rich telomeric oligonucleotides as reported earlier (see Methods)) in different cell types produced <italic>hTERT</italic> upregulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). (b) TL shortening, on the other hand, caused <italic>hTERT</italic> suppression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). (c) Temporally induced TL elongation over days, using exogenous <italic>hTERT</italic>, gradually activated the endogenous <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter. As TL receded, after discontinuing induction, the endogenous <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter was re-suppressed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). (d) <italic>hTERT</italic> activation during reprogramming of primary fibroblast to iPSCs showed reduced promoter TRF2 binding on telomere elongation and <italic>hTERT</italic> activation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). (e) And, finally upon telomere shortening in iPSCs, TRF2 occupancy was regained on the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter, followed by increased repressor mark deposition and reduced <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription. Together, these demonstrate that telomeres play a key role in <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation, adding new insight to the current understanding of telomere elongation/maintenance as a consequence of hTERT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>).</p>
<p>Telomere length and <italic>hTERT</italic> expression are critical in maintaining pluripotency and the ability of stem cells to differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). The re-occupation of TRF2 at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter in telomere-shortened iPSCs (iPSC-ST) along with suppression of its expression demonstrates the applicability of TRF2-dependent TL-sensitive <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation in stem cells and presents a potentially useful tool to modulate its differentiation capacity and pluripotency with further exploration.</p>
<p>An earlier paper showed long telomeres on chromosome 5p interacted with the proximal <italic>hTERT</italic> locus (1.2 Mb away) by physical chromatin looping (TPE-OLD)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Resulting heterochromatinization due to telomeric factors, including TRF2, repressed <italic>hTERT</italic>; loss of looping on telomere shortening de-repressed <italic>hTERT</italic>. We, on the other hand, observed that long telomeres induce, and shorter telomeres repress <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription, suggesting this was distinct from looping-induced interactions. An important underlying difference in the nature of TRF2 at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter must be noted: in TPE-OLD, TRF2 is telomere-associated, whereas TRF2 is non-telomeric in TSP. To confirm non-telomeric TRF2 binding we reasoned in two ways. (a) Telomere-associated TRF2 is likely to be present with other telomeric factors like RAP1 and TRF1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), and (b) inserted an <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter-reporter &gt;40 Mb from telomeres where looping interaction was unlikely. While TRF2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter was clear, RAP1 or TRF1 was absent(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter activity from the inserted reporter was TL-dependent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G-K</xref>). These support <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter-bound TRF2 as non-telomeric and indicate the two models (TPE-OLD and TSP) are likely context-specific. However, additional experimentation would be required to ascertain the contexts or range of telomere length at which the two mechanisms could operate in isolation or concert – providing further insights into their physiological relevance.</p>
<p><italic>hTERT</italic> promoter G4s had a causal role in telomere-induced <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Interestingly, in many cancers, activation of <italic>hTERT</italic> was reported to be frequently due to <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter mutations; subsequently noted to overlap with the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter G4 forming stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). We show for the two most common clinically significant <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter mutations known to abrogate these G4 structures, the TRF2 binding site on the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter was also disrupted (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The artificially introduced <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter-reporter on G4 disruption lost its dependence on TL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These build support for a G4-dependent TL-driven mechanism of <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation/maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>).</p>
<p>Xenograft mice tumours indicated TL-induced <italic>hTERT</italic> activation might be active <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, results are primarily from cells engineered for TL elongation/shortening (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). While these open new avenues additional work would be necessary to understand broader implications. For example, it is not clear how the initial TL elongation (which results in <italic>hTERT</italic> reactivation) is triggered during tumorigenic transformation. Interestingly, recent work shows telomere transfer from antigen-presenting cells (APCs) results in telomere elongation of specific T cell populations, subsequent telomerase expression induced proliferative expansion during T cell activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). This suggests the possibility of telomere transfer between tumour and immune/other cells within the tumour microenvironment might alter TL, contributing to <italic>hTERT</italic> activation. A similar model might be functional during reprogramming. Moreover, it would be of interest to test how TL-dependent <italic>hTERT</italic> regulatory mechanisms affect senescing primary cell and telomerase-negative cancer cells (with ALT mechanism).</p>
<p>The current study provides experimental evidence that TRF2, a well-characterized telomere-binding protein, mediates crosstalk between telomeres and the regulatory region of the hTERT gene in a telomere length-dependent manner. Given the observed link between hTERT expression and telomere length, it is likely that additional telomere-associated proteins and regulatory pathways contribute to this regulation.</p>
<p>The remaining shelterin complex components—POT1, hRap1, TRF1, TIN2, and TPP1— may play crucial roles in this context, as they are integral to telomere maintenance and protection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Additionally, several DNA damage response (DDR) proteins, which interact with telomere-binding factors and help preserve telomere integrity, could potentially influence hTERT regulation in a telomere length-dependent manner(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). However, direct interactions or regulatory roles would require further experimental validation. Another group of proteins with potential relevance in this mechanism are the sirtuins, which directly associate with telomeres and are known to positively regulate telomere length, undergoing repression upon telomere shortening(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Notably, SIRT1 has been reported to interact with telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>), while SIRT6 has been implicated in TRF2 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) and telomerase activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Given their roles in telomere homeostasis, sirtuins may serve as key mediators of telomere length-dependent hTERT regulation.</p>
<p>In summary, results reveal a heretofore unknown mechanism of <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation by TRF2 in a TL-dependent manner. Long telomeres sequester more TRF2 for telomere protection, which reduces TRF2 at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter. Resulting in de-repression of <italic>hTERT</italic>, and increased <italic>hTERT</italic> levels in turn synthesize (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) and help maintain longer telomeres. The reversal of this was observed in TL shortening. Taken together, these suggest a feed-forward model mechanistically connecting telomeres to <italic>hTERT</italic> with likely significant implications in better understanding telomere-related physiological events, particularly tumorigenesis, ageing and de-differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>).</p>

<list-item><p>To generate the TL elongation followed by shortening model, the doxycycline-inducible hTERT expression system, (stable cell generation discussed below), was used. The doxycycline-inducible system consists of cells with an integrated dox-hTERT cassette, seeded in different culture flasks and maintained under three conditions: uninduced (no doxycycline), induced with doxycycline for 10 days, and post-induction withdrawal for defined time periods. Cells are harvested at multiple time points and analysed as paired samples. Briefly, the Dox-HT1080 cells were seeded in T25 flasks and treated with 1µg/mL dox daily (one set being cultured without induction) and TL measured at time points Days 0/6/8/10/16 and 24. Beyond the first 10 days, dox treatment produced no further elongation (as seen on Day 16<sup>--</sup> in Supplementary Fig 2A left panel). Cells were cultured till Day 24, after discontinuing dox at Day-10, for telomere shortening. Similar treatment was done for the Dox-MDA-MB-231 cellular model, and TL was measured on Days 0/4/8/10/12 and 14; cells were studied till Day 14 (after dox withdrawal at Day-10 and no further increase in TL with dox treatment) when substantial telomere shortening was noted.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Reprogramming was conducted using the CytoTune iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, fibroblast cells (5 × 10^5) were transduced with reprogramming factor genes delivered by non-integrating Sendai viruses. The following day, cells were centrifuged at 200g for 5 minutes at room temperature to remove the virus and then cultured for an additional two days. On the third day post-transduction, 0.5–2 × 10^5 cells were plated on Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6-well plates and maintained in Essential 8™ Medium (Gibco™). The medium was changed daily, and cells were monitored for the emergence of colonies resembling embryonic stem (ES) cells. Between days 16 and 20 following transduction, colonies with flat, well-defined margins indicative of an ES-like phenotype were manually selected and expanded as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These iPSC colonies were cultured on Matrigel-coated plates in Essential 8™ Medium at 37°C in a 5% CO2 environment, with daily media changes. During passaging, the typical split ratio was 1:5, and colonies were detached using ReLeSR (Stem Cell Technologies). To generate the telomere shortened version of iPSCs, iPSCs were seeded in Matrigel-coated 6-well plates and transfected with a telomeric sequence-specific sgRNA (tel-sgRNA) and <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 expressing plasmid. 24h post-transfection, they were subjected to puromycin selection (0.4µg/mL) for 5 days and monitored for any morphological or proliferation capacity changes.</p></list-item>

<title>Telomere length determination</title>
<p>Telomere length was determined using two methods - RT-PCR-based and Flow Cytometry-based. For flow cytometry-based evaluation using Agilent DAKO kit, 2 x10<sup>6</sup> cells were divided into two fractions-for FITC labelled Telomeric PNA probe (Agilent DAKO kit) and unlabeled control cells. The cell fractions were washed and further labelled with PI for whole DNA content as per the manufacturer’s protocol. The fluorescence signal was acquired for at least 10,000 events on BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer. FCS files were then analyzed using FlowJo version 10.8.1 software. Fold change of telomere length relative to reference cell samples was calculated using Median Fluorescence signal intensity values of labelled and unlabeled sample preparations, according to the kit-provided formula.</p>
<p>For RT-PCR-based telomere length estimation, genomic DNA was isolated using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit.

<title>Histone H3 methyl transferase activity quantification assay</title>
<p>1µg of purified histone H3 N-terminal peptide (procured as a component of Active Motif kit Catalog No. 56100) was incubated overnight (12-14h), at 37°C in the presence of 8µM (working concentration) S-adenosyl-L-methionine, 0.6µg purified PRC2 complex of proteins (cat no.SRP0381) and in the presence/absence of M2 FLAG bead-bound TRF2 protein (WT or R17H variants) in 25µL of a histone assay buffer (component of ab113454 kit). After that, the protocol of ab115072 –Histone H3 (tri-methyl K27) quantification kit was followed. Briefly, 25µL of supernatant of the reaction mix was pipetted, added to the anti-H3K27me3 antibody-coated strip wells with 25 µL of antibody buffer (provided with kit ab115072) and incubated at room temperature for 2h; the wells were covered properly by Parafilm M to prevent evaporation. Post incubation, the wells were washed thrice with kit-provided wash buffer. Diluted detection antibody (as directed by kit) was then added to the wells and incubated for 1h at room temperature on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm. Next, the wells were washed thrice after aspirating the antibody solution. The suggested amount of Color Developer solution was added to the wells and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2-10 minutes. The colour development (blue) was monitored across the wells of sample and standard solution. Once the color in the standard well containing a higher concentration developed a medium blue colour, 50 μL of Stop Solution was added to all wells to stop the enzymatic reaction. Upon stopping the reaction, a yellow colour develops and the absorbance reading at 450nm was noted within 15minutes on a microplate reader.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors in this study extensively investigate how telomere length (TL) regulates hTERT expression via non-telomeric binding of the telomere-associated protein TRF2. They conclusively show that TRF2 binding to long telomeres results in a reduction in its binding to the hTERT promoter. In contrast, short telomeres restore TRF2 binding in the hTERT promoter, recruiting repressor complexes like PRC2, and suppressing hTERT expression. The study presents several significant findings revealing a previously unknown mechanism of hTERT regulation by TRF2 in a TL-dependent manner</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) A previously unknown mechanism linking telomere length and hTERT regulation through the non-telomeric TRF2 protein has been established, strengthening our understanding of telomere biology.</p>
<p>(2) The authors used both cancer cell lines and iPSCs to showcase their hypothesis and multiple parameters to validate the role of TRF2 in hTERT regulation.</p>
<p>(3) Comprehensive integration of the recent literature findings and implementation in the current study.</p>
<p>(4) In vivo validation of the findings.</p>
<p>(5) Rigorous controls and well-designed assays have been used.</p>
<p>Comments on current version:</p>
<p>The current version of the manuscript has addressed all the reviewers' concerns to the best of its ability. However, understanding the limitations of the authors, exploring ALT cell lines for the current mechanism would be desirable in the future.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors in this study extensively investigate how telomere length (TL) regulates hTERT expression via non-telomeric binding of the telomere-associated protein TRF2. They conclusively show that TRF2 binding to long telomeres results in a reduction in its binding to the hTERT promoter. In contrast, short telomeres restore TRF2 binding in the hTERT promoter, recruiting repressor complexes like PRC2, and suppressing hTERT expression. The study presents several significant findings revealing a previously unknown mechanism of hTERT regulation by TRF2 in a TL-dependent manner</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) A previously unknown mechanism linking telomere length and hTERT regulation through the non-telomeric TRF2 protein has been established strengthening the telomere biology understanding.</p>
<p>(2) The authors used both cancer cell lines and iPSCs to showcase their hypothesis and multiple parameters to validate the role of TRF2 in hTERT regulation.</p>
<p>(3) Comprehensive integration of the recent literature findings and implementation in the current study.</p>
<p>(4) In vivo validation of the findings.</p>
<p>(5) Rigorous controls and well-designed assays have been use.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors should comment on the cell proliferation and morphology of the engineered cell lines with ST or LT.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The cell proliferation and morphology of the engineered cells were monitored during experiments. With a doubling time within 16-18 hours, all the cancer cell line pairs used in the study were counted and seeded equally before experiments.</p>
<p>No significant difference in morphology or cell count (before harvesting for experiments) was noted for the stable cell lines, namely, HT1080 ST-HT1080 LT, HCT116 p53 null scrambled control-HCT116 p53 null hTERC knockdown.</p>
<p>MDAMB 231 cells which were treated with guanine-rich telomere repeats (GTR) over a period of 12 days, as per the protocol mentioned in Methods. Due to the alternate day of GTR treatment in serum-free media followed by replenishment with serum-supplemented media, we noted that cells would undergo periodic delay in their proliferation (or transient arrest) aligning with the GTR oligo-feeding cycles and appeared somewhat larger in comparison to their parental untreated cells.</p>
<p>Next, the cells with Cas9-telomeric sgRNA mediated telomere trimming were maintained transiently (till 3 days after transfection). During this time, no significant change in morphology or cell proliferation was observed in any of the cell lines, namely HCT116 or HEK293T Gaussia Luciferase reporter cells. iPSCs were also monitored. However, no change in morphology or cellular proliferation was observed during the 5 days post-transfection and antibiotic selection.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Also, the entire study uses engineered cell lines, with artificially elongated or shortened telomeres that conclusively demonstrate the role of hTERT regulation by TRF2 in telomere-length dependent manner, but using ALT negative cell lines with naturally short telomere length vs those with long telomeres will give better perspective. Primary cells can also be used in this context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer correctly highlights (as we also acknowledge in the Discussion) that our study primarily utilizes engineered cell lines with artificially elongated or shortened telomeres. We agree that using ALT-negative cells with naturally short versus long telomeres would provide additional perspective. However, a key challenge in this experimental setup is the inherent variation in TRF2 protein levels among these cell types—a parameter central to our hypothesis. Comparing observations across such non-isogenic cell line pairs presents experimental limitations as these would require extensive normalization for multiple factors and introduce additional complexities, which would be difficult to interpret with clarity.</p>
<p>We had also explored primary cells, specifically foreskin fibroblasts and MRC5 lung fibroblasts, as suggested by the reviewer. However, we encountered two significant challenges. To achieve a notable telomere length difference of at least 20%, these primary cells had to undergo a minimum of 25 passages. During this period, we observed a substantial decline in their proliferation capacity and an increased tendency toward replicative senescence. Additionally, we noted a significant reduction in TRF2 protein levels as the primary cells aged, consistent with findings from Fujita K et al., 2010 (Nat Cell Biol.), which reported p53-induced, Siah-1-mediated proteasomal degradation of TRF2. Due to these practical limitations, we focused on cancer cell lines with respective isogenic backgrounds, ensuring a controlled experimental framework. On the other hand, this opens new avenues for future research to explore broader implications. Investigating other primary cell types that may not present these challenges could be a valuable direction for future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors set up time-dependent telomere length changes by dox induction, which may differ from the gradual telomere attrition or elongation that occurs naturally during aging, disease progression, or therapy. This aspect should be explored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we utilized a Doxycycline-inducible hTERT expression system to modulate telomere length in cancer cells, aiming to capture any gradual changes that might occur upon steady telomerase induction or overexpression—an event frequently observed in cancer progression. We monitored telomere length and telomerase activity at regular intervals (Supplementary Figure 2), noting a gradual increase until a characteristic threshold was reached, followed by a reversal to the initial telomere length.</p>
<p>While this model provides interesting insights in context of cancer cells, it does not replicate the conditions of aging or therapeutic intervention. We agree that exploring telomere length-dependent regulation of hTERT in normal aging cells is an important avenue for future research. Investigating TRF2 occupancy on the hTERT promoter in response to telomere length alterations through therapeutic interventions—such as telomestatin or imetelstat (telomerase inhibitors) and 6-thio-2’-deoxyguanosine (telomere damage inducer)—would provide valuable insights and warrants further exploration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) How does the hTERT regulation by TRF2 in a TL-dependent manner affect the ETS binding on hTERT mutant promoter sites?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our previous study (Sharma et al., 2021, Cell Reports), we have experimentally demonstrated that GABPA and TRF2 do not compete for binding at the mutant hTERT promoter (Figure 4M-R). Silencing GABPA in various mutant hTERT promoter cells did not increase TRF2 binding. While GABPA has been reported to show increased binding at the mutant promoter compared to the wild-type (Bell et al., 2015, Science), no telomere length (TL) sensitivity has been noted yet. In the current manuscript we show that telomere alterations in hTERT mutant cells (that do not form promoter G-quadruplex) does not significantly affect TRF2 occupancy at the promoter, reinforcing our earlier findings that G-quadruplex formation is crucial for TRF2 recruitment. Since TRF2 binding is not affected this would not impact GABPA binding. Therefore change in TL is unlikely to influence ETS binding by GABPA.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Stabilization of the G-quadruplex structures in ST and LT conditions along with the G4 disruption experimentation (demonstrated by the authors) will strengthen the hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that stabilizing G-quadruplex (G4) structures in mutant promoter cells under ST and LT conditions would further strengthen our hypothesis. From our ChIP experiments on hTERT promoter mutant cells following G4 stabilization with ligands, as reported in Sharma et al. 2021 (Figure 5G), we observed that TRF2 occupancy was regained in the telomere-length unaltered versions of -124G&gt;A and -146G&gt;A HEK293T Gaussia luciferase cells (referred to as LT cells in the current manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The telomere length and the telomerase activity are not very consistent (Figure 2A, and S1A, Figure 4B and S3). Please comment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we employed both telomerase-dependent and independent methods for telomere elongation.</p>
<p>HT1080 model: Telomere elongation resulted from constitutive overexpression of hTERC and hTERT, leading to a direct correlation with telomerase activity.</p>
<p>HCT116 (p53-null) model: hTERC silencing in ST cells, a known limiting factor for telomerase activity, resulted in significantly lower telomerase activity and a 1.5-fold telomere length difference.</p>
<p>MDAMB231 model: Guanine-rich telomeric repeat (GTR) feeding induced telomere elongation through recombinatorial mechanisms (Wright et al., 1996), leading to significant telomere length gain but no notable change in telomerase activity.</p>
<p>HCT116 Cas9-telomeric sgRNA model: Telomere shortening occurred without modifying telomerase components, resulting in a minor, insignificant increase in telomerase activity (Figure 2A, S1).</p>
<p>Regarding xenograft-derived HT1080 ST and LT cells (Figure 4B, S3), the observed variability in telomere length and telomerase activity may stem from infiltrating mouse cells, which naturally have longer telomeres and higher telomerase activity than human cells. Since in the reported assay tumour masses were not sorted to exclude mouse cells, using species-specific markers or fluorescently labelled HT1080 cells in future experiments would minimize bias. However, even though telomere length and telomerase activity assays cannot differentiate for cross-species differences, mRNA analysis and ChIP experiments performed specifically for hTERT and hTERC mRNA levels, TRF2 occupancy, and H3K27me3 enrichment on hTERT promoter (Figure 4B–E) strongly support our conclusions.</p>

<p>(7) Please comment on the other telomere-associated proteins or regulatory pathways that might contribute to hTERT expression based on telomere length.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The current study provides experimental evidence that TRF2, a well-characterized telomere-binding protein, mediates crosstalk between telomeres and the regulatory region of the hTERT gene in a telomere length-dependent manner. Given the observed link between hTERT expression and telomere length, it is likely that additional telomere-associated proteins and regulatory pathways contribute to this regulation.</p>
<p>The remaining shelterin complex components—POT1, hRap1, TRF1, TIN2, and TPP1—may play crucial roles in this context, as they are integral to telomere maintenance and protection (Stewart J et al., 2012 Mutat Res.). Additionally, several DNA damage response (DDR) proteins, which interact with telomere-binding factors and help preserve telomere integrity, could potentially influence hTERT regulation in a telomere length-dependent manner (Longhese M, 2008 Genes &amp; Development). However, direct interactions or regulatory roles would require further experimental validation. Another group of proteins with potential relevance in this mechanism are the sirtuins, which directly associate with telomeres and are known to positively regulate telomere length, undergoing repression upon telomere shortening (Amano H et al., 2019 Cell Metabolism, Amano H, Sahin E 2019 Molecular &amp; Cellular Oncology). Notably, SIRT1 has been reported to interact with telomerase (Lee SE et al., 2024, Biochem Biophys Res Commun.), while SIRT6 has been implicated in TRF2 degradation (Rizzo et al. 2017) and telomerase activation (Chen J et al. 2021, Aging) . Given their roles in telomere homeostasis, sirtuins may serve as key mediators of telomere length-dependent hTERT regulation.</p>
<p>Based on this suggestion, we have included the above in Discussion.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Telomeres are key genomic structures linked to everything from aging to cancer. These key structures at the end of chromosomes protect them from degradation during replication and rely on a complex made up of human telomerase RNA gene (hTERC) and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). While hTERC is expressed in all cells, the amount of hTERT is tightly controlled. The main hypothesis being tested is whether telomere length itself could regulate the hTERT enzyme. The authors conducted several experiments with different methods to alter telomere length and measured the binding of key regulatory proteins to this gene. It was generally observed that the shortening of telomere length leads to the recruitment of factors that reduce hTERT expression and lengthening of telomeres has the opposite effect. To rule out direct chromatin looping between telomeres and hTERT as driving this effect artificial constructs were designed and inserted a significant distance away and similar results were obtained.</p>
<p>Overall, the claims of telomere length-dependent regulation of hTERT are supported throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper has several important strengths. Firstly, it uses several methods and cell lines that consistently demonstrate the same directionality of the findings. Secondly, it builds on established findings in the field but still demonstrates how this mechanism is separate from that which has been observed. Specifically, designing and implementing luciferase assays in the CCR5 locus supports that direct chromatin looping isn't necessary to drive this effect with TRF2 binding. Another strength of this paper is that it has been built on a variety of other studies that have established principles such as G4-DNA in the hTERT locus and TRF2 binding to these G4 sites.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The largest technical weakness of the paper is that minimal replicates are used for each experiment. I understand that these kinds of experiments are quite costly, and many of the effects are quite large, however, experiments such as the flow cytometry or the IPSC telomere length and activity assays appear to be based on a single sample, and several are based upon two maximum three biological replicates. If samples were added the main effects would likely hold, and many of the assays using GAPDH as a control would result in significant differences between the groups. This unnecessarily weakens the strength of the claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s recognition of the resource-intensive nature of our experiments, and we are confident in the robustness of the observed results. Due to the project’s timeline constraints and the need for consistency across experiments, we have reported findings based on 3 biological replicates with appropriate statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Regarding the fibroblast-iPSC model, we would like to clarify that we have presented data from two independent biological replicates, each consisting of a fibroblast and its derived iPS cell pair, rather than a single sample. Additionally, the Tel-FACS assays involved analysing at least 10,000 events, ensuring statistical significance in all cases.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another detail that weakens the confidence in the claims is that throughout the manuscript there are several examples of the control group with zero variance between any of the samples: e.g. Figure 2K, Figure 3N, and Figure 6G. It is my understanding that a delta delta method has been used for calculation (though no exact formula is reported and would assist in understanding). If this is the case, then an average of the control group would be used to calculate that fold change and variance would exist in the group. The only way I could understand those control group samples always set to 1 is if a tube of cells was divided into conditions and therefore normalized to the control group in each case. A clearer description in the figure legend and methods would be required if this is what was done and repeated measures ANOVA and other statistics should accompany this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The above point has been raised by the reviewer in the 'Recommendations for Authors' section as well. We have addressed it in detail in that section, citing each figure where the reviewer noted a concern regarding the lack of variance. Changes made in the manuscript have also been highlighted there.</p>
<p>We would like to clarify that, throughout the manuscript, fold changes were previously calculated independently for each biological replicate by normalizing treated conditions to their corresponding control (untreated or Day 0) sample within the same replicate. This means that the control group is normalized to 1 individually in each replicate, resulting in an apparent lack of variance in the control when plotted. The normalization was not performed using an averaged control value across replicates. As such, the absence of visible variance in the control group reflects the normalization method rather than a true lack of variability in the underlying data.</p>
<p>In the revised version of the manuscript, we have carefully considered the reviewer’s comments and applied changes wherever appropriate. For example (detailed response in the ‘Recommendations for Authors’ section), in datasets where two distinct stable cell lines are compared (e.g., HT1080 ST/LT and HCT p53-null ST/LT), unpaired statistical analysis is more appropriate. Hence, we have updated these panels accordingly and indicated the statistical methods used in the figure legends and Methods section. However, in experiments where cells were indeed seeded separately and subsequently subjected to experimental conditions—representing paired samples—we have chosen not to make any changes. A clearer description of this procedure has, however, been added to the Methods and figure legends to ensure full transparency.</p>
<p>We believe this approach accurately reflects the experimental design, appropriately addresses the reviewer’s concerns regarding variance and statistical analysis, and ensures clarity and rigor in data reporting.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A final technical weakness of the paper is the data in Figure 5 where the modified hTERT promoter was inserted upstream of the luciferase gene. Specifically, it is unclear why data was not directly compared between the constructs that could and could not form G4s to make this point. For this reason, the large variance in several samples, and minimal biological replicates, this data was the least convincing in the manuscript (though other papers from this laboratory and others support the claim, it is not convincing standalone data).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's thoughtful feedback on the presentation of the luciferase assay data in Figure 5. The data for the wild-type hTERT promoter (capable of forming G4 structures) was previously reported in Figure 2G-K. To avoid redundancy in data presentation, we initially chose to report the results of the mutated promoter separately. However, we recognize that directly comparing the wild-type and mutated promoter constructs within the same figure would provide clearer context and strengthen the interpretation of the results. In light of this, we have updated Figure 5 in the revised manuscript to include the data for both constructs, ensuring a more comprehensive and informative comparison.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The second largest weakness of the paper is formatting.</p>
<p>When I initially read the paper without a careful reading of the methods, I thought that the authors did not have appropriate controls meaning that if a method is applied to lengthen, there should be one that is not lengthened, and when a method is applied to shorten, one which is not shortened should be analysed as well. In fact, this is what the authors have done with isogenic controls. However, by describing all samples as either telomere short or telomere long, while this simplifies the writing and the colour scheme, it makes it less clear that each experiment is performed relative to an unmodified. I would suggest putting the isogenic control in one colour, the artificially shortened in another, and the artificially lengthened in another.</p>
<p>Similarly, the graphs, in general, should be consistent with labelling. Figure 2 was the most confusing. I would suggest one dotted line with cell lines above it, and then the method of either elongation or shortening below it. I.e. HT1080 above, hTERC overexpression below, MDAMB-231 above guanine terminal repeats below, like was done on the right. Figure 2 readability would also be improved by putting hTERT promoter GAPDH (-ve control) under each graph that uses this (Panel B and Panel C not just Panel C). All information is contained in the manuscript but one must currently flip between figure legends, methods, and figures to understand what was done and this reduces clarity for the reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer again for their thoughtful suggestions regarding figure formatting and colour coding to improve clarity. We fully understand the rationale for proposing separate colours for unmodified, telomere-shortened, and telomere-lengthened groups, as this could make the experimental design more immediately apparent. However, after careful consideration, we believe that implementing this change across all figures may unintentionally reduce clarity in other aspects  (presented in other figures) of the data presentation. This is further explained below.</p>
<p>Specifically, applying three distinct colours throughout would make it harder to visually track key biological trends—such as changes in chromatin occupancy—across different models. For instance, the same colour could represent opposing regulatory patterns in distinct contexts (e.g., upregulation in one model and downregulation in another), which will make these figures difficult to understand. We feel that maintaining a consistent colour scheme based on telomere status—i.e., long telomeres (LT) vs short telomeres (ST)—across figures facilitates better comparison of biological outcomes across different experimental systems.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to address the reviewer’s concern about clarity in experimental design, we have added more detailed descriptions of the methodology and model systems used, in both the Methods and figure legend sections. These updates aim to make it easier for the reader to follow which groups serve as isogenic controls versus modified samples, without disrupting the consistency of data visualization.</p>
<p>We hope this strikes a balance between improving clarity and preserving the interpretability of the broader biological trends presented in our manuscript.</p>
<p>Please note, we have incorporated the reviewer’s suggestion to indicate details of model generation for HT1080 and MDAMB 231 cell lines in Figure 2. To quote the reviewer,</p>
<p>“I would suggest one dotted line with cell lines above it, and then the method of either elongation or shortening below it. I.e. HT1080 above, hTERC overexpression below, MDAMB-231 above guanine terminal repeats below, like was done on the right.”</p>
<p>We have also put hTERT promoter GAPDH (-ve control) under each graph and not at the end of Panel C in Figure 2, as suggested by reviewer.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Please check for grammatical errors throughout the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have gone through the manuscript thoroughly, checked and corrected it for grammatical errors if and where detected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Please use both the FACS and qPCR-based assays to check telomere length in all the experiments to strengthen the observations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. We confirm that both FACS- and qPCR-based assays were performed to assess telomere length in our experiments. In the original submission, we chose to present primarily the FACS-based data in the main figures. This decision was based on the inherent differences in the measurement principles of the two methods, which can lead to discrepancies in the reported fold changes. We were concerned that presenting both datasets side by side in the main figures might lead to confusion for readers who are not directly familiar with the nuances of telomere length assays.</p>
<p>However, in light of the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now included the qPCR-based data as Supplementary Figure 1A, and updated the manuscript text and figure legends accordingly to reflect this addition.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Correct the labeling in the legend (Figure 2).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected legend of Figure 2. Thanks to the reviewer for pointing it out.</p>

<p>(4) In Figure 6B, why TRF WT condition have higher hTERT expression than the UT condition?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for noting that the hTERT mRNA levels, as estimated by FISH in Figure 6B, appear slightly higher in TRF2 WT overexpressing HT1080 cells compared to the untransfected (UT) condition. Specifically, the average mean intensity values (a.u.) were 53 for UT and 57 for WT. Although this difference was not statistically significant, we acknowledge the reviewer's observation. Currently, we do not have a clear explanation for this small, non-significant variation.</p>
<p>Importantly, using the same FISH-based method, we observed a significant upregulation of hTERT mRNA levels upon TRF2 R17H overexpression compared to both UT and TRF2 WT conditions, supporting our key conclusions.</p>
<p>Additionally, qRT-PCR analysis of hTERT mRNA levels in cells stably expressing TRF2 WT (induced by doxycycline) consistently showed a significant downregulation compared to the uninduced (equivalent to UT in the microscopy experiments) state. These results were robust and reproducible across three different cell lines, including HT1080. Consistently, TRF2 R17H expression led to significant upregulation of hTERT mRNA levels upon induction.</p>
<p>Together, these complementary findings strengthen the validity of our observations.</p>

<p>(5) In telomere length between ST and LT in Fig. 5B significant? (especially the right panel -146G&gt;A).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We consistently worked with approximately 20–30% telomere shortening in HEK293 cells across all three cell types (WT promoter, -124G&gt;A, and -146G&gt;A), as this range was reproducibly achieved within the experimental timeframe without risking excessive telomere trimming. The reported telomere length differences are based on FACS analysis of more than 10,000 events per condition, providing strong statistical significance. Importantly, while the absolute differences in telomere length may appear modest, their biological impact is evident in the distinct cellular characteristics observed between ST and LT cell pairs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>As mentioned above it was somewhat unclear why so many instances of control groups had no variance between them. A more complete reporting of the formulas used to calculate the results, and methods (if samples were divided from a single source into different conditions) would be appreciated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable and detailed feedback. The instances where the control groups appeared to lack variance were mainly mRNA data (Figure 2D, 3G,3N), luciferase activity (Figure 2K), and in vitro methyltransferase activity (Figure 6G). We shall try to categorically address them all.</p>
<p>In Figure 2D, for the MDA-MB-231  GTR oligo and HCT116 telomere trimming datasets, the untreated cells were seeded separately and subsequently used to generate the treated conditions within the same experiment. Thus, these two datasets represent paired experimental conditions. Fold changes were calculated independently for each replicate (paired samples), and the fold changes across replicates were plotted. Because the control group serves as a common baseline within each pair and fold changes are normalized individually, minimal variance appears across controls. Given the experimental design, we believe no change is necessary for these panels. However, we have provided additional clarification regarding the calculation formulas and sample handling in the Methods section to avoid any ambiguity.</p>
<p>For the ST/LT versions in HT1080 and HCT p53-null background cells, while each replicate could technically be treated as paired, these could be treated as four distinct stable cell lines. Hence, we agree it would be appropriate to apply unpaired statistical analysis for these datasets. We have updated the plots accordingly and described the statistical methods in detail in the figure legends and Methods section.</p>
<p>Figure 3G and 3N depict the doxycycline-induced cells which follow the design: untreated and dox-treated conditions were seeded from the same batch of cells into separate flasks and treated differently. Hence, these are also paired cases, and fold changes were calculated per replicate before plotting. Therefore, we believe no changes are necessary for these panels. However, we have provided more details regarding sample handling in the Methods section to avoid any ambiguity.</p>
<p>In Figure 2K, previously we had plotted fold change in luciferase activity over short telomere (ST) cells, for each independent biological replicates. However, to address the reviewer’s concern of not showing variance in control group, we have now plotted the luminescence signal (normalised over total protein). We have also updated Figure 5E accordingly, and also included WT promoter data along with the mutant cell line data- as was suggested in public reviewer’s comment.</p>
<p>In Figure 6G, as each replicate of the in vitro methyltransferase activity used different batches of purified protein, there are inherent batch differences that were accounted for by normalizing each replicate internally. Fold changes were then determined for each replicate separately, as previously described. The fold changes across replicates were plotted, and significance between different conditions was tested using two-way ANOVA. To address the reviewer’s comment to show variance in the control, we have now plotted individual replicates.</p>
<p>We believe these revisions, along with the expanded methods clarification, will fully address the reviewer's concerns and accurately reflect the experimental design and statistical analysis applied.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Many times, in the manuscript a / is used to indicate both directions. For example: &quot;Genes distal from telomeres (for instance 60 Mb from the nearest telomere) were activated/repressed in a TL-dependent way&quot;... &quot;Resulting increase/decrease in non-telomeric promoter-bound TRF2 affected gene expression&quot;. For readability, either this can be replaced with a directionless word like altered, changed, etc, or the writer can list both directions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the careful reading and thoughtful suggestions. In the manuscript, we have used the ‘/’ symbol to indicate opposing directions, followed by the word ‘respectively’ to relate these directions to their corresponding outcomes, wherever appropriate. However, as rightly pointed out, certain sentences would benefit from alternative constructions for improved clarity and readability. We have therefore reviewed the manuscript and revised such sentences, making minor modifications wherever necessary, as outlined below.</p>
<p>We found hTERT was transcriptionally altered depending on telomere length (TL).</p>
<p>Notably, another conceptually distinct mechanism of TL-dependent gene regulation was reported which influenced genes spread throughout the genome: expression of genes distal from telomeres (for instance 60 Mb from the nearest telomere) was altered in a TL-dependent way, but without physical telomere looping interactions.</p>
<p>Second, the shortening or elongation of telomeres led to the release or sequestration of telomeric TRF2, respectively, thereby increasing or decreasing the availability of TRF2 at non-telomeric promoters and affecting gene expression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A non-necessary, but potentially extra convincing experiment to perform would be to use a combination of light-activated, or ligand-activated cas9 telomere trimming and guanine terminal repeat additions in the same cell line. Like the dox experiments, this would show over time how altering telomere length alters the recruitment of heterochromatin factors and hTERT levels. Executing the experiment this way would be more definitive as it does not rely on changing hTERT itself. Authors do already have examples that support their claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this additional experiment (reviewer mentions as non-necessary), which would indeed provide valuable insights into the relationship between telomere length, heterochromatin factor recruitment, and hTERT levels. While we recognize the potential of this approach, due to constraints on resources, we are currently unable to execute this experiment. However, we believe that the existing data presented in the manuscript already supports our conclusions effectively.</p>
