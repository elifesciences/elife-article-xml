<title>Summary</title>
<p>Nuclear processes depend on the organization of chromatin, whose basic units are cylinder-shaped complexes called nucleosomes. A subset of mammalian nucleosomes <italic>in situ</italic> (inside cells) resembles the canonical structure determined <italic>in vitro</italic> 25 years ago. Nucleosome structure <italic>in situ</italic> is otherwise poorly understood. Using cryo-ET and 3-D classification analysis of yeast cells, here we find that canonical nucleosomes account for less than 10% of total nucleosomes expected <italic>in situ</italic>. In a strain in which H2A-GFP is the sole source of histone H2A, class averages that resemble canonical nucleosomes both with and without an extra density are found <italic>ex vivo</italic>, but not <italic>in situ</italic>. These data suggest that the yeast intranuclear environment favors multiple non-canonical nucleosome conformations. Using the structural observations here and the results of previous genomics and biochemical studies, we propose a model in which the average yeast nucleosome’s DNA is partially detached <italic>in situ</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eukaryotic chromosomes are polymers of DNA-protein complexes called nucleosomes. An octamer of proteins, consisting of a heterotetramer of histones H3 and H4 and two heterodimers of histones H2A and H2B, resides at the nucleosome’s center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). Canonical nucleosomes resemble 10 nm wide, 6 nm thick cylinders and have 145 – 147 base pairs of DNA bent in 1.65 left-handed superhelical gyres around the histone octamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Zlatanova et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, non-canonical nucleosomes have either partially detached DNA, partially detached histones, fewer than 8 histones, or a combination of these features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Zlatanova et al., 2009</xref>). Both X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-EM have shown that reconstituted nucleosomes, either alone or within a complex, are largely canonical <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Nucleosome structures <italic>in situ</italic> inside cells remain mysterious.</p>
<p>Molecular-resolution (2 – 4 nm) studies of unique objects like cells may be obtained by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), a form of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that generates 3-D reconstructions called cryotomograms. These studies reveal life-like snapshots of macromolecular complexes because the samples are prepared and then imaged in an unfixed, unstained, frozen-hydrated state. Most eukaryotic cells are too thick for cryo-ET, so thinner frozen-hydrated samples are made by cutting by cryomicrotomy or thinning by cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ng and Gan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>). These two approaches respectively produce cryosections and plank-like samples called cryolamellae. Subvolumes called subtomograms contain independent copies of the cells’ macromolecular complexes. These subtomograms can be further studied by averaging, which increases the signal-to-noise ratio, and classification, which facilitates the analysis of heterogeneity. Large macromolecular complexes such as ribosomes and proteasomes have been identified <italic>in situ</italic> by 3-D classification followed by comparison of the class averages to known structures – an approach called purification <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Beck and Baumeister, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the purification <italic>in silico</italic> approach, we previously showed that canonical nucleosomes exist in cryotomograms of yeast cell lysates <italic>ex vivo</italic> and in a HeLa cell cryolamella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cai et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cai et al., 2018c</xref>). Herein, we use the term <italic>ex vivo</italic> to describe nucleosomes from lysates instead of the term <italic>in vitro</italic>, which is more commonly used to describe either reconstituted or purified mononucleosomes. However, our 3-D structural analysis did not generate canonical nucleosome structures from cryosectioned fission yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cai et al., 2018b</xref>). The discrepancy between nucleosome class averages <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in situ</italic> could have either technical or biological origins. As a biological explanation for the absence of canonical nucleosome class averages <italic>in situ</italic>, we hypothesized that yeast nucleosomes are either conformationally or constitutionally heterogeneous.</p>
<p>In this work, we test this heterogenous-nucleosome hypothesis by using cryo-ET to image both wild-type cells and strains that have nucleosomes bearing GFP as a density tag. We use the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, herein called yeast, because it has only two copies of each histone gene and because it is more amenable to gene editing. Our work compares the chromatin in both lysates and thin cellular cryo-EM samples prepared using primarily cryo-FIB milling. To obtain more information about nucleosomes <italic>in situ</italic>, we create one strain in which H2A-GFP is the sole source of H2A, meaning that the nucleosomes are expected to project one or two extra densities from their surface. Canonical nucleosomes are abundant in nuclear lysates and, in the H2A-GFP-expressing strain lysates, have extra densities consistent with GFP. In contrast, canonical nucleosomes account for less than 10% of the expected number of total nucleosomes in wild-type cell cryolamellae. Furthermore, neither canonical nucleosomes nor nucleosome-like particles with extra protruding densities were detected in the H2A-GFP-expressing strain. These findings suggest that the yeast intracellular environment disfavors the canonical nucleosome conformation.</p>

<title>Canonical nucleosomes are abundant in wild-type lysates</title>
<p>The crystal structure of the reconstituted yeast nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">White et al., 2001</xref>) shows a canonical structure that is largely indistinguishable from the first published one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). To describe the various views of the nucleosome, herein we use the compact nomenclature introduced by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>): the disc view is along the superhelical axis, and the gyre view is along the pseudo-dyad axis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The side view, which was not defined by Zhou et al, is orthogonal to both the disc and gyre views.</p>

<p>The original RELION subtomogram-analysis workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bharat and Scheres, 2016</xref>) involves 2-D classification, followed by 3-D classification (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>), whereas in the alternative approach, 2-D classification is bypassed and subtomograms are subjected directly to 3-D classification (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>); for brevity, we term this alternative method “direct 3-D classification”. Direct 3-D classification is limited by computer hardware (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kimanius et al., 2016</xref>), but can detect more canonical nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>); see the Methods for more details. In this study, the original workflow is used on a subset of samples to show example 2-D class averages for comparison with other studies. However, the conclusions in this paper are drawn from direct 3-D classification, which detects more canonical nucleosomes.</p>
<p>Our previous subtomogram analysis of nuclear lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cai et al., 2018c</xref>) revealed that nucleosomes from the wild-type strain YEF473A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bi and Pringle, 1996</xref>) adopt the canonical structure <italic>ex vivo</italic>. We repeated this experiment on the strain BY4741 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brachmann et al., 1998</xref>), which serves as the wild-type and parent strain for the histone-GFP tagging mutants described later. In this experiment, yeast nuclei are isolated, lysed, then deposited on an EM grid. Cryotomograms of BY4741 nuclear lysates reveal the crowded nucleosome-like particles and other cellular debris (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). Next, we template matched for nucleosome-like particles using a nucleosome-sized featureless cylinder as a reference. Direct 3-D classification (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3, A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>) followed by 3-D refinement produced an 18 Å-resolution subtomogram average of a BY4741 canonical nucleosome class (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref>). The subtomogram average of wild-type yeast nucleosomes in nuclear lysates has longer linker DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) than the crystal structure, which was reconstituted using a 146-bp DNA fragment.</p>

<title>Canonical nucleosomes are rare in wild-type cells <italic>in situ</italic></title>
<p>Cryo-FIB milling is a compression-free method to thin frozen-hydrated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hayles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Mahamid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Marko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Medeiros et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Rigort et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Villa et al., 2013</xref>). This technique uses a beam of gallium ions to thin a cell under cryogenic conditions, producing a frozen-hydrated plank-like cellular sample called a cryolamella. Canonical nucleosomes are detectable in a HeLa cell cryolamella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>), meaning that cryo-FIB milling does not grossly perturb canonical nucleosomes <italic>in situ</italic>. We prepared cryolamellae of wild-type BY4741 cells. Cryotomograms of yeast cryolamellae showed that nuclei were packed with nucleosome-like particles (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>). Two-dimensional class averages of template-matched nucleosome-like particles reveal densities that have the approximate size and shape of nucleosomes (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>). We then subjected the particles belonging to the most nucleosome-like 2-D class averages to 3-D classification, following the original RELION classification workflow. However, none of these 3-D class averages resemble canonical nucleosomes (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref>). While many of the nucleosome-like class averages have dimensions similar to the canonical nucleosome, none of them have densities that resemble the distinctive 1.65 left-handed gyres of DNA. To rule out the possibility that canonical nucleosomes were missed during 2-D classification, we performed direct 3-D classification using 100 classes. None of the resultant 100 class averages resemble a canonical nucleosome (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine if our template-matching and classification workflow missed the canonical nucleosomes, we re-did both template matching and 3-D classification of BY4741 wild-type yeast cryolamellae with intentionally biased references. Instead of a featureless cylinder, we used the yeast nucleosome crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">White et al., 2001</xref>) as the reference (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7A</xref>). If canonical nucleosomes are abundant in yeast, they should be detected as a class average that resembles a low-resolution nucleosome crystal structure. No canonical nucleosome class averages were seen in this control experiment (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7B</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).</p>
<p>Our previous study of a HeLa cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>), which detected canonical nucleosomes, used a Volta phase plate (VPP). VPP data has more low-resolution contrast than defocus phase-contrast data. To test if canonical nucleosomes in yeast cryolamellae are detectable in VPP data, we recorded VPP tilt series and reconstructed tomograms of BY4741 cell cryolamellae (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>). Subtomogram analysis of the VPP tomograms by 2-D classification (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9A</xref>), followed by 3-D classification did not reveal a nucleosome class average in BY4741 (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9B</xref>). When we performed direct 3-D classification using 100 classes, we detected one class average that resembles a canonical nucleosome (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10A</xref>, Movie S1). A second round of classification revealed two types of class averages, one of which resembles a slightly elongated nucleosome (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10B</xref>, Movie S2). Refinement of these two types of nucleosomes produced 24 Å-resolution averages that differ in the amount of linker DNA visible (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">S10C</xref>). The class average that has more ordered linker DNA vaguely resembles the chromatosome, a form of the nucleosome that has linker DNA crossing at the entry-exit site and in contact with a linker histone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bednar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). However, the DNA does not appear to cross at the DNA entry-exit site, and, at the present resolution, it is not possible to determine if the linker histone is present. Unlike plunge-frozen complexes, which interact with the air-water interface and have biased orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Noble et al., 2018</xref>), complexes <italic>in situ</italic> are not subject to such biases. Visualization of the angular distribution of the canonical nucleosomes shows that the disc views are undersampled and likely missed by the classification analysis (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10D</xref>), which we also observed in our analysis of HeLa nucleosomes <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>). This missing hemisphere of views results in roughly half of the canonical nucleosomes going undetected. In summary, the use of VPP and relatively thin (≤ 160 nm) cryolamellae made it possible to detect two canonical nucleosome classes that differ in the amount of ordered linker DNA, similar to what we observed in a HeLa cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>).</p>
<p>Following our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>), we performed a negative control by analyzing a tomogram of a region in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure S11</xref>), which does not have any nucleosomes. We performed template matching using the same reference as for our analysis of nuclei and then direct 3-D classification into 100 classes. None of the resultant class averages resemble a canonical nucleosome (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure S12</xref>), confirming that our analysis was not biased by the cylindrical reference.</p>
<p>Our classification detected only 769 canonical nucleosomes. If we account for the undersampling of disc views (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10D</xref>), we estimate there are ∼1,500 canonical nucleosomes detected in the 5 tomograms. In comparison, we estimate that in the single HeLa cryolamella cryotomogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>), there were more than 2,000 nucleosomes in a nucleus volume ∼1/6th of the total analyzed here in BY4741. The percentage of HeLa nucleosomes that are non-canonical <italic>in situ</italic> is unknown and will require further study. To visualize the distribution of canonical nucleosomes, we remapped the two class averages back into their positions in the original tomogram that contains the largest number of canonical nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The remapped model shows that the canonical nucleosomes are scattered throughout the sampled nuclear volume. There are no large clusters of canonical nucleosomes like what we saw near the nuclear envelope of a HeLa cell. Using experimentally determined values for nucleosome number and chromatin volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Oberbeckmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Uchida et al., 2011</xref>), the tomograms we analyzed are expected to hold 25,000 nucleosomes. Therefore, the nucleosomes (both canonical and non-canonical) should pack with an order-of-magnitude higher density than visualized in our remapped model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In summary, our calculations suggest that the vast majority (&gt; 90%) of the nucleosomes in BY4741 yeast are non-canonical.</p>

<title>Histone GFP-tagging strategy</title>
<p>Our previous cryo-ET analysis of nucleosomes in a HeLa cell revealed that subtomogram 3-D classification is sensitive to features much smaller than the nucleosomes, as evidenced by the separation of canonical-nucleosome class averages that differ by ∼10 bp of linker DNA near the dyad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>). Furthermore, studies of flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Oda and Kikkawa, 2013</xref>) and pilus machines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chang et al., 2016</xref>) showed that subtomogram averages of complexes <italic>in situ</italic> can reveal either the presence or absence of protein densities as small as fluorescent proteins. These observations led us to attempt to use the GFP tag to facilitate nucleosome identification <italic>in situ</italic>. Our strategy is to compare subtomogram averages of nucleosome-like particles in strains that express only wild-type histones versus those that express only GFP-tagged histones. Note that this tagging strategy did <italic>not</italic> work as intended because we could not detect tagged nucleosomes 3-D classes <italic>in situ</italic>. However, this negative result provided an important clue about the nature of nucleosomes inside yeast cells (see below).</p>
<p>Histones can accept a genetically encoded GFP tag at either the N- or C-terminus. An N-terminal GFP tag is not expected to be visible in subtomogram averages because it would be separated from the histone’s globular domain by the long, flexible N-terminal “tail”. Therefore, we chose to tag the histone C-terminus, which does not have a flexible tail (<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Figure S13, A</xref> and <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). To further confine the tag, we eliminated the peptide linker that is included in popular GFP-tagging modules (<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Figure S13C</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> contains two copies of each histone (<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Figure S13D</xref>), which are arranged as gene pairs. To maximize our chances of detecting nucleosome class averages that have an extra density, we sought to create strains in which a histone-GFP fusion is the sole source of one class of histones (<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Figure S13, E</xref> and <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">F</xref>).</p>
<p>In budding yeast, the H2A and H2B genes are arranged as gene pairs <italic>HTA1-HTB1</italic> and <italic>HTA2-HTB2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hereford et al., 1979</xref>). We first deleted the entire <italic>HTA2-HTB2</italic> gene pair to generate LGY0012. This deletion prevents <italic>HTA2-HTB2</italic>, which is flanked by two retrotransposon elements, from being amplified in circular DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Libuda and Winston, 2006</xref>). We then inserted the GFP gene at the 3’ end of <italic>HTA1</italic>, without a linker, to generate LGY0016, making H2A-GFP the sole source of H2A. We confirmed LGY0016’s genotype by PCR analysis (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Figure S14, A</xref> and <xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">B</xref>) and Sanger sequencing. Immunoblots using anti-H2A or anti-GFP antibodies detected a single ∼40 kilodalton band, which is the expected size of the H2A-GFP fusion protein (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Figure S14C</xref>). Accordingly, the LGY0016 nuclei showed bright fluorescence (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Figure S14D</xref>). We also constructed a strain, LGY0015, that expresses an H2B-GFP fusion without a linker peptide (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Figure S14, E – H</xref>). LGY0015 also has an untagged copy of H2B. We were unable to create strains that have either H2B-GFP, H3-GFP, or H4-GFP as the sole H2B, H3, and H4 sources, respectively. Consistent with this low tolerance for a GFP-tagged histone as the sole source of a histone type, the LGY0016 doubling time is ∼50% longer than for wild-type BY4741 (130 minutes versus 85 minutes) in rich media.</p>

<title>GFP is detectable on nucleosome subtomogram averages <italic>ex vivo</italic></title>
<p>To determine if GFP tags are detectable on the nucleosome’s surface, we imaged the nuclear lysates of LGY0016 and LGY0015 cells by cryo-ET (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Figures S15</xref> and <xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">S16</xref>). The 2-D class averages of LGY0016 and LGY0015 nuclear lysates resemble those seen in single-particle cryo-EM studies of reconstituted nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chua et al., 2016</xref>), though with lower-resolution features (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs17" ref-type="fig">S17A</xref>). Note that 2-D classification uses a circular mask, meaning that it will not bias the shape of the resultant class averages to resemble, for example, the double-lined motifs seen in nucleosome side and gyre views. To increase the number of detected nucleosomes, we used direct 3-D classification into 40 classes. We obtained canonical nucleosome 3-D class averages this way in the lysates of both strains (<xref rid="figs18" ref-type="fig">Figure S18</xref> and <xref rid="figs19" ref-type="fig">S19</xref>; Movies S3 and S4). These class averages have the unmistakable structural motifs of canonical nucleosomes, such as a 10-nm diameter, 6-nm thick cylindrical shape, and the left-handed path of the DNA densities. There is more DNA than the crystal structure’s 1.65 gyres because lysate samples have linker DNA. All these properties are consistent with the subtomogram analysis of nucleosomes from wild-type strains BY4741 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and YEF473A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cai et al., 2018c</xref>).</p>

<p>Subsequent classification rounds revealed nucleosome class averages that had an extra density projecting from one or both faces (<xref rid="figs18" ref-type="fig">Figures S18B</xref> and <xref rid="figs19" ref-type="fig">S19B</xref>). One example of each class (zero, one, or two extra densities) was refined to ∼25 Å resolution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="figs17" ref-type="fig">S17B</xref>). The position of the extra density is consistent with the location of the H2A C-terminus being closer to the DNA entry-exit point (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) and the H2B C-terminus being far from the DNA entry-exit point (<xref rid="figs17" ref-type="fig">Figure S17C</xref>). In principle, LGY0015 cells can assemble nucleosomes that have two copies of H2B-GFP. The absence of LGY0015 nucleosome classes with two densities suggest that they are either unstable or too rare to detect by 3-D classification. We focused our <italic>in situ</italic> cryo-ET analysis on LGY0016 cells because the GFP tags are easier to recognize on nucleosomes from nuclear lysates of this strain.</p>

<title>Canonical nucleosome classes are not detected in LGY0016 cells <italic>in situ</italic></title>
<p>In an attempt to detect more yeast nucleosomes <italic>in situ</italic>, we did three types of imaging experiments on LGY0016 cells. We performed cryo-ET of cryolamellae with and without the VPP (<xref rid="figs20" ref-type="fig">Figures S20</xref> and <xref rid="figs21" ref-type="fig">S21</xref>) and we also imaged cryosections with the VPP (<xref rid="figs22" ref-type="fig">Figure S22</xref>). The cryolamellae benefit from the absence of compression artifacts while the cryosections benefit from being thinner on average. We performed template matching and then subjected the hits directly to 3-D classification, which was needed to detect canonical nucleosomes in BY4741 above. The 3-D class averages from all three samples resembled neither canonical nucleosomes nor cylindrical bodies with one or more protruding densities that is expected from the lysate samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>, <xref rid="figs23" ref-type="fig">S23</xref>, <xref rid="figs24" ref-type="fig">S24</xref>, Movie S5). Some class averages have two linear motifs that resemble the double DNA gyres opposite the DNA entry-exit point, but these DNA-like densities do not go 1.65 times around the center of mass as expected of canonical nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). Small variations in the classification parameters such as mask size, class number did not reveal any canonical nucleosome classes in LGY0016 cell cryotomograms. We therefore conclude that canonical nucleosomes are rare inside budding yeast nuclei and that non-canonical nucleosomes are the vast majority.</p>

<title>Ribosome control for sample, data, and analysis pathologies</title>
<p>We may have missed canonical nucleosomes if there were pathologies with either our lamellae, data, or workflow, which would result in grossly misclassified and misaligned particles. To test this hypothesis, we performed template matching, 3-D classification and alignment on cytoplasmic ribosomes. Because ribosomes are so large (&gt; 3 megadaltons) and have been studied extensively <italic>in situ</italic>, any of the pathologies listed above would result in either the absence of ribosome class averages or extremely low resolution. Using our control tomogram of the cytoplasm, which is densely packed with ribosomes, we obtained a subtomogram average at between ∼33 Å resolution based on the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.5 cutoff criterion (or 28 Å using the FSC = 0.143 criterion), from 1,150 particles (<xref rid="figs25" ref-type="fig">Figure S25</xref>). As a comparison, we simulated densities with the yeast ribosome crystal structure between 15 Å and 30 Å resolution and found that our average has density features consistent with this resolution range. The resolutions of our nucleosome and ribosome averages (∼24 Å and 33 Å) are comparable to recent <italic>in situ</italic> subtomogram averages using similar numbers of particles (∼500 to 1,500) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Laughlin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">van den Hoek et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, our lamellae, data, and workflow do not show evidence of pathologies.</p>

<title>GFP tagging of H3 and H4 also does not reveal nucleosomes</title>
<p>In cryolamellae of LGY0016 cells, the absence of nucleosome-like class averages that have an extra density bump suggested that previously unappreciated properties of the H2A-H2B heterodimer make this histone pair a poor candidate for the GFP fusion tag strategy (see Discussion). We therefore revisited GFP tagging of H3 and H4, which are found in all known and speculated forms of nucleosomes and non-canonical nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Zlatanova et al., 2009</xref>). Because all attempts to make H3- or H4-GFP “sole source” strains failed, we tested strains that had one wild-type copy and one GFP-tagged copy of one of these histones. We tagged members of the <italic>HHF1-HHT1</italic> gene pair, which encode histone H4 (<italic>HHF1</italic>) and H3 (<italic>HHT1</italic>). <italic>HHF1-HHT1</italic> is flanked by the same transposon elements as <italic>HTA2-HTB2</italic>, so gene amplification here would not result in the wild-type copy outnumbering the tagged copy. The genotypes and phenotypes were validated by confirmation PCRs, western blots, and fluorescence confocal microscopy (<xref rid="figs26" ref-type="fig">Figures S26</xref> and <xref rid="figs27" ref-type="fig">S27</xref>). We created H3-GFP strains without a linker (LGY0007) and with linker sequences RIPGLIN (LGY0002) and GGSGGS (LGY0070); this latter linker was introduced previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Verzijlbergen et al., 2010</xref>). For H4, we could only obtain a strain with a H4-GFP-expressing strain by using the flexible GGSGGS linker (LGY0071; <xref rid="figs27" ref-type="fig">Figure S27</xref>). Flexible linkers are not expected to facilitate tag-based identification because the tag can occupy a much larger volume and get blurred out as a result but was the only one tolerated in our H4 tagging attempts.</p>
<p>We next prepared nuclear lysates of each of these strains, performed cryo-ET, and subjected them to direct 3-D classification analysis (<xref rid="figs28" ref-type="fig">Figures S28</xref> – <xref rid="figs31" ref-type="fig">S31</xref>). Like the other strains, the lysates of each of these four strains had large numbers of canonical nucleosomes (<xref rid="figs28" ref-type="fig">Figures S28A</xref>, <xref rid="figs29" ref-type="fig">S29A</xref>, <xref rid="figs30" ref-type="fig">S30A</xref>, <xref rid="figs31" ref-type="fig">S31A</xref>). Of the canonical nucleosomes, we were only able to detect class averages that have the extra density in the LGY0007 lysates (<xref rid="figs28" ref-type="fig">Figure S28</xref>); the nuclear lysates of the other strains do not have nucleosome class averages with a GFP density. Finally, to test if nucleosomes, canonical or non-canonical, with the GFP density bump, could be detected <italic>in situ</italic>, we performed cryo-ET of LGY0007 cryolamellae with the VPP (<xref rid="figs32" ref-type="fig">Figure S32</xref>). We then performed template matching and subjected the hits to direct 3-D classification analysis. Compared to the BY4741 (wild type) cell cryolamella VPP class averages (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10A</xref>), the 3-D class averages in LGY0007 cell cryolamellae resemble neither canonical nucleosomes nor cylindrical bodies with a protruding density (<xref rid="figs33" ref-type="fig">Figure S33</xref>). Therefore, H3- and H4-GFP fusions cannot be used to detect non-canonical nucleosomes and much more work needs to be done to identify non-canonical nucleosomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cryo-EM of cells has made the structural analysis of chromatin organization <italic>in situ</italic> feasible. The earliest <italic>in situ</italic> studies were done with projection cryo-EM images and 2-D Fourier analysis of cryosectioned cells, which revealed that long-range order is absent in chromatin <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Eltsov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">McDowall et al., 1986</xref>). Cryo-ET studies later showed that short-range order is present in isolated chicken erythrocyte nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Scheffer et al., 2011</xref>), but absent in picoplankton and budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gan et al., 2013</xref>). These early cryo-ET studies revealed little about nucleosome structure <italic>in situ</italic> because, as Eltsov <italic>et al</italic> observed, the nucleosomes in those samples appeared like smooth ellipsoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Eltsov et al., 2018</xref>). Recent cryo-ET studies using state-of-the-art electron-counting cameras and energy filters have revealed that in cryotomographic slices of cell nuclei, there are densities that resemble nucleosome side and gyre views in which gyre-like features are resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cai et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Eltsov et al., 2018</xref>). This higher-fidelity data made it possible to use 3-D classification to detect canonical nucleosomes in nuclear envelope-associated chromatin in a HeLa cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>).</p>
<p>Our use of 3-D classification detected canonical nucleosomes in wild-type yeast nuclear lysates and canonical nucleosomes both with and without GFP tags in nuclear lysates of some strains that bear histone-GFP fusions. We also detected a canonical nucleosome class average in wild-type cell cryolamellae imaged with a VPP. The <italic>in situ</italic> detections suggest that there are only ∼1,500 canonical nucleosomes (taking account of the undersampling of nucleosomes in the disc view) out of the 25,000 nucleosomes expected of the total sampled nuclear volume. Note that the percentage of canonical nucleosomes in lysates cannot be accurately estimated because we cannot determine how many chromosomes’ worth of nucleosomes are in each field of view. The estimates from the lamellae are more reliable because the expected numbers of nucleosomes (canonical or not) can be estimated from genomics, biochemical, and X-ray tomography data (see Methods). When we analyzed LGY0016 cryolamellae, in which H2A-GFP is the sole source of H2A, we did not detect canonical nucleosome classes or any cylindrical nucleosome-sized structures that have extra density bumps. Likewise, analysis of cryolamellae of LGY0007 did not reveal either a canonical nucleosome-like class average or any cylindrical nucleosome-sized density with an extra density bump, even though H3-GFP should be incorporated into the H3-H4 tetramer, the central component of the nucleosome.</p>
<p>The absence of either a canonical nucleosome-like class average that has an extra density bump, or a cylinder with an extra density bump in the LGY0016 strain suggests that the H2A-H2B heterodimer is mobile <italic>in situ</italic>. By “mobility”, we are not implying that H2A-H2B is dissociated. The H2A/H2B dimers are in contact with the H3/H4 heterotetramer because crosslinking and single-particle fluorescence imaging experiments showed that approximately 80% of H2B – and presumably H2A to which it stably dimerizes – is bound to chromatin <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mohan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Ranjan et al., 2020</xref>). H2A-H2B mobility was hinted at by the observations from X-ray crystallography that yeast nucleosomes lack the hydrogen bonds that stabilize the two H2A-H2B heterodimers in metazoan nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">White et al., 2001</xref>) and that interfaces between H2A-H2B and H3 are moderately exposed to small-molecule probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Marr et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, recent simulations show that the H2A/H2B heterodimer may adopt numerous orientations and small displacements, with either fully or partially unwrapped DNA, while remaining in contact with H3-H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ishida and Kono, 2022</xref>). We also cannot rule out the possibility that expression of H2A-GFP nucleosome structure is less ordered <italic>in situ</italic>.</p>
<p>Like LGY0016 (H2A-GFP sole source), none of the LGY0007 (H3 plus H3-GFP) nucleosome-like class averages had an extra density consistent with the GFP density tag, unlike the lysates. Furthermore, there were no canonical nucleosome class averages – either without or with the GFP density – seen among the class averages of LGY0007 lamella nucleosome-like particles. These observations suggest that the expression of H3-GFP makes nucleosomes less ordered <italic>in situ</italic>. Altogether, our experiments show that in budding yeast, canonical nucleosomes are rare <italic>in situ</italic> and that the expression of GFP-tagged histones leads to further perturbations of nucleosome structure <italic>in situ</italic>.</p>
<p>Our data is consistent with a model in which yeast canonical nucleosomes are abundant <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). They adopt multiple non-canonical conformations <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) and rarely adopt the canonical one (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Note that the blurring in these panels implies the heterogeneity in the positions of the DNA and proteins, not their actual motion. In addition to H2A-H2B and DNA conformational heterogeneity, diverse nucleosome-associated proteins that bind to multiple positions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) would further increase the heterogeneity; in this figure, the blurring implies constitutional heterogeneity, not motion. A high abundance of non-canonical nucleosomes means that more of the genome would be accessible, consistent with yeast having high levels of transcription. Nucleosome heterogeneity is also consistent with the absence of chromatin long-range order <italic>in situ</italic> because crystalline oligonucleosome arrays can only form if sequential nucleosomes adopt nearly identical conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ekundayo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Robinson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Song et al., 2014</xref>). Further investigation is needed to identify the biochemical and biophysical factors responsible for the abundance of non-canonical nucleosomes in yeast and to determine their diverse structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Zlatanova et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>In combination with our previous work on a HeLa cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>), we show that globular complexes as small as canonical nucleosomes (∼200 kilodaltons) can be detected by 3-D classification of subtomograms from cryolamellae that were imaged with a VPP. Given the low throughput of cryo-FIB milling, the low yield of cryolamellae thinner than 160 nm, and the technical difficulties of VPP imaging, it is not yet feasible to systematically determine the conditions needed to detect sub-200 kDa complexes by purification <italic>in silico</italic>. More depositions of eukaryote cryolamellae cryo-ET datasets in the public database EMPIAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Iudin et al., 2016</xref>) may enable a thorough search of data-collection and processing-parameter space.</p>
<p>Our <italic>in situ</italic> cryo-ET-based model adds to the body of work on non-canonical nucleosomes. ChIP-seq analysis has detected sub-nucleosomes <italic>in situ</italic>, though the abundance was unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Rhee et al., 2014</xref>). MNase-seq has also detected nucleosomes in a partially unwrapped and partially disassembled state <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Ramachandran et al., 2017</xref>). A recent Hi-C variant “Hi-CO” presented evidence that &lt; 147 bp of yeast nucleosomal DNA is protected from MNase attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Ohno et al., 2019</xref>), which is consistent with the partial detachment of core DNA. Molecular dynamics advances in all-atom and coarse-grained simulations are now showing that nucleosomes are far more dynamic than previously appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Armeev et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brandani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Farr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Huertas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ishida and Kono, 2021</xref>). The DNA-unwrapping associated with nucleosome breathing was shown to disfavor ordered helical oligonucleosome structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Farr et al., 2021</xref>). Nucleosome breathing is also evident in high-throughput atomic-force microscopy experiments, which revealed that only ∼30% of nucleosomes are fully wrapped, and that approximately half of the nucleosomes have an opening angle (measured between the entry/exit DNA arms) 60° larger than the fully wrapped one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Konrad et al., 2021</xref>). Nucleosomes that have non-canonical nucleosome properties, such as lower stability or exposure of internal surfaces, have been reported in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Koyama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sanulli et al., 2019</xref>), which may explain why we did not observe canonical nucleosomes in cryosections in those cells either (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cai et al., 2018b</xref>). Some nucleosomes in human and fly cell cryosections appear “gaping”, i.e., with the inter-DNA-gyre distance slightly larger than ∼2.7 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Eltsov et al., 2018</xref>). Partial DNA detachment has been seen in complexes between nucleosomes and remodelers and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eustermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Farnung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Willhoft et al., 2018</xref>), methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bilokapic and Halic, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Jang et al., 2019</xref>), or transcription-related complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dodonova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Kujirai et al., 2018</xref>). Larger amounts (up to ∼25 bp) of DNA detachment have been seen very rarely in cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bilokapic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). A recent study of cryosectioned fly embryos has also presented evidence of nucleosome-like structures such as hemisomes and three-gyre structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fatmaoui et al., 2022</xref>). The prevalence and functional consequences of non-canonical nucleosomes <italic>in situ</italic> remain to be studied in other organisms.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Alternative hypotheses</title>
<p>We consider the alternative hypothesis that canonical nucleosomes are the dominant form <italic>in situ</italic> and that we have missed them as a result of our image processing. Many of the 3-D class averages appear to have multiple gyre-like densities, which may arise from nucleosome stacking. However, classes with multiple gyre-like densities are also found in the class averages from the cytoplasm, which does not have nucleosomes (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure S12</xref>). These are “junk” classes that result from the averaging of different particle species into the same class. Importantly, stacked canonical nucleosomes are so conspicuous that they could not have been missed in tomographic slices. For instance, two stacked canonical nucleosomes have twice the mass of a single canonical nucleosome and would have dimensions 12 nm by 10 nm (<xref rid="figs34" ref-type="fig">Figure S34</xref>). Multiple stacked canonical nucleosomes would appear like 10-nm-thick filaments.</p>
<p>Another alternative hypothesis is that the lack of disc views, corresponding to nucleosomes whose “face” is parallel to the lamella surface, resulted in canonical nucleosomes going undetected. This hypothesis would be supported only if the orientations of canonical nucleosomes were biased. However, biased orientation in cryo-EM experiments is usually a result of interactions with the air-water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Noble et al., 2018</xref>), which does not exist for nucleosomes inside the nucleus of a cell. Another hypothesis is that the missing views resulted in elongated class averages because of the missing wedge or missing cone in Fourier space. This artifact would only affect the distribution of canonical versus non-canonical nucleosomes if canonical nucleosomes have a preferred orientation, which we have just argued against due to the nature of our cellular samples. The class averages from non-disc-view nucleosomes do not have a missing-wedge/cone artifact because they include nucleosomes whose superhelical axes are in the X-Y plane; when averaged together, the Fourier transforms of these nucleosomes “fill in” Fourier space because they sample numerous rotations about their super-helical axes. Missing-wedge-free reconstructions are exemplified by plunge-frozen actin filaments, which lie parallel to the EM grid. As illustrated in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Merino et al., 2018</xref>), reconstructions of filamentous actin are free of missing-wedge distortions even though the axial views are completely absent.</p>
<p>Some of the particles in the tomographic slices resemble donuts. Because nucleosome disc views also resemble donuts, it is possible that we completely missed these particles in either our template matching or classification analyses. As stated above, even if we missed all the disc views, our conclusions would not change because the orientations of canonical nucleosomes inside of cellular samples are not biased. Furthermore, the donut-like particles cannot be canonical nucleosomes because they are too wide (&gt; 12 nm). A subset of them were detected by template matching and classification and separated into their own class, which resembles a cylinder with a rounded cap (Movie S5, row 5 column 1).</p>
<p>Another hypothesis for the low numbers of detected canonical nucleosomes is that the nucleoplasm is too crowded. However, crowding is an unlikely explanation because we were able to detect canonical nucleosome class averages in our most-crowded nuclear lysates, which are so crowded that most nucleosomes are butted against others (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Figures S15</xref> and <xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">S16</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>Because naked linker DNA cannot yet be seen <italic>in situ</italic> in yeast, the connectivity between the nucleosomes (both canonical and non-canonical) could not be followed. The subtomogram analysis was unable to resolve the structures of the non-canonical nucleosomes. Because of the low resolution, we could not assess the variability in the structure and composition of the canonical nucleosomes. All of these limitations could potentially be addressed by increasing the data quality and the numbers of classes and subtomograms per class, which require advances at all stages of structural cell biology. These advances include improvements in cryo-FIB milling throughput and reproducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Buckley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Tacke et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Zachs et al., 2020</xref>), cryo-EM cameras, laser phase plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Turnbaugh et al., 2021</xref>), template-matching / segmentation software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bepler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Moebel et al., 2021</xref>), and subtilt refinement software such as emClarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Himes and Zhang, 2018</xref>), EMAN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), Warp/M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Tegunov et al., 2021</xref>) and RELION 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Zivanov et al., 2022</xref>). Because structural cell biology is still a nascent field, the optimum combination of sample prep, imaging, and data analysis will require thorough exploration of the parameter space at each step. The nucleosome Volta subtomogram averages presented here were limited to ∼24 Å, even though the data was recorded close to focus as suggested by a higher-resolution study of purified ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Khoshouei et al., 2017</xref>). Limiting factors include lower particle numbers, alignment inaccuracy, VPP charging, and the lack of contrast transfer function (CTF) modeling. In single-particle cryo-EM analysis, high-resolution analysis (3 Å or better) requires accurate modeling and then compensation for the CTF. A key first step of CTF modeling is the visualization of Thon rings in Fourier power spectra. We plotted Fourier power spectra in both 2-D with CTFFIND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>) and as a 1-D rotational average with IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mastronarde, 1997</xref>), but could not see Thon rings (<xref rid="figs35" ref-type="fig">Figure S35</xref>), meaning that CTF compensation is not feasible. A study of VPP single-particle cryo-EM analysis recommends intentionally underfocussing to 500 nm to increase the number of Thon rings, making CTF modeling easier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Danev et al., 2017</xref>). However, the samples used in that study were much thinner (plunge-frozen proteasomes) and the dose used per image was much higher (∼40 electrons / Å<sup>2</sup>). Because the subtomogram analysis of smaller complexes inside cryolamellae faces multiple challenges, more investigation is needed to determine the optimum parameters for increased resolution.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the positive identification of the non-canonical nucleosome species. The approaches attempted here (the use of a GFP tag) failed. An alternative approach would be to remap the various averages and show that the linker DNA of sequential non-canonical nucleosomes point to each other, as we have previously done for HeLa chromatin <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>). Unfortunately, this approach is not suitable for yeast because only the canonical class averages have linker-DNA densities – none of the other class averages have densities that resemble linker DNA. Because non-canonical yeast nucleosomes <italic>in situ</italic> are unknown structures, we would have to identify individual instances using a “GFP of cryo-EM”, in the form of a compact fusion protein-like structure that can be directly visualized in tomographic slices without classification and subtomogram averaging. Several attempts have been made in recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Diestra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Mercogliano and DeRosier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Nishino et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). More work is needed to test the suitability of such tags as “GFPs of cryo-EM” <italic>in situ</italic>.</p>

<title>Plasmid extraction and linearization</title>
<p>The pFA6a plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>) used are shown in the key resources table. The plasmid pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-His3MX6 was a gift from John Pringle (Addgene 41598; Addgene, Watertown, MA) and pFA6a-link-yoTagRFP-T-Kan was a gift from Wendell Lim &amp; Kurt Thorn (Addgene 44906); both were given in the form of bacterial stabs. Note that pFA6a-link-yoTagRFP-T-Kan is the source of the KanR marker used to delete HTB2-HTA2. Five mL of bacteria were cultured overnight, then plasmids were extracted with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>Extracted plasmids were linearized by double digestion with a reaction containing 1 µg of plasmid DNA, 5 µL of 10× rCutSmart™ Buffer (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), 10 units each of <italic>Sal</italic>I and <italic>EcoR</italic>V restriction enzymes (New England BioLabs) topped up to 50 µL with nuclease-free water. The reaction mixture was heated at 37°C for 15 minutes for the digestion reaction, then 80°C for 20 minutes to inactivate the enzymes.</p>

<title>Strain construction</title>
<p>The strain details are shown in <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>. Primers were from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Singapore) and listed in <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>. Q5 PCR Master Mix (New England BioLabs) was used for PCR reactions. BY4741 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brachmann et al., 1998</xref>) served as the wild-type strain. Tagging and deletion cassettes were amplified from linearized pFA6a plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>) with a PCR reaction containing 1 ng of template DNA and 0.5 μM of each primer, using a PCR program of 98°C for 30 seconds, 30 cycles of 98°C for 5 seconds, 60°C for 10 seconds and 72°C for 1.5 minutes, then 72°C for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Cells were transformed using the lithium acetate / PEG4000 method reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Nishimura and Kanemaki, 2014</xref>). Overnight cell culture in YPD was diluted to 0.1 OD<sub>600</sub> in 25 mL of YPD and grown to 0.3 OD<sub>600</sub>. Ten mL of cells were collected, centrifuged at 1,600 <italic>× g</italic> at 25°C for 3 minutes, and the supernatant was removed. The cells were then washed twice with 10 mL sterile water with centrifugation at 1,600 <italic>× g</italic> at 25°C for 3 minutes. The cells were resuspended in 1 mL sterile water, transferred to a new 1.5 mL collection tube, centrifuged at 17,900 × <italic>g</italic> at 25°C for 1 minute, washed in 1 mL of TE/LiAc (10 mM tris, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 100 mM lithium acetate), with centrifugation at 17,900 × <italic>g</italic> for 1 minute, and resuspended in 50 μL of the same buffer. Fifty μL of cell suspension was transferred to a new 1.5 mL collection tube containing 5 μL of 10 mg/mL salmon sperm DNA (Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA) plus 5 μL of PCR-amplified cassette DNA. 360 µL of TE/LiAc/PEG (10 mM tris, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM lithium acetate, 40% w/v Polyethylene glycol 4000) was added and incubated with shaking at 25°C for 30 minutes. Forty µL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added, the suspension was incubated at 42°C for 15 minutes in a water bath, then cooled on ice for 2 minutes. The suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 1 minute, the liquid was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 300 μL of 1× TE buffer, pH 8.0 (10 mM tris, 1 mM EDTA). Two hundred μL of this cell suspension was plated on a selection plate and incubated for several days at 30°C. Histidine selection plates were created with 6.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich), 1.92 g/L yeast synthetic drop-out medium supplements without histidine (Sigma-Aldrich), 2% w/v glucose and 2% w/v agar. G418 selection plates were created by adding G418 to the molten agar (YPD for G418 single selection, histidine auxotrophy medium for double selection) to a concentration of 200 mg/L before it was poured.</p>
<p>Transformants were validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted with the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Confirmation PCR was performed with 1 µg of template genomic DNA and 0.5 μM of each primer, using a PCR program of 94°C for 2 minutes, 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 minute, 62°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 3.5 minutes, then 72°C for 5 minutes. PCR products were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions, with water used for the final elution before they were sent for Sanger sequencing.</p>

<title>DNA gels and immunoblots</title>
<p>PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose in Tris-acetate-EDTA and visualized with FloroSafe DNA Stain (Axil Scientific Pte Ltd, Singapore). The electrophoresis was performed at 100 Volts for 60 – 80 minutes before visualization with a G:Box (Syngene).</p>
<p>To generate protein samples for immunoblot analysis, ∼20 OD<sub>600</sub> units of yeast cells were pelleted and stored at −80°C for at least 1 hour. Cells were then resuspended in 200 µL of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and vortexed with glass beads at 4°C for 1 minute 4 times. For each sample, 500 µL of ice-cold 5% TCA was added, mixed with the pellet, then transferred to a new 1.5 mL collection tube. Another 500 µL of ice-cold 5% TCA was mixed with each pellet and transferred to the same 1.5 mL collection tube as before, so that each collection tube had 1 mL total volume. The tubes were then left on ice for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 15,000 <italic>× g</italic> at 4°C for 20 minutes. The TCA was aspirated from the tube, then the pellet was resuspended in 212 µL of Laemmli sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol added (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). To neutralize the residual TCA, 26 µL of 1 M Tris, pH 8 was added. This mixture was heated at 95°C for 5 minutes, centrifuged at 25°C at 15,000 <italic>× g</italic> for 10 minutes, then 5 µL of the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE.</p>
<p>The primary and secondary antibodies used for immunoblots are shown in <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>. 10% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™ Precast Protein Gels (Bio-Rad) were used, with either Precision Plus Protein™ WesternC™ Standards (Bio-Rad) or Invitrogen™ MagicMark™ XP Western Protein Standard (Thermo Fisher Scientific, TFS, Waltham, MA) used as the ladder. The proteins were electrophoresed at 100 Volts for 1 hour at 25°C. The gels were transferred onto Immun-Blot® PVDF Membranes (Bio-Rad) at 4°C in transfer buffer (3.02 g/L tris, 14.4 g/L glycine, 20% methanol). The transfer was performed at 100 Volts for 30 minutes. The membranes were then blocked with 2% BSA in 1× Tris-Buffered Saline, 0.1% Tween® 20 Detergent (TBST) for 1 hour. This was followed by 50 µg/mL avidin in TBST for 30 minutes, then a wash with TBST for 20 minutes if Precision Plus Protein™ WesternC™ Standards ladder was used. All antibody dilution factors are reported in <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>. The membranes were probed with primary antibodies at the stated dilutions in 2% BSA in TBST for 1 hour at 25°C. Membranes were washed with TBST for 20 minutes three times at 25°C. The membranes were then probed with secondary antibodies in 2% BSA in TBST for 1 hour, with additional Precision Protein™ StrepTactin-HRP Conjugate (Bio-Rad) at 1:10,000 dilution if Precision Plus Protein™ WesternC™ Standards ladder was used. Finally, the membranes were washed with TBST for 10 minutes 3 times, then treated with a 50:50 mixture of Clarity Western Peroxide Reagent and Clarity Western Luminol/Enhancer Reagent (Bio-Rad) for 5 minutes before visualization by chemiluminescence on an ImageQuant LAS 4000 (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA).</p>

<title>Fluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>Cells were grown to log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.1 – 1.0), of which 2 OD<sub>600</sub> units of cells were collected, pelleted at 5,000 <italic>× g</italic> for 1 minute, then resuspended in 1 mL of YPD. Four µL of cell culture was then applied to a glass slide and pressed against a coverslip. The cells were imaged live at 23°C with an Olympus FV3000 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 1.35 NA 60× oil-immersion objective lens. GFP fluorescence was acquired using the 488 nm laser-line, with a DIC image recorded in parallel with the fluorescence image. Images were captured as Z-stacks thick enough to sample the GFP signals through all the nuclei in each stage position.

<title>Preparation of nuclear lysates</title>
<p>Yeast nuclei were prepared with reagents from the Yeast nuclei isolation kit (Abcam 206997, Cambridge, United Kingdom), unless noted otherwise. Yeast cells (30 mL, OD<sub>600</sub> ∼1) were pelleted at 3,000 <italic>× g</italic> for 5 minutes at 25°C. The pellet was washed twice with 1 mL water (3,000 <italic>× g</italic>, 1 minute). The pellet was then resuspended in 1 mL Buffer A (pre-warmed to 30°C) containing 10 mM dithiothreitol. The suspension was incubated in a 30°C water bath for 10 minutes. Cells were then pelleted at 1,500 <italic>× g</italic> for 5 minutes and then resuspended in 1 mL Buffer B (prewarmed to 30°C) containing lysis enzyme cocktail (1:100 dilution).

<title>Preparation of cryosections</title>
<p>Self-pressurized freezing was done based on a modified version of a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Yakovlev and Downing, 2011</xref>). Yeast cells (30 mL, OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2 – 0.6) were pelleted and resuspended in a dextran stock (40 kilodalton, 60% w/v, in YPD) to a final concentration of 30%. Cells were then loaded into a copper tube (0.45 / 0.3 mm outer / inner diameters). Both ends of the tube were sealed with flat-jaw pliers. The tube was held horizontally and dropped into the liquid-ethane cryogen. The tube’s ends were removed under liquid nitrogen with a tube-cut tool (Engineering Office M.

<p>Gold colloid solution (10-nm diameter, 5 µL at 5.7 ×10<sup>12</sup> particles/mL in 0.1 mg/mL BSA) was applied to a continuous-carbon grid (10-nm thick carbon) and then air-dried overnight. Cryosections were controlled by a custom joystick-based micromanipulator (MN-151S, Narishige Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ladinsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ng et al., 2020</xref>). Seventy nm-thick frozen-hydrated sections were cut at −150°C in a Leica UC7/FC7 cryo-ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria). The EM grid was positioned underneath the ribbon using a Leica micromanipulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Studer et al., 2014</xref>). The cryosection ribbon (∼3 mm long) was then attached to the grid by operating the Crion (Leica Microsystems) in “charge” mode for ∼30 seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Pierson et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Preparation of cryolamellae</title>
<p>Cells were plunge-frozen and then cryo-FIB milled using the method of Medeiros and Bock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Medeiros et al., 2018</xref>) as follows. Immediately before plunge-freezing, mid-log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> ∼0.6) yeast cells were pelleted at 4,000 <italic>× g</italic> for 5 minutes. They were then resuspended in YPD media containing 3% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide as cryo-protectant to a final OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 2.5. Four µL of the cells were subsequently deposited onto Quantifoil R2/4 200 mesh copper grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH, Jena, Germany), which were then manually blotted from the back with Whatman® Grade 1 filter paper for approximately 3 – 5 seconds. The grids were then plunged into a 63/37 propane/ethane mixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Tivol et al., 2008</xref>) using a Vitrobot Mark IV (humidity: 100%, temperature: 4°C). Cryo-FIB milling was performed on a Helios NanoLab 600 DualBeam (Thermo Fisher Scientific, TFS, Waltham, MA) equipped with a Quorum PolarPrep 2000 transfer system (Quorum Technologies, Laughton, United Kingdom). Plunge-frozen yeast samples were coated with a layer of organometallic platinum using the in-chamber gas injection system and the cold-deposition method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hayles et al., 2007</xref>). Cryolamellae were then generated as follows: bulk material was first removed using the FIB at 30 kV 2.8 nA, followed by successive thinning of the cryolamellae at lower currents of 0.28 nA and 48 pA.</p>

<title>Cryo-ET data collection and reconstruction</title>
<p>All cryo-ET data were collected on Titan Krioses (TFS). Tilt series were collected with either TFS Tomo4, Leginon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Suloway et al., 2009</xref>), SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mastronarde, 2003</xref>), or PACE-tomo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Eisenstein et al., 2022</xref>). Images were recorded either on a Falcon II (TFS) in integration mode or as movie frames on a K2 or K3 summit camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA) in super-resolution mode. The pixel sizes for the K2 and K3 data were chosen so that when binned to the same level, they closely match the ∼7 Å pixel size in our previous <italic>in situ</italic> study of HeLa chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>). Smaller pixel sizes were chosen for Falcon II data because this camera has lower detective quantum efficiency than the K-series cameras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Ruskin et al., 2013</xref>). Movies were aligned with either MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) or IMOD alignframes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mastronarde, 1997</xref>). Prior to starting data collection of cryolamellae, the stage was pre-tilted to either −10° or −15° to account for the milling angle. Additional data-collection details are shown in <xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>.</p>
<p>Volta Phase Plate (VPP) imaging was done using the protocol of Fukuda and colleagues {Fukuda, 2015}. The VPP position and condenser stigmator were adjusted such that the Ronchigram (the projected pattern visible in the camera) was free of elongated features, indicating no astigmatism, and is flat rather than grainy, indicating that the VPP is on-plane. Notably, the VPP needs to be heated, or else the phase shift will rapidly exceed π/2 radians {Danev, 2014}. Two different VPP assemblies were used, which we will refer to as the NYSBC-2019 and NUS-2020 ones. These VPPs required different heater power settings to maintain a stable phase shift. The NYSBC-2019 and NUS-2020 VPP heaters were operated at ∼100 mW and ∼370 mW, respectively.</p>
<p>Cryotomograms were reconstructed using IMOD’s <italic>eTomo</italic> workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mastronarde, 1997</xref>). Tilt series of lysates and cryosections were aligned using the gold beads as fiducials while those of cryolamellae were aligned with patches as fiducials. Only the tilt series that exhibited the minimal amount of drift and sample warping were analyzed. To further improve the tilt series alignment around the chromatin, fiducials (beads or patches) were chosen on the chromatin regions. For cryolamella patch tracking, tilt series were binned to a pixel size of 6.8 Å, the “Break contours into pieces w/ overlap” was set to 10, and the low-frequency rolloff sigma and cutoff radius were set to 0.03 and 0.1 pixel<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. A boundary model was created so that only the chromatin was enclosed. Fiducial patches were manually deleted if they overlapped with debris like ice crystals or if they mistracked. We did not detect a correlation between the alignment residual (<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Table S6</xref>) and our ability to detect canonical nucleosomes.</p>
<p>CTF estimation and phase flipping were done on the defocus phase contrast datasets using IMOD’s <italic>ctfplotter</italic> and <italic>ctfphaseflip</italic> programs. Prior to reconstruction, the cryosection and cryolamellae tilt series were binned to a final pixel size of 6.8 Å using the <italic>eTomo</italic> antialiasing option. Two tomogram versions were reconstructed for each tilt series. For visualization purposes, the tilt series were low-pass filtered to attenuate spatial frequencies beyond 25 Å to 30 Å resolution, prior to tomogram reconstruction. For classification analysis, the tilt series were low-pass filtered with a Gaussian rolloff starting at 15 Å resolution for lysates and 20 Å for cryosections and cryolamellae. In the classification jobs, the resolution of the data was further limited to 25 Å or 20 Å (see next section for details).

<title>Nucleosome template matching, classification, and subtomogram averaging</title>
<p>A featureless round-edged 10 nm-diameter, 6 nm-thick cylindrical template was created using the Bsoft program <italic>beditimg</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Heymann and Belnap, 2007</xref>). A cubic search grid with a 12-nm spacing was created with the PEET program <italic>gridInit</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Heumann, 2016</xref>). Regions that had high-contrast artifacts from surface contaminants and ice crystals were excluded. Template matching was done using PEET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Heumann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Heumann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nicastro et al., 2006</xref>), with a duplicate-removal cutoff distance of 6 nm. To accelerate the runs, no orientation search was done around the cylindrical axis and the resolution was attenuated starting at 70 Å on account of the smooth appearance of the template. Candidate hit lists of different cross-correlation cutoffs were generated using the PEET program <italic>createAlignedModel</italic>, then visualized together with the tomograms in <italic>3dmod</italic>. The cross-correlation cutoff that eliminated spurious densities (primarily empty nucleoplasm) was chosen. The final numbers of subtomograms analyzed for each sample are in <xref rid="tbls7" ref-type="table">Table S7</xref> and in the figures and figure legends.</p>
<p>Classification and subtomogram analysis were done with RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kimanius et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Scheres, 2012</xref>), following the workflows in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>. In the published workflow (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bharat and Scheres, 2016</xref>), each subtomogram is first averaged by projecting the entire volume (16 nm along the Z axis), which introduces contributions from densities above and below the candidate nucleosome. To minimize the influence of other densities, pseudo-projections were created by averaging ∼12 nm along the Z axis, using the <italic>ot_relion_project.py</italic> script. 2-D classification using mask diameters ranging from 120 Å to 140 Å produced clear nucleosome-like classes, though the smaller masks included fewer adjacent densities. Note that in RELION, only circular masks are available for 2-D classification, meaning that it is not possible for the pseudo-projected densities to appear cylinder-like due to truncation by the mask. Densities that belonged to the most nucleosome-like classes were exported for 3-D classification, split into 30 classes. The resolution cutoffs were 25 Å for 2-D and 20 Å for 3-D classification. To eliminate the influence of adjacent densities during 3-D classification, a smooth cylindrical mask with a cosine-shaped edge was applied. The mask was created using <italic>beditimg</italic> and <italic>relion_mask_create</italic>. Because the GFP densities protrude from the nucleosome surface, we used a 9 nm-tall cylindrical mask for the analysis of nucleosomes with GFP tags, such as LGY0016 nucleosomes. The percentage of subtomograms belonging to each class was extracted with the script <italic>count_particles.awk</italic> from Guillaume Gaullier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gaullier, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>As observed in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>), some nucleosomes were lost in the 2-D classification process. We therefore used the alternative workflow in which the template matching hits were directly classified in 3-D (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). To accommodate the increased diversity of complexes (some of which would have been removed had 2-D classification been done), we used 40 classes for BY4741, LGY0015, and LGY0016 lysates and 100 classes for cryolamellae and lysates of strains in which H3 or H4 were GFP tagged, without prior 2-D classification. These jobs crashed frequently because the RELION memory usage scales up with the number of classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kimanius et al., 2016</xref>). We were able to eliminate the crash problem by using higher-memory GPUs and by decreasing the number of translational search steps from 5 to 3 or 4. The canonical nucleosome classes were subjected to “Gold-standard” 3-D refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Henderson et al., 2012</xref>). No map sharpening was applied. Subtomogram class-average volumes were visualized with UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

Template matching was done using this reference, including data to higher resolution (28 Å) than that for the less-biased search above and including a search around all Euler angles. The hits were subjected to 2-D classification to remove obvious non-nucleosomal densities. Next, the hits were 3-D classified using the simulated map as an initial alignment reference. To maximize the model bias, the template was only low-pass filtered to 20 Å-resolution instead of the recommended 60 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bharat and Scheres, 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Estimation of nucleosomes sampled per cryolamella</title>
<p>First, the average concentration of nucleosomes in the chromatin was estimated. The absolute number of nucleosomes per cell determined from genomics is 60,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Oberbeckmann et al., 2019</xref>). Soft X-ray tomography measurements revealed that the average G1 nucleus volume is 2 µm<sup>3</sup>, of which 20% is nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Uchida et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, chromatin (the nuclear volume not taken by the nucleolus), which contains the vast majority of nucleosomes, occupies ∼1.6 µm<sup>3</sup>. These two experimental values give an average nucleosome concentration of 37,500 per µm<sup>3</sup>. Next, the nuclear volume sampled by subtomogram analysis was determined by first drawing one closed contour around the chromatin using 3dmod; this closed contour encloses only the portion of the tomogram that was analyzed by template matching. The volume of this closed contour, which is one-voxel thick, was extracted using the command:</p>
<p>imodinfo -F model.mod</p>
<p>This command outputs the quantity “Cylinder volume”, in cubic pixels (voxels). The total tomographic volume sampled (<xref rid="tbls8" ref-type="table">Table S8</xref>) was obtained by multiplying Cylinder volume, the voxel volume (0.31 nm<sup>3</sup> for 0.68 nm pixel size), and the number of tomographic slices that contain chromatin. The BY4741 VPP tomograms summed to 0.67 µm<sup>3</sup>, which yields ∼25,000 nucleosomes. For the HeLa cell in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cai et al., 2018a</xref>) (EMPIAR-10179), the nucleus volume analyzed was 0.12 µm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>Atomic models of the nucleosome (PDB 1KX5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Davey et al., 2002</xref>) were manually positioned in UCSF Chimera and edited to remove the N-terminal tails. A 3-D density map was calculated with the Bsoft program <italic>bgex</italic>.

A tilt series was calculated from the simulated map using the IMOD program <italic>xyzproj</italic>. The tilt series was then aligned by cross-correlation and then backprojected using IMOD’s <italic>eTomo</italic> workflow.

<title>Ribosome subtomogram analysis control</title>
<p>Ribosomes were analyzed using the same software packages as for nucleosomes, as detailed in the workflow in <xref rid="figs25" ref-type="fig">Figure S25</xref>. Candidate ribosomes were template matched in a single VPP tomogram (from <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure S11</xref>), using a 25-nm-diameter sphere as a reference. The candidate ribosomes were filtered by cross correlation so that obvious false positives (vacuum) were excluded, leaving 3,816 hits. These particles were subjected to direct 3-D classification with k = 10, resulting in six non-empty classes. Particles belonging to the two ribosome classes (1,150 total) were pooled and “gold-standard” refined, yielding a density map at 28 Å resolution (FSC = 0.143) / 33 Å resolution (FSC = 0.5). Density maps were simulated at 15 Å, 20 Å, and 30 Å resolution using the Bsoft program <italic>bgex</italic> and the yeast ribosome crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben-Shem et al., 2011</xref>).

<caption><title>Subtomogram classification workflow</title>
<p>Classification starts with subtomograms that contain nucleosome-like particles, template matched in PEET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). (A) In the workflow recommended by Bharat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Bharat et al., 2015</xref>), the subtomograms are first subjected to sequential rounds of 2-D classification to remove particles that belong to ‘bad’ classes. Once the bad classes are removed, the remaining set is subjected to 3-D classification. (B) In the alternative “direct 3-D” classification workflow, the subtomograms are subjected directly to 3-D classification. The 2-D classification steps (greyed out) are bypassed.</p></caption>

<p>(A) Maps of the two H2A-H2B loci in the parent (wild-type) strain BY4741 and the H2A-GFP strain LGY0016. Primers used for PCR verification are indicated with the half arrow symbols. (B) Agarose gel of PCR amplicons expected (or not) from LGY0016 genomic DNA, in which the HTB2-HTA2 locus is deleted and the HTA1 locus is tagged with GFP. (C) Immunoblot analysis of strains LGY0016 (expresses H2A-GFP only) and LGY0012 (expresses H2A only, control). The α-GFP antibody correctly detected the large H2A-GFP fusion protein in LGY0016 (lane 4) but not in LGY0012 (lane 3, negative control). The α-H2A antibody detected H2A-GFP in LGY0016 and H2A in LGY0012. (D) DIC and GFP fluorescence confocal microscopy for LGY0016 cells. In the left panel, the GFP signals are overlaid in green. In the right panel, GFP signals are rendered with inverted contrast. (E) Map of the HTA1-HTB1 locus before (upper) and after (lower) the GFP insertion, with validation primers indicated. The color scheme is the same as in panel A. Note that LGY0015 still has the HTA2-HTB2 gene pair and therefore expresses untagged H2B. (F) Validation PCR for LG0015. (G) Validation immunoblots for strains BY4741 (wild type) and LGY0015 (expresses H2B and H2B-GFP). The α-GFP detected a ∼40 kDa protein (H2B-GFP) in LGY0015 but not BY4741. The α-H2B antibody detects the 40 kDa (H2B-GFP) in LGY0015 but not BY4741. Note that the α-H2B antibody has poorer specificity and does not generate a strong signal for the untagged H2B. (H) In the left panel, the GFP signals are overlaid in green. In the right panel, GFP signals are rendered with inverted contrast.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Control VPP subtomogram analysis of ribosomes <italic>in situ</italic></title>
<p>(A) Candidate ribosomes were template matched from a single VPP tomogram of the cytoplasm from <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure S11</xref>, using a 25-nm-diameter sphere as a reference. Direct 3-D classification into ten classes led to six non-empty classes, of which two were of ribosomes. Note that template matching is insufficient to uniquely identify a macromolecular complex, particularly when the reference is a featureless body like a sphere or cylinder. A simple reference was used to reduce the model bias. Template matching done with featureless references generates substantial numbers of false positives, which are confidently removed by classification. Complexes are only considered as identified after the 3-D classification step produces recognizable class averages. Therefore, the term “candidate ribosomes” is used to describe the 3,816 template matching hits. (B) The 1,150 ribosome subtomograms were pooled and 3-D refined, producing an average at 28 Å resolution by the “Gold-standard” FSC (0.143 cutoff) criterion and 33 Å resolution with an FSC = 0.5 cutoff.

<p>This manuscript by Tan et al is using cryo-electron tomography to investigate the structure of yeast nucleosomes both ex vivo (nuclear lysates) and in situ (lamellae and cryosections). The sheer number of experiments and results are astounding and comparable with an entire PhD thesis. However, as is always the case, it is hard to prove that something is not there. In this case, canonical nucleosomes. In their path to find the nucleosomes, the authors also stumble over new insights into nucleosome arrangement that indicates that the positions of the histones is more flexible than previously believed.</p>
<p>Major strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>Personally, I am not ready to agree with their conclusion that heterogenous non-canonical nucleosomes predominate in yeast cells, but this reviewer is not an expert in the field of nucleosomes and can't judge how well these results fit into previous results in the field. As a technological expert though, I think the authors have done everything possible to test that hypothesis with today's available methods. One can debate whether it is necessary to have 35 supplementary figures, but after working through them all, I see that the nature of the argument needs all that support, precisely because it is so hard to show what is not there. The massive amount of work that has gone into this manuscript and the state-of-the art nature of the technology should be warmly commended. I also think the authors have done a really great job with including all their results to the benefit of the scientific community. Yet, I am left with some questions and comments:</p>
<p>Could the nucleosomes change into other shapes that were predetermined in situ? Could the authors expand on if there was a structure or two that was more common than the others of the classes they found? Or would this not have been found because of the template matching and later reference particle used?</p>
<p>Could it simply be that the yeast nucleoplasm is differently structured than that of HeLa cells and it was harder to find nucleosomes by template matching in these cells? The authors argue against crowding in the discussion, but maybe it is just a nucleoplasm texture that side-tracks the programs?</p>
<p>The title of the paper is not well reflected in the main figures. The title of Figure 2 says &quot;Canonical nucleosomes are rare in wild-type cells&quot;, but that is not shown/quantified in that figure. Rare is comparison to what? I suggest adding a comparative view from the HeLa cells, like the text does in lines 195-199. A measure of nucleosomes detected per volume nucleoplasm would also facilitate a comparison.</p>
<p>If the cell contains mostly non-canonical nucleosomes, are they really non-canonical? Maybe a change of language is required once this is somewhat sure (say, after line 303).</p>
<p>The authors could explain more why they sometimes use conventional the 2D followed by 3D classification approach and sometimes &quot;direct 3-D classification&quot;. Why, for example, do they do 2D followed by 3D in Figure S5A? This Figure could be considered a regular figure since it shows the main message of the paper.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Why is there a gap in the middle of the nucleosome in panel B? The authors write that this is a higher resolution structure (18Å), but in the even higher resolution crystallography structure (3Å resolution), there is no gap in the middle.</p>

<p>Nucleosome structures inside cells remain unclear. Tan et al. tackled this problem using cryo-ET and 3-D classification analysis of yeast cells. The authors found that the fraction of canonical nucleosomes in the cell could be less than 10% of total nucleosomes. The finding is consistent with the unstable property of yeast nucleosomes and the high proportion of the actively transcribed yeast genome. The authors made an important point in understanding chromatin structure in situ. Overall, the paper is well-written and informative to the chromatin/chromosome field.</p>

<p>Several labs in the 1970s published fundamental work revealing that almost all eukaryotes organize their DNA into repeating units called nucleosomes, which form the chromatin fiber. Decades of elegant biochemical and structural work indicated a primarily octameric organization of the nucleosome with 2 copies of each histone H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, wrapping 147bp of DNA in a left handed toroid, to which linker histone would bind.</p>
<p>This was true for most species studied (except, yeast lack linker histone) and was recapitulated in stunning detail by in vitro reconstitutions by salt dialysis or chaperone-mediated assembly of nucleosomes. Thus, these landmark studies set the stage for an exploding number of papers on the topic of chromatin in the past 45 years.</p>
<p>An emerging counterpoint to the prevailing idea of static particles is that nucleosomes are much more dynamic and can undergo spontaneous transformation. Such dynamics could arise from intrinsic instability due to DNA structural deformation, specific histone variants or their mutations, post-translational histone modifications which weaken the main contacts, protein partners, and predominantly, from active processes like ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, transcription, repair and replication.</p>
<p>This paper is important because it tests this idea whole-scale, applying novel cryo-EM tomography tools to examine the state of chromatin in yeast lysates or cryo-sections. The experimental work is meticulously performed, with vast amount of data collected. The main findings are interpreted by the authors to suggest that majority of yeast nucleosomes lack a stable octameric conformation. The findings are not surprising in that alternative conformations of nucleosomes might exist in vivo, but rather in the sheer scale of such particles reported, relative to the traditional form expected from decades of biochemical, biophysical and structural data. Thus, it is likely that this work will be perceived as controversial. Nonetheless, we believe these kinds of tools represent an important advance for in situ analysis of chromatin. We also think the field should have the opportunity to carefully evaluate the data and assess whether the claims are supported, or consider what additional experiments could be done to further test the conceptual claims made. It is our hope that such work will spark thought-provoking debate in a collegial fashion, and lead to the development of exciting new tools which can interrogate native chromatin shape in vivo. Most importantly, it will be critical to assess biological implications associated with more dynamic - or static forms- of nucleosomes, the associated chromatin fiber, and its three-dimensional organization, for nuclear or mitotic function.</p>

<p>We thank the Editors and Reviewers for their thoughtful and helpful comments. We also appreciate the extraordinary amount of effort needed to assess both the lengthy manuscript and the previous reviews. Below, we provide our provisional responses in bold blue font. The majority of the comments are straightforward to address. We have taken a more conservative approach with the subset of comments that would require us to speculate because we either lack key information or we lack technical expertise. Instead of adding the speculative replies to the main text, we think it will be better to leave them in the rebuttal for posterity. Readers will therefore have access to our speculation and know that we did not feel confident enough to include these thoughts in the Version of Record.</p>

<p>We want to point out that canonical nucleosomes are there in wild-type cells in situ, albeit rarer than what’s expected based on our HeLa cell analysis. The negative result (absence of any canonical nucleosome classes in situ) was found in the histone-GFP mutants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>Personally, I am not ready to agree with their conclusion that heterogenous non-canonical nucleosomes predominate in yeast cells, but this reviewer is not an expert in the field of nucleosomes and can't judge how well these results fit into previous results in the field.

</disp-quote>
<p>Our best guess (speculation) is that one of the class averages that is smaller than the canonical nucleosome contains one or more non-canonical nucleosome classes. We do not feel confident enough to single out any of these classes precisely because we do not yet know if they arise from one non-canonical nucleosome structure or from multiple – and therefore mis-classified – non-canonical nucleosome structures (potentially with other non-nucleosome complexes mixed in). We feel it is better to leave this discussion out of the manuscript, or risk sending the community on wild goose chases.</p>
<p>Our template-matching workflow uses a low-enough cross-correlation threshold that any nucleosome-sized particle (plus minus a few nanometers) would be picked, which is why the number of hits is so large. So unless the noncanonical nucleosomes quadrupled in size or lost most of their histones, they should be grouped with one or more of the other 99 class averages (WT cells) or any of the 100 class averages (cells with GFP-tagged histones). As to whether the later reference particle could have prevented us from detecting one of the non-canonical nucleosome structures, we are unable to tell because we’d really have to know what an in situ non-canonical nucleosome looks like first.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Presumably, the nucleoplasmic “side-tracking” texture would come from some molecules in the yeast nucleus. These molecules would be too small to visualize as discrete particles in the tomographic slices, but they would contribute textures that can be “seen” by the programs – in particular RELION, which does the discrimination between structural states. We do not know the inner-workings of RELION well enough to say what kinds of density textures would side-track its classification routines.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The title of the paper is not well reflected in the main figures. The title of Figure 2 says &quot;Canonical nucleosomes are rare in wild-type cells&quot;, but that is not shown/quantified in that figure. Rare is comparison to what? I suggest adding a comparative view from the HeLa cells, like the text does in lines 195-199. A measure of nucleosomes detected per volume nucleoplasm would also facilitate a comparison.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 2’s title is indeed unclear and does not align with the paper’s title and key conclusion. The rarity here is relative to the expected number of nucleosomes (canonical plus non-canonical). We have changed the title to “Canonical nucleosomes are a minority of the expected total in wild-type cells”. We would prefer to leave the reference to HeLa cells to the main text instead of as a figure panel because the comparison is not straightforward for a graphical presentation. Instead, we will report the total number of nucleosomes estimated for this particular tomogram (~7,600) versus the number of canonical nucleosomes classified (297; 594 if we assume we missed half of them).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If the cell contains mostly non-canonical nucleosomes, are they really non-canonical? Maybe a change of language is required once this is somewhat sure (say, after line 303).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting semantic and philosophical point. From the yeast cell’s “perspective”, the canonical nucleosome structure would be the form that is in the majority. That being said, we do not know if there is one structure that is the majority. From the chromatin field’s point of view, the canonical nucleosome is the form that is most commonly seen in all the historical – and most contemporary – literature, namely something that resembles the crystal structure of Luger et al, 1997. Given these two lines of thinking, we will add the following clarification after line 303:</p>
<p>“At present, we do not know what the non-canonical nucleosome structures are, meaning that we cannot even determine if one non-canonical structure is the majority. Until we know what the family of non-canonical nucleosome structures are, we will use the term non-canonical to describe the nucleosomes that do not have the canonical (crystal) structure”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors could explain more why they sometimes use conventional the 2D followed by 3D classification approach and sometimes &quot;direct 3-D classification&quot;. Why, for example, do they do 2D followed by 3D in Figure S5A? This Figure could be considered a regular figure since it shows the main message of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because the classification of subtomograms in situ is still a work in progress, we felt it would be better to show one instance of 2-D classification for lysates and one for lamellae. While it is true that we could have presented direct 3-D classification for the entire paper, we anticipate that readers will be interested to see what the in situ 2-D class averages look like.</p>
<p>The main message is that there are canonical nucleosomes in situ (at least in wild-type cells), but they are a minority. Therefore, the conventional classification for Figure S5A should not be a main figure because it does not show any canonical nucleosome class averages in situ.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 1: Why is there a gap in the middle of the nucleosome in panel B? The authors write that this is a higher resolution structure (18Å), but in the even higher resolution crystallography structure (3Å resolution), there is no gap in the middle.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There is a lower concentration of amino acids at the middle in the disc view; unfortunately, the space-filling model in Figure 1A hides this feature. The gap exists in experimental cryo-EM density maps. See below for an example. The size of the gap depends on the contour level and probably the contrast mechanism, as the gap is less visible in the VPP subtomogram averages. To clarify this confusing phenomenon, we will add the following lines to the figure legend:</p>
<p>“The gap in the disc view of the nuclear-lysate-based average is due to the lower concentration of amino acids there, which is not visible in panel A due to space-filling rendering. This gap’s size may depend on the contrast mechanism because it is not visible in the VPP averages.”</p>
