<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The prevalence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) are increasing worldwide. Radiation resistance hinders radiotherapy, a standard treatment for advanced CRC, leading to local recurrence and metastasis. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying radioresistance in CRC is critical to enhance therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes. Bioinformatic analysis and tumour tissue examination were conducted to investigate the CPT1A mRNA and protein levels in CRC and their correlation with radiotherapy efficacy. Furthermore, lentiviral overexpression and CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral vectors, along with <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> radiation experiments, were used to explore the effect of CPT1A on radiosensitivity. Additionally, transcriptomic sequencing, molecular biology experiments, and bioinformatic analyses were employed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which CPT1A regulates radiosensitivity. CPT1A was significantly downregulated in CRC and negatively correlated with responsiveness to neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Functional studies suggested that CPT1A mediates radiosensitivity, influencing reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and DNA damage response. Transcriptomic and molecular analyses highlighted the involvement of the peroxisomal pathway. Mechanistic exploration revealed that CPT1A downregulates the FOXM1-SOD1/SOD2/CAT axis, moderating cellular ROS levels after irradiation and enhancing radiosensitivity. CPT1A downregulation contributes to radioresistance in CRC by augmenting the FOXM1-mediated antioxidant response. Thus, CPT1A is a potential biomarker of radiosensitivity and a novel target for overcoming radioresistance, offering a future direction to enhance CRC radiotherapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-highest cause of cancer-related mortality(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Siegel, Wagle, Cercek, Smith, &amp; Jemal, 2023</xref>). Radiotherapy is crucial for CRC management, especially in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (cT<sub>3-4</sub>N<sub>+</sub>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Glynne-Jones et al., 2017</xref>). Neoadjuvant therapies show clinical or pathological complete response in 16–30% of patients, realising downstaging in approximately 60% of patients, significantly enhancing local control, and facilitating curative surgery(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cercek et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, radiotherapy is beneficial in initially unresectable and recurrent cases with limited metastasis to organs, such as the liver and lungs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cervantes et al., 2023</xref>). Nonetheless, the effectiveness of radiotherapy is affected by radioresistance, which precipitates tumour relapse and metastasis and currently lacks an efficacious clinical resolution. Unlocking the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC radioresistance will enhance outcomes and improve patient prognoses.</p>
<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are byproducts of normal cellular metabolism occurring in organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bhattacharyya, Chattopadhyay, Mitra, &amp; Crowe, 2014</xref>). Within mitochondria, 90% of cellular ROS are generated by complexes I, II, and IV of the electron transport chain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Glasauer &amp; Chandel, 2014</xref>). Exogenous stimuli, including radiation, can cause significant, acute elevations in ROS levels(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hecht, Zocchi, Alimohammadi, &amp; Harris, 2024</xref>). ROS function ambivalently in the intracellular signalling and redox homoeostasis of tumour cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shah, Ibis, Kashyap, &amp; Boussiotis, 2023</xref>). ROS amplify oncogenic phenotypes, such as proliferation and differentiation, hasten the accumulation of metastasis-inducing mutations, and aid tumour cell survival under hypoxic conditions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Palma et al., 2023</xref>). However, excess ROS precipitate apoptosis and other cell death types from oxidative stress(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Palma et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, intracellular ROS generation is meticulously monitored and regulated by a comprehensive ROS-scavenging system encompassing antioxidants and antioxidative enzymes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Palma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shah et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Radiation ionises water molecules, creating an intracellular surge of ROS, which indirectly cause two thirds of DNA damage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Chio &amp; Tuveson, 2017</xref>). Consequently, ROS scavenging inevitably influences cancer cell radiosensitivity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Skvortsova, Debbage, Kumar, &amp; Skvortsov, 2015</xref>). Increased expression and activity of antioxidative enzymes, such as peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, are correlated with radiosensitivity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hecht et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) is an outer mitochondrial membrane that catalyses the rate-limiting step of fatty acid oxidation and is absent in several tumours(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Melone et al., 2018</xref>). The CPT1 family contains three isoforms: CPT1A, CPT1B, and CPT1C. Research on CPT1A has been detailed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Schlaepfer &amp; Joshi, 2020</xref>). CPT1A is critical to cancer cell growth, survival, and drug resistance, making it an attractive target(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Qu, Zeng, Liu, Wang, &amp; Deng, 2016</xref>). CPT1A also interacts with other key pathways and factors regulating gene expression and apoptosis in cancer cell(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Qu et al., 2016</xref>). However, its role in CRC and radiotherapy resistance is unclear.</p>
<p>Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is a critical transcription factor for many cellular processes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kalathil, John, &amp; Nair, 2020</xref>). Besides benefitting normal cell functions, it also regulates cancer processes, including growth, metastasis, and recurrence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alimardan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Khan, Khan, Ahmad, Fatima, &amp; Nasser, 2023</xref>). FOXM1 also affects radiotherapy outcomes in many cancer types, including colorectal cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kwon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2022</xref>; N. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Pal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Takeshita et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Xiu, Sui, Wang, &amp; Zhang, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Previously, we found that various metabolic pathways, including fatty acid metabolism, are closely related to tumour radioresistance. Therefore, this study mainly focused on CPT1A, which affects CRC radiosensitivity, to reveal novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate radiotherapy resistance and improve clinical outcomes.</p>

<title>Cell culture and lentiviral infection</title>
<p>The CRC cell lines HCT-15, RKO, HCT 116, HT-29, Caco-2, SW480, and SW620 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. To establish radiation-resistant strains, HCT-15-25F and HCT-15-5F cells were generated using both conventional fractionated irradiation (2 Gy/fraction, 25 fractions, 5 fractions/week over 5 weeks) and large-fractionated irradiation (5 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions, for 1 week).</p>
<p>The full-length lentiviral expression of <italic>CPT1A</italic> with puromycin was constructed by VectorBuilder. <italic>CPT1A</italic>-targeting CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral vectors (hCpt1a[gRNA#1]: AAATCTCTAC<bold>TACACGGCCGATGTTACGAC</bold><underline>AGG</underline>TACCGTCCTT, hCpt1a[gRNA#2]: AGAAGGTAAG<bold>GACGGTACCTGTCGTAACAT</bold><underline>CGG</underline>CCGTGTAGTA, hCpt1a[gRNA#3]: CTGAACACTC<bold>CTGGGCAGATGCGCCGATCG</bold><underline>TGG</underline>CCCACCTTTG) with RFP and Puro were constructed by VectorBuilder.

<title>Colony formation assay and multi-target single-hit survival model</title>
<p>The radiosensitivity of all human CRC cell lines was determined using a colony formation assay (CFA) with a multi-target single-hit model to the surviving fractions. Cells were plated in 6-well plates and irradiated at doses of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 Gy (6 MeV X-rays). The cells were then cultured for 10 d, stained with 1% crystal violet, and quantified using ImageJ version 1.8.0. The surviving fraction for each dose was calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p>[(number of surviving colonies at dose X) / (number of cells seeded at dose X (average colonies arising from non-irradiated cells (0 Gy)) / number of non-irradiated cells seeded)]. Survival curves were used to develop the multi-target single-hit model, <italic>SF</italic> = 1 − (1 − e<sup>−<italic>D</italic>/<italic>D</italic>0</sup>) × <italic>N</italic>, where <italic>SF</italic> is the surviving fraction, <italic>D</italic> is the radiation dose, and <italic>N</italic> is the extrapolation number.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>Comet assay</title>
<p>The comet assay was performed as previously described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, slides were covered with 100 μL of pre-warmed normal melting point agarose (2%) and placed on ice to solidify the first gel layer. Cells irradiated with 6 Gy were digested to obtain a cell suspension. Ten microliters of the cell suspension were mixed with 80 μL of pre-warmed low melting point agarose (0.75%) and poured onto the slides. The slides were dipped in a cold lysis solution for 2 h. After cell lysis, the slides were placed in a horizontal electrophoresis chamber filled with cold TAE solution, incubated for 25 min in the dark, and electrophoresed (1 V/cm). The slides were then neutralised in PBS for 5 min and stained with propidium iodide (PI) or DAPI. Comet images were captured using a fluorescence microscope. The percentage of DNA in the tail was analysed using the CASP 1.2.3 beta 1.</p>

<title>Animal model</title>
<p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanfang Hospital. Male BALB/c nude mice (5 weeks old) were purchased from the Southern Medical University Laboratory Animal Center, China and raised under specific pathogen-free conditions. All <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were performed following institutional guidelines. To develop the xenograft tumour model, 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells were subcutaneously injected into the left flank of mice. On reaching a volume of 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, the tumours were irradiated twice at 8 Gy, and other parts of the mouse body were protected with a lead shield. The tumour volume was measured using Vernier callipers and calculated as 1/2 × length × width × width. After the mice were euthanised with phenobarbital sodium, the tumours were excised, weighed, and embedded in paraffin for further experiments.</p>

<title>Transcriptomics</title>
<p>HCT 116-NC and HCT 116-KO cells were collected and sent to RIBOBIO (Guangzhou, China) for polyA-seq transcriptome sequencing. RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups, the expression level of each transcript was calculated according to the transcript per million reads method. RSEM was used to quantify the gene abundance. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2(S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Genes with |log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)|&gt;1 and P&lt;0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed. In addition, functional enrichment analysis, including using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), was performed to identify significantly enriched DEGs in GO terms and metabolic pathways at a Bonferroni-corrected P-value of 0.05 compared with the whole-transcriptome background. The heatmap and volcano of mRNA sequencing were conducted on ImageGP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bic.ac.cn/ImageGP">www.bic.ac.cn/ImageGP</ext-link>) (Tong Chen, 2022). GO functional enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses were performed using the ClusterProfiler package in R(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>ROS detection</title>
<p>ROS were stained with a 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe and detected using flow cytometry. Briefly, the probe was diluted in cell culture media at a 1:1000 ratio to yield a final concentration of 10 μmol/L. The culture medium was replaced with 1 mL of DCFH-DA solution. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. After incubation, the cells were washed thrice with serum-free medium to remove any excess DCFH-DA.</p>
<p>One hour after 6 Gy irradiation, the cells were digested into single-cell suspensions and washed once with PBS. Finally, cells were resuspended in PBS, and the fluorescence intensity was analysed using flow cytometry at excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 525 nm, respectively.</p>

<p>Cells (5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) were seeded into 10 cm wells until reaching 80% confluence before. One hour after irradiation with 6 Gy, crude enzyme extract was prepared. The cells were digested, collected, and centrifuged to remove the supernatant. Next, 1 mL of HPLC-grade water was added to each pellet. The cells were disrupted by ultrasonication (20% power, 3 s on and 10 s off, repeated 25–40 times). The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 8000 ×<italic>g</italic> and 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected as the crude enzyme extract.

<title>Low expression of CPT1A in CRC tumours</title>
<p>Analysis of CRC mRNA sequencing arrays from GEO consistently indicated low <italic>CPT1A</italic> mRNA levels in CRC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The transcript levels of <italic>CPT1A</italic> were lower in most colon cancers (19/24 pairs) than in the adjacent non-tumour tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Meanwhile, CPT1A protein levels were lower in most CRC tissues (14/16 pairs) than in the adjacent non-tumour tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Further exploration of CPT1A expression in TCGA revealed that CPT1A mRNA levels were significantly lower in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) tissues than in the adjacent non-tumour tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Similar results were observed for rectal adenocarcinoma (READ) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of the cancer-adjacent borders of two patients showed that CPT1A protein levels were lower in CRC tissues than in the nearby non-tumour tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). These findings provide comprehensive evidence supporting the downregulation of <italic>CPT1A</italic> expression at both mRNA and protein levels in CRC.</p>

<title>Low-CPT1A CRC exhibits radioresistance and poor overall survival</title>
<p>Based on the IHC scores, patients were divided into CPT1A high- and low-expression groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that low CPT1A-expressing patients had low overall survival (OS) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Survival analysis of READ patients with low CPT1A using GEPIA also suggested a low OS; the difference was statistically close but not significant (P=0.061, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). To further investigate the correlation between CPT1A and radiotherapy efficacy, IHC staining and scoring for CPT1A were performed on samples from 43 patients with rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Among patients with a tumour regression grade (TRG) score of 1, which indicates a minimal number of residual tumour cells, a high IHC score for CPT1A is often observed. Conversely, patients with a TRG score of 2, indicating more residual tumour cells, exhibited relatively lower IHC staining intensity and overall scores (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). A comparison of groups with TRG 2–3 and TRG 1 revealed significantly higher IHC scores in the TRG 1 group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The TRG and IHC scores for CPT1A showed a negative correlation (R=-0.3430 and P=0.024) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). In summary, low CPT1A expression was associated with poor OS, high TRG scores, and a high probability of radioresistance.</p>

<title>Decreased CPT1A expression contributes to radiation resistance in CRC cells</title>
<p>Through a CFA and multi-target single-hit survival model, we found that SW480, Caco-2, SW620, HT-29 and cells were more resistant to radiation than HCT15, RKO, and HCT 116 cells (Supplementary Figure 1A, B, Supplementary Table 3). Furthermore, the background expression levels of CPT1A in the above cells revealed that CPT1A transcription and protein levels were higher in radiation-resistant cells than in radiosensitive cells (Supplementary Figure 1C, D).</p>
<p>Accordingly, we constructed stable CRC cell lines with CPT1A knockout/overexpression. We transfected the CRISPR/Cas9 lentivirus into HCT 116 cells (highest CPT1A expression and radiosensitive) and used western blotting to verify that the knockout efficiency of the 2<sup>nd</sup> site was the highest, while mRNA levels were significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B).

<p>The CFA and multi-target single-hit survival model suggested that radioresistance increased with <italic>CPT1A</italic> knockout (D0=1.526 vs. 1.993, P&lt;0.05, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, D), whereas the radioresistance of cells decreased with <italic>CPT1A</italic> overexpression (D0=2.724 vs.1.963, P&lt;0.01, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, F). The comet assay suggested that the proportion of DNA in the tail of cells decreased with CPT1A knockout, indicating improved damage repair. With <italic>CPT1A</italic> overexpression, the proportion of DNA in the tail increased, indicating reduced damage repair capabilities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). We also detected γ-H2A.X expression at different time points after 6 Gy irradiation; with <italic>CPT1A</italic> knockout, γ-H2A.X disappeared from cells faster, indicating improved cell damage repair (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). With CPT1A overexpression, the disappearance rate of γ-H2A.X in cells was slower, remaining detectable even after 24 hours, indicating diminished cellular repair capability (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that CPT1A radiosensitizes intrinsically radioresistant cells.</p>
<p>We generated radioresistant cell lines (HCT-15-25F and HCT-15-5F) from the HCT-15 parent line by fractionated irradiation (Supplementary Figure 2A). Using CFAs and the multi-target single-hit survival model, we observed increased radioresistance in these new cell lines, as indicated by higher D0 values than those of the parental cells (HCT-15 D0=2.957, HCT-15-5F D0=3.240, HCT-15-25F D0=3.822) (Supplementary Figures 2B, C). We also found significantly decreased CPT1A protein expression in HCT-15-25F and HCT-15-5F cells compared with that in the original cells (Supplementary Figure 2D). Thus, HCT-15-25F cells were selected for further analysis. Transfection with the <italic>CPT1A</italic>-overexpressing lentivirus led to stable overexpression in HCT-15-25F cells (Supplementary Figure 2E). To assess the impact of CPT1A overexpression on DNA repair capacity, we monitored γ-H2A.X expression at different time points following 6 Gy irradiation. <italic>CPT1A</italic> overexpression resulted in a slow disappearance of intracellular γ-H2A.X, suggesting enhanced DNA damage repair capability (Supplementary Figure 2F). CFAs and the multitarget single-hit survival model revealed that <italic>CPT1A</italic> overexpression increased the radiosensitivity of radioresistant cells (D0=2.871 vs. 2.581, P&lt;0.05; Supplementary Figures 2G, H), indicating that CPT1A exerts a radiosensitizing effect in inducible radioresistant cell lines.</p>

<title>Low CPT1A levels accelerate post-radiation ROS scavenging</title>
<p>The gene expression heatmap showed high consistency among replicates for both HCT 116-NC and HCT 116-KO cells (Supplementary Figure 3A). With <italic>CPT1A</italic> knockdown, we found 363 upregulated and 1290 downregulated genes (|log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)|&gt;1 and P&lt;0.05) (Supplementary Figure 3B). We conducted KEGG pathway analysis and GO annotation for all DEGs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; Supplementary Figure 3 C-E), showing that the main enriched pathways were in peroxisomes, cell cycle nucleotide excision repair, and fatty acid degradation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Peroxisomes are important organelles that maintain cellular redox balance by clearing ROS. Therefore, we targeted peroxisomal pathways. ROS levels in the cells were dynamically balanced, including ROS production and scavenging (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). To investigate the effect of CPT1A on ROS, we examined them in stable <italic>CPT1A</italic> knockout/overexpression cells following 6 Gy irradiation and 1 h of incubation with DCFH-DA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The total ROS levels in <italic>CPT1A</italic> knockout cells decreased, whereas those in <italic>CPT1A</italic>-overexpressing cells increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The main mechanism by which cells produce ROS under irradiation is through the X-ray ionisation of water molecules, which far exceeds those from oxidative phosphorylation and NOX enzymes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that the regulation of CPT1A by intracellular ROS levels may be attributed to increased ROS scavenging. We examined the GSH/GSSG ratio (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, F) and SOD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, H), CAT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>), and POD enzyme activities (results were unchanged, data not shown) in stable <italic>CPT1A</italic> knockout/overexpression cells; in <italic>CPT1A</italic> knockout cells, the GSH/GSSG ratio and SOD and CAT enzyme activities increased, and these changes were also observed under 6 Gy irradiation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>).

Additionally, we assessed the GSH/GSSG ratio (Supplementary Figure 4E, F) and SOD (Supplementary Figure 4G, H), POD (Supplementary Figure 4I, J), and CAT enzyme activities (Supplementary Figure 4K) in radioresistant cells, both at baseline and after 6 Gy irradiation, revealing an increased GSH/GSSG ratio and elevated activities of SOD, POD, and CAT enzymes in radioresistant cells compared to those in parental HCT-15 control cells.

<title>Reduced CPT1A expression mediates radioresistance in CRC through increased expression of ROS-scavenging genes, facilitated by FOXM1</title>
<p>The reasons underlying the changes in SOD and CAT enzyme activities require further investigation.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We elucidated the role of CPT1A in CRC and the molecular mechanisms involved in mediating radiosensitivity. CPT1A is often downregulated in CRC, and low CPT1A expression can worsen OS and increase the probability of radiochemotherapy resistance. Low CPT1A expression increases FOXM1 activity, promoting the transcription and translation of downstream SOD1, SOD2, and CAT, thereby facilitating the scavenging of radiation-induced ROS. Our study establishes CPT1A as an effective biomarker to predict CRC prognosis and radiotherapy sensitivity and proposes the molecular mechanism by which it mediates radiosensitivity through the FOXM1-SOD1/SOD2/CAT axis.</p>
<p>CPT1A is crucial to CRC initiation and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mazzarelli et al., 2007</xref>). However, its role in CRC remains unclear. CPT1A is an essential tumour suppressor. Using a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to explore hub genes in CRC development, we found that CPT1A is expressed at low levels in CRC and acts as a central anticancer gene, exhibiting excellent prognostic value(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">He, Zeng, &amp; Xu, 2023</xref>). Sinomenine improves colitis-associated cancer by upregulating CPT1A(J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang, Huang, Dai, &amp; Xia, 2022</xref>). In contrast, high CPT1A expression is associated with malignancy in CRC, and its inhibition ameliorates malignant phenotypes. CPT1A-mediated fatty acid oxidation promotes CRC metastasis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). DHP-B, a CPT1A inhibitor, disrupts CPT1A-VDAC1 interaction in the mitochondria, increasing mitochondrial permeability and reducing oxygen consumption and energy metabolism in CRC cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hu et al., 2023</xref>). We observed significant downregulation of CPT1A expression in CRC, and low CPT1A expression was associated with worse prognosis and greater radiochemotherapy resistance, consistent with previous studies.</p>
<p>The PGC1α/CEBPB/CPT1A axis, which enhances lipid β-oxidation, increases ATP and NADPH levels and promotes cellular radiation resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tan et al., 2018</xref>). Tan et al. also discovered an interaction between CPT1A and Rab14, which transports fatty acids into the mitochondria, thereby facilitating lipid oxidation and cell survival under irradiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Du et al., 2019</xref>). The HER1/2-MEK-ERK1/2-CPT1A/CPT2 axis reportedly enhances cell proliferation and confers radiation resistance in breast cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Han et al., 2019</xref>). However, no studies have investigated the association between CPT1A and radiosensitivity in CRC. Our research revealed that CPT1A is a radiation sensitivity gene, contradicting previous literature, possibly due to differences in cancer types.</p>
<p>Transcriptomic sequencing revealed that CPT1A regulates multiple pathways, including the peroxisomal pathway, which is responsible for ROS scavenging. <italic>CPT1A</italic> knockdown upregulated FOXM1, which, in turn, stimulated the transcription and translation of crucial antioxidative enzymes, SOD1, SOD2, and CAT, thereby expediting ROS clearance. This contradicts previous findings that CPT1A overexpression accelerates ROS production by increasing fatty acid β-oxidation, thereby promoting ageing phenotypes or augmenting cancer cells’ oxidative defences(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jiang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Joshi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Luo, Sun, Wang, Zhang, &amp; Wang, 2021</xref>). Our findings diverge from those of other studies for two main reasons: first, previous research into the effects of CPT1A on ROS largely centred around mitochondria rather than the peroxisome; second, previous studies did not account for radiation, which significantly increases ROS production above cellular oxidative processes.</p>
<p>We identified FOXM1 as a key regulator connecting CPT1A to ROS scavenging in CRC, exhibiting an inverse correlation with both CPT1A and ROS levels. FOXM1 is an essential transcription factor in intracellular redox, specifically in regulating the redox state of malignant mesothelioma cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Cunniff, Wozniak, Sweeney, DeCosta, &amp; Heintz, 2014</xref>). FOXM1-dependent fatty acid oxidation-mediated ROS modulation is a cell-intrinsic drug resistance mechanism in cancer stem cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>FOXM1</italic> knockdown increases intracellular ROS levels and decreases the transcription levels of SOD2, CAT, PRDX, and GPX2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Smirnov et al., 2016</xref>). Overall, our findings align with existing literature, highlighting the crucial role of FOXM1 in orchestrating the interplay between CPT1A and ROS homoeostasis. We further revealed that FOXM1 participates in the transcriptional regulation of SOD1.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. We only conducted radiosensitivity investigations of CPT1A in nude mice, which only demonstrated its regulatory role in CRC cell radiosensitivity. It remains unclear whether CPT1A can regulate the radiosensitivity of the entire tumour microenvironment in immunocompetent mice. Additionally, FOXM1 primarily localises to the nucleus, whereas CPT1A is a cytoplasmic protein; there is no known physiological basis for their co-localisation. Therefore, the specific mechanism through which CPT1A regulates FOXM1 expression requires further investigation. The reasons for the decreased expression of CPT1A in tumour cells remain unclear. Future studies should explore this in greater detail.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We elucidated a novel molecular pathway underlying radioresistance in CRC cells, whereby downregulation of CPT1A induces an increase in both mRNA and protein levels of FOXM1. This elevation subsequently augments the transcription and translation of SOD1, SOD2, and CAT, thereby expediting radiation-induced ROS clearance. The resulting enhanced ROS scavenging confers a marked increase in cellular resistance to radiotherapy. Our findings highlight that the CPT1A-FOXM1-SOD/CAT axis is a critical contributor to radioresistance in CRC, offering new perspectives to unravel the intricacies of radioresistance mechanisms and potentially guiding innovative therapeutic interventions to overcome this challenge.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Fats and lipids serve many important roles in cancers, including serving as important fuels for energy metabolism in cancer cells by being oxidized in the mitochondria. The process of fatty acid oxidation is initiated by the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), and the function and targetability of CPT1A in cancer metabolism and biology have been heavily investigated. This includes studies that have found important roles for CPT1A in colorectal cancer growth and metastasis.</p>
<p>In this study, Chen and colleagues use analysis of patient samples and functional interrogation in animal models to examine the role CPT1A plays in colorectal cancer (CRC). The authors find that CPT1A expression is decreased in CRC compared to paired healthy tissue and that lower expression correlates with decreased patient survival over time, suggesting that CPT1A may suppress tumor progression. To functionally interrogate this hypothesis, the authors both use CRISPR to knockout CPT1A in a CRC cell line that expresses CPT1A and overexpress CPT1A in a CRC cell line with low expression. In both systems, increased CPT1A expression decreased cell survival and DNA repair in response to radiation in culture. Further, in xenograft models, CPT1A decreased tumor growth basally and radiotherapy could further decrease tumor growth in CPT1A-expressing tumors. As CRC is often treated with radiotherapy, the authors argue this radiosensitization driven by CPT1A could explain why CPT1A expression correlates with increased patient survival.</p>
<p>Lastly, Chen and colleagues sought to understand why CPT1A suppresses CRC tumor growth and sensitizes the tumors to radiotherapy in culture. The antioxidant capacity of cells can increase cell survival, so the authors examine antioxidant gene expression and levels in CPT1A-expressing and non-expressing cells. CPT1A expression suppresses the expression of antioxidant metabolism genes and lowers levels of antioxidants. Antioxidant metabolism genes can be regulated by the FOXM1 transcription factor, and the authors find that CPT1A expression regulates FOXM1 levels and that antioxidant gene expression can be partially rescued in CPT1A-expressing CRC cells. This leads the authors to propose the following model: CPT1A expression downregulates FOXM1 (via some yet undescribed mechanism) which then leads to decreased antioxidant capacity in CRC cells, thus suppressing tumor progression and increasing radiosensitivity. This is an interesting model that could explain the suppression of CPT1A expression in CRC, but key tenets of the model are untested and speculative.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• Analysis of CPT1A in paired CRC tumors and non-tumor tissue using multiple modalities combined with analysis of independent datasets rigorously show that CPT1A is downregulated in CRC tumors at the RNA and protein level.</p>
<p>• The authors use paired cell line model systems where CPT1A is both knocked out and overexpressed in cell lines that endogenously express or repress CPT1A respectively. These complementary model systems increase the rigor of the study.</p>
<p>• The finding that a metabolic enzyme generally thought to support tumor energetics actually is a tumor suppressor in some settings is theoretically quite interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• The authors propose that CPT1A expression modulates antioxidant capacity in cells by suppressing FOXM1 and that this pathway alters CRC growth and radiotherapy response. However, key aspects of this model are not tested. The authors do not show that FOXM1 contributes to the regulation of antioxidant levels in CRC cells and tumors or if FOXM1 suppression is key to the inhibition of CRC tumor growth and radiosensitization by CPT1A. Thus, the model the authors propose is speculative and not supported by the existing data.</p>
<p>• The authors propose two mechanisms by which CPT1A expression triggers radiosensitization: decreasing DNA repair capacity (Figure 3) and decreasing antioxidant capacity (Figure 5). However, while CPT1A expression does alter these capacities in CRC cells, neither is functionally tested to determine if altered DNA repair or antioxidant capacity (or both) are the reason why CRC cells are more sensitive to radiotherapy or are delayed in causing tumors in vivo. Thus, this aspect of the proposed model is also speculative.</p>
<p>• The authors find that CPT1A affects radiosensitization in cell culture and assess this in vivo. In vivo, CPT1A expression slows tumor growth even in the absence of radiotherapy, and radiotherapy only proportionally decreases tumor growth to the same extent as it does in CPT1A non-expressing CRC tumors. The authors propose from this data that CPT1A expression also sensitizes tumors to radiotherapy in vivo. However, it is unclear whether CPT1A expression causes radiosensitization in vivo or if CPT1A expression acts as an independent tumor suppressor to which radiotherapy has an additive effect. Additional experiments would be necessary to differentiate between these possibilities.</p>
<p>• The authors propose in Figure 3 that DNA repair capacity is inhibited in CRC cells by CPT1A expression. However, the gH2AX immunoblots performed in Figure 3H-I that measure DNA repair kinetics are not convincing that CPT1A expression impairs DNA repair kinetics. Separate blots are shown for CPT1A expressing and non-expressing cell lines, not allowing for rigorous comparison of gH2AX levels and resolution as CPT1A expression is modulated.</p>
<p>• There are conflicting studies (PMID: 37977042, 29995871) that suggest that CPT1A is overexpressed in CRC and contributes to tumor progression rather than acting as a tumor suppressor as the authors propose. It would be helpful for readers for the authors to discuss these studies and why there is a discrepancy between them.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Chen et al. describes how low levels of CPT1A in colorectal cancer (CRC) confer radioresistance by expediting radiation-induced ROS clearance. The authors propose that this mechanism of ROS homeostasis is regulated through FOXM1. CPT1A is known for its role in fatty acid metabolism via beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, making it important in many metabolic disorders and cancers.</p>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that the upregulation of CPT1A is essential for the tumor-promoting effect in colorectal cancers (CRC) (PMID: 32913185). For example, CPT1A-mediated fatty acid oxidation promotes colorectal cancer cell metastasis (PMID: 2999587), and repression of CPT1A activity renders cancer cells more susceptible to killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (PMID: 37722058). Additionally, inhibition of CPT1A-mediated fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) sensitizes nasopharyngeal carcinomas to radiation therapy (PMID: 29721083). While this suggests a tumor-promoting effect for CPT1A, the work by Chen et al. suggests instead a tumor-suppressive function for CPT1A in CRC, specifically that loss or low expression of CPT1A confers radioresistance in CRC. This makes the findings important given that they oppose the previously proposed tumorigenic function of CPT1A. However, the data presented in the manuscript is limited in scope and analysis.</p>
<p>Major Limitations:</p>
<p>(1) Analysis of Patient Samples</p>
<p>- Figure 1D shows that CPT1A levels are significantly lower in COAD and READ compared to normal tissues. It would be beneficial to show whether CPT1A levels are also significantly lower in CRC compared to other tumor types using TCGA data.</p>
<p>
- The analysis should include a comparison of closely related CPT1 isoforms (CPT1B and CPT1C) to emphasize the specific importance of CPT1A silencing in CRC.</p>
<p>
- Figure 2 lacks a clear description of how IHC scores were determined and the criteria used to categorize patients into CPT1A-high and CPT1A-low groups. This should be detailed in the text and figure legend.</p>
<p>
- None of Figure 2B or 2C show how many patients were assigned to the CPT1A-low and CPT1A-high groups.</p>
<p>(2) Model Selection and Experimental Approaches</p>
<p>- The authors primarily use CPT1A knockout (KO) HCT116 cells and CPT1A overexpression (OE) SW480 cells for their experiments, which poses major limitations.</p>
<p>
- The genetic backgrounds of the cell lines (e.g., HCT116 being microsatellite instable (MSI) and SW480 not) should be considered as they might influence treatment outcomes. This should be acknowledged as a major limitation.</p>
<p>
- Regardless of their CPT1A expression levels, for the experiments with HCT116 and SW480 cells in Figure 3C-F, it would be useful to see whether HCT116 cells can be further sensitized to radiotherapy in overexpression and whether SW480 cells can be desensitized through CPT1A KO.</p>
<p>
- The use of only two CRC cell lines is insufficient to draw broad conclusions. Additional CRC cell lines should be used to validate the findings and account for genetic heterogeneity. The authors should repeat key experiments with additional CRC cell lines to strengthen their conclusions.</p>
<p>(3) Pharmacological Inhibition</p>
<p>Several studies have reported beneficial outcomes of using CPT1 pharmacological inhibition to limit cancer progression (e.g., PMID: 33528867, PMID: 32198139), including its application in sensitization to radiation therapy (PMID: 30175155). Since the authors argue for the opposite case in CRC, they should show this through pharmacological means such as etomoxir and whether CPT1A inhibition phenocopies their observed genetic KO effect, which would have important implications for using this inhibitor in CRC patients.</p>
<p>(4) Data Representation and Statistical Analysis</p>
<p>- The relative mRNA expression levels across the seven cell lines (Supplementary Figure 1C) differ greatly from those reported in the DepMap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/portal/">https://depmap.org/portal/</ext-link>). This discrepancy should be addressed.</p>
<p>
- The statistical significance of differences in mRNA and protein levels between RT-sensitive and RT-resistant cells should be shown (Supplementary Figure 1C, D).</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The study offers significant insights into the role of CPT1A in CRC radioresistance, proposing a tumor-suppressive function. However, the scope and depth of the analysis need to be expanded to fully validate these claims. Additional CRC cell lines, pharmacological inhibition studies, and a more detailed analysis of patient samples are essential to strengthen the conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study aims to elucidate the role of CPT1A in developing resistance to radiotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). The manuscript is a collection of assays and analyses to identify the mechanism by which CPT1A leads to treatment resistance through increased expression of ROS-scavenging genes facilitated by FOXM1 and provides an argument to counter this role, leading to a reversal of treatment resistance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The article is well written with sound scientific methodology and results. The assays performed are well within the scope of the hypothesis of the study and provide ample evidence for the role of CPT1A in the development of treatment resistance in colorectal cancer. While providing compelling evidence for their argument, the authors have also rightfully provided limitations of their work.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The primary weakness of the study is acknowledged by the authors at the end of the Discussion section of the manuscript. The work heavily relies on bioinformatics and in vitro work with little backing of in vivo and patient data. In terms of animal studies, it is to be noted that the model they have used is nude mice with non-orthotopic, subcutaneous xenograft, which may not be the best recreation of the patient tumor.</p>
