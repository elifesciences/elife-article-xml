<title>Abstract</title><p>Evolutionary adaptation to diurnal vision in ground squirrels has led to the development of a cone-dominant retina, in stark contrast to the rod-dominant retinas of most mammals. The molecular mechanisms driving this shift remain largely unexplored. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and chromatin accessibility profiling (scATAC-Seq) across developmental retinal neurogenesis in the 13-lined ground squirrel (13LGS) to uncover the regulatory basis of this adaptation. We find that 13LGS cone photoreceptors arise not only from early-stage neurogenic progenitors, as seen in rod-dominant species like mice, but also from late-stage neurogenic progenitors. This extended period of cone generation is driven by a heterochronic shift in transcription factor expression, with cone-promoting factors such as <italic>Onecut2</italic>, <italic>Pou2f1</italic>, and <italic>Zic3</italic> remaining active in late-stage progenitors, and factors that promote cone differentiation such as <italic>Thrb</italic>, <italic>Rxrg</italic>, and <italic>Mef2c</italic> expressed precociously in late-stage neurogenic progenitors. Functional analyses reveal that <italic>Zic3</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> are sufficient to promote cone photoreceptor and repress rod specification, and act through species-specific regulatory elements that drive their expression in late-stage progenitors. These results demonstrate that evolutionary modifications to gene regulatory networks underlie the development of cone-dominant retinas, and provide insight into mechanisms of sensory adaptation and potential strategies for cone photoreceptor regeneration in vision disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Evolutionary adaptation to new ecological niches often requires the development of new sensory, motor, and/or behavioral capacities. These adaptations are typically mediated by structural changes to the nervous system which arise from changes in the composition and connectivity of individual neuronal subtypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. While the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes are generally poorly understood, the vertebrate retina serves as an ideal system for investigating them. Shifts in temporal nicheâsuch as transitions between predominantly nocturnal and diurnal behaviorâhave occurred repeatedly across diverse vertebrate lineages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. These shifts inevitably require adaptive modifications in the rod and cone visual pathways, which detect dim and bright light, respectively.</p>
<p>Mammals represent a notable exception to the general trend in which diurnal vertebrate species possess cone-dominant retinas. This deviation reflects the long-term effects of a selective nocturnal bottleneck that occurred before the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction event, preceding the mammalian radiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Despite considerable variation in photoreceptor subtype composition among mammals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, even strongly diurnal species typically have rod-dominant retinas, with rod-to-cone ratios ranging from approximately 5:1 to 20:1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Strictly nocturnal species, such as mice, exhibit even more pronounced rod dominance of 33:1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, diurnal ground squirrels are a major exception to this rule, possessing an inverted rod-to-cone ratio, having only one rod for every 6â7 cones throughout most of the retina <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, and as many as 50 cones for every rod in the central visual streak <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. By examining the development of the cone-dominant ground squirrel retina and comparing it to that of nocturnal rodents like mice, we can identify molecular mechanisms underlying this dramatic and evolutionarily rapid shift in photoreceptor subtype composition.</p>
<p>In rod-dominant mouse and human retinas, cones are generated primarily during early stages of retinal neurogenesis, whereas rods are predominantly produced in later stages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The progenitors that selectively give rise to cones and rods are in turn distinguished by the activity of a network of transcription factors that confer early and late-stage temporal identity. The progenitors that give rise to cones and rods are distinguished by the activity of a network of transcription factors that establish early- and late-stage temporal identities. Cones originate from a subpopulation of early-stage <italic>Otx2</italic> and <italic>Neurod1</italic>-positive neurogenic progenitors that express <italic>Onecut1/2</italic> and <italic>Pou2f1/2</italic>, which confer competence to generate both cones and horizontal cells and activate transcription factors that promote cone differentiation while simultaneously repressing rod-specific factor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In contrast, late-stage <italic>Otx2</italic>- and <italic>Neurod1</italic>-positive neurogenic progenitors primarily generate postmitotic rod precursors, which express transcription factors such as <italic>Nrl</italic> and <italic>Nr2e3</italic> that suppress cone-specific genes, while also activating rod-specific genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Postmitotic cone precursors, in turn, express transcription factors such as <italic>Thrb</italic>, <italic>Rxrg</italic>, and <italic>Sall3</italic>, which further activate cone-specific genes and inhibit rod-specific gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Evolutionary changes in the rod-to-cone ratio may result directly from alterations in the expression or activity of these factors, or from other, as-yet-uncharacterized components of the transcriptional regulatory networks that govern temporal patterning and photoreceptor identity.</p>
<p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of cone-dominant mammalian retinas, we performed unbiased single-cell RNA- and ATAC-Seq analyses, to comprehensively profile gene expression and regulatory changes in the developing retina of the cone-dominant 13-lined ground squirrel (13LGS) across the full course of neurogenesis. We directly compared these data with similar datasets from the developing retina of rod-dominant mice. Our findings reveal that cone generation occurs at high levels even during late neurogenesis in 13LGS, coinciding with two broad heterochronic shifts in transcription factor expression in late-stage retinal progenitors. The first shift involves an expanded expression of a subset of transcription factors that are typically active in early-stage progenitors in rod-dominant retinasâfactors known or predicted to promote cone specification. In addition to previously characterized factors such as <italic>Onecut2</italic> and <italic>Pou2f1</italic>, this group includes previously uncharacterized genes, such as <italic>Zic3</italic>, which we show to be both necessary and sufficient for cone specification during early neurogenesis. The second shift involves precocious expression of transcription factors typically found in postmitotic cone precursors, including <italic>Thrb</italic> and <italic>Rxrg</italic>, along with newly identified factors such as <italic>Mef2c</italic>, which cooperatively activate cone-specific genes while repressing rod-specific ones. The expression of these transcription factors in both late-stage progenitors and committed photoreceptor precursors is driven by multiple 13LGS-specific enhancer elements. These enhancers are directly targeted by <italic>Otx2</italic> and <italic>Neurod1</italic>, which broadly regulate photoreceptor specification and differentiation, as well as by heterochronically-expressed transcription factors specific to early-stage retinal progenitors and cone precursors. Our results demonstrate that heterochronic expansion of the expression of transcription factors that promote cone development is a key event in the evolution of the cone-dominant 13LGS retina.</p>

<title>Single-cell RNA- and ATAC-Seq profiling of developing 13LGS retina</title>
<p>In 13LGS, retinal neurogenesis begins around embryonic day 18 (E18), with birth occurring at E27 (blue-dotted line in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and concludes by postnatal day 17 (P17)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. To comprehensively profile cellular-level changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility, we conducted scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq analyses across ten developmental time points, spanning the full course of neurogenesis and the immediate post-neurogenesis period (E18â P21). We selected these time points to align with stages previously profiled in the developing mouse retina (E11âP14)) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. High-quality data were obtained for all stages, with scATAC-Seq data showing expected fragment length and distribution patterns (Fig. S1A, B). Using selective markers of cell types previously identified in the developing mouse retina, we successfully annotated cell populations identified through UMAP clustering of aggregated scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq data. This approach distinguished all major retinal cell types, including both early- and late-stage primary and neurogenic retinal progenitor cells (RPCs and N. RPCs) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Cell type-specific expression and chromatin accessibility patterns showed greatest correlation in the same and closely-related cell types across modalities (Fig. S1C), with expected expression and accessibility patterns observed for known cell type-specific marker genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Each annotated progenitor state and cell type (C1âC12) exhibited significant numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Fig. S1D, Table ST1) and differentially accessible chromatin regions (DARs) (Fig. S1E). We investigated enrichment of monomeric transcription factor motifs within DARs. Evolutionarily conserved patterns of motif accessibility, identified using ChromVAR and the TRANSFAC2018 database, (Fig. S1F, Table ST1) and transcription factor footprinting (Fig. S1G, H) were observed. Notably, motifs annotated as belonging to <italic>Nr2f1</italic> showed strong activity in early-stage RPCs, <italic>Pou4f2</italic> in retinal ganglion cells, <italic>Nfix</italic> in late-stage RPCs and MÃ¼ller glia, and <italic>Crx</italic> and <italic>Neurod1</italic> in photoreceptor precursors (Fig. S1F, Table ST1). Motifs assigned to one transcription factor can have more complicated binding situations <italic>in vivo</italic>, but these enrichments are markedly consistent with previous studies in developing mouse and human retina <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Direct comparisons of cell type composition across individual time points in the 13LGS and mouse retina indicated a high degree of stage-matching and broad concurrence (Fig. S1I). The transition from early- to late-stage states occurred between E26 and P1 in 13LGS, compared to E16âE18 in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The expected temporal patterns of neurogenesis were observed in both species: retinal ganglion cells and amacrine cells were generated predominantly by early-stage progenitors, whereas bipolar cells and MÃ¼ller glia were produced by late-stage progenitors. Photoreceptor precursors were detected from E18 through P12 in 13LGS, with cone cells becoming clearly distinct in the early postnatal period. Notably, a large proportion of cones were generated during the first postnatal week in 13LGS. As expected, identification of mature cones in the 13LGS scATAC data preceded the scRNA data, as chromatin opening precedes gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In contrast to mice, where rods are distinct from E18 onward <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, rods in 13LGS were not detected until the late postnatal period (P12). Both scRNA- and scATAC-Seq data demonstrated that, at all developmental stages, cones were significantly more abundant than rods in 13LGS, comprising approximately 25% of all retinal cells following the completion of neurogenesis at P12. By subclustering cones, we can separate distinct clusters of S-cones from the far more numerous M-cones at each postnatal time point, except P21 where there are too few S-cones present to form a separate cluster, and identify genes enriched in each cone subtype (Table ST2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In contrast, in mice, rods progressively increased in proportion, reaching approximately 70% of retinal cells by P8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). These proportions are roughly in agreement with what has been found <italic>in vivo</italic> by prior studies using orthogonal approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Comparative multiomic analysis of photoreceptor differentiation in 13LGS and mouse</title>
<p>These findings suggest that late-stage RPCs in 13LGS retina are competent to generate cone photoreceptors but not other early-born cell types, with rod specification occurring only at very late postnatal stages (&gt;P12) of neurogenesis. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this heterochronic shift in developmental competence, we used Harmony on conserved genes to integrate scRNA- and scATAC-Seq data from all late-stage time points in 13LGS and mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, Table ST3).</p>

<p>In the 13LGS scRNA-Seq data, we observed well-defined, continuous differentiation trajectories linking late-stage primary and neurogenic RPCs to cones, bipolar, and amacrine cells. However, no clear trajectory for rod differentiation was detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In contrast, scRNA-Seq data from mice revealed differentiation trajectories connecting neurogenic progenitors to rods, amacrine, and bipolar cells, but not to cones at this stage (indicated by arrows in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Similarly, scATAC-Seq analysis in 13LGS identified a strong progenitor-to-cone photoreceptor trajectory, but no corresponding progenitor-to-rod trajectory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Interestingly, both species exhibited a bipolar cell/photoreceptor precursor population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). This may suggest that late-stage 13LGS retina contain bipolar cell/cone bipotent progenitors similar to the bipolar cell/rod bipotent progenitors of late-stage mouse retina <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, though further investigation would be required to confirm this. Nonetheless, this highlights the specificity of the effects of heterochronic expansion of cone-promoting factors.</p>
<p>To further characterize species-specific patterns of gene expression and regulation during photoreceptor development, we analyzed differential gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and motif enrichment across late-stage primary and neurogenic progenitors, immature photoreceptor precursors, rods, and cones. This analysis revealed eight distinct species-specific differential expression patterns identified by k-means clustering (C1âC8) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>; Table ST4).</p>
<p>Clusters C1âC3 were selectively expressed in 13LGS. C1 was active exclusively in RPCs, C2 active across all stages of cone specification, and C3 restricted to mature cones. Notably, C2 included several genes previously implicated in photoreceptor development, such as the cone-promoting transcription factor <italic>Onecut1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and <italic>Mef2c</italic>, a MADS-box transcription factor which is cone-enriched in human retina <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and reported to be essential for photoreceptor survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. The smaller cluster C3 contained transcription factors such as <italic>Thrb</italic>, <italic>Rxrg</italic>, and <italic>Sall3</italic>, which are all selectively expressed in cone precursors and essential for cone-specific gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Additionally, <italic>Zic3</italic>, which is selectively expressed in early-stage RPCs in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, was also enriched in C3.</p>
<p>Clusters C4âC8 contained genes that were selectively active in mice relative to 13LGS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Clusters C4âC6 showed higher expression levels in mice across different cellular contexts: C4 was specific to progenitors, C5 was active throughout specification, and C6 spanned progenitors and photoreceptor precursors. C4 included the early-stage RPC transcription factor <italic>Nr2f1</italic>, C5 contained <italic>Sox8</italic> and <italic>Sox11</italic>, and C6 featured <italic>Dlx2</italic>. While the direct relevance of most of these differences remains unclear, <italic>Nr2f1</italic> is essential for establishing the dorsal-ventral gradients in M- and S-cone opsin expression that are observed in mouse cones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, but which do not exist in 13LGS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Clusters C7 and C8, which were selectively active in mouse photoreceptor precursors and rods, contained several transcription factors known to promote rod differentiation and repress cone fate. In C7, we identified <italic>Casz1</italic>, a temporal patterning factor that represses the competence of late-stage progenitors to generate cones, while also promoting rod specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In C8, as expected, we observed <italic>Nrl</italic>, <italic>Nr2e3</italic>, and <italic>Samd7</italic>, all of which activate rod-specific genes while repressing cone-specific genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Integrated scRNA- and ATAC-Seq analysis using ArchR identified regulatory elements predicted to control each of these genes in both 13LGS and mouse (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Notably, genes in C2 and C3, which were more highly expressed in 13LGS and are strong candidates for promoting cone specification, exhibited significantly higher numbers of predicted functional cis-regulatory elements than their mouse counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). This species-specific increase in predicted regulatory elements was either absent from, or far less pronounced in, other gene clusters.</p>

<title>Identifying transcription factors that promote cone specification in 13LGS</title>
<p>To identify transcription factors that strongly contribute to cone specification, we compared differential motif enrichment in accessible chromatin regions across cell types between 13LGS and mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Motifs associated with neurogenic bHLH factors such as Neurog2, Olig2, Ascl1, and Neurod1 were highly enriched in neurogenic RPCs and photoreceptor precursors in both species, as was the motif for Otx2, a key factor required for both rod and cone specification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Similarly, motifs for transcription factors strongly expressed in late-stage RPCs, such as Lhx2, Sox8, and Nfia/b, were prominent in progenitors of both species.</p>
<p>Motifs for cone-specific transcription factors, including Thrb, Rxrg, and Esrrg were significantly more prominent in cones of 13LGS. Furthermore, in 13LGS, the Zic3 motif was accessible in both progenitors and mature cones, whereas in mice, its accessibility declined in mature cones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F,G</xref>). These data suggest that species-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) observed in 13LGS late-stage RPCs are characterized by relatively higher activity levels of transcription factors that are enriched in both early-stage RPCs and postmitotic cone precursors in mice contribute to the development of the cone-dominant retina in 13-LGS.</p>
<p>To more systematically identify transcription factors regulating cone specification in 13-LGS, we used scRNA- and ATAC-Seq data from late-stage RPCs and differentiating photoreceptors to reconstruct GRNs predicted to activate cone-specific genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>, Table ST5). This analysis focused on transcription factors with differential expression in late-stage RPCs between 13LGS and mice. Some transcription factors in this network, such as <italic>Otx2</italic>, <italic>Neurod1</italic>, <italic>Crx</italic>, <italic>Prdm1</italic>, and <italic>Mef2d</italic>, have been shown to promote both rod and cone differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and their expression patterns did not exhibit strong species-specific differences.</p>
<p>In contrast, two patterns of differential transcription factor expression between mouse and 13LGS were found. First, transcription factors identified in this network that are known to be required for committed cone precursor differentiation, including <italic>Thrb</italic>, <italic>Rxrg</italic>, and <italic>Sall3</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, consistently showed stronger expression in late-stage RPCs of 13LGS compared to mice. Other genes such as <italic>Mef2c</italic>, which, while not functionally linked to cone specification, are also most prominently expressed in differentiated cones, also showed expression in late-stage RPCs. This suggests a species-specific pattern of precocious expression of cone differentiation-promoting transcription factors in the course of cone differentiation. Second, transcription factors in the network known to promote cone specification in early-stage mouse RPCs, such as <italic>Onecut2</italic> and <italic>Pou2f1</italic>, exhibited enriched expression in late-stage RPCs of 13LGS, implying a heterochronic expansion of cone-promoting factors into later developmental stages. This pattern was also observed for <italic>Zic3</italic>, which emerged as the most likely candidate for driving cone-specific gene expression in 13-LGS. In mice, <italic>Zic3</italic> was selectively enriched in early-stage RPCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, supporting its potential role in cone specification.</p>
<p>To confirm heterochronic expression of candidate cone-promoting factors in late-stage developing 13LGS retina, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNA hybridization chain reaction (HCR) analysis. We analyzed co-expression of the candidate cone-promoting factors <italic>Zic3</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic>, as well as <italic>Pou2f1</italic>, a cone-promoting factor active in early-stage RPCs in mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, with markers of neurogenic RPCs and/or differentiating cones. <italic>Pou2f1</italic> co-expression with <italic>Otx2</italic> was observed at P1, P5, P10, and P24 in 13LGS (Fig. S2A). At all ages examined, <italic>Zic3</italic> was co-expressed with the neurogenic RPC/photoreceptor precursor marker <italic>Otx2</italic> and the cone precursor marker <italic>Rxrg</italic> (Fig. S2B). Weak Mef2c protein expression was observed in Otx2-positive neurogenic RPCs at P1 (data not shown), with increased expression at P5, with stronger expression detected in mature photoreceptors at later developmental stages (Fig. S2C).</p>

<title><italic>Zic3</italic> promotes cone-specific gene expression and is necessary for normal cone differentiation</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of either <italic>Onecut1</italic> or <italic>Pou2f1</italic> in late-stage mouse retinal progenitors is sufficient to induce the expression of cone-specific genes while also repressing rod-specific genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. We employed a similar approach to determine whether <italic>Zic3</italic>, either alone or in combination with the heterochronically expressed cone-promoting factor <italic>Pou2f1</italic>, can likewise induce cone differentiation from late-stage mouse RPCs. To test this, we conducted electroporation of P0 <italic>ex vivo</italic> mouse retinal explants, as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, and used scRNA-Seq, running different conditions together using CellPlex, to assess the effects of <italic>Zic3</italic> overexpression alone, or in combination with <italic>Pou2f1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). ScRNA-Seq analysis of GFP-positive electroporated cells at five days <italic>in vitro</italic> showed that overexpression of heterochronically expressed transcription factors produced a cone-like photoreceptor precursor population (Fig. S3A, Table ST6). Comparison of gene expression between this photoreceptor cluster and rod photoreceptors revealed that empty plasmids induced one differentially-expressed gene: <italic>GFP</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B,C</xref>, Table ST6). Meanwhile, <italic>Zic3</italic> not only induced the expression of several cone photoreceptor-specific genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> at this stage, it also downregulated the expression of many rod-specific genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). <italic>Pou2f1</italic> overexpression upregulated an overlapping but distinct set of cone-specific genes relative to <italic>Zic3</italic>, while also downregulating many of the same rod-specific genes, often to a greater extent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Co-overexpression of <italic>Zic3</italic> and <italic>Pou2f1</italic> in late-stage RPCs had a synergistic effect, resulting in more differentially expressed genes than did either <italic>Zic3</italic> or <italic>Pou2f1</italic> alone, and greater quantitative changes in cellular levels of expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B,C</xref>, Table ST6).</p>

<p><italic>Onecut1</italic> overexpression similarly produced a population of cone-like precursors (Fig S3B, Table ST6). It upregulated a largely distinct set of cone-specific genes compared to <italic>Pou2f1</italic> alone, but shared some upregulated cone-specific genes with the combined overexpression of <italic>Zic3</italic> and <italic>Pou2f1</italic> (Fig. S3C,D, Table ST6). Furthermore, <italic>Onecut1</italic> overexpression downregulated many of the same rod-specific genes as did the combined overexpression of <italic>Pou2f1</italic> and <italic>Zic3</italic> (Fig. S3C,D). Similarly to <italic>Onecut1</italic> and <italic>Pou2f1</italic> overexpression, <italic>Zic3</italic> overexpression produced horizontal cell-like precursors in addition to cone-like precursors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> (Fig. S3A,B, Table ST6).</p>
<p>Because conventional <italic>Zic3</italic> knockouts show widespread and complex developmental defects and high gestational lethality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, we generated an early RPC-specific <italic>Zic3</italic> loss-of-function (LOF) mutant by combining the retinal progenitor-specific Chx10-CreGFP transgenic line with a conditional <italic>Zic3</italic> allele <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). This resulted in a significant reduction in the number of cone photoreceptors in the mutant retina (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E,F</xref>), while the relative numbers of rods and horizontal cells remained unaffected (Fig. S4A-D).</p>
<p>ScRNA-Seq analysis (n=4) of P14 <italic>Zic3</italic> conditional mutant retinas identified quantitative changes in gene expression in several terminally differentiated cell types (Fig. S4E-G, Table S7). Mutant cones showed reduced expression of <italic>Thrb</italic> but increased expression of multiple cone-specific markers, including <italic>Opn1sw</italic>, <italic>Pde6h</italic>, and <italic>Gngt2</italic> (Fig. S4F). Despite the increased <italic>Opn1sw</italic> expression, there does not seem to be a differential impact on genes enriched in S- or M-cones; <italic>Pde6h,</italic> which we find to have reduced expression in S-cones in 13-LGS, is increased in mutant cones and <italic>Pex5l</italic>, which is higher in S-cones, is reduced in mutant cones (Fig. S4F, Table ST7). Interestingly, increased expression of rod-specific genes (<italic>Rho</italic>, <italic>Nrl</italic>, <italic>Pde6g</italic>, <italic>Gngt1</italic>) and pan-photoreceptor genes (<italic>Crx</italic>, <italic>Stx3</italic>, <italic>Rcvrn</italic>) was observed in MÃ¼ller glia (Fig. S4G). Furthermore, several MÃ¼ller glia-specific genes were downregulated, including <italic>Clu</italic>, <italic>Aqp4</italic>, and Notch pathway components such as <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic>, with the exception of <italic>Hopx</italic>, which was upregulated (Fig. S4G).

<p>ScRNA-Seq analysis revealed substantial alterations in cell type composition following <italic>MEF2C</italic> overexpression, with a marked increase in both neurogenic RPCs and immature photoreceptor precursors, which suggested a broad delay or arrest in rod differentiation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,C</xref> Table ST8). Additionally, a novel subpopulation of cone-like precursors emerged (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Cone-like precursors exhibited upregulation of genes such as <italic>Gnat2</italic>, <italic>Arr3</italic>, and <italic>Pde6c</italic>, while also maintaining expression of genes that are typically enriched in both immature rod and cone photoreceptors, including <italic>Tpi1</italic>, <italic>Rtn4</italic>, and <italic>Tpt1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Histological analysis indicated that <italic>MEF2C</italic> overexpression consistently led to morphological abnormalities in electroporated regions, including the formation of whorls and rosettes in the outer nuclear layer, a phenotype reminiscent of <italic>Nrl</italic> and <italic>Nr2e3</italic> mutants that exhibit ectopic cone-specific gene expression in rods (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, Fig. S5A,B) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Although a few GFP-positive electroporated cells co-expressing the cone-specific marker Gnat2 were detected in control (likely due to electroporation of already-present cone cells) there was a significant increase in double-positive cells in the test condition, matching the novel cone-like precursor population found in the scRNA-Seq (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). No obvious reduction in the relative number of Nrl-positive cells was observed (Fig. S5A). No changes were observed in the distribution or abundance of other retinal cell types (Fig. S5B-D).</p>
<p>A previous study reported that <italic>Nestin-Cre;Mef2c<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice, which are predicted to exhibit loss of function of <italic>Mef2c</italic> throughout the developing central nervous system, showed a rapid degeneration of both rod and cone photoreceptors, that resembled photoreceptor loss observed in fast-acting <italic>rd1/rd1</italic> mutants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.

Integration of scATAC-Seq and CUT&amp;RUN data showed that 13LGS consistently harbors both greater numbers of accessible chromatin regions associated with markers of both active (H3K27Ac-positive) enhancers and poised (H3K4me1-positive) enhancers for these genes. However, most of these elements were not evolutionarily conserved, with intergenic enhancers exhibiting particularly low levels of conservation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In contrast, H3K4me3-positive promoter elements were relatively well-conserved and were found in similar numbers in both species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Though conserved and species-specific enhancers showed enrichment for binding sites for the broad photoreceptor precursor transcription factors Otx2 and Neurod1 profiled by CUT&amp;RUN, transcription factors known to regulate cone differentiationâ including <italic>Mef2c</italic>, <italic>Rxrg</italic>, <italic>Thrb</italic> and <italic>Zic3</italic> âdemonstrated far greater motif enrichment in active regulatory elements in 13LGS than in mice, though few of these elements exhibited evolutionary conservation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C,D</xref>, Table ST10).</p>
<p>Enhancer elements in 13LGS are predicted to be directly targeted by a considerably greater number of transcription factors than in mice. This is particularly evident in enhancers associated with <italic>Thrb</italic> in both species, which are shown to be directly targeted by Otx2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E,F</xref>). While the <italic>Thrb</italic> promoter is both accessible and bound by Otx2 in mouse photoreceptor precursors, it is predicted to be targeted by significantly fewer transcription factors compared to the active elements in 13LGS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E,F</xref>). In 13LGS, we identified a pair of species-specific enhancers that are active in late-stage neurogenic RPCs, photoreceptor precursors, and mature cones. These enhancers are predicted to be directly targeted by a combination of factors, including those broadly expressed in developing rods and cones (Otx2, Crx, Neurod1, Prdm1); cone-promoting factors that are restricted to early-stage RPCs in mice (Zic3, Onecut2, Pou2f1); and by transcription factors that selectively promote cone precursor differentiation (Rxrg, Mef2c). The gene regulatory networks (GRNs) driving cone specification in 13LGS become progressively more stable over time, as additional transcription factors are recruited and multiple layers of positive regulation are incorporated (Fig. S7A-D, S8A-C, S9A-C).</p>
<p>We conclude that the development of the cone-dominant retina in 13LGS is driven by the evolution of novel cis-regulatory elements that promote heterochronic expression of cone-promoting and rod-inhibiting transcription factors that are restricted to either early-stage RPCs or postmitotic cone photoreceptor precursors in mice. These <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements are activated by a combination of these factors themselves, in conjunction with transcription factors such as Otx2 and Neurod1, that are expressed in both developing rods and cones. The sustained expression of these factors is maintained by an intricate and progressively expanding network of cross-activating regulatory interactions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study represents the first comprehensive molecular analysis of gene regulatory networks that controls the development of a cone-dominant retina derived from a rod-dominant ancestral state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Using integrated scRNA- and scATAC-Seq analyses, we systematically examined developmental changes in gene expression and regulation in the cone-dominant 13-lined ground squirrel (13LGS) retina, and directly compared these findings to stage-matched data from the rod-dominant mouse. Though birthdating analysis would be required for a direct demonstration, our findings strongly indicate that 13LGS exhibit a selective expansion of the temporal window of cone generation, extending into late stages of neurogenesis. This is mediated by the heterochronic expression of a subset of transcription factors in late-stage progenitors that both promote cone and repress rod specification. In addition to previously characterized cone-promoting and rod-inhibiting factors such as <italic>Onecut2</italic> and <italic>Pou2f1</italic>, we identified <italic>Zic3</italic>, which is selectively expressed in early-stage RPCs in mice, as a key driver of cone specification. Late-stage 13LGS RPCs also exhibit precocious expression of transcription factors such as <italic>Thrb</italic>, <italic>Rxrg</italic>, and <italic>Sall3</italic>, which in mice function post-mitotically to promote cone differentiation, and in many cases also act in parallel to inhibit rod differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Transcription of these genes in late-stage RPCs is controlled by 13LGS-specific enhancer elements, which are directly targeted by transcription factors that are broadly expressed in both early- and late-stage RPCs, such as Otx2, as well as by heterochronically and precociously expressed cone-promoting transcription factors through a dynamic process of positive feedback and cross-activation. The gene regulatory network (GRN) governing cone specification becomes progressively more complex, incorporating additional transcription factors over time. These factors include genes expressed in both rod and cone precursors, such as Neurod1 and Prdm1; genes known to promote cone precursor differentiation, such as Sall3; and previously uncharacterized regulators such as Mef2c, which we show to both activate cone-specific genes and repress rod-specific genes.</p>
<p>The evolution of novel morphological features, such as bat wings or the elongated legs of jerboas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, is often driven by the emergence of lineage-specific cis-regulatory elements, which confer novel spatiotemporal patterns of expression to structurally conserved transcription factors or secreted patterning regulators. Based on our bioinformatic analysis, the evolution of the cone-dominant 13LGS retina follows this paradigm, in which species-specific enhancer elements, identified by the overlap of species-specific H3K27Ac peaks and cell type-specific chromatin accessibility, are used to drive both the ectopic heterochronic expression of transcription factors that regulate neural progenitor temporal identity and precocious expression in retinal progenitors of transcription factors that normally act to promote cone differentiation in postmitotic precursor cells. These in turn promote cone, and repress rod, photoreceptor specification. The highly interconnected nature of the GRN controlling 13LGS cone specification should make it robust, limiting the impact of the loss of any single enhancer element on cone production. Similarly, the GRNâs highly derived nature, with TF binding combinations not seen in rod-dominant retinas, means enhancers that are functional in the 13LGS cannot necessarily be expected to behave similarly in mice. In all vertebrates examined to date, including 13LGS, separate and mutually cross-repressive GRNs specify early- and late-stage temporal identity in retinal progenitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In mice, cone generation occurs only in progenitors in which the early-stage network is active <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, whereas in 13LGS, multiple transcription factors from the early-stage network persist in late-stage RPCs.</p>
<p>This raises the question of whether similar heterochronic shifts in key temporal identity regulators may underlie other cases of rapid evolutionary changes in the rod-cone ratio. Examples in mammals include the development of the cone-dominant retina in primate-like tree shrews and the formation of the rod-free foveola in the primate fovea <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. However, rapid changes in the rod-cone ratio are observed across vertebrate classes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Significant differences in the relative abundance of other retinal cell types are also observed among species, often correlated with temporal niche adaptation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Moreover, shifts in the relative ratios of neuronal subtypes in the central nervous system can underlie species-specific behavioral, cognitive, and sensory processes between closely-related vertebrate species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. These variations may also stem from species-specific heterochronic expression of transcription factors that control temporal identity in the developing brain.</p>
<p>By performing an unbiased and comprehensive analysis of gene regulatory networks that are selectively active in late-stage RPCs of 13LGS, we have identified numerous previously uncharacterized factors that are strong candidates for promoting cone specification. In line with previous studies of <italic>Onecut1</italic> and <italic>Pou2f1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, we find that these factors each activate expression of a subset of cone-specific genes while broadly and potently repress expression of rod-specific genes. Working in mice, we demonstrate that <italic>Zic3</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> behave similarly, activating expression of partially overlapping sets of cone-specific genes and strongly repressing rod differentiation. Many additional candidates, such as <italic>Hivep2</italic> or <italic>Isl2</italic>, remain to be tested and are likely to serve similar functions. Our analysis suggests that gene regulatory networks controlling cone specification are highly redundant, with transcription factors acting in complex, redundant, and potentially synergistic combinations. This is further supported by our findings on the synergistic effects of combined overexpression of <italic>Zic3</italic> and <italic>Pou2f1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and the relatively mild or undetectable phenotypes obsered following loss of function of <italic>Zic3</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, Fig. S6), as well as other cone-promoting factors such as <italic>Onecut1</italic> and <italic>Pou2f1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>These findings have potentially significant clinical implications, as the loss of cone photoreceptors is the primary trigger for irreversible blindness in hereditary diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. Effective strategies for driving cone specification and differentiation are essential for developing cell-based therapies to replace photoreceptors lost to degenerative disease, and the findings of comparative studies like ours can help identify these mechanisms.</p>

For each reaction, either 500,000 13LGS nuclei or 385,000 mouse nuclei were used. The CUTANA protocol v4.0 protocol was followed with minor modifications. In brief, isolated nuclei were resuspended in CUT&amp;RUN wash buffer and added directly to Concanavalin A beads. Then 0.5 Âµg of the following antibodies were added to each respective reaction: IgG control (EpiCypher, 13-0042), H3K4me1 (EpiCypher, 13-0057), H3K4me3 (EpiCypher, 13-0041), H3K27ac (EpiCypher, 13-0059), H3K27me3 (EpiCypher, 13-0055), NeuroD1 (Cell Signaling, 62953), Otx2 (R&amp;D Systems, BAF1979), or Otx2 (Atlas Antibodies, HPA000633). H3K9me3 (Abcam, ab8898) was used at 0.41 Âµg of antibody per reaction. The total CUT&amp;RUN DNA yield, up to 5 ng of total purified DNA, was used for library preparation, using reagents from CUTANAâ¢ CUT&amp;RUN Library Prep Kit (EpiCypher, 14-1001) or NEBNextÂ® Ultraâ¢ II DNA Library Prep Kit for IlluminaÂ® (NEB, E7645S). The EpiCypher CUTANA Library Prep Kit User Manual v1.3 was followed and indexing performed using NEBNextÂ® Multiplex Oligos for IlluminaÂ® (NEB, E7395S) or Dual Index Kit TT Set A (10X Genomics, PN-1000215). Final libraries were sequenced at the Novogene sequencing core (Sacramento, CA, USA) on the NovaSeq X Plus (Illumina) to generate paired-end 150 base pair reads.</p>

<title>Integration of 13LGS and mouse late-stage single-cell datasets</title>
<p>To compare cone development between 13LGS and mouse during the late developmental stages, scRNA-Seq datasets spanning different periods (E21âP8 for 13LGS and E18âP5 for mouse) were integrated. First, the raw gene expression matrices from both species were filtered to retain only conserved genes. Next, 13LGS gene identifiers were mapped to their corresponding mouse gene identifiers as shown in Table S2, and when multiple 13LGS genes corresponded to a single mouse gene, their expression values were summed. The resulting 13LGS and mouse cell-by-gene matrices were directly merged, and the combined raw count matrix was normalized using SCTransform (SCT) before being integrated with Harmony in Seurat. Dimensionality reduction and clustering analyses were then performed on the Harmony dimensions to identify combined cell types (RPCs, N. RPCs, BC/Photoreceptor Precursors, Cones, and Rods). Finally, cell annotations from the scRNA-Seq data were transferred to the scATAC-Seq dataset using the addGeneIntegrationMatrix function in ArchR (version) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. Based on the scATAC-Seq clusters and transferred annotations, the final cell types were manually annotated.

<title>Identification of differential photoreceptor development genes and their regulatory elements between 13LGS and mouse</title>
<p>To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in photoreceptor development between the 13LGS and mouse datasets, we utilized the integrated cell-by-gene matrix from the previous integration step. Differential comparisons were performed using the âFindMarkersâ function from the Seurat package with the criteria of p-value &lt; 1e-6 and average logâ fold change &gt; 0.35. Specifically, the following comparisons were made: 13LGS_RPCs vs. Mouse_RPCs, 13LGS_N. RPCs vs. Mouse_N. RPCs, 13LGS_BC/Photoreceptor Precursors vs. Mouse_BC/Photoreceptor Precursors, 13LGS_Cone vs. Mouse_Cone, and 13LGS_Cone vs. Mouse_Rod. All DEGs from these comparisons were then merged and clustered according to their expression levels across RPCs, N. RPCs, BC/Photoreceptor precursors, cones, and rods in both species using a k-means algorithm (k = 8). Genes in clusters 2 and 3 were subsequently identified as 13LGS-specific cone-promoting genes.</p>
<p>To identify regulatory elements associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs), scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq datasets were first integrated separately for 13LGS and mouse. Next, using the integrated multi-omics data, cells from RPC, NG, BC/Photoreceptor Precursor, Cone, and rod populations were analyzed to calculate Peak-to-Gene (PtoG) correlations via the âaddPeak2GeneLinksâ function in ArchR. For each gene, peaks located within 500 kb that showed a PtoG correlation greater than 0.25 and an FDR below 0.01 were defined as its regulatory elements. Subsequently, the number of regulatory elements per cluster was compared between 13LGS and mouse at the level of conserved gene pairs. For each species, the gene-associated regulatory element counts were normalized by the average number of regulatory elements per gene. Finally, pairwise t-tests were performed to assess the differences in the number of cis-regulatory elements across clusters.</p>

<title>Construction of gene regulatory networks</title>
<p>Late-stage cell type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) were constructed independently for 13LGS and mouse. To enable a direct comparison between the two networks, we first filtered the cells and genes prior to GRN analysis. For the 13LGS dataset, retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), neurogenic retinal progenitor cells (N. RPCs), bipolar cell/photoreceptor precursors (BC/Photoreceptor precursors), and cones were selected. In contrast, the mouse dataset includes RPCs, N. RPCs, BC/photoreceptor precursors, cones, and rods. Additionally, only the conserved genes present in both datasets were retained for GRN construction.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Identifying cis-regulatory elements</title>
<p>For each target gene, three categories of peaks were identified as potential regulatory elements based on the following criteria: 1) TSS Peaks: Peaks located within a 1 kb region surrounding the target geneâs transcription start site (TSS). 2) Gene Body Peaks: Peaks situated within the target gene body. Only peaks with a peak-to-gene (PtoG) correlation greater than 0.25 and statistically significant (FDR &lt; 0.05) were retained. 3) Intergenic Peaks: Peaks found within 500 kb of the target geneâs TSS, but not overlapping with the TSS or gene body regions of other target genes. These peaks were also required to have a PtoG correlation greater than 0.25 and to be statistically significant (FDR &lt; 0.05).</p>

<label>2.</label><title>Predicting TF binding sites</title>
<p>Cell type-specific TF binding sites were identified based on TF expression, motif matching, and footprint scores. First, TFs with an average expression level below 0.1 in each cell type were excluded. Next, binding sites for the remaining expressed TFs were determined by matching their motifsâsourced from the TRANSFAC2018 databaseâto the peak sequences using the matchMotifs function from the motifmatchr package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> (p-value threshold = 5e-5). Second, footprint scores were calculated using merged scATAC-Seq signals for each cell type. The Tn5 insertion sites were extracted using the âgetFragmentsFromProjectâ function from the ArchR package, converted to BED files, and normalized with TOBIAS software <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>). Finally, for each motifâs binding region, the average normalized Tn5 insertion signals were calculated by its center (S_center) and flanking regions (S_left and S_right). The flanking region is triple the size of the center region. Motifs were retained if they met the following criteria: S_left - S_center &gt; 0.05 and S_right - S_center &gt; 0.05.</p>

<p>To identify key transcription factors (TFs) promoting cone specification in 13LGS, cone-specific genes were first identified by comparing with other late-stage neurons using the FindMarkers function (cutoffs: logâFC &gt; 0.3 and adjusted p-value &lt; 0.01). Next, for each TF, the enrichment of its regulatory targets within the cone-specific genes was assessed using a hypergeometric test via Râs phyper function, where the âpopulationâ was defined as the total number of target genes in the positive GRNs, the âsampleâ as the number of positive targets for that TF, and the âsuccessesâ as the number of positive targets present in the cone-specific gene list. Additionally, the coverage of each TF was calculated as the proportion of its positive targets that are cone-specific. Finally, TFs with a hypergeometric test p-value &lt; 1e-6 and coverage &gt; 0.2 were identified as key activators. The Top 30 TFs were ranked by the number of their positive regulated cone-specific genes.</p>

<title>Identification of TSS, aEnhancers and pEnhancers by CUT &amp; RUN</title>
<p>TSS, bTSS (bivalent TSS), aEnhancer (active enhancer), and pEnhancer (poised enhancer) elements were identified based on the H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac CUT&amp;RUN datasets in conjunction with the candidate cis-regulatory elements defined in the previous step using scATAC-Seq analysis. To determine the presence of a histone modification within each candidate cis-regulatory element, the corresponding histone peaks were overlapped with these elements, and the average signal intensity for each histone mark was calculated within their regions. A cis-regulatory element was considered to exhibit a histone modification if it both overlapped with a histone peak and showed an average signal greater than 2.5. Finally, cis-regulatory elements exhibiting H3K4me3+ were classified as TSS, those with H3K4me3â and H3K27ac+ as aEnhancer, and those with H3K4me1+ as pEnhancer.</p>

<title>Identification of conserved regulatory elements</title>
<p>Conserved regulatory elements between 13LGS and mouse were identified by comparing ATAC-Seq peaks (all potential cis-regulatory elements), as well as putative regulatory elements associated with promoters, active, and poised enhancers that were associated with conserved gene pairs. For each conserved gene pair, candidate regulatory peaks were collected from both species and paired one-to-one, with each pair comprising one peak from 13LGS and one peak from mouse. Subsequently, the sequence of each 13LGS peak and the forward and reverse complement sequences for each mouse peak were extracted using the Biostrings package in R. Similarity scores for each candidate peak pair were computed with the âpairwiseAlignmentâ function using local alignment parameters (type = âlocalâ, gapOpening = -2, gapExtension = -1). To determine the cutoff for conserved peak pairs, a normal model was fitted to all similarity scores using the MASS packageâs fitdistr function, and a threshold corresponding to a p-value &lt; 0.05 under the fitted normal distribution was defined. Peak pairs with scores exceeding this threshold were considered to be conserved.</p>

<title>ChromVAR analysis</title>
<p>Global transcription factor (TF) activity at the single-cell level was evaluated using ChromVAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. The analysis began with the raw cell-by-peak matrix, which was processed with the addGCBias function to adjust for GC content biases. Next, motif information from the TransFac2018 database was incorporated to generate a TF z-score matrix via the matchmotifs and computeDeviations functions. Finally, these z-scores were visualized as heatmaps to illustrate TF activity patterns across the cell population.</p>
<p>To identify cell type-specific motifs in 13LGS, the z-score matrix generated from ChromVAR was converted into a Seurat object. The FindAllMarkers function from the Signac package was then applied with the following parameters: only.pos = TRUE, mean.fxn = rowMeans, and fc.name = âavg_diffâ. Finally, motifs with an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.01 and an average difference (avg_diff) &gt; 2 were identified as cell type-specific.</p>
<p>To identify differential motifs associated with photoreceptor development between 13LGS and mouse, the ChromVAR-generated z-score matrix was utilized. The following pairwise comparisons were performed: 13LGS_RPCs vs. Mouse_RPCs, 13LGS_N. RPCs vs. Mouse_N. RPCs, 13LGS_BC/Photoreceptor Precursors vs. Mouse_BC/Photoreceptor Precursors, 13LGS_Cone vs. Mouse_Cone, and 13LGS_Cone vs. Mouse_Rod. Motifs exhibiting an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.01 and an average difference (avg_diff) &gt; 2, with their corresponding genes showing consistent changes, were designated as differential motifs. Subsequently, all differential motifs were merged and clustered via hierarchical clustering based on their average ChromVAR z-score levels across RPCs, N. RPCs, BC/Photoreceptor precursors, cone, and rod cell types in both species.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Weir et al. investigate why the 13-lined ground squirrel (13LGS) retina is unusually rich in cone photoreceptors, the cells responsible for color and daylight vision. Most mammals, including humans, have rod-dominant retinas, making the 13LGS retina both an intriguing evolutionary divergence and a valuable model for uncovering novel mechanisms of cone generation. The developmental programs underlying this adaptation were previously unknown.</p>
<p>Using an integrated approach that combines single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), scATACseq, and histology, the authors generate a comprehensive atlas of retinal neurogenesis in 13LGS. Notably, comparative analyses with mouse datasets reveal that in 13LGS, cones can arise from late-stage neurogenic progenitors, a striking contrast to mouse and primate retinas, where late progenitors typically generate rods and other late-born cell types but not cones. They further identify a shift in the timing (heterochrony) of expression of several transcription factors. Further, the authors show that these factors act through species-specific regulatory elements. And overall, functional experiments support a role for several of these candidates in cone production.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>This study stands out for its rigorous and multi-layered methodology. The combination of transcriptomic, epigenomic, and histological data yields a detailed and coherent view of cone development in 13LGS. Cross-species comparisons are thoughtfully executed, lending strong evolutionary context to the findings. The conclusions are, in general, well supported by the evidence, and the datasets generated represent a substantial resource for the field. The work will be of high value to both evolutionary neurobiology and regenerative medicine, particularly in the design of strategies to replace lost cone photoreceptors in human disease.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) Overall, the conclusions are strongly supported by the data, but the paper would benefit from additional clarifications. In particular, some of the conclusions could be toned down slightly to reflect that the observed changes in candidate gene function, such as those for Zic3 by itself, are modest and may represent part of a more complex regulatory network.</p>
<p>(2) Additional explanations about the cell composition of the 13LGS retina are needed. The ratios between cone and rod are clearly detailed, but do those lead to changes in other cell types?</p>
<p>(3) Could the lack of a clear trajectory for rod differentiation be just an effect of low cell numbers for this population?</p>
<p>(4) The immunohistochemistry and RNA hybridization experiments shown in Figure S2 would benefit from supporting controls to strengthen their interpretability. While it has to be recognized that performing immunostainings on non-conventional species is not a simple task, negative controls are necessary to establish the baseline background levels, especially in cases where there seems to be labeling around the cells. The text indicates that these experiments are both immunostainings and ISH, but the figure legend only says &quot;immunohistochemistry&quot;. Clarifying these points would improve readers' confidence in the data.</p>
<p>(5) Figure S3: The text claims that overexpression of Zic3 alone is sufficient to induce the cone-like photoreceptor precursor cells as well as horizontal cell-like precursors, but this is not clear in Figure S3A nor in any other figure. Similarly, the effects of Pou2f1 overexpression are different in Figure S3A and Figure S3B. In Figure S3B, the effects described (increased presence of cone-like and horizontal-like precursors) are very clear, whereas it is not in Figure S3A. How are these experiments different?</p>
<p>(6) The analyses of Zic3 conditional mutants (Figure S4) reveal an increase in many cone, rod, and pan-photoreceptor genes with only a reduction in some cone genes. Thus, the overall conclusion that Zic3 is essential for cones while repressing rod genes doesn't seem to match this particular dataset.</p>
<p>(7) Throughout the text, the authors used the term &quot;evolved&quot;. To substantiate this claim, it would be important to include sequence analyses or to rephrase to a more neutral term that does not imply evolutionary inference.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper aims to elucidate the gene regulatory network governing the development of cone photoreceptors, the light-sensing neurons responsible for high acuity and color vision in humans. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis through stage-matched comparisons of gene expression and chromatin accessibility using scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq from the cone-dominant 13-lined ground squirrel (13LGS) retina and the rod-dominant mouse retina. The abundance of cones in the 13LGS retina arises from a dominant trajectory from late retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) to photoreceptor precursors and then to cones, whereas only a small proportion of rods are generated from these precursors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper presents intriguing insights into the gene regulatory network involved in 13LGS cone development. In particular, the authors highlight the expression of cone-promoting transcription factors such as Onecut2, Pou2f1, and Zic3 in late-stage neurogenic progenitors, which may be driven by 13LGS-specific cis-regulatory elements. The authors also characterize candidate cone-promoting genes Zic3 and Mef2C, which have been previously understudied. Overall, I found that the across-species analysis presented by this study is a useful resource for the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The functional analysis on Zic3 and Mef2C in mice does not convincingly establish that these factors are sufficient or necessary to promote cone photoreceptor specification. Several analyses lack clarity or consistency, and figure labeling and interpretation need improvement.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors perform deep transcriptomic and epigenetic comparisons between mouse and 13-lined ground squirrel (13LGS) to identify mechanisms that drive rod vs cone-rich retina development. Through cross-species analysis, the authors find extended cone generation in 13LGS, gene expression within progenitor/photoreceptor precursor cells consistent with a lengthened cone window, and differential regulatory element usage. Two of the transcription factors, Mef2c and Zic3, were subsequently validated using OE and KO mouse lines to verify the role of these genes in regulating competence to generate cone photoreceptors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this is an impactful manuscript with broad implications toward our understanding of retinal development, cell fate specification, and TF network dynamics across evolution and with the potential to influence our future ability to treat vision loss in human patients. The generation of this rich new dataset profiling the transcriptome and epigenome of the 13LGS is a tremendous addition to the field that assuredly will be useful for numerous other investigations and questions of a variety of interests. In this manuscript, the authors use this dataset and compare it to data they previously generated for mouse retinal development to identify 2 new regulators of cone generation and shed insights into their regulation and their integration into the network of regulatory elements within the 13LGS compared to mouse.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors chose to omit several cell classes from analyses and visualizations that would have added to their interpretations. In particular, I worry that the omission of 13LGS rods, early RPCs, and early NG from Figures 2C, D, and F is notable and would have added to the understanding of gene expression dynamics. In other words, (a) are these genes of interest unique to late RPCs or maintained from early RPCs, and (b) are rod networks suppressed compared to the mouse?</p>
<p>(2) The authors claim that the majority of cones are generated by late RPCs and that this is driven primarily by the enriched enhancer network around cone-promoting genes. With the temporal scRNA/ATACseq data at their disposal, the authors should compare early vs late born cones and RPCs to determine whether the same enhancers and genes are hyperactivated in early RPCs as well as in the 13LGS. This analysis will answer the important question of whether the enhancers activated/evolved to promote all cones, or are only and specifically activated within late RPCs to drive cone genesis at the expense of rods.</p>
<p>(3) The authors repeatedly use the term 'evolved' to describe the increased number of local enhancer elements of genes that increase in expression in 13LGS late RPCs and cones. Evolution can act at multiple levels on the genome and its regulation. The authors should consider analysis of sequence level changes between mouse, 13LGS, and other species to test whether the enhancer sequences claimed to be novel in the 13LGS are, in fact, newly evolved sequence/binding sites or if the binding sites are present in mouse but only used in late RPCs of the 13LGS.</p>
<p>(4) The authors state that 'Enhancer elements in 13LGS are predicted to be directly targeted by a considerably greater number of transcription factors than in mice'. This statement can easily be misread to suggest that all enhancers display this, when in fact, this is only the cone-promoting enhancers of late 13LGS RPCs. In a way, this is not surprising since these genes are largely less expressed in mouse vs 13LGS late RPCs, as shown in Figure 2. The manuscript is written to suggest this mechanism of enhancer number is specific to cone production in the 13LGS- it would help prove this point if the authors asked the opposite question and showed that mouse late RPCs do not have similar increased predicted binding of TFs near rod-promoting genes in C7-8.</p>
