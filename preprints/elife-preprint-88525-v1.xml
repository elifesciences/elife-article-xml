<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Photosynthetic eukaryotes, such as microalgae and plants, foster fundamentally important relationships with their microbiome based on the reciprocal exchange of chemical currencies. Among these, the dicarboxylate metabolite azelaic acid (Aze) appears to play an important, but heterogeneous, role in modulating these microbiomes, as it is used as a carbon source for some heterotrophs but is toxic to others. However, the ability of Aze to promote or inhibit growth, as well as its uptake and assimilation mechanisms into bacterial cells are mostly unknown. Here, we use transcriptomics, transcriptional factor coexpression networks, uptake experiments, and metabolomics to unravel the uptake, catabolism and toxicity of Aze on two microalgal-associated bacteria, <italic>Phycobacter</italic> and <italic>Alteromonas</italic>, whose growth is promoted or inhibited by Aze, respectively. We identify the first putative Aze transporter in bacteria, a ‘C<sub>4</sub>- TRAP transporter’, and show that Aze is assimilated through fatty acid degradation, with further catabolism occurring through the glyoxylate and butanoate metabolism pathways when used as a carbon source. <italic>Phycobacter</italic> took up Aze at an initial uptake rate of 3.8×10<sup>-9</sup> nmol cell<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> and utilized it as a carbon source in concentrations ranging from 10 μM-1 mM, suggesting a broad range of acclimation to Aze availability. For inhibited bacteria, we infer that Aze inhibits the ribosome and/or protein synthesis and that a suite of efflux pumps is utilized to shuttle Aze outside the cytoplasm. We demonstrate that seawater amended with Aze becomes enriched in bacterial families that can catabolise Aze, which appears to be a different mechanism from that in soil, where modulation by the host plant is required. This study enhances our understanding of carbon cycling in the oceans and how microscale chemical interactions can structure marine microbial populations. In addition, our findings unravel the role of a key chemical currency in the modulation of eukaryote-microbiome interactions across diverse ecosystems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eukaryote-microbiome interactions are among the most diverse associations in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Chemical exchanges between diverse eukaryotes and their microbiomes are hallmarks of these relations, particularly involving secondary metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Despite the importance of secondary metabolites as signaling molecules that play critical roles in structuring microbial populations and regulating global biogeochemical cycles, the molecular mechanisms by which identified chemicals regulate microbial relationships in the ocean are largely elusive. The C<sub>9</sub> dicarboxylic acid, azelaic acid (or azelate, hereafter Aze) is a ubiquitous, yet enigmatic metabolite produced by photosynthetic organisms, such as plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] and phytoplankton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. It is postulated to be a product of the peroxidation of galactolipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], yet its exact biosynthetic pathway is unknown. Aze plays a crucial role as an infochemical that primes systemic acquired resistance against phytopathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and influences microbial diversity in soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In marine environments, diatoms secrete Aze to modulate bacterial populations by promoting the growth of symbionts while simultaneously inhibiting opportunists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Despite this undeniable importance, no Aze uptake proteins are known in bacteria and its assimilation into bacterial cells to promote or inhibit growth is poorly understood. A single gene has recently been identified in <italic>Pseudomonas nitroreducens</italic> that acts as a transcriptional regulator of Aze, <italic>azeR</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], yet its regulatory targets are unknown. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that enable the transport and assimilation of Aze into bacterial cells to induce positive or negative phenotypes will help to reveal how eukaryotic hosts influence and control their microbiome.</p>
<p>To examine how bacteria transport and catabolise Aze, we used <italic>Phycobacter azelaicus</italic> (formerly <italic>Phaeobacter</italic> sp. F10, and hereafter <italic>Phycobacter</italic>) as a model to study how Aze promotes bacterial growth and <italic>Alteromonas macleodii</italic> F12 (hereafter <italic>A. macleodii</italic>) as a model to study the inhibitory effects of Aze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Both bacteria were isolated from the diatom <italic>Asterionellopsis glacialis,</italic> which was shown to produce Aze to modulate its microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. In previous experiments, Aze caused an increase in cell density of <italic>Phycobacter</italic> relative to controls, while temporarily inhibiting the growth of <italic>A. macleodii</italic> before its growth recovered relative to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. A combination of transcriptomics, transcriptional coexpression networks of master transcriptional regulators, metabolomics, and uptake experiments were used to elucidate how these bacteria process Aze. Additionally, <italic>in situ</italic> mesocosm experiments with seawater microbial communities and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> were conducted to examine if Aze influences microbial diversity in natural environments and enrich microbial taxa that carry genes involved in Aze uptake and response. We discover the first putative Aze transport system in bacteria and map out how each bacterium responds to and processes Aze through complex regulatory networks.</p>

<title>Growth and Transcriptional Response to Aze</title>
<p><italic>Phycobacter</italic> incubated with 1 mM Aze as the sole carbon source showed a significant increase in growth relative to no-carbon controls or growth with glutamate as the sole carbon source (Figure S1a). To elucidate the transcriptional responses of <italic>Phycobacter</italic> to growth on Aze, RNA samples were collected at 0.5 and 8 hours after Aze addition to <italic>Phycobacter</italic> to capture the short-term uptake and longer-term catabolism of Aze (Figure S1b). To infer possible mechanisms of short-term toxicity by <italic>A. macleodii</italic>, samples were collected at 0.5 hours. After 0.5 hours, <italic>Phycobacter</italic> differentially expressed 273 genes in response to Aze; this number increased to 558 genes after 8 hours, corresponding to ∼20% of all CDS in its genome (Table S1). Approximately 78% of differentially expressed genes were upregulated in response to Aze (<italic>n</italic>=652) and most occurred at 8 hours (<italic>n</italic>=494). Only 70 genes displayed consistent expression profiles at both 0.5 and 8 hours, suggesting the immediate, short-term response to Aze is different from long-term growth on the substrate. In contrast, <italic>A. macleodii</italic> differentially expressed 274 genes at 0.5 hours, corresponding to ∼7% of all CDS in its genome, half of which were upregulated (Table S1).</p>
<p>Global analysis of KEGG pathways showed significant differences between the transcriptional profiles of <italic>Phycobacter</italic> and <italic>A. macleodii</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). While fatty acid degradation, amino acid metabolism and degradation, ABC transporters, oxidative phosphorylation, propanoate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathways exhibited similar expression ratios across both bacteria in response to Aze, upregulated genes in these pathways were mostly dominated by <italic>Phycobacter</italic> transcripts. In contrast, downregulated genes were mostly enriched in <italic>A. macleodii</italic> transcripts. Interestingly, fatty acid degradation genes were among the most upregulated genes in <italic>Phycobacter</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Aze Catabolism by <italic>Phycobacter</italic></title>
<p>No uptake genes are known for Aze. A C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter substrate-binding protein (INS80_RS11065) was the most and the third most upregulated gene in <italic>Phycobacter</italic> grown on Aze at 0.5 and 8 hours, respectively. The small and large permease genes (INS80_RS11060 and INS80_RS11055) neighboring this gene, which form a functional TRAP transporter, were among the top 20 most upregulated genes in the transcriptome at 0.5 hours and continued to be upregulated at 8 hours, implicating these genes in transporting Aze (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Tables S2 and S3). All three genes are co-localized with the putative Aze transcriptional regulator, <italic>azeR</italic> (INS80_RS11050, belonging to the <italic>lclR</italic> family transcriptional factor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], which was also upregulated at 0.5 hours. <italic>In silico</italic> predictions revealed that <italic>azeR</italic>, the small and large permeases all fall within a single operon while the substrate-binding gene is transcribed independently (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We assign this cluster of genes the designation <italic>azeTSLR</italic> (<italic>T</italic>=substrate-binding protein, <italic>S</italic>=small permease, <italic>L</italic>=large permease, <italic>R</italic>=regulator). Once inside the cell, Aze appeared to be fed into the fatty acid degradation pathway via a PaaI family thioesterase and acyl-coA ligase (<italic>fadD</italic>) that are present directly downstream of <italic>azeTSLR</italic> and upregulated at 0.5 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Table S2). Aze-coA was then putatively degraded through a series of steps catalyzed by genes in the fatty acid degradation pathway (<italic>acd, paaF, and fadN</italic>) that were among the most highly upregulated genes at 0.5 hours and continued to be upregulated at 8 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Tables S2 and S3). These successive reactions presumably liberated two acetyl-coA molecules to generate glutaryl-coA. This molecule can either be converted to glutaconyl-coA, or further degraded into acetyl-coA via <italic>gcdH</italic>, <italic>paaF</italic>, <italic>fadN</italic> and <italic>atoB</italic>, all of which were upregulated at both time points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm the patterns observed in the <italic>Phycobacter</italic> transcriptome and resolve the fate of glutaryl-coA, <italic>Phycobacter</italic> was supplemented with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>9</sub>-Aze, and intracellular metabolites were extracted and analyzed using an elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) and a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FTMS). Within 15 minutes of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>9</sub>-Aze addition, <italic>Phycobacter</italic> cells were significantly enriched in <sup>13</sup>C and continued to exhibit an increase in δ<sup>13</sup>C up to 120 minutes as shown using IRMS (repeated-measure ANOVA, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) (Figure S2). Within 15 min, 0.18% of the carbon content of <italic>Phycobacter</italic> cells was derived from Aze, corresponding to an uptake rate of 3.8 x10<sup>-9</sup> nmol cell<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>. After 120 min, the fraction of carbon derived from Aze contributed to 0.67% of the total carbon in the cells (Table S4). Consistent with this observation, FTMS analysis showed that 15-30 minutes after the addition of labeled Aze to cells, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>9</sub>-Aze, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>9</sub>-Azeloyl-coA, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>7</sub>-pimeloyl-coA, and <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>- glutaryl-coA were detected and increased in relative abundance over the course of 120 minutes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Table S4). Furthermore, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-glutaconyl-coA was detected at 2 hours and <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>- propionate-coA at 1-2 hours after addition of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>9</sub>-Aze. Glutaconyl-coA is a side product of glutaryl-coA oxidation that is shuttled into butanoate metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], while propionyl-coA is an important intermediate in glyoxylate and propanoate metabolism, indicating these pathways maybe activated downstream of Aze catabolism. Indeed, while greater upregulation of fatty acid degradation occurred at 0.5 hours than at 8 hours, greater upregulation of glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, butanoate metabolism and other downstream pathways occurred at 8 hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>, Table S2).</p>

<title>Toxicity of Aze in <italic>A. macleodii</italic></title>
<p>The genome of <italic>A. macleodii</italic> completely lacks any TRAP transport systems, suggesting Aze crosses the cell membrane non-specifically. In fact, <italic>A. macleodii</italic> assimilated negligible amounts of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>9</sub>-Aze, with a relative uptake ∼160 times lower than that of <italic>Phycobacter</italic> at 120 minutes (Figure S2). In contrast to the <italic>Phycobacter</italic> transcriptome, the highest upregulated gene 0.5 hours after Aze addition to <italic>A. macleodii</italic> was an efflux RND transporter periplasmic subunit (GKZ85_RS10170). The permease and outer membrane subunits of this efflux pump (GKZ85_RS10160, GKZ85_RS10165) that belong to the same operon were among the top 10 most upregulated genes in the <italic>A. macleodii</italic> transcriptome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>, Tables S2 and S3). This efflux system presumably removes Aze from the cytoplasm. Several other efflux transporters and ABC multidrug transporters were among the most upregulated genes in the presence of Aze relative to the controls. Among upregulated genes in the presence of Aze were secretion systems, protein export, spore formation, stress-response proteins, heat shock proteins, proteases, and ribosome protection genes (Tables S2 and S3). Fatty acid degradation was not differentially expressed in the presence of Aze, while most ribosomal genes were either downregulated or not differentially expressed. In addition, nucleotide metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transfer, amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis were downregulated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, Table S2). Collectively, these transcriptomic patterns confirm previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] that indicate <italic>A. macleodii</italic> mitigates the toxic effects of Aze over time and that this mitigation relies on removing Aze from the cell via efflux systems and simultaneously arresting cellular metabolism. Interestingly, several genes involved in ribosome protection and response to protein degradation (<italic>rmf</italic>, <italic>hpf</italic>, <italic>hslR</italic>, <italic>hslU</italic>, <italic>hslV</italic>) were upregulated, suggesting Aze may disrupt protein synthesis (Table S2).</p>

<title><italic>AzeR</italic> and <italic>xre</italic> Transcriptional Networks</title>
<p>Due to the stark transcriptional response to Aze in each bacterium, we hypothesized that transcriptional regulation plays a major role in activating essential pathways that catabolize or mitigate the toxicity of Aze, particularly since both bacteria have complete fatty acid degradation pathways. To identify transcriptional master regulators for <italic>Phycobacter</italic> and <italic>A. macleodii</italic>, we performed regulatory impact factor (RIF) analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Transcriptional factors (TF) in each species were compared to the unique corresponding differentially expressed gene lists, which led to the identification of 29 regulators with significant scores for <italic>Phycobacter</italic> and 12 for <italic>A. macleodii</italic> (deviating ± 1.96 SD from the mean; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) (Table S5). Interestingly, <italic>azeR</italic> was the top differentially expressed TF identified in <italic>Phycobacter</italic>. In contrast, only two TFs, namely (i) XRE family transcriptional regulator (<italic>xre</italic>), a bacterial TF associated with stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], and (ii) helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulators (GKZ85_RS06065 and GKZ85_RS16495), were differentially expressed in <italic>A. macleodii</italic>. To gain insights into the regulatory mechanisms at play during exposure to Aze, we used transcriptional coexpression networks, which enabled characterization of transcriptional patterns during response to disease, stress, and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Significant connections (r ≥ ±0.95) within the initial network identified 286 genes with 7,208 connections in <italic>Phycobacter</italic> and 274 genes with 7,102 connections in <italic>A. macleodii</italic> (Figure S3). Subnetworks that contain <italic>azeR</italic> and <italic>xre</italic> show that they act as hub genes in putatively regulating specific gene categories in <italic>Phycobacter</italic> and <italic>A. macleodii</italic>, respectively. The subnetwork of <italic>azeR</italic> shows that it putatively regulates transcription of most of the pathways that are involved in assimilating Aze in <italic>Phycobacter</italic>, including <italic>azeTSL</italic>, fatty acid degradation, butanoate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, in addition to other genes that may be indirectly affected by Aze catabolism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4a</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). In contrast, the subnetwork of <italic>xre</italic> shows that it putatively regulates transcription of the efflux system implicated in removal of Aze from the cytoplasm of <italic>A. macleodii</italic>, stress proteins and proteases, protein export, nucleotide metabolism, and amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4b</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).

<title>Aze Addition to Seawater Mesocosms</title>
<p>To examine the influence of Aze as a potential carbon source or antimicrobial compound on marine microbial populations, surface seawater was collected and enriched for prokaryotes by size-fractionated filtration. Seawater mesocosms were supplemented with 100 μM Aze or an equivalent volume of Milli-Q water (see <italic>Methods</italic>) and incubated in the dark for 16 hours, after which DNA was extracted and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing was used to assess prokaryotic diversity. The total number of species (richness) was higher in Aze treated samples relative to T=16 hours control samples (Wilcox, <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.05), while the diversity of the microbial community was significantly lower (Wilcox, <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.05) in Aze-treated samples relative to controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>).

<title>Aze Addition to soil and infiltration into <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title>
<p>We hypothesized that Aze may have similar influences in rhizobial ecosystems as it did in marine ecosystems, particularly its influence on soil microbial community composition. Potting soil was amended with 100 μM Aze, suberic acid or an equivalent volume of Milli-Q water and incubated in the dark for 16 hours at 24°C. The C<sub>8</sub>-dicarboxylic acid suberic acid was used to ensure potential changes in the microbial community structure were specific to Aze. DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to assess prokaryotic diversity. Unlike seawater (Figure S4a), Aze-treated soil did not significantly alter the soil microbial community (Figure S4b), which suggests a fundamental difference compared to seawater. Because Aze is known to prime the immune system in plants, a fundamentally different function from its role in diatoms where it modulates phycosphere microbial communities, we hypothesized that Aze may act indirectly on soil communities through the plant host.</p>
<p>Four-week-old <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> leaves were infiltrated with 500 µL of 1 mM Aze, suberic acid or an equivalent volume of MES buffer as a control and incubated for five days. Rhizosphere microbial communities were collected, DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to assess prokaryotic diversity. Aze-treated plants displayed lower diversity and richness indices compared to controls (MES buffer and suberic acid) (Figure S5a), though these trends were not statistically significant. Taxonomic classification at the family level revealed a highly diverse microbial community across all samples (Figure S6a), but Aze- treated plants showed a distinct root microbiome compared to controls (PERMANOVA, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; Figure S5b). Differential abundance analysis with DESeq2 (<italic>p</italic>-adj&lt;0.05) identified 75 and 78 ASVs enriched between Aze vs MES controls and Aze vs suberic acid controls, respectively (Figures S6b and S6c). Interestingly, many of the enriched ASVs belonged to typical rhizobial symbionts, such as Azospirillaceae and Rhizobiaceae. These findings suggest that Aze does not directly influence the soil microbiome but acts indirectly by priming the immune system of <italic>A. thaliana,</italic> which ultimately modifies rhizosphere composition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Aze is a ubiquitous metabolite produced endogenously by photosynthetic organisms. It was recently revealed that Aze production by a ubiquitous diatom enables it to selectively promote growth of its bacterial symbionts while simultaneously inhibiting growth of opportunists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. In addition, plants use Aze to prime their immune system in response to phytopathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Its toxic effects against the acne-causing bacterium, <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, popularized its use in skin care products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Aze has also been shown to have antitumor effects on cancerous cells, and functions as a competitive inhibitor of mitochondrial oxidoreductases and steroid biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The ability of a single metabolite to selectively inhibit or promote different populations of bacteria simultaneously poses important questions about how this metabolite evolved in the eukaryotic chemical repertoire to influence their microbiome and its role in unicellular vs multicellular phototrophs.</p>
<p>Identifying Aze as a putative substrate of a TRAP transporter system is a novel and exciting result. Despite numerous attempts, our efforts to knock-out <italic>azeTSL</italic> in <italic>Phycobacter</italic> failed. Information about bacterial transporters and their substrates remain speculative, and much less is known about substrate specificity for bacterial TRAP transporters than other transporters, such as ABC transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. TRAP transporters consist of a substrate-binding domain and two transmembrane segments (large and small permeases), while lacking the canonical nucleotide-binding domain found in ABC transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Recognized substrates for TRAP transporters vary from sugars, mono- and di-carboxylates, organosulfur molecules, heterocyclic carboxylates, and amino acids. Among dicarboxylates, only C<sub>4</sub>-compounds, such as succinate, fumarate, and malate, have been identified as substrates for TRAP transporters, which explains the prevalent annotation of <italic>“C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate transporter”</italic> for proteins in bacterial genomes, including <italic>Phycobacter</italic>. Other than C<sub>6</sub>-adipate that binds with high affinity to a tripartite tricarboxylate transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], it is not known how dicarboxylates with &gt;4 carbons are taken up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. This makes AzeTSL a putative transporter of the longest chain dicarboxylate molecule known to date. The sheer abundance of dicarboxylate transporters in bacterial genomes begs the question of whether they transport a variety of C<sub>n</sub>-dicarboxylates, such as C<sub>5</sub>-glutarate, C<sub>6</sub>-adipate, C<sub>7</sub>-pimelate, C<sub>8</sub>-suberate, C<sub>9</sub>-azelate and C<sub>10</sub>-sebacate. Some of these metabolites are produced by primary producers and thus potentially serve as growth factors or signals for heterotrophic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Therefore, further work is needed to expand on the nature of substrates specific to dicarboxylate TRAP transporters.</p>
<p>We have shown that while <italic>Phycobacter</italic> uses fatty acid degradation and subsequently glyoxylate, dicarboxylate, and butanoate metabolism pathways to catabolize Aze, <italic>A. macleodii</italic> attempts to mitigate the toxicity of Aze by cytoplasm efflux and by downregulating its ribosome and protein synthesis pathways (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). However, the fact that <italic>A. macleodii</italic> possesses a complete fatty acid degradation pathway similar to bacteria that display inhibition by Aze is intriguing, as it is unclear why such bacteria cannot catabolize this metabolite. The answer may lie in the fact that <italic>Phycobacter</italic>, and bacteria that catabolize Aze such as <italic>P. nitroreducens</italic>, possess the transcriptional factor AzeR. Using RIF analysis, we have shown that <italic>azeR</italic> in <italic>Phycobacter</italic> putatively regulates its fatty acid degradation pathway and <italic>azeTSL</italic>, along with other pathways essential for the catabolism of Aze (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). By activating uptake, fatty acid degradation and other essential genes, AzeR enables bacteria to efficiently metabolize Aze. In contrast, bacteria deficient in AzeR, such as <italic>A. macleodii,</italic> are presumably unable to activate these pathways rapidly and thus fall susceptible to the toxic effects of Aze. Nevertheless, <italic>A. macleodii</italic> likely uses efflux pumps and the activation of a variety of stress-related pathways mediated by the transcriptional factor XRE (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>) to recover from Aze-dependent toxicity in a relatively short period of time. While Aze exhibits a wide range of inhibitory activity, in <italic>A. macleodii,</italic> ribosome and/or protein synthesis inhibition seem to contribute to the toxicity associated with Aze, evidenced by the strong downregulation of most ribosomal protein coding genes, protein synthesis genes and proteases. This finding agrees with previous studies that demonstrated the bacteriostatic effects of Aze on protein, DNA and RNA synthesis in <italic>P. acnes</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Aze addition to seawater mesocosms induced a statistically significant increase in the relative abundance of taxa that are capable of assimilating Aze compared to controls. Rhodobacteraceae ASVs comprised the most abundant group to be influenced by Aze additions, highlighting their adaptation to phytoplankton exudates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], while MG II archaea ASVs exhibited the largest enrichment relative to controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>). While we cannot discount competitive interactions from inducing the significant enrichment of MG II archaea ASVs, the possibility that Aze may be a growth substrate for this important group is intriguing. The MG II archaea (<italic>Candidatus</italic> Poseidoniales) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] remain uncultivated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], hindering our understanding of their metabolic capacity, though isotope probing and metagenomic analysis showed its assimilation of phytoplankton-derived substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Several MG II genera exhibited chemotaxis towards phytoplankton exudates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and displayed significant correlations to chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> in an oceanographic time-series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Further work is needed to confirm the link, if any, between Euryarchaeota and Aze. In soil, Aze primes the plant immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], which likely drives the production of a myriad of metabolites that modulate the rhizosphere microbiome. Indeed, introducing Aze directly to soil had negligible effect on the soil microbiome, while Aze introduction to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> appears to cause significant changes to the rhizosphere composition that may reflect complex interactions between the host and rhizosphere microbes (Figure S6). Further work is needed to clarify the mechanisms enabling plants to modulate rhizosphere microbiomes through Aze.</p>
<p>In summary, photosynthetically derived secondary metabolites play a significant role in structuring microalgal and plant microbiomes. In the oceans, they are hypothesized to influence algal blooms, succession of microbial populations and global biogeochemical cycles. However, the perception and response of these metabolites in microbial heterotrophs remain largely unknown. This study set out to unravel the molecular mechanisms of Aze on bacteria that enables eukaryotic hosts to modulate their associated microbiome. More broadly, we demonstrate that bacterial lineages occupying different ecosystems, such as the phycosphere surrounding microalgal cells, may have gained an ecological advantage over others by evolving mechanisms that assimilate Aze. These findings expand understanding of bacterial TRAP- transporters and their potential substrates, while also highlighting the importance of linking ubiquitous transporter systems to chemical currencies identified in the ocean. While Aze assimilation represents an important mechanism to structure the microbiome of primary producers, it is likely one of many such metabolites that together work in concert to ensure the maintenance of healthy microbial communities, which ultimately influence higher trophic levels and control global biogeochemical cycling.</p>

The results were converted to <sup>13</sup>C fractions prior recalculation of the uptakes of azelaic acid using EasyIsoCalculator spreadsheet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].</p>

<title>Seawater mesocosms and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing</title>
<p>Seawater samples were collected in July 2021 from surface waters off the coast of Saadiyat Island (24°38’28.6&quot;N 54°27’09.4&quot;E), United Arab Emirates, kept in the dark, and immediately brought back to the lab. The seawater was filtered through a 1.2-μm filter (Whatman, UK) to remove most phytoplankton and divided into 12 vessels each containing 30 mL to carry out a mesocosm experiment. Control replicates (<italic>n</italic>=4 at T=0 hours) were immediately filtered onto a 0.2-μm filter (Whatman, UK) to capture microbial cells. Treatment replicates (<italic>n</italic>=4) with 100 μM Aze and another set of control replicates (<italic>n</italic>=4) with an equal volume of Milli-Q water added in lieu of Aze were incubated at 24°C for 16 hours in the dark (T=16 hours). We used 100 μM Aze in this case to avoid potential uptake, degradation, and precipitation of this molecule over the long course of the experiment. After incubation, they were immediately filtered onto a 0.2-μm filter (Whatman, UK). Genomic DNA was extracted immediately after filtration from all filters using the DNeasy PowerWater Kit (Qiagen) and sent to NovogeneAIT Genomics (Singapore) for 16S rRNA gene amplification using the 515F-Y (5′- GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 926R (5′-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT-3′) universal primers and paired-end (2x250 bp) sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (San Diego, CA) platform.</p>
<p>Clean raw reads were processed with the rANOMALY R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] using the DADA2 R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] to generate amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Taxonomic classification was based on the SILVA v138 database. Alpha-diversity was assessed using the richness indices; observed OTUs and Chao1, and diversity indices; Shannon and Simpson. Beta-diversity was assessed and visualized by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on pairwise Bray-Curtis distance and tested by the permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). The differential abundance of taxa across the treatment and control samples was calculated with DESeq2 v3.14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] with a <italic>p</italic>-adjusted value cutoff of &lt;0.05. All plots were generated using the ggplot2 and phylosmith [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] R packages and all statistical analyses were performed on R 4.1.2.</p>

<title>Soil supplementation, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Aze infusion, incubations and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing</title>
<p>Two hundred and fifty milligrams of potting soil (Planting Mix No.1; ACE Hardware) was supplemented with 300 µL of 100 µM Aze, suberic acid or Milli-Q water and incubated at 24°C, in the dark for 16 hours. Following incubation, the soil samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until DNA extraction.</p>
<p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seeds (Col-0) were sowed into potting soil and allowed to germinate under short day conditions (8 hours light/24°C and 16 hours dark/22°C) in a plant growth chamber (Fitoclima 600, Aralab, Rio de Mouro, Portugal). One-week old healthy seedlings (<italic>n</italic>=15) were transplanted into round pots containing ∼90 g of fresh potting soil, with one seedling per pot. Three additional pots were designated as “plant-free” that received no seedlings. Pots were covered with cling film for 48 hours to maintain humidity after transplantation. All pots (including plant-free controls) were spatially randomized in the growth chamber and allowed to grow for three additional weeks.</p>
<p>One millimole treatment stocks of Aze (Sigma-Aldrich) and suberic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared in 5 mM 2-(N-Morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) (pH 5.4) and filter sterilized through 0.2 µm Sterivex filters. Each plant was syringe-infiltrated with 500 µl Aze, suberic acid (equivalent to 2 µmol) or MES buffer (<italic>n</italic>=5 for each treatment) through the abaxial surface of three leaves. Infiltrated leaves were gently dried with absorbent paper and marked with a felt-tipped pen. Plant-free pots (<italic>n</italic>=3) were left untreated, and all pots were incubated for five days, as described above. Plants roots and plant-free controls were harvested, and the rhizosphere microbial communities were collected as described in Lebeis et al., 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>] with modifications. Briefly, above ground plant organs were removed, and loose soil was physically removed until ∼1 mm of soil remained on the root surface. Roots were placed in 25 mL sterile MES buffer in 50 mL centrifuge tubes. Rhizosphere microbial communities were collected by first vortexing the roots in MES buffer for 15 seconds at maximum speed and subsequently sonicating for 5 minutes using an Ultrasonic Cleaner (VWR) at power level 3 to liberate tightly adherent and endophytic microbes. The root system was removed aseptically, and the turbid solution was filtered through a 100 µm nylon filter to remove large debris and plant material. The filtrate was centrifuged at 3,200 × g for 30 minutes and most of the supernatant discarded. The pellet was resuspended in the remaining supernatant (∼200-400 µL) and transferred to sterile 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was removed, and the remaining pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until DNA extraction. For plant-free pots, approximately 250 mg of soil was collected 2 cm below the surface, transferred to MES buffer and processed and stored as described above.</p>
<p>Microbial genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and samples were sequenced at NovogeneAIT Genomics (Singapore) using 16S rRNA gene amplification using the primers 515F (5′- GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and paired-end (2x250bp) sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (San Diego, CA) platform.

<title>Transcriptional master regulator analysis</title>
<p>We used the regulatory impact factor (RIF) algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] to detect transcription factors (TFs) with high regulatory potential contributing to the observed transcriptional remodeling upon Aze uptake. RIF is designed to identify key regulatory loci contributing to transcriptome divergence between two biological conditions. Predicted TF lists were obtained from the genome annotation (GFF file) of both <italic>Phycobacter</italic> and <italic>A. macleodii</italic> and normalized data (variance stabilized, log<sub>2</sub>-transformed counts) of these genes were retrieved. The same normalization strategy was applied to the DE genes. An expression matrix containing normalized expression of the TF genes and DE genes were subjected to RIF analysis per species. RIF analysis identifies regulators that are consistently differentially co-expressed with highly abundant and highly DE genes (RIF1 metric) and regulators that have the most altered ability to act as predictors of the abundance of DE genes (RIF2 metric). TFs were considered significant when the RIF score deviates ±1.96 standard deviation from the mean (<italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05).</p>

<title>Transcriptional coexpression networks (TCNs)</title>
<p>The Partial Correlation and Information Theory (PCIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] has been extensively used for gene network analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. We utilized PCIT to detect significant connections (edges) between pairs of genes (nodes) while considering the influence of a third player (gene). PCIT calculates pairwise correlations between given gene pairs after considering all possible three- way combinations of genes (triads) present within a gene expression matrix. The algorithm calculates partial correlations after exploring all triads before determining the significance threshold that depends on the average ratio of partial and direct correlation. The set of key regulatory TFs (identified by RIF analysis) and DE genes per species were used for construction of the networks. Normalized data (variance stabilized, log<sub>2</sub>-transformed counts) of these genes were used for network construction. The PCIT-inferred networks were visualized using Cytoscape v3.9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. From these initial networks, we explored a series of subnetworks; first connections between nodes were considered when the partial correlation <italic>r</italic> was &gt;± 0.95. From these networks, hub genes (potential regulatory components within the network) and their connected genes (first neighbors) were extracted based on: 1) key regulatory factors (with highest RIF scores), 2) differential expression significance, and 3) degree centrality (the number of connections of a node with other nodes in the network).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Shibl et al., studied the possible role of dicarboxylate metabolite azelaic acid (Aze) in modulating the response of different bacteria, it was used as a carbon source by Phycobacter and possibly toxic for Alteromonas. The experiments were well conducted using transcriptomics, transcriptional factor coexpression networks, uptake experiments, and chemical methods to unravel the uptake, catabolism, and toxicity of Aze on these two bacteria. They identified a putative Aze TRAP transporter in bacteria and showed that Aze is assimilated through fatty acid degradation in Phycobacter. Meanwhile, in Alteromonas it is suggested that Aze inhibits the ribosome and/or protein synthesis, and that efflux pumps shuttles Aze outside the cytoplasm. Further on, they demonstrate that seawater amended with Aze selects for microbes that can catabolize Aze.</p>
<p>Major strengths:</p>
<p>
The manuscript is well written and very clear. Through the combination of gene expression, transcriptional factor co-expression networks, uptake experiments, and chemical methods Shibl et al., showed that Aze has a different response in two bacteria.</p>
<p>Major weakness:</p>
<p>
There is no confirmation of the Aze TRAP transporters through mutagenesis.</p>
<p>Impact on the field:</p>
<p>
Metabolites exert a significant influence on microbial communities in the ocean, playing a crucial role in their composition, dynamics, and biogeochemical cycles. This research highlights the intriguing capacity of a single metabolite to induce contrasting responses in distinct bacterial species, underscoring its role in shaping microbial interactions and ecosystem functions.</p>

<p>This study explores the breadth of effects of one important metabolite, azelaic acid, on marine microbes, and reveals in-depth its pathway of uptake and catabolism in one model bacterial strain. This compound is known to be widely produced by phytoplankton and plants, and to have complex effects on associated microbiomes.</p>
<p>This work uses transcriptomics to assay the response of two strains that show contrasting responses to the metabolite: one catabolizes the compound and assimilates the carbon, while the other shows growth inhibition and stress response. A highly induced TRAP transporter, adjacent to a previously identified regulator, is inferred to be the specific uptake system for azelaic acid. However the transport function was not directly tested via genetic or biochemical methods. Nevertheless, this is a significant finding that will be useful for exploring the distribution of azelaic acid uptake capability across metagenomes and other bacteria.</p>
<p>The authors use pulse-chase style metabolomics experiments to beautifully demonstrate the fate of azelaic acid through catabolic pathways. They also measure an assimilation rate per cell, though it remains unclear how this measured rate relates to natural systems. The metabolomics approach is an elegant way to show carbon flux through cells, and could serve as a model for future studies.</p>
<p>The study seeks to extend the results from two model strains to complex communities, using seawater mesocosm experiments and soil/Arabidopsis experiments. The seawater experiments show a community shift in mesocosms with added azelaic acid. However, the mechanisms for the shift were not determined; further work is necessary to demonstrate which community members are directly assimilating the compound vs. benefitting indirectly or experiencing inhibition. In my opinion the soil and Arabidopsis experiments are quite preliminary. I appreciate the authors' desire to broaden the scope beyond marine systems, but I believe any conclusions regarding different modes of action in aquatic vs terrestrial microbial communities are speculative at this stage.</p>
<p>This work is a nice illustration of how we can begin to tease apart the effects of chemical currencies on marine ecosystems. A key strength of this work is the combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics methods, along with assaying the impacts of the metabolite on both model strains of bacteria and whole communities. Given the sheer number of compounds that probably play critical roles in community interactions, a key challenge for the field will be navigating the tradeoffs between breadth and depth in future studies of metabolite impacts. This study offers a good compromise and will be a useful model for future studies.</p>
