<title>Abstract</title><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) is the most common approach to observe global binding of proteins to DNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. The occupancy of transcription factors (TFs) from ChIP-seq agrees well with an alternative method, chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC-seq2). However, ChIP-seq and ChEC-seq2 reveal strikingly diUerent patterns of enrichment of yeast RNA polymerase II. We hypothesized that this reflects distinct populations of RNAPII, some of which are captured by ChIP-seq and some of which are captured by ChEC-seq2. RNAPII association with enhancers and promoters - predicted from biochemical studies - is detected well by ChEC-seq2 but not by ChIP-seq. Enhancer/promoter bound RNAPII correlates with transcription levels and matches predicted occupancy based on published rates of enhancer recruitment, preinitiation assembly, initiation, elongation and termination. The occupancy from ChEC-seq2 allowed us to develop a stochastic model for global kinetics of RNAPII transcription which captured both the ChEC-seq2 data and changes upon chemical-genetic perturbations to transcription. Finally, RNAPII ChEC-seq2 and kinetic modeling suggests that a mutation in the Gcn4 transcription factor that blocks interaction with the NPC destabilizes promoter-associated RNAPII without altering its recruitment to the enhancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotes, diUerential expression of the genome is achieved primarily through regulated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription. Since its discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Roeder and Rutter, 1969</xref>), transcription by RNAPII has been the focus of intense study using a variety of methods. From biochemical, structural and genetic studies, a consensus has emerged for the mechanism of RNAPII transcription (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Schier and Taatjes, 2020</xref>). For genes that are dependent on enhancers, sequence-specific transcription factors (ssTFs) bind to enhancers and recruit co-activators like histone acetyltransferases and chromatin remodelers as well as Mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fishburn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Green, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Prochasson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Ptashne and Gann, 1997</xref>). Co-activators facilitate the removal of nucleosomes from the promoter, allowing binding of TFIID (TATA binding protein), which recruits additional general transcription factors (GTFs; TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIF) and ultimately RNAPII (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Last, TFIIE and TFIIH are recruited to complete the formation of the preinitiation complex (PIC). Through Mediator, ssTFs interact with RNAPII to stabilize the PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdella et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Richter et al., 2022</xref>). Transcription is initiated by unwinding of the DNA by TFIIH as well as phosphorylation of the RNAPII carboxyl terminal domain by TFIIH kinase (Cdk7; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, inset; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cadena and Dahmus, 1987</xref>; P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Komarnitsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lu et al., 1991</xref>). In metazoans, regulatory factors (negative elongation factor and DRB-sensitive factor, DSIF) cause RNAPII to pause after initiation, leading to an accumulation of RNAPII downstream of the transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adelman and Lis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Core and Adelman, 2019</xref>). The P-TEF-b kinase releases RNAPII from pausing by phosphorylation of these factors and RNAPII, leading to elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Marshall and Price, 1995</xref>). Finally, transcription of a polyadenylation sequence both causes RNAPII to pause and simulates cleavage and polyadenylation by Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nag et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Orozco et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<p>Two alternative mechanisms of RNAPII recruitment are shown: 1) direct recruitment to the promoter and 2) recruitment to the UASs facilitated by a ssTFs and coactivators such as Mediator, followed by transfer to the promoter. After RNAPII associates with the promoter, TFIIH is recruited, leading to phosphorylation of Serine 5 (inset) in the carboxyl terminal domain by the TFIIH-associated kinase Kin28 and initiation. RNAPII elongation through the transcribed region is associated with phosphorylation of Serine 2 in the carboxyl terminal domain. RNAPII pauses over the terminator during cleavage and polyadenylation before dissociating. Image created with BioRender.</p></caption>

<p>To study transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>, the most common approach has been chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), in which protein-DNA complexes are stabilized through formaldehyde crosslinking and recovered by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Solomon et al., 1988</xref>). Coupled with next generation sequencing, ChIP-seq has been widely adopted to explore the genome-wide interactions of RNAPII and co-regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Welboren et al., 2009</xref>). The occupancy of RNAPII over transcribed regions correlates with nascent transcription. Exonuclease foot printing of RNAPII over DNA (ChIP-exo; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</xref>) or RNA (NET-seq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>) and nuclear run-on (PRO-seq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>) have provided high resolution of maps of RNAPII binding to the genome. Together, such methods highlight paused and elongating RNAPII and suggest that very little RNAPII is associated with the promoter in the preinitiation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Core et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The dynamics of RNAPII transcription <italic>in vivo</italic> has also been explored by tracking single molecules of RNAPII (or co-regulators) or individual transcripts. Such experiments oUer a diUerent view of transcription. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) over arrays of inducible reporter genes reveals that a small fraction (∼13%) of the RNAPII molecules that assemble at the promoter initiates transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Darzacq et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Stasevich et al., 2014</xref>). Monitoring the production of single molecules of mRNA from either such arrays or single genes suggests that RNAPII elongation rate is ∼1000-3000 bp/min and that termination is associated with a prolonged pause (50-70s; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Larson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>). Single molecule tracking of RNAPII and GTFs reveals that ∼40% of RNAPII is chromatin-associated and that when initiation is blocked, the dwell time of RNAPII (presumably at the promoter) is ∼ 10s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>). Because these observations would predict that RNAPII levels at the promoter and terminator (as well as pausing sites) should be higher than those over the transcribed region, they are diUicult to reconcile with the RNAPII enrichments observed by ChIP-seq.</p>
<p>Single molecule tracking of ssTF and RNAPII binding to enhancers and promoters <italic>in vitro</italic> oUers another important perspective. In yeast nuclear extracts, ssTF binding to enhancers (also called upstream activating sequences, UASs) has been observed. Consistent with the consensus model, ssTFs stimulate RNAPII and PIC recruitment to a neighboring promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Rosen et al., 2020</xref>). Surprisingly, RNAPII and certain PIC components are recruited by ssTFs even in the absence of a promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baek et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that RNAPII is recruited to chromatin by ssTFs, perhaps through interactions with Mediator, and that recruitment to UASs allows eUicient promoter loading of PIC components. However, the association of RNAPII and PIC factors with UASs has not been observed by ChIP-seq.</p>
<p>An alternative to ChIP is chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC), in which endogenous proteins of interest are tagged with micrococcal nuclease (MNase; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Schmid et al., 2004</xref>). Their association with the genome can be monitored by permeabilizing cells and addition of calcium to activate MNase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Schmid et al., 2004</xref>). The cleavage sites can be identified by next generation sequencing (ChEC-seq2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">VanBelzen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zentner et al., 2015</xref>). For ssTFs and nuclear pore proteins, ChEC-seq2 gives results very similar to ChIP-seq or ChIP-exo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ge et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">VanBelzen et al., 2024</xref>). Likewise, ChEC-seq2 with co-activators and Mediator resembles ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bruzzone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Grünberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Saleh et al., 2022</xref>). However, we find that ChEC-seq2 with RNAPII gives a pattern of enrichment that was notably diUerent from that observed using ChIP-seq. Whereas ChIP shows strong enrichment of RNAPII over the transcribed region and little enrichment over the promoter or upstream, ChEC-seq2 showed strong enrichment of RNAPII over the promoter, UAS and 3’UTR and little signal over the transcribed region. The ChEC-seq2 enrichment of RNAPII over promoters correlated with both nascent transcription and ChIP-seq enrichment of RNAPII over coding regions, suggesting that it reflects active RNAPII. RNAPII association with UAS regions was strongest for genes that recruit co-activators and was dependent on ssTFs.</p>
<p>The occupancy of RNAPII over UASs and promoters from ChEC-seq2, combined with published RNAPII dynamics, allowed us to develop a Stochastic model for the global kinetics of RNAPII transcription. This model and ChEC-seq2 data oUer insight into the eUects of genetic perturbations that block transcription globally and suggests that the nuclear pore complex promotes transcription by stabilizing promoter-associated RNAPII. This work suggests that ChEC captures important regulatory events associated with transcription that are missed by ChIP.</p>

<title>ChEC-seq2 and ChIP-seq with RNA Polymerase II yield distinct enrichment patterns</title>
<p>To assess ChEC-seq2 with RNAPII, MNase was inserted at the carboxyl terminus of the endogenous genes encoding the RNAPII subunits Rpo21 (also called Rpb1) and Rpb3. These strains, along with a control strain expressing soluble, nuclear MNase (sMNase) were grown in rich medium, harvested and permeabilized to induce MNase activity. Genomic DNA was prepared and converted into ChEC-seq2 libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">VanBelzen et al., 2024</xref>). For comparison, we selected a high-quality RNAPII ChIP-seq dataset from cells grown in rich medium Rpb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Vijjamarri et al., 2023b</xref>; GEO Accession GSE220578) that used the 8WG16 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Thompson et al., 1989</xref>), which recognizes the carboxyl terminal domain of Rpb1 (Philip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Komarnitsky et al., 2000</xref>). Over transcriptionally active genes like <italic>ILV5</italic>, ChIP-seq gave strong enrichment of Rpb1 over the transcribed region and terminator and low enrichment over the enhancer/upstream activating sequence (UAS) and the promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. 1<sup>st</sup> row). In contrast, ChEC-seq2 with either Rpb1 or Rpb3 showed strong enrichment at the UAS, promoter, and terminator of <italic>ILV5</italic> and a low enrichment over the transcribed region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> rows; compare with sMNase in black). However, over the repressed <italic>GAL1-10</italic> locus, both ChIP-seq and ChEC-seq2 show background enrichment for RNAPII (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, right). Notably, sMNase cleavage over <italic>GAL1-10</italic> reflects both unprotected linkers between well-positioned nucleosomes and nucleosome depletion upstream of promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chereji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lee et al., 2004</xref>); <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, right). This pattern was unrelated to the trimming of mapped reads to the first base pair (untrimmed tracks in <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 1A</xref>) or the normalization of transcript length used in metagene plots (enrichment over promoters and the 5’ end of genes in <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - supplement 1B</xref>; see Methods). Globally, while both ChIP-seq and ChEC-seq2 showed positive Spearman correlation with nascent transcription, diUerent regions of genes correlated best with nascent mRNA (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 1C</xref>). Nascent transcription correlated best with the enrichment of RNAPII over the promoter from ChEC-seq2 and the enrichment of RNAPII over the transcribed region from ChIP-seq was most strongly correlated with nascent transcription. Thus, both ChIP-seq and ChEC-seq2 with RNAPII show enrichments that correlate with transcriptional activity, but these two methods reveal complementary interaction patterns.</p>

<p>DiUerent classes of RNAPII-transcribed yeast genes show distinct mechanisms of transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>). To more precisely define the diUerences between ChIP and ChEC, we compared ChIP-seq with ChEC-seq2 over three such classes: 1) genes that bind sequence-specific transcription factors (ssTFs) and coactivators such as <underline>S</underline>AGA, <underline>T</underline>up1, <underline>M</underline>ediator, SWI/SNF (STM), 2) genes bound to ssTFs but not coactivators (transcription factors <underline>o</underline>nly, TFO) and 3) a set of 330 genes that showed no detectable nascent transcription (Rep). Because diUerent classes of genes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rossi et al., 2021</xref> are expressed at diUerent levels (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 1D</xref>), the most highly expressed 150 genes from the STM and TFO classes were analyzed. Metagene plots of mean RNAPII ChIP-seq over each of these sets of genes reveal strong enrichment over the transcribed region for the STM genes and, to some extent, for the TFO genes, with a notable dip over the promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, left). Metagene plots of RNAPII ChEC-seq2 showed a strong enrichment over the promoter for both STM and TFO genes and over the UAS for STM genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, middle &amp; right). RNAPII was not enriched over repressed genes by ChIP-seq or ChEC-seq2.</p>
<p>To better understand the ChEC patterns upstream of transcription start sites, mean cleavage by RNAPII was plotted at higher resolution by aligning to 597 high-confidence TATA boxes upstream of expressed genes (based on SLAM-seq), oriented so that the TSS is 50bp ± 39bp to the right (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; ± 250bp). Because sMNase cleaves the TATA boxes strongly (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-supplement 1E</xref>) - reflecting either increased accessibility or the T/A sequence preference of sMNase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Dingwall et al., 1981</xref>; Horz et al., 1981) - we subtracted the sMNase cleavage from specific cleavage frequency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Both Rpb1-MN and Rpb3-MN produced cleavage peaks ∼17bp upstream and ∼35bp downstream of the TATA box, although their relative intensities were diUerent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, Rpb1 ChIP-seq signal was low over the TATA and TSS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>The ChEC-seq2 signal for RNAPII over the UAS region correlates with recruitment of coactivators upstream of STM genes, but not upstream of TFO genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, middle &amp; right), arguing that it is not an artifact of nearby promoters or genes. To better understand the ChEC-seq2 signal over promoters and UAS regions, we mapped proteins expected to interact with the promoter (preinitiation complex (PIC) components TFIIA (Toa2) and TFIIE (Tfa1)) or the UAS (the Rap1 ssTF and Mediator). For this comparison, we selected 287 STM genes near high-confidence Rap1 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">VanBelzen et al., 2024</xref>). While the PIC complex interacted strongly with the promoter region of both STM and TFO genes, Rap1 and Mediator interacted strongly with the UAS region of STM genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Rap1 and Mediator also showed a low level of enrichment upstream of the promoter region of TFO genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, ChEC-seq2 of PIC components shows promoter enrichment, while ChEC-seq2 with TFs and Mediator shows UAS enrichment.</p>
<p>When mapped over TATA sites, TFIIA (Toa2-MN) produced a major cleavage peak ∼12bp upstream and a minor peak ∼12bp downstream from the TATA box (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). TFIIE (Tfa1-MN) showed the strongest peak ∼34bp downstream of the TATA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These data suggest that ChEC-seq2 reflects the arrangement of TFIIA, RNAPII and TFIIE within the preinitiation complex: TFIIA interacts with DNA immediately upstream of TBP, RNAPII binds on both sides of TBP and TFIIE binds downstream of TBP (Supplementary movie 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aibara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schilbach et al., 2021</xref>). Also, consistent with an ordered assembly of the PIC, the peak of TFIIA cleavage 12bp downstream of the TATA box is absent/shifted downstream in the RNAPII and TFIIE ChEC data, suggesting that TFIIA binds before RNAPII and TFIIE during PIC assembly and that this site becomes protected when RNAPII and TFIIE join (Supplementary movie 1). Together, these data suggest that ChEC-seq2 captures both UAS-associated RNAPII and the preinitiation complex.</p>
<p>Given the dramatic diUerence between ChEC-seq2 and ChIP-seq, we next asked if either pattern is consistent with the dynamics of transcription as described in the literature. Because <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lacks promoter-proximal pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Booth et al., 2016</xref>) and has few intron-containing genes that require splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Stajich et al., 2007</xref>), these slow elongation steps are expected to be absent. Therefore, RNAPII initiation and pausing during termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hyman and Moore, 1993</xref>) would represent relatively slow steps compared with the rate of elongation. Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in yeast suggest promoter dwell times in the range of approximately 5-20 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baek et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>) a termination time of up to 70 s and an elongation rate between 1000-3000 bp/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Larson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>). Using these ranges, we calculated the predicted RNAPII occupancy over the promoter, the transcribed region and the terminator for the typical transcribed yeast gene (see Methods; median size of transcribed region = 1.2kb; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>). Of 24 combinations of dwell times and elongation rates tested, 21 predicted higher occupancy at the promoter than over the transcribed region and 21 predicted higher occupancy at terminators than over the transcribed region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). None of the 24 predicted the strong signal over the transcribed region with promoter depletion characteristic of ChIP-seq. This suggests that ChIP-seq is unable to detect functionally important RNAPII interactions at the promoter and UAS that are detected ChEC-seq2.</p>

<title>ChEC-seq2 detects elongating and phosphorylated RNA Polymerase II</title>
<p>Next, we performed ChEC-seq2 with the kinases involved in initiation and elongation, as well as the elongation factor Spt5 (part of DSIF). Phosphorylation of the carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII regulates its activity and the association of factors involved in splicing, histone modification, RNA processing. Initiation correlates with phosphorylation of Ser5 of the CTD by Kin28 (Cdk7/TFIIH kinase; (Philip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Komarnitsky et al., 2000</xref>). Elongation is coupled with phosphorylation of Ser2 by Ctk1 (P-TEF-b; CTDK-I; Cdk9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cho et al., 2001</xref>) and Bur1 (P-TEFb; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Qiu et al., 2009</xref>), and the association of Spt4/5 (DSIF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hartzog et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Kin28-MN, Ctk1-MN and Spt5-MN showed strong cleavage over active genes and little enrichment over inactive genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). All three proteins showed maximum cleavage over the promoters of active genes. Kin28 showed significant enrichment over the UAS region of STM genes that was absent from TFO genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, left). The elongation factor Spt5 showed enrichment over both as well as the transcribed region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, right). In contrast, Ctk1-MN cleavage was primarily localized to promoters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, middle). Higher resolution mapping aligned to TATA boxes confirmed that, while Rpb1 shows peaks of cleavage upstream and downstream of TATA, Kin28, Ctk1 and Spt5 show a single peak downstream, near the TSS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, the signal upstream of the TATA was greatest for Kin28, followed by Ctk1 and then Spt5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This suggests that, while Rpb1 shows interactions at the TSS and upstream, factors involved in initiation and elongation are more enriched with the TSS and over the transcribed region.</p>

<p>To confirm that the ChEC cleavage pattern by Kin28 and Ctk1 reflects their activity, we developed a method to measure RNAPII phosphorylation by ChEC-seq2. Two single chain IgG fragments that recognize phosphorylated Ser2 (Ser2p) RNAPII CTD or phosphorylated Ser5 (Ser5p) RNAPII CTD (Mintbodies) have been expressed as GFP- and SNAP-tagged fusions and shown to localize at transcriptionally active loci in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ohishi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Uchino et al., 2021</xref>). We constructed Mintbody-MNase (Mb-MN) fusions to detect these phosphorylated forms of RNAPII (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>; α-Ser2p-MN and α-Ser5p MN). Because binding phosphorylated CTD could compete for critical interactions with RNAPII, we tested several promoters to identify an expression level that produced the smallest growth defect (not shown). Strains expressing the Mb-MNs from the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter had a minimal growth defect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) and cleaved chromatin upon permeabilizing cells and addition of calcium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-supplementary Figure S2A). Both α-Ser5p -MN and α-Ser2p-MN give patterns very similar to those produced by their respective kinases; Ser5p was more enriched over promoters and UAS regions, while Ser2p was more evident in the transcribed region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> &amp; F). To compare these patterns, we normalized mean cleavage over promoters, UAS regions, transcribed regions and 3’UTR regions by each Mb-MN (or sMNase) to that by Rpb1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Ser5p and Ser2p levels were lower than Rpb1 over the UAS and promoter, but higher than Rpb1 over the transcript and 3’UTR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Furthermore, the levels of Ser2p were lower than those of Ser5p over the UAS and promoter and higher than those of Ser5p over the transcript (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Thus, ChEC-seq2 can reveal RNAPII recruitment, initiation and elongation during transcription.</p>

<title>Global transcriptional changes are detected by ChEC-seq2</title>
<p>To further validate the biological significance of RNAPII ChEC-seq2, we examined an environmental perturbation that results in a large-scale transcriptional change. Cells exposed to 10% ethanol in growth medium show widespread changes in transcription, downregulating hundreds of genes enriched for those involved in ribosome biogenesis (GO: 0042254; blue in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) and upregulating genes enriched for chaperones (GO: 0009266; red in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). ChEC-seq2 using Rpb1-MN, Kin28-MN, Ctk1-MN, α-Ser5p-MN and α-Ser2Pp -MN captures these changes. These proteins showed increased enrichment over <italic>HSP104</italic> following ethanol treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Like <italic>HSP104</italic>, metagene plots for the average change in cleavage induced by ethanol stress showed increased cleavage by Rpb1-MN, Kin28-MN, Ctk1-MN as well as their products Ser5p and Ser2p over the top 100 induced genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> &amp; D, left). Notably, over the transcribed region, enrichment was higher at the 3’ end, especially for Ctk1-MN (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> &amp; D, left). In contrast, metagene plots of the average change in cleavage over the 137 ribosomal protein genes showed strong decreases in cleavage by all of these proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> &amp; D, right). The changes in sMNase cleavage were generally the opposite of what we observed with the specific proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> &amp; D, black trace/column). Thus, ChEC-seq2 can capture biologically relevant changes in RNAPII association, its regulators and its phosphorylation states that reflect large-scale changes in global transcription.</p>

<title>RNAPII ChEC-seq2 upon chemical-genetic perturbations of transcription</title>
<p>Next, we tested the eUect of blocking either PIC formation or initiation on RNAPII/PIC occupancy by ChEC-seq2. PIC formation was blocked by depleting TFIIB using auxin-induced degradation (Sua7-AID; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) and initiation was inhibited by treating an analog-sensitive allele of Kin28 (<italic>kin28-is</italic>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rodríguez-Molina et al., 2016</xref>) with the ATP analog CMK.

TFIIB depletion did not strongly aUect sMNase cleavage over the promoters of STM genes and showed a distinct shift in cleavage near promoters of TFO genes from the TSS downstream (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Neither Rpb1-MN nor sMNase cleavage over repressed genes was altered by TFIIB depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).

<p>Higher resolution mapping of RNAPII (Rpb1-MN), TFIIA (Toa2-MN) and TFIIE (Tfa1-MN) cleavage over TATA boxes revealed that, upon TFIIB depletion, TFIIA occupancy shifted from the major upstream peak to the downstream peak (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). RNAPII and TFIIE peaks near the TATA and TSS were lost (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). This supports the notion that the downstream peak of TFIIA is lost upon RNAPII/PIC binding. Furthermore, the cleavage by Rpb1 upstream of the TATA box was unaUected by depletion of TFIIB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, middle), suggesting that TFIIB is required for proper PIC formation over the promoter, but is not required for association with upstream UAS elements.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we mapped RNAPII (Rpb1-MN) cleavage over 896 high-confidence sites for the ssTF Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">VanBelzen et al., 2024</xref>). Rap1 regulates hundreds of highly expressed genes and RNAPII ChEC-seq2 showed strong enrichment flanking Rap1 sites, while sMNase did not (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Depletion of TFIIB had no significant eUect on RNAPII occupancy over Rap1 sites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, RNAPII recruitment to the promoter is dependent on TFIIB, while RNAPII recruitment to the UAS is not.</p>
<p>Inhibition of <italic>kin28-is</italic> with CMK also lead to a strong decrease of RNAPII over the promoter, transcribed region and 3’UTR, especially for the STM genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). As expected, this was associated with a strong decrease of Ser5 phosphorylation and Ser2 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Cleavage by α-Ser5p-MN was most strongly decreased at the promoter, while cleavage by α-Ser2p-MN was most strongly decreased at the 3’ end of the transcript. No changes in cleavage were identified at repressed genes. We also observed a decrease of RNAPII cleavage over 597 TATA boxes near expressed genes, but not as strong as that observed upon depletion of TFIIB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). Thus, inhibition of Kin28 led to an apparent decrease in total RNAPII and its Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylated forms from highly expressed genes.</p>

<title>Developing a kinetic model for transcription based on ChEC-seq2 RNAPII occupancy</title>
<p>Because ChEC-seq2 provides information about important regulatory steps that have not been evident from previous global studies, we asked if we could use these data to develop a model for the global kinetics of RNAPII transcription. Steady-state occupancy of RNAPII should reflect the rates of several steps: RNAPII recruitment to the UAS and/or promoter, PIC assembly, initiation, elongation and termination. We developed a stochastic computational model for these steps (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) by fixing rates that have been experimentally determined (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>5</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>6</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>7</sub>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and optimizing the remaining rates to fit to the RNAPII occupancy observed from either ChIP-seq or ChEC-seq2. To capture the distinct mechanisms of RNAPII recruitment, we modeled the STM and TFO gene classes separately: for the STM class, we assumed that all RNAPII is recruited first to the UAS (reflecting <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>) before being transferred to the promoter (reflecting <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>); for the TFO class, RNAPII is recruited directly to the promoter (reflecting <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>). In genes with a UAS, such as the STM class of genes, RNAPII is recruited nearly exclusively to the UAS through ssTFs and coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baek et al., 2021</xref>), and we therefore omit RNAPII recruitment to the promoter (<italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>) the STM model. We additionally incorporated the possibility of dissociation from the UAS (reflecting <italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub>, STM class) and promoter (reflecting <italic>k</italic><sub>-3</sub>, both classes), as well as the possibility of reversal from promoter to UAS (reflecting <italic>k</italic><sub>-2</sub>, STM class).</p>

Instead, the average predicted occupancy from an equal number of the top-performing ChIP-seq models as used in ChEC-seq2 simulations (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 789 for STM and 371 for TFO) was used to generate the predictions shown (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). <bold>(C, D)</bold> The average change in Rpb1-MN by ChEC-seq2 at each gene-region following conditional depletion or inactivation of PIC components (purple) for 1143 TFO-class genes and 643 STM-class genes that are expressed in SDC is shown.

<p>Fitting to the RNAPII occupancy from ChIP-seq or ChEC-seq over diUerent regions (UAS, promoter, transcribed region or 3’UTR), we identified the optimal range of values for the undefined rates (<italic>i.e.</italic>, <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>-2</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>-3</sub>, and <italic>k</italic><sub>4</sub>), producing an ensemble of best-fit models (Figure S5). Agreement between the models and the data was measured using cosine similarity (Methods). The models trained on the ChEC-seq2 occupancy for either the TFO or STM genes showed excellent agreement with the data (cosine similarity &gt; 0.995; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, top &amp; <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – supplement 1A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Optimal agreement between the models and ChEC-seq data was achieved by using the lower bound for dwell time at the terminator from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Larson et al., 2011</xref> (30 seconds; <italic>k</italic><sub>7</sub> = 0.0325 s<sup>-1</sup>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Importantly, the rates that are shared between the two types of models are identical (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, modeling RNAPII occupancy data from ChEC-seq2 produced a range of plausible values for the rates of transcription that agrees well with the empirical data (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the published rates, neither model was able to find rates for the other steps that produced occupancy that matched that observed by ChIP-seq (<italic>i.e.</italic>, there were no models with cosine similarity &gt; 0.9; <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – supplement 1B</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). The best ChIP-seq models predicted RNAPII occupancy over all regions that was significantly diUerent from that observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, bottom). By varying the published rates as well, the model could produce the occupancies observed by ChIP-seq (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – supplement 1E</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). However, this required eliminating dissociation from the promoter (<italic>k</italic><sub>-3</sub>), increasing the initiation rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>5</sub>) two-fold with instantaneous recruitment of TFIIH (<italic>k</italic><sub>4</sub>) and increasing the termination rate ∼4.3-fold above the maximum published rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>7</sub> = 0.14 s<sup>-1</sup>; <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – supplement 1 E</xref>, inset table). Thus, although it is possible to model the RNAPII occupancy observed by ChIP-seq, the predicted rates are diUicult to reconcile with the literature.</p>
<p>We explored which rates in the model could account for the eUects of TFIIB depletion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) and Kin28 inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>; Methods) on mean RNAPII occupancy over UASs, promoters, transcribed regions and 3’UTRs. Consistent with a role for TFIIB in recruiting RNAPII to the promoter, reducing the rate of RNAPII recruitment (<italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>) to the promoters of TFO genes produced RNAPII occupancy changes that matched the observed eUects of TFIIB depletion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, left; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>For the STM genes, decreasing k<sub>2</sub> alone (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the rate of RNAPII transfer from the UAS to promoter) predicted an accumulation of RNAPII at the UAS and did not agree well with the data (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, right). Instead, models that decreased k<sub>2</sub> and <italic>either</italic> increased the rate of dissociation from the UAS (<italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub>) or decreased the rate of RNAPII recruitment to the UAS (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>) produced RNAPII occupancies that agreed well with the data (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, right; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, for STM genes, depletion of TFIIB decreased promoter recruitment without causing an increase in UAS binding, suggesting that TFIIB depletion may also reduce recruitment of RNAPII to, or stimulate RNAPII dissociation from, the UAS.</p>
<p>Next, we asked which rates in our kinetic model could account for the eUects of inhibiting Kin28. Modeling a decrease in the rate of initiation (<italic>k</italic><sub>5</sub>) predicted an accumulation at the promoter (and UASs of STM class genes), which is not observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Instead, the eUects of inhibiting Kin28 fit best with destabilizing RNAPII bound to the UAS or promoter, either by decreasing recruitment (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> or <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>, respectively) or by increasing dissociation (<italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub> or <italic>k</italic><sub>-3</sub>, respectively; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, for TFO class genes, either an increase in promoter dissociation (<italic>k</italic><sub>-3</sub>) or a decrease in promoter recruitment (<italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>) with a decrease in initiation (<italic>k</italic><sub>5</sub>) produced occupancies that agreed with the data (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, left; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, for STM class genes, incorporating an increase in promoter dissociation <italic>(k</italic><sub>-3</sub>), an increase in UAS dissociation (<italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub>) or decrease in UAS recruitment (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>) with a decrease in initiation (<italic>k</italic><sub>5</sub>) resulted in fits that agreed with the empirical findings (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, right). Notably, for STM class genes, the combination of a decrease in initiation with an increase in promoter dissociation produced the best fit at the UAS. Together, these findings indicate that the changes in RNAPII occupancy observed by ChEC-seq2 upon perturbation of PIC components can be explained by reasonable changes in transcriptional rates.</p>

<title>Disrupting the interaction with the NPC impacts promoter association of RNAPII without altering UAS binding</title>
<p>Hundreds of active yeast genes physically associate with the NPC and this is dependent on ssTFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Casolari et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Light et al., 2010</xref>; Randise-HinchliU et al., 2016; Vosse et al., 2013).

For example, a mutation in the Gcn4 TF that blocks interaction with the NPC results in a quantitative decrease in transcription of Gcn4 targets (genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hinnebusch and Fink, 1983</xref>). This mutation replaces three amino acids within a 27 amino acid Positioning Domain (PD<sub>GCN4</sub>) that does not overlap the activation or DNA binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>). We confirmed this eUect by measuring nascent transcription upon amino acid starvation in <italic>gcn4-pd</italic> strains or a wildtype control (Materials &amp; Methods). Although both <italic>GCN4</italic> and <italic>gcn4-pd</italic> mutant strains showed widespread transcriptional changes upon amino acid starvation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), the upregulation (and downregulation) of transcription was quantitatively stronger for the <italic>GCN4</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, right panel).

<p>ChEC-seq2 against Rpb1-MN was performed in <italic>GCN4</italic>, <italic>gcn4Δ</italic> and <italic>gcn4-pd</italic> mutant strains grown in the presence or absence of amino acids. This experiment identified 287 genes that showed a log<sub>2</sub> fold-change (LFC) of 1 or greater (p. adj &lt; 0.05) in the <italic>GCN4</italic> strain upon amino acid starvation, but not in the <italic>gcn4Δ</italic> strain (Table S1). These genes were strongly enriched for genes involved in amino acid metabolism (<italic>p</italic> = 3e-46; GO term 0006520) and strongly overlapped with Gcn4 targets (Bonferroni-adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 1e-10 from Fisher Exact test comparing overlap with targets defined near high-confidence Gcn4 ChEC-seq2 sites; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">VanBelzen et al., 2024</xref>). In cells grown in the presence of amino acids, neither the <italic>gcn4Δ</italic> or <italic>gcn4-pd</italic> mutations aUected Rpb1 occupancy at the 287 Gcn4-dependent genes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, left column). However, upon amino acid starvation, strains lacking Gcn4 showed a stark decrease in Rpb1 recruitment upstream of the TSS that spanned both the UAS and promoter region (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, top panel). The eUects of the <italic>gcn4-pd</italic> mutation were more modest and showed a decrease in Rpb1 specifically over the promoter (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, bottom). This suggested that the recruitment of RNAPII to the UAS region is dependent on Gcn4, but not on the PD<sub>GCN4</sub>.</p>
<p>Consistent with this possibility, Rpb1 cleavage adjacent to the TATA boxes near the Gcn4 target genes was strongly aUected by loss of Gcn4 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 2e-16; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing the mean cleavage pattern over 173 TATAs) and was significantly decreased by the <italic>pd</italic> mutation (p = 4e-5; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, top). Likewise, in strains lacking Gcn4, Rpb1-MN cleavage over 284 Gcn4 binding sites near the Gcn4 targets was strongly decreased (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, bottom). However, Rpb1-MN cleavage over these Gcn4 binding sites was unaUected by the <italic>gcn4-pd</italic> mutation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, bottom). Thus, Gcn4 recruits RNAPII to both UASs and promoters, while the PD<sub>GCN4</sub> impacts the association of RNAPII with promoters.</p>
<p>Finally, we compared the eUects of adjusting the rates of each step in our kinetic model to the eUects of the Gcn4 mutations on Rpb1 occupancy (Figure 7 – Supplement). The eUects of loss of Gcn4 agreed well with simply decreasing RNAPII recruitment to the UAS alone in the model (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>, resulting in less RNAPII to move from the UAS to the promoter; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). For the <italic>gcn4-pd</italic> mutant, increasing the dissociation of RNAPII from the promoter (<italic>k</italic><sub>-3</sub>) either alone or in combination with decreasing the rate of transfer of RNAPII from the UAS to the promoter (k<sub>2</sub>) agreed well with these data (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). This suggests that Gcn4 both recruits RNAPII to the UAS through its activation domains and that its interaction with the NPC stabilizes promoter-bound RNAPII.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Understanding complex biological mechanisms requires multipronged, multidisciplinary approaches. Each approach has strengths and weaknesses but together, they provide a more complete picture. Our current understanding of RNAPII transcription, involving the dynamic collaboration of dozens of proteins, is the product of biochemical, structural, genetic, cell biological and genomic approaches. From decades of such work, we have an excellent working model for this critical biological process. Biochemical, structural and cell biological approaches (and, in some cases, genetic approaches) can be biased by the particularities of the model system(s). For this reason, global approaches provide an essential perspective to assess the generality of the conclusions from more focused studies. Our current global perspective of molecular biology is dominated by a single technique: chromatin immunoprecipitation, coupled with next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and its derivatives. Indeed, ChIP-seq is the sole method used to define DNA binding and chromatin state by the ENCODE and modENCODE Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Landt et al., 2012</xref>). Such a methodological monoculture is problematic if there are ways in which ChIP falters in detecting important interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Teytelman et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>For proteins that bind to DNA at specific sites, ChIP-seq and ChEC-seq2 generally agree. For example, high confidence binding sites for ssTFs show excellent agreement between either ChIP-seq or ChIP-exo and ChEC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Donczew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">VanBelzen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zentner et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">2015</xref>). Likewise, mapping the associations of PIC components, Mediator or the kinases associated with transcription by ChEC-seq2 was very similar to such maps produced by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Saleh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). However, some exceptions have been noted, as well. ChEC-seq with both Rif1 and Sfp1 reveals biologically sensible binding sites that were not evident from ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bruzzone et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>While both ChIP-seq and ChEC-seq2 with RNAPII gives enrichment over genes that correlates with transcription, the patterns are complementary; ChIP highlights interactions with the transcribed region (reflecting paused or elongating RNAPII) and ChEC highlights interactions with the enhancer, promoter and terminator (reflecting preinitiation or terminating RNAPII). We have validated the RNAPII enrichment reported by ChEC-seq2 in five ways. First, the maps produced by two diUerent subunits of RNAPII are highly similar (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Second, the RNAPII ChEC signal over promoters and UAS regions correlates well with the RNAPII ChIP signal over coding sequences and with nascent transcription rates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Third, the cleavage by either Rpb1 or Rpb3 (as well as TFIIA and TFIIE) peaks on either side of TATA boxes, which agrees well with biochemical and structural analysis of the preinitiation complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Fourth, widespread changes in transcription are captured by changes in the Rpb1 enrichment by ChEC over all gene regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Fifth, depletion of TFIIB leads to loss of Rpb1 and TFIIE, as well as an increase of TFIIA, over transcriptional start sites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). These data, strengthened by the correlations with ChEC using factors involved in initiation and elongation, argue that the patterns of RNAPII enrichment revealed by ChEC-seq2 are biologically meaningful and fit well with the literature.</p>
<p>Why is there a diUerence between RNAPII ChIP and ChEC? While ChIP captures direct protein-DNA interactions well, it is much less able to capture indirect interactions. Additional factors that may influence ChIP enrichment include the local nucleosome occupancy, the accessibility of the epitope and the relative sensitivity of diUerent regions to shearing by sonication. Unlike ssTFs or even PIC components that bind to directly to precise genomic sites, RNAPII interacts both indirectly (through ssTFs) and directly (in the PIC and transcribing RNAPII) with diUerent regions, each of which is associated with distinct sets of cofactors. These diUerences likely impact the two methods; ChEC should detect both direct and indirect interactions with DNA, whereas ChIP should strongly favor direct interactions. Likewise, ChEC will perform better in nucleosome-depleted regions while ChIP cross-linking may be enhanced by lysine-rich nucleosomes.</p>
<p>ChEC detects UAS-associated RNAPII observed in single molecule biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baek et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Rosen et al., 2020</xref>) that have not been observed by ChIP-seq. This is consistent with recruitment of RNAPII to ssTFs/Mediator bound to UASs. While the enhanced RNAPII ChEC signal in intergenic regions may also reflect lower nucleosome occupancy, sMNase cleavage was not enriched over UASs like Rap1 binding sites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the RNAPII ChEC enrichment observed over promoters and UASs is consistent with that expected from known dwell times and the rate of elongation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The low RNAPII ChIP signal at UASs and the high signal over coding sequences could reflect both its more direct interaction with DNA and its intimate association highly cross-linkable nucleosomes during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bintu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ehara et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kujirai et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is less clear why the RNAPII ChIP-seq signal over the promoter is so low. ChIP successfully captures enrichment of PIC components at promoters, indicating that promoter regions can be successfully enriched by ChIP. But because promoters and enhancers tend to be more readily sheared by sonication than formaldehyde fixed transcribed regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Giresi et al., 2007</xref>), perhaps these regions are poorly recovered during RNAPII ChIP-sequencing. Future studies will resolve these diUerences.</p>
<p>We present a novel method for observing the genome-wide location of the phosphorylated forms of RNAPII (Ser2p and Ser5p) using single chain antibodies (Mintbodies) tagged with MNase. ChEC-seq2 with these Mintbodies produces patterns that agree well with total RNAPII and with the kinases responsible for these modifications. Consistent with ChIP, Ser5p RNAPII is enriched in promoters and the 5’end of active genes, while Ser2p is enriched over the body and 3’ end. Inactivation of the Kin28 Ser5p kinase results in dramatic loss of RNAPII, Ser5p RNAPII and Ser2p RNAPII from active genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This is consistent with an important role for Ser5p in initiation and with the observation that Ser2 phosphorylation is functionally downstream of Ser5p.</p>
<p>The NPC has been implicated in transcription in yeast and other organisms. In yeast, inactivation of DNA elements or transcription factors that promote interaction with the NPC leads to a quantitative defect in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brickner et al., 2012</xref>). Single molecule RNA FISH (smRNA FISH) in strains bearing mutations that blocked the interaction of the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter with the NPC showed a decrease in the fraction of cells that exhibit transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brickner et al., 2016</xref>). A mutation in the Gcn4 ssTF that blocks its ability to mediate peripheral localization and interaction with the NPC leads to a defect in expression of Gcn4 target genes (<italic>gcn4-pd</italic>; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>) and inactivation of nuclear pore proteins essential for chromatin interaction leads to a global transcriptional defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ge et al., 2024</xref>). Applying RNAPII ChEC-seq2, we have explored the phenotype of the <italic>gcn4-pd</italic> mutant. Whereas loss of Gcn4 leads to loss of RNAPII from UASs and promoters, inactivation of the PD<sub>GCN4</sub> reduces the association of RNAPII with the promoter without aUecting its recruitment to the UAS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This suggests that the PD<sub>GCN4</sub> either enhances the transfer of RNAPII from the UAS to the promoter or stabilizes the association of RNAPII with the promoter. Genetic interactions between nuclear pore proteins and Mediator suggest that these two components function at the same step in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ge et al., 2024</xref>). Together with the smRNA FISH result, this suggests that nuclear pore proteins stimulate enhancer function by stabilizing RNAPII association with the PIC.</p>
<p>Because ChEC-seq2 measures global occupancy of RNAPII that includes important states that are missed by ChIP-seq, it allowed us to develop a global model for the kinetics of RNAPII transcription. Building on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>), we have modeled two classes of genes: those that show RNAPII association only with promoters (TFO) and those that show association with UASs as well (STM). For the TFO model, RNAPII is recruited directly to the promoter. For STM genes, RNAPII is recruited to the UAS and then transferred to the promoter. Subsequent steps (initiation, elongation and termination) are assumed to be the same between these two classes. Several of the rates are from the literature, while the others were fit to the experimental RNAPII enrichments over UASs, promoters, transcribed regions and 3’UTRs. While we were unable to find rates within a reasonable range of parameters that produced RNAPII occupancies matching ChIP-seq, the model identified a large ensemble of rates that produced RNAPII occupancies matching ChEC-seq2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). The RNAPII occupancy from ChEC-seq2 data over highly active genes matched models that included a short dwell time over the terminator (∼ 30s), at the lower bound of what was reported in Zenklusen 2008 (mean = 56 ± 20s) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Larson et al., 2011</xref> (mean = 70 ± 41s).</p>
<p>The kinetic model suggests that perturbations often have more than one eUect, as expected for a dynamic, multi-step process like transcription. For example, the eUects of depletion of TFIIB on RNAPII ChEC-seq2 are best modeled by both a decrease in RNAPII recruitment and an increase in non-productive dissociation of RNAPII, either from the promoter or the UAS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Likewise, the eUects of inhibition of Kin28 were most consistent with both a decrease in initiation and an increase in dissociation from the promoter/UAS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). These results suggest that the PIC is unstable and that such perturbations cause RNAPII to dissociate. This conclusion agrees with the observation that a small fraction of the polymerases that assemble at the promoter initiate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Darzacq et al., 2007</xref>) and with the observation that conditional inactivation of PIC components does not preserve stable intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Petrenko et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, these results were consistent across the entire ensemble of models, showing that this is a robust eUect. These models should serve as a helpful framework for future global studies of transcription.</p>

<p>SLAMseq was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>) with the following modifications. Approximately 10<sup>8</sup> cells were collected, resuspended in SDC-uracil + 200 µM 4-thiouracil and incubated for 6 minutes at 30°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted from cell pellets as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Schmitt et al., 1990</xref>), and purified with the Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit (New England Biolabs). Alkylated RNA was purified with the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (New England Biolabs). RNA quality was confirmed after each purification with a TapeStation 4150 (Agilent). Sequencing libraries were prepared from 150 ng RNA the QuantSeq 3’ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit (FWD) kit (Lexogen). Sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina) in the single-end, 50 bp format at the Northwestern University NUseq core facility.

<title>Computational model</title>
<p>We used a stochastic model to simulate the average occupancy of RNAPII along a discretized model gene (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), assuming each step in the transcription cycle is a Poisson process. We separately modeled two classes of genes: STM genes and TFO genes. For STM genes, we assume that the association of RNAPII with the gene occurs at the UAS and is reversible, with association rate <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> and dissociation rate <italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub>. Next, the RNAPII transitions from the UAS to the promoter with rate <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>. This rate represents an aggregate step that requires the recruitment of early general transcription factors (GTFs) such as TFIIA and TFIIB. Because these interactions are reversible, we assume RNAPII can transition back to the UAS from the promoter with rate <italic>k</italic><sub>-2</sub>. When at the promoter, the RNAPII awaits the arrival of late GTFs such as TFIIH to form the complete PIC. This process occurs at the aggregate rate <italic>k</italic><sub>4</sub>. While awaiting arrival of late GTFs, the RNAPII can also dissociate from the promoter with rate <italic>k</italic><sub>-3</sub>. Once the PIC has assembled, TFIIH kinase phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNAPII to initiate transcription and promoter escape. This occurs with rate <italic>k</italic><sub>5</sub>. The transcribed region is modeled as ten identical 120bp compartments, and the RNAPII moves to each succeeding compartment with rate <italic>k</italic><sub>6</sub>. Finally, once the RNAPII reaches the terminator, it dissociates with rate <italic>k</italic><sub>7</sub>. TFO genes are modeled similarly, with the omission of <italic>k</italic><sub>1,</sub> <italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>, and <italic>k</italic><sub>-2</sub>, and instead introducing <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>, the rate of recruitment directly to the promoter. The UAS, promoter, and terminator regions are modeled as independent 120 bp compartments. No compartment could be occupied by more than one RNAPII.</p>
<p>We simulated 1000 seconds of the transcription cycle to allow the system to reach steady state. We report the RNAPII occupancy of each segment of the gene over the final 60 seconds to align with the experimental procedure. The simulated data was then normalized using the <italic>L<sup>2</sup></italic> norm and scaled to have the same magnitude as the empirical data to approximate the unit conversion to CPM or CPMn. This process was repeated across 100,000 genes and the average occupancy in each region of the gene was recorded. Simulations were performed using the Gillespie algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gillespie, 1977</xref>), a stochastic simulation method that generates statistically correct trajectories of a given system. The algorithm uses random sampling to determine the timing and sequence of state transitions that correspond to diUerent steps in the transcription cycle. Code for the simulations is available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jasonbrickner/RNAPII_kinetics_simulation">https://github.com/jasonbrickner/RNAPII_kinetics_simulation</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Model fitting</title>
<p>Several parameters in the model were fixed according to previously published data; <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub> were from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Rosen et al., 2020</xref>; <italic>k</italic><sub>5</sub> was based on the residency time of TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>); <italic>k</italic><sub>6</sub> was based on an average elongation rate of 1000 bp/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Larson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>) and <italic>k</italic><sub>7</sub> is based on 56 ± 20s and 70s ± 41s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Larson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>). Other parameters in the model were free and were fit to either ChEC-seq2 or ChIP-seq data by performing a grid search.</p>
<p>We evaluated each model in the grid by computing the cosine similarity between the output of the model and the empirical data. That is, we calculated the quantity
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="602535v2_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>M<sub>i</sub></italic> is the average occupancy of the model in the <italic>i</italic>-th segment (UAS, promoter, transcript, or 3’UTR) and <italic>E<sub>i</sub></italic> is the corresponding empirical data from the same segment. The cosine similarity ranges from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect alignment, 0 indicating no correlation, and -1 indicating perfect inverse alignment. This measure allows us to quantitatively assess how well each model’s predictions align with the observed data simultaneously across gene regions. Rather than choosing the single model with the best fit, we elected to use an ensemble approach to more thoroughly interpret the data. In this approach, all models with cosine similarity greater than 0.995 were included in the ensemble (for ChEC-seq2). This ensemble approach allows us to explore the full space of models that are consistent with the data and avoid any spurious conclusions that may arise from the investigation of a single parameter set. The recovered ensemble of models was distributed across a manifold in parameter space, establishing required relationships between the unknown parameters (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – Supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7 – Supplement 1</xref>). For ChIP-seq data, the model could not achieve a cosine similarity greater than 0.85, so instead we report the best fitting models to provide context. Genes with fewer than 50 nascent read counts were removed from the STM and TFO datasets, yielding 643 STM genes and 1143 TFO genes.</p>
<p>Based on the established functions of the proteins involved (TFIIB, Kin28 or Gcn4), we identified the rate that would be most likely influenced by the experimental perturbation and simulated the eUects of perturbing that rate. If altering that rate was not suUicient to match the data, the eUects of changing additional rates were explored to identify the model that best match the data. Changes to rates that did not match the empirical data are not shown. The final list of parameters used to simulate each experiment are given in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The S288C genome sequence and annotations from build R64-3-1 were used for analysis and visualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Engel et al., 2013</xref>). The STM and TFO gene classifications are from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>). TATA-positions were from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rhee &amp; Pugh, 2012</xref>. The top 150 expressed genes within each class were defined by Nascent RNA counts (SLAMseq) from the BY4741 strain grown in SDC. Similarly, expressed genes subsets were defined as genes for which there were ≥ 50 nascent RNA counts on average across 3 biological replicates. This resulted in the following number of genes per expressed subsets: STM, 643 genes; TFO, 1143 genes; TATA-containing, 597 genes.</p>
<p>TSS and TES locations were defined by an RNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>), when available. In cases where no TSS was available from RNA-seq, the TSS was instead taken from a CAGE-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lu and Lin, 2021</xref>). If neither dataset contained TSS or TES information, the median 5’UTR length (47 bp) or 3’UTR length (118 bp) was used to define these locations, respectively. Median UTR lengths were calculated from the most abundant transcript isoform for mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>). ChEC-seq2 signal was binned into gene regions defined as: UAS, -500 bp to -151 relative to TSS; Promoter, -150 to +25 relative to TSS; Transcript, +26 relative to TSS and -76 relative to TES; Terminator, -75 to +150 relative to TES.</p></list-item>

Instead, an equal number of rate combinations (best-fit) as shown in (<bold>C</bold>) is displayed. <bold>(E)</bold> In an attempt to identify rates that fit the RNAPII enrichment seen by ChIP-seq, we used the promotor-recruitment model (TFO genes) and loosened previously fixed rates <italic>k</italic><sub>5</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>7</sub> and expanded the search range for <italic>k</italic><sub>4</sub> while fixing <italic>k<sub>-3</sub></italic>. Published rates for <italic>k<sub>5</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>7</sub></italic> are displayed in red on the axes. Range from parameter fit <italic>k</italic><sub>4</sub> from ChEC-seq2 data (C) is shown in orange on the <italic>k</italic><sub>4</sub> axis. The range of values for <italic>k<sub>4</sub>, k<sub>5</sub></italic>, and <italic>k<sub>7</sub></italic> that fit the ChIP-seq data are shown in the table (Functional Range). In the idealized case <italic>k<sub>-3</sub></italic> = 0 and <italic>k<sub>4</sub></italic> is instantaneous then <italic>k<sub>7</sub></italic> should be equal to the product of <italic>k<sub>6</sub></italic> and the ratio between the average occupancy given by ChIP in the coding region and terminator of the gene (approximately 0.14 s<sup>-1</sup>), and <italic>k<sub>5</sub></italic> should be equal to the product of <italic>k<sub>6</sub></italic> and the ratio between the average occupancy given by ChIP in the coding region and the terminator of the gene (approximately 0.2 s<sup>-1</sup>). The functional ranges shown agree with this, as rate <italic>k<sub>5</sub></italic> is bounded below by the idealized approximation, and rate <italic>k<sub>7</sub></italic> is centered around its idealized approximation. <bold>(F)</bold> The average Rpb1 signal (purple) from ChIP-seq over the indicated regions from TFO-class genes that are expressed in SDC. RNAPII enrichment resulting from rate combinations shown in (E) were modeled in combination with fixed rates from the literature shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. UAS, Promoter, and 3’UTR were represented by a single 120 bp bin and the transcript region was composed of 10 sequential bins to represent a 1200 bp transcript. The average predicted occupancy for RNAPII over each region from the models (<italic>i.e.</italic> sets of rates) that best matched the empirical data are shown (see Methods). For Rpb1 ChIP-seq, 55 rate-combinations from the promoter model fit the empirical data from TFO-class genes. Empirical and model outcomes were compared for each gene region with a Student’s t-test, which reported no significant diUerences (p &gt; 0.05).</p></caption>

<caption><title>Parameter fitting of unknown transcription rates in UAS-recruitment model for Gcn4 target genes.</title>
<p>Rates with no known value were parameter fit using a grid search (see Methods). We used the UAS-recruitment model and explored rates <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>-2</sub>, and <italic>k</italic><sub>4</sub> in the range [0, 0.2] and <italic>k</italic><sub>-3</sub> in the range [0, 0.03]. Rate combinations that fit the Rpb1-MN ChEC-seq2 data from 287 Gcn4-target genes under amino acid starvation conditions. The fitting procedure resulted in 1057 rate combinations that fit the empirical data.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors use ChEC-seq, an MNase-based method to map yeast RNA pol II. Part of the reasoning for this study is that earlier biochemical work suggested pol II initiation and termination should involve slow steps at the UAS/promoter and termination regions that are not well visualized by formaldehyde-based ChIP methods. Here the authors find that pol II ChIP and ChEC give complementary patterns. Pol II ChIP signals are strongest in the coding region (where ChIP signal correlates well with transcription (rho = 0.62)). In contrast, pol II ChEC signals are strongest at promoters (rho = 0.52) and terminator regions. Weaker upstream ChEC signals are also observed at the STM class genes where biochemical studies have suggested a form of Pol (and maybe other general factors) is recruited to UAS sites. ChEC of TFIIA and TFIIE give promoter-specific ChEC signals as expected. Extending this work to elongation factors Ctk1 and Spt5 unexpectedly give strong signals near the PIC location and little signals over the coding region. This, and mapping CTD S2 and S5 phosphorylation by ChEC suggests to me that, for some reason, ChEC isn't optimal for detecting components of the elongation complex over coding regions.</p>
<p>Examples are also presented where perturbations of transcription can be measured by ChEC. Modeling studies are shown where adjustment of kinetic parameters agree well with ChEC data and that these models can be used to estimate which steps in transcription are affected by various perturbations. No tests were performed to see if the predictions could be validated by other means. Finally, the role of nuclear pore binding by Gcn4 is explored, although the results do not seem convincing. Overall, the authors show that pol II ChEC is a valuable and complementary method for investigating transcription mechanisms and slow steps at the initiation and termination regions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by VanBelzen et. al. compares chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) and chromatin endogenous cleavage sequencing (ChEC-seq2) to examine RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) binding patterns in yeast. While ChIP-seq shows RNAPII enrichment mainly over transcribed regions, ChEC-seq2 highlights RNAPII binding at promoters and upstream activating sequences (UASs), suggesting it captures distinct RNAPII populations that the authors speculate are linked more tightly to active transcription. The authors develop a stochastic model for RNAPII kinetics using ChEC-seq2 data, revealing insights into transcription regulation and the role of the nuclear pore complex in stabilizing promoter-associated RNAPII. The study suggests that ChEC-seq2 identifies regulatory events that ChIP-seq may overlook.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This is a carefully crafted study that adds significantly to existing literature in this area. Transgenic MNase fusions with endogenous Rpb1 and Rpb3 subunits were carefully performed, and complemented by fusions with several additional proteins that help the authors to dissect the transcription cycle. Both the S. cerevisiae lines and the sequencing data are likely to be of significant use to the community.</p>
<p>(2) The validation of ChEC-seq2 and its comparison with ChIP-seq is highly valuable technical information for the community.</p>
<p>(3) The kinetic modeling appears to be thoughtfully done.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The term &quot;nascent transcription&quot; is all too often used interchangeably for NET-seq, PRO-seq, 4sU-seq, and other assays that often provide different types of information. The authors should make it clear their use of the term refers to SLAM-seq data.</p>
<p>(2) The authors do not perform any comparison to run-on (PRO-seq) data. My impression is that the distribution of PRO-seq signal in S. cerevisiae agrees better with the distribution the authors observe by ChIP-seq. PRO-seq only captures RNAPII that is engaged and actively transcribing. If PRO-seq does indeed provide a similar profile as ChIP-seq, wouldn't this indicate that the high frequency of association between RNAPII and either the promoter or UAS reflects RNAPII that has not yet started transcription elongation? Perhaps this could help sort out what types of activities are occurring at the UAS (which does not appear to require a full PIC) or at the promoter (which does)?</p>

<p>Response to Reviewer #1:</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that ChIP is much better than ChEC at recovering RNA polymerase II and elongation factors associated with the transcribed regions.  We believe that this is due to cross-linking, which enriches for these interactions.  However, as we highlight in the manuscript, cross-linking may not accurately report on the occupancy of RNA polymerase II and elongation factors over all regions.  Although, by ChEC, we observe elongation factors upstream of the transcribed region, compared with total RNA polymerase II, the relative enrichment of elongation factors or phosphorylated RNA polymerase II is significantly higher over transcribed regions, with a bias to the 3’ end (Figure 4B &amp; C). This is consistent with these proteins and modifications functioning in elongation.</p>
<p>Regarding how convincing the results with the <italic>gcn4-pd</italic> mutant are, we would highlight that the phenotype of this mutant is a quantitative decrease in transcription and this leads to a quantitative decrease, rather than qualitative loss, of RNA polymerase II over the promoter, without impacting the association of RNA polymerase II over the UAS region.  This effect was small but statistically significant (p = 4e-5). Obviously, more mechanistic studies will need to be performed, but this result supports a role for the interaction with the nuclear pore complex in either enhancing the transfer of RNA polymerase II from the enhancer to the promoter or in preventing its dissociation from the promoter.</p>
<p>Response to Reviewer #2:</p>
<p>Thank you for your supportive comments and suggestions.  We will clarify our use of Nascent RNA in the text.  We agree that the stronger enrichment of the transcribed region from Rpb1 ChIP-seq experiments should correlate well with actively transcribing RNA polymerase II observed by PRO-seq; enrichment by PRO-seq reported in a paper from John Lis’ lab strongly favors transcribed regions with a modest peak over the terminator (PMID: 27197211, Figure 2A).  ChEC reveals functionally important forms of RNA polymerase II that are not engaged in transcription.  This manuscripts highlights the potential utility of ChEC-seq2 in measuring these interactions - suggested by the recent work from Buratowski and Gelles’ single molecule studies - globally.</p>
