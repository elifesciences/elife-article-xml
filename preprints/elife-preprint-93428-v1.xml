<title>Abstract</title><p>SCARF1 (Scavenger receptor class F member 1, SREC-1 or SR-F1) is a type I transmembrane protein that recognizes multiple endogenous and exogenous ligands such as modified low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and is important for maintaining homeostasis and immunity. But the structural information and the mechanisms of ligand recognition of SCARF1 are largely unavailable. Here we solve the crystal structures of the N-terminal fragments of human SCARF1, which show that SCARF1 forms homodimers and its epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains adopt a long-curved conformation. Then we examine the interactions of SCARF1 with lipoproteins and are able to identify a region on SCARF1 for recognizing modified LDLs. The mutagenesis data show that the positively charged residues in the region are crucial for the interaction of SCARF1 with modified LDLs, which is confirmed by making chimeric molecules of SCARF1 and SCARF2. In addition, teichoic acids, a cell wall polymer expressed on the surface of gram-positive bacteria, are able to inhibit the interactions of modified LDLs with SCARF1, suggesting the ligand binding sites of SCARF1 might be shared for some of its scavenging targets. Overall, these results provide mechanistic insights into SCARF1 and its interactions with the ligands, which are important for understanding its physiological roles in homeostasis and the related diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Scavenger receptor (SR) was first discovered in late 1970s during the studies regarding the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques of patients who lack LDL receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Up to date, SR family includes a large number of cell surface proteins that can be classified into more than ten classes (class A-L) based on the structural similarities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. SRs bind a wide range of endogenous and exogenous ligands including modified lipoproteins, damaged or apoptotic cells and pathogenic microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and play important roles in maintaining homeostasis, host defense and immunity, and have been linked to diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer’s disease and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Scavenger receptor class F (SR-F) has two known members, SCARF1 and SCARF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). SCARF1 was identified in cDNA libraries from human umbilical vein endothelial cells as a receptor for modified LDLs, thus also named SREC-1 (Scavenger Receptors expressed in Endothelial Cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. It is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells and distributed in organs such as heart, liver, kidney and spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. SCARF1 recognizes modified LDLs, including acetylated LDL (AcLDL), oxidized LDL (OxLDL) and carbamylated LDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that the SCARF1-mediated degradation of AcLDL accounts for 60% of the amounts of AcLDL degraded by the pathway independent of scavenger receptor class A (SR-A), suggesting that SCARF1 may play a key role in the development of atherosclerosis in concert with SR-A in some situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. SCARF1 expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells can recognize and internalize heat shock protein-bound antigens and activate adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. It may also cooperate with the Toll-like receptors to mediate the cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. SCARF1-knockout mice can develop symptoms similar to systemic lupus erythematosus disease and lead to accumulation of apoptotic cells in the immune organs, suggesting that it is involved in the removal of apoptotic cells and maintaining homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. SCARF1 may also associate with the extravasation of leukocytes from circulation into inflamed tissues during injury or infection, thus having a role in the inflammatory changes in vessel walls and the initiation of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Recent data also show that SCARF1 is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and loss of SCARF1 is associated with poorly differentiated tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. SCARF2 has 35% sequence identity and similar organ distribution with SCARF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Genetic analysis suggests that SCARF2 is linked to a rare disease called van den Ende-Gupta syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], which may provide clues for the physiological roles of this molecule.</p>

</fig>
<p>Previous reports have shown that SCARF1 can bind a number of endogenous ligands other than modified LDLs, including heat shock proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], calreticulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], Ecrg4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], Tamm-Horsfall protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] and apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], and mediate ligand internalization and transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. It can also bind bacterial, viral, and fungal antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], but the mechanisms for having such diverse ligand binding properties are unclear. By contrast, SCARF2 shows no binding activity with modified LDLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], but recent data suggest SCARF2 may share ligands such as complement C1q and calreticulin with SCARF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. In addition, MEGF10 (multiple EGF-like domains-10), which might be another member of SR-F family, is a mammalian ortholog of Ced-1 and a receptor of amyloid-β in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], suggesting that SR-F family members may have rather wide ligand binding specificities.</p>
<p>SCARF1 (MW, 86 kD) is a type I transmembrane protein that has a short signal peptide followed by a long extracellular region, a transmembrane helix and a large cytoplasmic portion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Its ectodomain has three glycosylation sites and contains multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, which usually has a two-stranded β-sheet followed by a loop region and three conserved disulfide bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. It has been shown that modified LDLs are the ligands for several SRs, including SR-A members, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor (LOX-1), CD36, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. For the SR-A members, including SCARA1 (CD204, SR-A1), MARCO and SCARA5, they bind modified LDLs in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner through the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains of the receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. In the case of LOX-1, both positively charged and non-charged hydrophilic residues might be involved in lipoprotein recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. And for CD36, positively charged residues are identified to be critical for its binding with OxLDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Since SCARF1 has different structural features with other known lipoprotein receptors, how it recognizes modified lipoproteins remains unclear.</p>
<p>Here we determined the crystal structures of the N-terminal fragments of SCARF1 and characterized the interaction of SCARF1 with modified LDLs by biochemical and mutagenesis studies, thus providing mechanistic insights into the recognition of lipoproteins by this receptor.</p>

<title>Crystal structures of the N-terminal fragments of SCARF1</title>
<p>To determine the structure of the extracellular region of SCARF1, the intact and several truncation fragments of SCARF1 ectodomain were expressed in insect cells and purified for crystallization screening. Among them, two fragments (f1, 20-132 aa and f2, 20-221 aa) were crystallized and the crystals diffracted to 2.2 Å and 2.6 Å, respectively (Table S1 and S2). The initial phasing for f1 crystal was done by SAD using Pt derivatives and the structure was refined to 2.2 Å with a native dataset after molecular replacement. The crystal of f1 fragment belongs to space group P212121 with two molecules per asymmetric unit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The f1 crystal structure contains a number of loops and two stranded β-sheets stabilized by hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds, which is consistent with the typical feature of EGF-like domains, and it adopts a bow-like conformation with the middle part (∼55-102 aa) protruding outwards (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The electron density of the N-terminal end (∼21-62 aa) of one molecule in an asymmetric unit is relatively weak and some residues are missing, probably due to the flexibility of this region.</p>
<p>The structure of f2 fragment was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of f1 fragment combined with the EGF-like fragments predicted by AlphaFold as phasing models and refined to 2.6 Å resolution. The crystal belongs to space group P4122 with one molecule per asymmetric unit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In the f2 crystal structure, the N-terminal region of SCARF1 (residue 20-56 aa) and the C-terminal region (210-221 aa) are largely missing, suggesting these regions are quite flexible, consistent with low electron density of the N-terminal end of the f1 crystal. Rest of the f2 fragment adopts a long-curved conformation with multiple EGF-like domains arranged in tandem (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Superposition of the two crystal structures reveals the structure of the N-terminal fragment of SCARF1 (20-209 aa) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), which has similar structural features with the AlphaFold prediction of the molecule (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). However, the crystal structures show a much larger curvature and local differences with the AlphaFold model (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>), which is in agreement with a recent report regarding the comparison between the protein structures in PDB and AlphaFold models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>SCARF1 forms homodimers</title>
<p>In the crystal of f1 fragment, two molecules in an asymmetric unit are related by a two-fold non-crystallographic symmetry axis. Interestingly, in the crystal of f2 fragment, although an asymmetric unit has only one molecule, the dimer related by the crystallographic two-fold symmetry can be well superimposed with the dimer found in the asymmetric unit of f1 crystals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), suggesting that dimerization occurs in a similar fashion for the two fragments in different crystal forms. At the dimeric interfaces of f1 and f2 fragments, hydrogen bonds are formed between S88 and Y94 of the monomers, and F82 and Y94 are also close to each other, thus may form π-π interaction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Two salt bridges are also observed in f1 crystals between two monomers, one is between D61 and K71, the other is between R76 and D98 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To further characterize the dimerization of SCARF1, a number of mutants of the ectodomain were constructed, and the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was applied to monitor the elution volumes of the proteins. The results showed that mutant S88A, where the hydrogen bonds between S88 and Y94 were removed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), had a small elution volume shift compared to the wild type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), suggesting that the homodimers were still maintained, but instability may increase for the dimer. By contrast, mutant Y94A, where the hydrogen bonds and the π-π interactions between Y94 and F82 were both removed, showed a significant elution volume shift (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and the volume corresponded to the molecular weight of the monomeric SCARF1 ectodomain, suggesting that the π-π interactions between F82 and Y94 were important for dimerization. Other mutants such as S88A/Y94A and F82A/S88A/Y94A also eluted at the volume of the monomer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). In parallel, we measured the hydrodynamic diameters of the mutants by dynamic light scattering (DLS), and it showed that the wild type and mutant S88A had larger diameters than mutants Y94A, S88A/Y94A and F82A/S88A/Y94A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), which was consistent with the SEC data. In addition, both the dimeric wild type and the monomeric mutant (S88A/Y94A) of the ectodomain exhibited similar SEC elution volumes at pH 6.0 and pH 8.0, suggesting that pH did not have large impact on the dimerization or the conformation of SCARF1 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Interactions of SCARF1 with modified LDLs</title>
<p>To characterize the interaction of SCARF1 with lipoproteins, we monitored the binding of lipoproteins with the SCARF1-transfected HEK293 cells using flow cytometry. The results showed that the SCARF1-transfected cells only bound OxLDL or AcLDL, rather than native LDL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), consistent with the previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], and SCARF1 appeared to have higher affinity for OxLDL than AcLDL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In parallel, we also tested the interaction of SCARF1 with high density lipoproteins (HDL) and oxidized HDL (OxHDL), the results showed that both HDL and OxHDL were not able to bind the SCARF1-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Fluorescent confocal images also confirmed that SCARF1 colocalized with OxLDL or AcLDL, rather than LDL, HDL or OxHDL in the transfected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Moreover, the flow cytometry data showed that the binding between SCARF1 and modified LDLs occurred either in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or EDTA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>), suggesting that the interaction of SCARF1 with OxLDL or AcLDL is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent.</p>

<p>To identify the lipoprotein binding region on the ectodomain of SCARF1, we generated a series of truncation mutants, including SCARF1<sup>Δ20-132aa</sup>, SCARF1<sup>Δ24-221aa</sup>, SCARF1<sup>Δ222-353aa</sup> and SCARF1<sup>Δ353-415aa</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). The cells transfected with these mutants were applied to examine the interactions with modified LDLs by flow cytometry. The results showed that the cells transfected with SCARF1<sup>Δ20-132aa</sup> and SCARF1<sup>Δ222-353aa</sup> could bind to OxLDL, similar to the cells expressing the wild type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-G</xref>). By contrast, the cells expressing SCARF1<sup>Δ24-221aa</sup> almost lost binding affinity with OxLDL completely, suggesting that the binding site might locate at the middle region (133-221aa) of the ectodomain of SCARF1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). In addition, the cells expressing SCARF1<sup>Δ353-415aa</sup> showed reduced binding with OxLDL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>), this may not be surprising as the deletion of the C-terminal regions of the ectodomain might change the conformation of the molecule and generate hinderance for the accessibility of lipoprotein particles.</p>

<title>SCARF1 recognizes modified LDLs through charge interactions</title>
<p>To identify the binding site for modified LDLs on the region identified above (133-221aa), we calculated the surface electrostatic potential of the region based on the crystal structure of f2 fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] and found a positively charged area in this region, which is mainly composed of two sites, one is R160 and R161 (Site 1), the other is R188 and R189 (Site 2) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). To test whether these positively charged sites are involved in lipoprotein recognition, we generated a number of mutants of SCARF1 including: R160S, R161S and R160S/R161S for Site 1; R188S, R189S and R188S/R189S for Site 2; R160S/R161S/R188S, R160S/R188S/R189S, R160S/R161S/R188S/R189S for both sites, and monitored their binding with OxLDL or AcLDL using flow cytometry. The results showed that all the single mutants for the two sites R160S, R161S, R188S, R189S had similar binding affinities as the wild type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-C</xref>), whereas the two double mutants, R160S/R161S for Site 1 or R188S/R189S for Site 2, exhibited reduced binding affinities with modified LDLs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-E</xref>). And the double mutant for Site 2, R188S/R189S, appeared to have lower affinity than the mutant for Site 1, R160S/R161S (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-E</xref>), implying that Site 2, R188S/R189S, may contribute more to the binding. The triple or quadruple mutants, R160S/R161S/R188S, R160S/R188S/R189S and R160S/R161S/R188S/R189S, where positive charges are largely removed for the two sites, almost lost the binding affinities with modified LDLs completely (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-E</xref>), suggesting these arginines are crucial for lipoprotein interaction and both sites contribute to the recognition. To further validate the importance of the charged residues, we made mutants where arginines were substituted with lysines on the two sites, including R160K/R161K, R188K/R189K and R160K/R161K/R188K/R189K. The flow cytometry data showed that all three mutants retained binding activities with modified LDLs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F-G</xref>), confirming the importance of charge interactions. Among them, mutants R160K/R161K and R188K/R189K had similar affinities as the wild type, and mutant R160K/R161K/R188K/R189K exhibited a reduction in binding affinity, suggesting the side chains of lysines may be slightly unfavorable for the interactions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F-G</xref>). In addition, fluorescent confocal images also confirmed that the mutant R160S/R161S/R188S/R189S did not bind to OxLDL, while the mutants R160K/R161K and R188K/R189K retained binding with OxLDL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that charge interactions are indispensable for the recognition of modified LDLs by SCARF1.</p>

<p>To confirm the binding position identified above for modified LDLs, we expressed and purified the wild type and mutants of the ectodomain of SCARF1 for ELISA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).

The ELISA data also showed that the monomeric mutants (S88A/Y94A, F82A/S88A/Y94A) had slightly higher affinities with OxLDL than the dimeric wild type, which might be due to the steric hinderance of the dimers when coated onto the plates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), but flow cytometry suggested that the monomeric mutants had lower affinities than the wide type (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), implying that the dimeric form may be more efficient to recognize lipoproteins on the cell surface. In addition, we also tested the binding of SCARF1 with OxLDL at pH 6.0 by ELISA and flow cytometry, and both data suggested that the binding activity was retained at pH 6.0 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>).</p>

<title>Interactions of modified LDLs with SCARF1/SCARF2 chimeric molecules</title>
<p>As another member in SR-F class, SCARF2 has similar structural features with SCARF1 according to AlphaFold prediction (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A-B</xref>). However, the flow cytometry data showed that SCARF2 did not bind to AcLDL or OxLDL (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-B</xref>), which is in agreement with the previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. To further validate the lipoprotein binding sites identified on SCARF1, we generated three pairs of SCARF1/SCARF2 chimeric molecules by switching the counterparts of the two molecules, including: i) SF1-1 and SF2-1, where 1-421aa of SCARF1(ectodomain) and 1-441aa of SCARF2 (ectodomain) are switched; ii) SF1-2 and SF2-2, where 1-221aa of SCARF1 and 1-242aa of SCARF2 are switched; and iii) SF1-3 and SF2-3, where 133-221aa of SCARF1 and 156-242aa of SCARF2 are switched (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C-E</xref>). Both flow cytometry data and fluorescent confocal images showed that SF2-1 gained binding activity with modified LDL, whereas SF1-1 lost the affinity, suggesting that the ectodomain of SCARF1 is sufficient for lipoprotein interaction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, 6F-G). Furthermore, the flow cytometry results of SF1-2, SF2-2, SF1-3 and SF2-3 demonstrated that SCARF2 chimeric molecules could bind modified LDLs when its counterparts are replaced by the fragments from SCARF1 that contain the binding sites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-F</xref>), thereby confirming the lipoprotein binding sites identified on SCARF1. However, the chimeric molecules SF2-2 and SF2-3 showed weaker affinities with OxLDL than SCARF1 or SF2-1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), suggesting the overall conformation or residues around the substituted binding region of SCARF2 might also affect ligand interaction. In addition, we made a sequence alignment of SCARF1 from different species and found that the positively charged residues at both site 1 and site 2 are well conserved, but not for SCARF2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>), consistent with the importance of these charged residues in ligand recognition for SCARF1.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SCARF1 can bind both endogenous and exogenous ligands through its ectodomain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], which adopts a long-curved conformation with multiple EGF-like domains arranged in tandem according to the crystal structures and the AlphaFold model. EGF-like domains are commonly found in cell surface molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>] and usually bind ligands in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. The EGF-like domains of SCARF1 do not contain the typical Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites according to sequence analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] and no obvious Ca<sup>2+</sup> density is observed in the crystal structures, consistent with the results of biochemical assays, suggesting that the interaction of SCARF1 with modified LDLs is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent. This is in contrast to the SR-A family, where SCARA1, MARCO and SCARA5 bind modified LDLs in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>].</p>
<p>The lipoprotein binding sites of SCARF1 locate at the middle region of the ectodomain and arginines are crucial for recognizing modified LDL by providing positive charges, which may have similarities with WIF-1, a Wnt inhibitory factor containing EGF-like domains that bind glycosaminoglycans through conserved arginines and lysines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. In fact, the binding of lipoproteins via charge interactions has been reported before. For LOX-1, which is also a scavenger receptor, positively charged residues such as arginines play essential roles for its binding with OxLDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. And similarly, positively charged residues are important to recognize OxLDL by CD36, which is a member in scavenger receptor class B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Therefore, the interaction of SCARF1 with modified LDLs might be similar to LOX-1 or the SR-B members, rather than the SR-A members. Moreover, both structural and biochemical data suggest that SCARF1 forms homodimers (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), which may facilitate the binding of modified lipoproteins and is also analogous to some of the lipoprotein receptors such as LOX-1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>].</p>

<p>Among the ligands of SCARF1, the teichoic acids from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> have been shown to interact with SCARF1 in a charge-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], which is similar to modified LDLs that also need charged residues to bind SCARF1. Therefore, teichoic acids and modified LDLs may share the binding sites on the ectodomain of SCARF1, implying that this region might be a general binding position for some of the scavenging targets, but whether all the ligands utilize this region for binding needs further investigation. In addition, the sequence alignment also shows that these charged residues are well conserved in different species for SCARF1, but SCARF2 lacks such sites on the ectodomain (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>), suggesting SCARF1 and SCARF2 are functionally divergent, although they have some sequence similarities.</p>
<p>Over the past decades, SCARF1 has been linked to a number of diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, fungal keratitis and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. But the mechanisms and roles of SCARF1 in these diseases are largely elusive. The structural and mechanistic characterization of SCARF1 and its interactions of multiple ligands would shed light on the physiological and pathological roles of this receptor on the corresponding pathways and may also provide insights on the therapeutic strategies against the related diseases.</p>

Dil-HDL (H8910) was purchased from Solarbio. The lipoproteins mentioned above (LDL, AcLDL, OxLDL, HDL) were isolated from human plasma.</p>
<p>For preparation of OxHDL, 140 µl of 1 mg/ml HDL were buffer-exchanged to PBS solution, and then the same volume of 100 µM CuSO<sub>4</sub> was divided into multiple small portions and added to HDL solutions gradually. After 16 h at 37°C, the reaction solutions were dialyzed against the PBS buffer containing 0.3 mM EDTA to stop the reaction.</p>

<title>ELISA experiments</title>
<p>Lipoprotein (OxLDL) was coated onto 96-well plates with 1 µg protein per well at 4 °C overnight. The plates were then blocked with the blocking buffer (25mM Hepes,150mM Nacl,0.1% Triton X-100,and 5%(w/v) BSA, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 3 h. The purified His-tagged proteins was serially diluted and added to each well in the binding buffer (25mM Hepes,150mM Nacl,0.1% Triton X-100,and 2 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4). After incubation at room temperature for 2 h, the plates were washed five times with the washing buffer (25mM Hepes,150mM NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) and then incubated with the mouse anti-His antibody (66005-1-Ig, Proteintech) for 1 h. After washing three times with the washing buffer, the plates were incubated with the HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (A0216, Beyotime) for 1 h. After washing three times with the washing buffer, 100 µl TMB Chromogen Solution (P0209-500ml, Beyotime) was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then, 50 µl H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (2.0M) was added to each well to stop the reactions. For the binding of lipoproteins at pH 6.0, PBS buffer (pH 6.0) was used following the similar procedure. The plates were then read at 450nm on a Synergy2 machine (Bio Tek Instruments).</p>

<p>SCARF1 is a scavenger membrane-bound receptor that binds modified versions of lipoproteins and has a major role in maintaining lipid homeostasis. This <bold>useful</bold> study reports the crystal structure of SCARF1 and identifies putative binding sites for modified lipoproteins. While some aspects of the analysis are <bold>incomplete</bold>, others are <bold>solid</bold>, and overall, the study advances our knowledge of how scavenger receptors clear modified lipoproteins to maintain lipid homeostasis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This study provides an incremental advance to the scavenger receptor field by reporting the crystal structures of the domains of SCARF1 that bind modified LDL such as oxidized LDL and acylated LDL. The crystal packing reveals a new interface for the homodimerization of SCARF1. The authors characterize SCARF1 binding to modified LDL using flow cytometry, ELISA, and fluorescent microscopy. They identify a positively charged surface on the structure that they predict will bind the LDLs, and they support this hypothesis with a number of mutant constructs in binding experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors have crystallized domains of an understudied scavenger receptor and used the structure to identify a putative binding site for modified LDL particles. An especially interesting set of experiments is the SCARF1 and SCARF2 chimeras, where they confer binding of modified LDLs to SCARF2, a related protein that does not bind modified LDLs, and use show that the key residues in SCARF1 are not conserved in SCARF2.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
While the data largely support the conclusions, the figures describing the structure are cursory and do not provide enough detail to interpret the model or quality of the experimental X-ray structure data. Additionally, many of the flow cytometry experiments lack negative controls for non-specific LDL staining and controls for cell surface expression of the SCARF constructs. In several cases, the authors interpret single data points as increased or decreased affinity, but these statements need dose-response analysis to support them. These deficiencies should be readily addressable by the authors in the revision.</p>
<p>The paper is a straightforward set of experiments that identify the likely binding site of modified LDL on SCARF1 but adds little in the way of explaining or predicting other binding interactions. That a positively charged surface on the protein could mediate binding to LDL particles is not particularly surprising. This paper would be of greater importance if the authors could explain the specificity of the binding of SCARF1 to the various lipoparticles that it does or does not bind. Incorporating these mutants into an assay for the biological role of SCARF1 would be powerful.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript by Wang and colleagues provided mechanistic insights into SCARF1 and its interactions with the lipoprotein ligands. The authors reported two crystal structures of the N-terminal fragments of SCARF1 ectodomain (ECD). On the basis of the structural analysis, the authors further investigated the interactions between SCARF1 and modified LDLs using cell-based assays and biochemical experiments. Together with the two structures and supporting data, this work provided new insights into the diverse mechanisms of scavenger receptors and especially the crucial role of SCARF1 in lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors started by determining the crystal structures of two fragments of SCARF1 ECD. The superposition of the two high-resolution structures, together with the predicted model by AlphaFold, revealed that the ECD of SCARF1 adopts a long-curved conformation with multiple EGF-like domains arranged in tandem. Non-crystallographic and crystallographic two-fold symmetries were observed in crystals of f1 and f2 respectively, indicating the formation of SCARF1 homodimers. Structural analysis identified critical residues involved in dimerization, which were validated through mutational experiments. In addition, the authors conducted flow cytometry and confocal experiments to characterize cellular interactions of SCARF1 with lipoproteins. The results revealed the vital role of the 133-221aa region in the binding between SCARF1 and modified LDLs. Moreover, four arginine residues were identified as crucial for modified LDL recognition, highlighting the contribution of charge interactions in SCARF1-lipoprotein binding. The lipoprotein binding region is further validated by designing SCARF1/SCARF2 chimeric molecules. Interestingly, the interaction between SCARF1 and modified LDLs could be inhibited by teichoic acid, indicating potential overlap in or sharing of binding sites on SCARF1 ECD.</p>
<p>The author employed a nice collection of techniques, namely crystallographic, SEC, DLS, flow cytometry, ELISA, and confocal imaging. The experiments are technically sound and the results are clearly written, with a few concerns as outlined below. Overall, this research represents an advancement in the mechanistic investigation of SCARF1 and its interaction with ligands. The role of scavenger receptors is critical in lipid homeostasis, making this work of interest.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript by Wang et. al. described the crystal structures of the N-terminal fragments of Scavenger receptor class F member 1 (SCARF1) ectodomains. SCARF1 recognizes modified LDLs, including acetylated LDL and oxidized LDL, and it plays an important role in both innate and adaptive immune responses. They characterized the dimerization of SCARF1 and the interaction of SCARF1 with modified lipoproteins by mutational and biochemical studies. The authors identified the critical residues for dimerization and demonstrated that SCARF1 may function as homodimers. They further characterized the interaction between SCARF1 and LDLs and identified the lipoprotein ligand recognition sites, the highly positively charged areas. Their data suggested that the teichoic acid inhibitors may interact with SCARF1 in the same areas as LDLs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The crystal structures of SCARF1 were high quality. The authors performed extensive site-specific mutagenesis studies using soluble proteins for ELISA assays and surface-expressed proteins for flow cytometry.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. The schematic drawing of human SCARF1 and SCARF2 in Fig 1A did not show the differences between them. It would be useful to have a sequence alignment showing the polymorphic regions.</p>
<p>
2. The description of structure determination was confusing. The f1 crystal structure was determined by SAD with Pt derivatives. Why did they need molecular replacement with a native data set? The f2 crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the f1 fragment. Why did they need to use EGF-like fragments predicted by AlphaFold as search models?</p>
<p>
3. It's interesting to observe that SCARA1 binds modified LDLs in a Ca2+-independent manner. The authors performed the binding assays between SCARF1 and modified LDLs in the presence of Ca2+ or EDTA on Page 9. However, EDTA is not an efficient Ca2+ chelator. The authors should have performed the binding assays in the presence of EGTA instead.</p>
<p>
4. The authors claimed that SCARF1Δ353-415, the deletion of a C-terminal region of the ectodomain, might change the conformation of the molecule and generate hinderance for the C-terminal regions. Why didn't SCARF1Δ222-353 have a similar effect? Could the deletion change the interaction between SCARF1 and the membrane? Is SCARF1Δ353-415 region hydrophobic?</p>
<p>
5. What was the point of having Figure 8? Showing the SCARF1 homodimers could form two types of dimers on the membrane surface proposed? The authors didn't have any data to support that.</p>
