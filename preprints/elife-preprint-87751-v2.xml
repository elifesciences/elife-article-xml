<title>Abstract</title><p>Annual cycles in daylength provide an initial predictive environmental cue that plants and animals use to time seasonal biology. Seasonal changes in photoperiodic information acts to entrain endogenous programs in physiology to optimize an animal’s fitness. Attempts to identify the neural and molecular substrates of photoperiodic time measurement in birds have, to date, focussed on blunt changes in light exposure during a restricted period of photoinducibility. The objectives of these studies were first to characterise a molecular seasonal clock in Japanese quail and second, to identify the key transcripts involved in endogenously generated interval timing that underlies photosensitivity in birds. We hypothesized that the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) provides the neuroendocrine control of photoperiod-induced changes in reproductive physiology, and that the pars distalis of the pituitary gland contains an endogenous internal timer for the short photoperiod dependent development of reproductive photosensitivity. Here we report distinct seasonal waveforms of transcript expression in the MBH, and pituitary gland and discovered the patterns were not synchronized across tissues. Follicle-stimulating hormone-β (<italic>FSH</italic>β) expression increased during the simulated spring equinox, prior to photoinduced increases in prolactin, thyrotropin-stimulating hormone-β and testicular growth. Diurnal analyses of transcript expression showed sustained elevated levels of <italic>FSH</italic>β under conditions of the spring equinox, compared to autumnal equinox, short (&lt;12L) and long (&gt;12L) photoperiods. <italic>FSH</italic>β expression increased in quail held in non-stimulatory short photoperiod, indicative of the initiation of an endogenously programmed interval timer. These data identify that FSHβ establishes a state of photosensitivity for the external coincidence timing of seasonal physiology. The independent regulation of FSHβ expression provides an alternative pathway through which other supplementary environmental cues, such as temperature, can fine tune seasonal reproductive maturation and involution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Seasonal rhythms in reproduction are ubiquitous in plants and animals. In birds, the annual change in daylength, referred to as photoperiod, provides an initial predictive environmental cue to time seasonal physiology and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ball, 1993</xref>). Temperature, nutrient availability and social cues act as supplementary cues that function to fine tune the timing of breeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wingfield and Farner, 1980</xref>). Seasonal timing of reproductive physiology and breeding requires the integration of both environmental cues and endogenously generated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gwinner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wingfield, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Helm &amp; Stevenson, 2014</xref>). Even in the absence of seasonal fluctuations in daylength, temperature, and food availability, endogenous circannual cycles in migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gwinner and Dittami, 1990</xref>), hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pengelley and Fisher, 1957</xref>), and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Woodfill et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lincoln et al., 2006</xref>) are maintained with remarkable temporal precision. Other endogenous timing mechanisms include interval timers that are programmed to establish a physiological state in anticipation of the next season, such as flowering in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Duncan et al., 2015</xref>) and the photorefractory state in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Prendergast et al. 2001</xref>). The anatomical and cellular basis of endogenous programs that time seasonal transitions in biology remain poorly characterized, but current evidence indicates that, in mammals, circannual time may reside in pituitary lactotropes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lincoln et al., 2006</xref>) and thyrotropes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wood et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In most long-lived species (e.g., &gt;2 yrs.), the annual change in photoperiod acts to entrain endogenous annual programs to time transitions in physiological state to seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bradshaw and Holzapfel, 2007</xref>). In many temperate-zone birds, exposure to long days (&gt;12hr), induces a photostimulated state in which gonadal development occurs in male and female birds. Short photoperiods (e.g., &lt;12hr) can induce gonadal involution in both sexes leading to a reproductively regressed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dawson et al., 2001</xref>). Birds become reproductively sensitive to stimulatory long photoperiods only after experiencing short photoperiods for at least ten days, in which a photosensitive state is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dawson et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In most birds, reptiles, and amphibians, annual changes in daylength are detected by photoreceptors located in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Perez et al., 2019</xref>). Stimulatory long photoperiods trigger a molecular cascade that starts with the upregulation of thyrotropin-stimulating hormone beta subunit (<italic>TSH</italic>β) in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland and results in gonadal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nakao et al., 2008</xref>). The current gap in our knowledge is how short days (i.e., &lt;12hr) induce gonadal involution, and how prolonged exposure to short days stimulates endogenous programs that sensitises the brain to respond, at a molecular level, to stimulatory long days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Follett and Sharp, 1969</xref>). Previous studies in European starlings (<italic>Sturnus vulgaris</italic>) demonstrated that exposure to short days increased Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (<italic>GNRH</italic>) expression in the preoptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Stevenson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Stevenson et al., 2012a</xref>). As both GnRH and gonadal growth increased in the absence of stimulatory long day lengths, another cellular pathway must also be involved in the endogenous development of reproductive physiology in birds.</p>
<p>There were three objectives of the present work. First, we aimed to characterise the photoperiod-induced seasonal molecular clock in the MBH and pituitary gland in Japanese quail. Then, we examined the daily waveform of multiple transcripts in the MBH and pituitary in birds from stimulatory long photoperiod (16L:8D), inhibitory short photoperiod (8L:16D) and the two equinoxes. The last objective was to determine if <italic>FSH</italic>β expression in the pituitary gland was upregulated after prolonged exposure to short photoperiods. We theorized multiple neuroendocrine regions including the preoptic area, mediobasal hypothalamus and pituitary cells are independently involved in the timing of seasonal transitions in physiology. Specifically, we hypothesized that pituitary gonadotropes establish a state of photosensitivity to stimulatory long day photoperiods and thus act as calendar cells that provide endogenous timing of gonadal growth.</p>

<title>Molecular characterisation of the photoperiod-induced seasonal clock</title>
<p>To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the seasonal molecular changes in the MBH and pituitary gland, we collected MBH and pituitary gland samples from Japanese quail using an experimental paradigm that aimed to maximize resolution (i.e., high sampling frequency), high-dimensionality (i.e., advanced nucleic acid sequencing) and robust statistical power (i.e., large sample sizes). Our experimental design simulated the photoperiodic regulation of seasonal physiology of Japanese quail, using sequential changes of an autumnal decrease, followed by a spring increase in daylength and measured testes volume, body mass and abdominal fat (Fig.1a). As anticipated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Follett and Sharp, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Robinson and Follett, 1982</xref>), light phases that exceed the critical day length (i.e., &gt;12hr) resulted in robust gonadal growth. Increases in body mass and abdominal fat deposition were delayed until the spring increase in day lengths reached 10hrs (10v) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). EdgeR analyses, of MBH sequences obtained using Minion, identified 1481 transcripts were differentially expressed (P&lt;0.05) (Table S1; Table S2), and BioDare2.0 established 398 have rhythmic patterns (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>; Fig. S1; Table S3). DAVID gene ontology analyses indicated that gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor and Wnt signalling pathways were consistently identified as the predominant cellular mechanism recruited during each photoperiodic transition (Table S2). Increased proopiomelanocortin (<italic>POMC</italic>) expression coincided with body mass growth and abdominal fat accumulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Thyroid hormone catabolism enzyme deiodinase type-3 (<italic>DIO3</italic>) increased after prolonged exposure to non-stimulatory photoperiods and was only therefore transiently elevated from 8L to 10v (10v; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we used vimentin immunoreactivity to examine changes in tanycytes morphology in relation to changes in deiodinase transcript expression. Highest levels of vimentin immunoreactivity in the median eminence coincided with the peak in <italic>DIO3</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>) suggesting the localized removal of active thyroid hormone is limited to a short phase and occurred prior to stimulatory photoperiods (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>). The photoperiod-induced change in vimentin was anatomically localized to the median eminence, as the area of immunoreactivity in the dorsal 3<sup>rd</sup>V ependymal layer did not change with seasonal transitions in reproduction (Fig. S2).</p>
<p>Next, we used MinION to sequence transcripts in the pituitary gland across the seasonal transitions in reproduction. EdgeR analyses identified 3090 transcripts were differentially expressed in the pituitary gland (Table S1; Table S4). DAVID gene ontology analyses identified that gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor and epidermal growth factor pathways are consistently observed across photoperiodic transitions (Table S4). BioDare2.0 established that 130 transcripts were rhythmically expressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>; Table S5; Fig. S1). A remarkable 96.5% (384/398) of MBH transcripts show a photoperiod-induced spiked patterned and only 12/14 remaining transcripts displayed sine waveforms. Conversely, 100% of pituitary transcripts conformed to sine (124/130) or cosine (6/130) waveforms. The predominant rhythmic patterns of expression likely reflect endogenous long-term molecular programs, characteristic of calendar cell function.</p>
<p>Lastly, we examined <italic>GNRH</italic> expression to delineate photoperiod-induced changes in the neuroendocrine control of reproductive physiology. <italic>GNRH</italic> expression in the preoptic area was temporarily decreased during the 8L short photoperiod indicating another nucleus specific cellular timer is present in this brain region (Fig. S2). Overall, the pituitary showed a distinct transcriptomic profile compared to the MBH suggesting independence in the representation of seasonal photoperiodic timing. The spring photoperiodic transition from 8L to 12v resulted in a significant increase in <italic>FSH</italic>β (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k</xref>) without a change in tanycyte restructuring (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). Subsequent transition to 14v and then 16v resulted in the upregulation of prolactin (<italic>PRL</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1l</xref>) and thyrotropin-stimulating hormone-β (<italic>TSH</italic>β), respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1m</xref>). These data establish that multiple cells in the pituitary code seasonal photoperiodic time and <italic>FSH</italic>β shows an endogenous increase in expression prior to reproductively stimulatory photoperiods.</p>
<p>Weighted gene co-expression network analyses (WGCNA) were conducted to discover gene co-expression modules, and then examine whether any of the resulting module eigengenes co-vary with photoperiod or physiological measures. The eigengene dendrogram of sequencing from individual animals was plotted and a heatmap of physiological factors was organised (Fig. S3). The scale-free topology and mean sample independence was assessed to determine a soft-threshold of 5 for both MBH and the pituitary gland sequencing datasets. 10 modules were identified for the MBH, and the pituitary gene set was grouped into 22 modules (Fig. S3). Of these modules there were 6 significant module-trait relationships in the MBH. There was one module with a significant negative correlation with fat score (Fig. S3; Table S6). 44 transcripts were identified to be significant in the negative relation for fat score. The other 5 were identified to be negatively related and included photoperiod, body mass, fat score, testes width, and testes volume (Fig. S3; Table S6). Overall, there were 23 transcripts that were significant and overlapped with photoperiod, testes width and testes volume. The other module found 70 transcripts for both body mass and fat score. Despite several modules showing trends toward significance, only one module for body mass was positively related in the pituitary gland (Fig. S3; Table S6). There were 206 transcripts identified to be significantly positively related to body mass.</p>
<p>To ascertain common molecular mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of photoperiodically regulated transcripts, transcription factor enrichment analysis was conducted on significant MBH (Table S7) and pituitary gland (Table S8) transcripts. Association plots show no overlap in DNA binding motifs between MBH and pituitary transcripts (Fig. S4) suggesting tissue-specific transcription binding factor regulation. Within the pituitary gland, several common transcription factors, such as the Jun proto-oncogene, Spi1 proto-oncogene and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (<italic>MEF2a</italic>) might be actively involved in the photoperiodic regulation of transcript expression. These findings indicate multiple transcription factors are likely recruited to control tissue-specific, and cell-specific transcript expression and seasonal life history transitions in physiology.</p>

<title>Increased <italic>FSH</italic><bold>β</bold> expression is programmed during the spring equinox</title>
<p>To establish whether increased pituitary <italic>FSH</italic>β during the spring 12hr transition reflects constitutively elevated expression or is driven by the sampling ‘time of day’, we collected tissue samples every 3 hours from quail that transitioned to the autumnal equinox (i.e., 12a), the short photoperiod (8L), spring equinox (12v) and long photoperiod (16L) seasonal phases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Photoinduced changes in testes volume confirmed seasonal reproductive condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Circadian clock genes aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator like (<italic>ARNTL1</italic>) and period 3 (<italic>PER3</italic>) exhibit robust anti-phase daily waveforms in expression, in the pituitary gland (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d</xref>) (Table S9). Only <italic>ARNTL1</italic>, but not <italic>PER3</italic> nor <italic>DIO2</italic>, had a rhythmic waveform in the MBH (Table S9; Fig. S5). Consistent with the previous study, <italic>FSH</italic>β expression was higher at the spring equinox compared to all other photoperiod groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). <italic>PRL</italic> expression was higher in long photoperiod (16L) compared to the two equinox and short photoperiod (8L) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). <italic>FSH</italic>β did not display a daily rhythm, which is likely due to the absence of D-box and E-box motifs in the <italic>FSH</italic>β promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). <italic>FSH</italic>β promoter does contain many DNA motifs that are targeted by several transcription factors that are responsive to hormonal and nutrient pathways indicating multiple upstream regulators are recruited to drive transcription (Table S10). These data support the conjecture that a long-term programmed increase in <italic>FSH</italic>β occurs under spring non-stimulatory photoperiod, and it is not driven by short-term daily photic cues.</p>

<title><italic>FSH</italic><bold>β</bold> expression establishes endogenously programmed photosensitivity</title>
<p>To identify if <italic>FSH</italic>β expression is driven by an endogenously programmed mechanism or in response to the gradual increase in light, adult quail were exposed to the 8L, 10v or 12v light schedules or kept in 8L for an additional 4 weeks (8Lext) (Fig. S6). The 8Lext treatment permitted confirmation whether <italic>FSH</italic>β expression would increase in that photoperiod, and therefore reflect an interval timing mechanism. <italic>FSH</italic>β expression increased 19-fold after 4 additional weeks of 8L suggesting that endogenous drivers initiate transcription despite no change in daylength (P&lt;0.05) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). But the dominant stimulator of <italic>FSH</italic>β expression was the transition to 10v and 12v photoperiod, which both expressed significantly increased levels compared to 8L (P&lt;0.001). These data demonstrate that both photoperiod and endogenous timing mechanisms drive <italic>FSH</italic>β expression in the pars distalis. It is likely that an additive function of endogenous timing and the spring increase in photoperiod drive <italic>FSH</italic>β expression.</p>

<p>As Opn5 was identified in the pituitary transcriptome, we then assessed its transcript expression across the photoperiod treatments. We discovered that Opn5 expression patterns paralleled <italic>FSH</italic>β suggesting the potential for direct light detection by Opn5 and subsequent regulation of <italic>FSH</italic>β expression. Based on <italic>FSH</italic>β promoter analyses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>), we examined the expression of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (<italic>MEF2a</italic>) expression as a potential upstream regulator of <italic>FSH</italic>β expression. <italic>MEF2a</italic> remained relatively constant suggesting this transcription factor binding protein is not the primary driver of <italic>FSH</italic>β expression (Fig. S6). Similarly, <italic>DNMT3a</italic> expression did not change across photoperiod treatments (Fig. S6) suggesting that epigenetic modifications (i.e., DNA methylation) may not provide the endogenous programmed change leading to constitutive <italic>FSH</italic>β expression. The precise molecular change upstream from <italic>FSH</italic>β transcription remains to be identified. In the MBH, <italic>DIO3</italic> displayed a rapid reduction in expression after transfer to 10v and was found to be significantly reduced in 12v photoperiod (P&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). There was a significant difference in MBH <italic>DIO2</italic> expression (Fig. S6), but this observation was driven by a decrease in 8ext. Interestingly, <italic>GNRH</italic> in the preoptic area was found to significantly increase after extended exposure to short photoperiods (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). These data indicate that endogenous switches in <italic>FSH</italic>β, and possibly <italic>GNRH</italic> expression, in response to short photoperiods may reflect multiple independent cellular timers that establish a physiological state of photosensitivity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This report used the well-characterised photoperiodic manipulation of the Japanese quail avian photoperiodic response using a laboratory-based light-schedule that accurately replicated findings from birds held in semi-natural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Robinson and Follett, 1982</xref>). The data reported herein demonstrate that photoperiods less that 12hrs light induce gonadal involution. Prolonged exposure to short photoperiods (i.e., 8L) were found to significantly increase <italic>DIO3</italic> expression and vimentin immunoreactivity in the median eminence. Increased <italic>DIO3</italic> expression and innervation of tanycytes occurred after gonadal regression suggesting that another unidentified mechanism is involved in the initiation of the termination in the breeding state. The gradual increase in photoperiods during the spring transition was found to be associated with a marked increase in <italic>FSH</italic>β expression in the pars distalis while lower levels of <italic>TSH</italic>β expression in the pars tuberalis were maintained. As photoperiods increase there is a steady elevation in <italic>FSH</italic>β expression, but vimentin immunoreactivity in the median eminence did not decline until after the critical daylength for photostimulation (i.e., 12L:12D) thus the release of FSH is prevented as daylengths are below the critical threshold. Previous reports established that <italic>TSH</italic>β expression is significantly increased during the period of photoinducibility in quail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nakao et al., 2008</xref>). Although the present study did not directly examine photoinduction, <italic>TSH</italic>β expression was consistently elevated in long day photoperiod (i.e., 16L). The patterns of expression suggest that stimulatory daylengths longer than 12hr induce thyrotropes to increase <italic>TSH</italic>β leading to a cascade of molecular events in the MBH that permit GnRH to stimulate gonadotropes to release FSHβ and initiate gonadal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nakao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yoshimura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yamamura et al., 2004</xref>). Note that other pituitary cell types, somatotropes and corticotropes do not appear to show any molecular switches across the photoperiodic phases. These findings uncover a two-component mechanism for the cellular basis of the external coincidence model for the avian photoperiodic response (Fig. S7). Increase <italic>FSH</italic>β expression establishes a state of photosensitivity to stimulatory day length, and <italic>TSH</italic>β thryotropes in the pars tuberalis monitor daylength and when light stimulation occurs during a period of photoinducibility, initiate gonadal development. The two-component model is exciting as it accommodates evidence for endogenous growth of quail gonads in the absence of photostimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Follett and Sharp, 1969</xref>). Moreover, a TSH<italic>-</italic>independent programmed change in <italic>FSH</italic>β expression addresses how seasonal rhythms in tropical, non-photoperiod birds can be regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gwinner and Dittami, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>The photoperiodic induction of gonadal growth in quail is dependent on circadian timing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Follett and Sharp, 1969</xref>). However, only a few proximal promoters of photoperiodic genes contain D-box elements required for circadian timing input and include eyes absent-3 (<italic>EYA3</italic>) and <italic>TSH</italic>β, but not <italic>FSH</italic>β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Liddle et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, E-box elements are only identified in the proximal promoter of <italic>EYA3</italic>. The presence of E- and D-boxes provides a clear molecular mechanism by which the circadian clock can control the long photoperiod induced expression of these highly photoperiodic genes. Conversely, <italic>FSH</italic>β expression did not show diurnal variation and instead maintained constitutive expression across long (16L:8D), short (8L:16D), and the ‘equinox’ (12L:12D) photoperiodic conditions. We used a broad, unbiased bioinformatic approach to identify putative transcriptional bindings sites that may regulate <italic>FSH</italic>β expression. We identified several potential transcriptional binding proteins and <italic>MEF2</italic> motifs were observed across multiple promoters of genes for transcripts in the pars distalis and pars nervosa of the pituitary gland. However, functional analyses are necessary to establish a causal link between these newly identified signalling pathways (e.g., MEF2) and the seasonal regulation of transcript expression.</p>
<p>The high-dimensionality and high-frequency analyses of seasonal transition in physiology used in this study, facilitated the ability to uncover that photoperiod differentially regulates two endocrine systems: reproduction and energy balance. <italic>POMC</italic> has well described roles in the neuroendocrine regulation of food intake and body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yeo and Heisler, 2012</xref>). We found that <italic>POMC</italic> expression increased in response to short photoperiods and was associated with delayed body mass and adipose tissue growth. Interestingly, there was a gradual increase in body mass and adipose tissue mass during the transition for short photoperiod to the spring equinox despite elevated levels of <italic>POMC</italic> expression (i.e., adipose). <italic>POMC</italic> levels did not decrease until after exposure to stimulatory long photoperiods. Given the consistent photoperiod-induced change in <italic>POMC</italic> expression across animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Helfer and Stevenson, 2020</xref>), these data provide significant insight into the temporal regulation of the central, and peripheral control of seasonal energy balance. As the closely related European quail (<italic>Coturnix coturnix</italic>) are migratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dorst, 1956</xref>; Bertin et al., 2007), the increased fattening observed early in the spring transition may reflect a conserved seasonal physiological response to ensure energy stores are provided for migration.</p>
<p>The integration of environmental cues to time breeding in birds varies between male and female birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ball and Ketterson, 2008</xref>; Tolla and Stevenson 2022). In most temperate breeding males, full reproductive development can be achieved in response to photoperiod cues. The robust change in gonadal growth and involution provides a powerful approach to identify the key neuroendocrine mechanisms that govern the avian photoperiodic response. Despite ovarian changes in response to photoperiodic manipulations, female birds generally require other supplemental cues (e.g., temperature, social cues) to attain full reproductive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wingfield, 1980</xref>). In female, white-crowned sparrows (<italic>Zonotrichia leucophrys</italic>), increased photoperiod induces ovarian development to a pre-breeding state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Farner et al., 1966</xref>), and supplementary cues, such as temperature, can modify ovarian growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wingfield et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wingfield et al., 2003</xref>). In Corsica, two populations of great tits (<italic>Parus major</italic>) differ in egg laying date by up to one-month despite males from both regions displaying similar timing in reproductive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Caro et al., 2006</xref>). As the initial predictive environmental cue (i.e., photoperiod) times reproduction similarly in both male and female birds, the data provided in this paper provides key insights into the fundamental mechanisms that govern transitions in the hypothalamo-pituitary control of reproduction. However, studies that seek to understand how supplementary cues (e.g., temperature) are integrated to fine tune the timing of reproduction will require a focus on female birds.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these studies provide a comprehensive transcriptome dataset that can facilitate ecological studies that seek to uncover the molecular substrates which environmental cues, such as temperature, impact phenological timing and mistiming in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Visser and Gienapp, 2019</xref>). The observation for photoperiod-independent regulation of <italic>FSH</italic>β expression provides a new cellular mechanism in which supplementary environmental cues, such as temperature, can regulate the timing of seasonal reproduction. For example, the marked population differences in Great tit laying dates in Corsica, despite similar daylength cues, might be driven by local temperatures cues acting on <italic>FSH</italic>β expression to advance, or delay follicular maturation. Overall, the data indicate a multi-cellular, multi-neural interval timing mechanism resides in the brain and has significant implications for understanding species-specific seasonal transitions in life-histories.</p>

<title>Study 1 – Photoperiod-induced transition in seasonal life history states</title>
<p>Male quail (N=108) were housed in a summer-like long-day (LD) photoperiod (16L:8D). To mimic the autumnal decline and subsequent spring increase in the annual photoperiodic cycle, birds were exposure to a sequential change in day length from 16L (16a), to 14L (14a), to 12L (12a), to 10L (10a), to 8L, then back to 10L (10v), to 12L (12v), to 14L (14v) and lastly 16L (16v)(Fig.1a). Each photoperiod treatment lasted for 2 weeks to minimize the impact of photoperiodic history effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Stevenson et al., 2012a</xref>). At the end of each photoperiodic treatment a subset of quail (n=12) body mass was used as a measure to pseudo randomly select birds for tissue collection and served to reduce the potential for unintentional bias. Birds were killed by cervical dislocation followed by jugular cut. A jugular blood sample was collected in 50ul heparinized tubes (Workhardt, UK) and stored at −20°C. Brain and pituitary stalk were rapidly dissected, frozen on powdered dry ice and stored at −80°C. Testes were dissected and weighed to the nearest 0.001g using the Sartorius microbalance (Sartorius, Germany). The length and width of the testes were measured using callipers and volumes were calculated using the equation for a spheroid (4/3 × 3.14 × [L/2] × [W/2]2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">King et al., 1997</xref>). Body mass was measured using an Ohaus microscale to the nearest 0.1g. Fat score was assessed using the common scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wingfield and Farner (1978)</xref>.

<title>Study 2 – Daily rhythms in molecular profiles during solstices and equinoxes</title>
<p>To investigate the daily molecular representation of summer-like and winter-like solstices and the autumnal and spring equinoxes, Japanese quail (N=188) were subjected to the same photoperiodic treatments described in Study 1. A subset of quail was pseudo randomly selected after the autumnal 12L:12D (n=47), short day 8L:16D (n=48), spring 12L:12D (n=46) and long day 16L:8D (n=47) treatment conditions. For each of the four photoperiodic treatment conditions, five-six birds were collected shortly after lights on (Zeitgeber time (zt) 0), and then every three hours for twenty-four-hour period. This resulted in a high frequency daily sampling period that included zt0, zt3, zt6, zt9, zt12, zt15, zt18, and zt21. Brain, pituitary gland, and liver was extracted and stored at −80°C.

<p>Male quail (N=24) were housed in LD (16L:8D) photoperiod for 2 days, and then day length was decreased to 12hr for one day, and then 8L for six weeks. A subset of quail was killed by decapitation followed by exsanguination and established the photoregressed 8L group (n=6). A subset of birds (n=6) was maintained in short day photoperiods for four more weeks (8Lext). This group of birds provided the ability to examine whether an endogenous increase in <italic>FSH</italic>β expression would occur in constant short day photoperiod condition. The other twelve birds were transitioned to the 10L:14D (10v) light treatment for 2 weeks and another subset of birds were collected (n=6). The last subset of birds was transitioned to 12L:12D (12v) for two weeks and were then killed (n=6). For all birds, the brain and pituitary glands were dissected and immediately frozen in dry ice and then placed at −80°C. This experimental design provided the ability to examine endogenous changes in pituitary cell function via the 8Lext group, and the photoinduced increase in photosensitivity (i.e., 10v and 12v).</p>

<title>Hypothalamic and pituitary dissection</title>
<p>During brain extraction the pituitary stalk was severed. The procedure leaves pituitary gland components of the pars intermedia, pars distalis and pars nervosa resting in the sphenoid bone.

Brains were placed ventral surface in an upward direction. For the anterior hypothalamus/preoptic area a 2mm diameter from 2mm brain slice was collected. The rostral edge of the optic nerve was identified and then a 1mm cut in the rostral and 1mm cut in the caudal direction was performed. Brain slices were checked to confirm the presence of the tractus septomesencephalicus in the rostral section and the decussation supraoptica dorsalis in the caudal section. These anatomical regions reliably capture the GnRH neuronal population in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Stevenson and Ball, 2009</xref>).

<p>To identify potential links between transcription factors identified using bioinformatic tests, and transcriptome data, we examined binding motifs in the FSHβ promoter. The upstream promotor sequence of 3500 bp (−3500 to 0) of Japanese quail FSHβ was obtained from Ensemble (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/index.html">http://www.ensembl.org/index.html</ext-link>). This promotor sequence was analysed by CiiDER transcription binding factor (TBFs) analysis tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gearing et al., 2019</xref>) against JASPER core database. DNA motifs in the promoter were unique for 470 transcription binding factors. The top 80 transcription binding factors were then subjected to PANTHER gene ontology enrichment analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mi et al., 2013</xref>). Several pathways were discovered and included hormone responsive, epigenetic and responsive to nutrients (Table S10).</p>

<title>Immunocytochemistry and histological analyses</title>
<p>Snap frozen brains from experiment 1 were sectioned at 20µm using a cryostat (CM1850, Leica). The tissues sections were collected in supercharged slides (631-0108, VWR) and stored in −80c till processed for staining. We used mouse monoclonal antibody (OAAEE00561, Aviva systems) raised against the Human vimentin gene (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_003371.2). The antibody has been shown to specifically bind with vimentin expressed in avian cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.avivasysbio.com/vim-antibody-oaee00561.html">https://www.avivasysbio.com/vim-antibody-oaee00561.html</ext-link>). Human and quail vimentin peptide show high similarity of 86.96% similarity. <italic>In silico</italic> analyses using BLAST confirmed that the antibody sequence is specific to vimentin. The next closest protein had 68% similarity (i.e., desmin) which is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle. We used Goat Anti-mouse Alexa Flour488 (A11001, Invitrogen) for the secondary antibody. As negative control procedures, we performed omission of primary antibody and omission of secondary antibody.</p>
<p>Immunocytochemistry was performed using the standard immunofluorescence protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Majumdar et al., 2015</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, sections (brain) in slides were first enclosed in margin using ImmEdge pen (H-4000, Vector Labs). The sections were then first post fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (5735, ThermoScientific) for 4 hours. After fixing, the sections were washed (3 times; 5 min each) with TBS (phosphate buffer saline with 0.2% triton). Then they were blocked in 20% Bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS for 1 hour at room temperature (RT). Subsequently the blocking solution was removed by pipetting and the sections were incubated with primary antibody (1:300 dilution) for 2 hours at RT and finally overnight at 4°C. The next day, sections were first washed with TBS (3 times; 5 min each) and then incubated with secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) for 2 hours at RT. Finally, the sections were again washed with TBS (3 times; 5 min each) and mounted in Fluromount-G mounting media with DAPI (004959-52, Invitrogen). The dried slides were visualized using Leica DM4000B fluorescence microscope equipped with Leica DFC310 FX camera. Leica Application Suite (LAS) software was used for image acquisition. All the images were taken at constant exposure for the FITC channel at 10X and 20X magnification.</p>
<p>For analysis and quantification of % area, ImageJ version 1.53j was used. For this, 20X images were first converted into greyscale images (8 bit) and a threshold applied. The threshold was determined using the triangle method on multiple randomly selected images and applied for all the images. The scale of measurement in ImageJ was then set to CM in 300pixels/cm scale. A region of interest in the median eminence and dorsal 3rdV ependymal layer was specified as 300*500 pixels (1*1.67 cm scaled units) and area fraction was measured. At least 3 images from each animal were measured and averaged for each bird. A total of 27 quail were used and distributed evenly across photoperiod treatments (n=3).</p>

<title>Statistical analyses and figure presentation</title>
<p>GLM tests were conducted to test for statistical significance. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction was applied to testes mass, body mass, fat score, vimentin immunoreactivity and qPCR analyses in Study 1. Two-way ANOVAs with photoperiod and zeitgebers main effects were conducted on qPCR analyses in Study 2. One-way ANOVAs were conducted for qPCR data in Study 3. qPCR data were log-transformed if violation of normality was detected. Significance was determined at P&lt;0.05. Figures were generated using AdobeIllustrator and BioRender was used to create images in panels Fig1d,n; Fig3e and Fig. S7.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> article provides insights into the neural centers and hormonal modulations underlying seasonal changes associated with photoperiod-induced life-history states in birds. The physiological and transcriptomic analyses of the mediobasal hypothalamus and pituitary gland offer <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for a timing mechanism for measuring day length, which is relevant for the field of seasonal biology. The study's experiments and findings have the potential to captivate the attention of molecular and organismal endocrinologists and chronobiologists.</p>

<p>This study is carefully designed and well executed, including a comprehensive suite of endpoint measures and large sample sizes that give confidence in the results. The authors have satisfactorily addressed my concerns. Specifically, the new graphical description of the experimental design along a timeline will be very helpful in guiding the reader through the paper. The narrative style is much improved and highly technical terminology is minimized. The authors now also address the question of sex differences, which will be important to study in future research. The additional analyses carried out by the authors are illuminating.</p>

<p>It is well known that as seasonal day length increases, molecular cascades in the brain are triggered to ready an individual for reproduction. Some of these changes, however, can begin to occur before the day length threshold is reached, suggesting that short days similarly have the capacity to alter aspects of phenotype. This study seeks to understand the mechanisms by which short days can accomplish this task, which is an interesting and important question in the field of organismal biology and endocrinology.</p>
<p>The set of studies that this manuscript presents is comprehensive and well-controlled. Many of the effects are also strong and thus offer tantalizing hints about the endo-molecular basis by which short days might stimulate major changes in body condition. Another strength is that the authors put together a compelling model for how different facets of an animal's reproductive state come &quot;on line&quot; as day length increases and spring approaches. In this way, I think the authors broadly fulfill their aims.</p>

<p>Comment 3 - There is a general consensus among the reviewers on three key aspects. Firstly, the article would greatly benefit from a clearer layout of the experimental design and methodology, potentially including schematics to help readers comprehend the complexity and details of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the feedback from Reviewer 2 in particular. We have added a new schematic for Experiment 3 (see PUBLIC REVIEWS Reviewer #2 Comment 2). We have also revised the Results section by including subheadings and additional text to help explain the methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 4 - Secondly, conducting a more comprehensive analysis of the available dataset, utilizing tools such as WGCNA to explore gene co-expression networks beyond specific genes, is recommended. Additionally, it is advised to exercise greater caution when discussing the limitations of the employed methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The suggestion for the WGCNA is excellent and very much appreciated. The revised manuscript includes WGCNA for both the MBH and pituitary gland. See Figures S3 &amp; Table S6 and lines 166-182; 497-505).</p>

<p>Comment 5 - Thirdly, expanding the results section to create a more engaging narrative that guides readers through the numerous findings, and extending the discussion and conclusions to emphasize the ecological relevance of learning photoperiodic/seasonal responses and highlighting the presented model, would be valuable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These were excellent suggestions that significantly improved the clarity and quality of the manuscript.

<p>Comment 6 - Finally, please pay close attention to the comment on the statistical analysis provided by Rev#2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is unclear why the Benjamini-Hochberg’s FDR analyses was suggested. The statistical test is a version of the Bonferroni test but is less stringent. We prefer to use conservative tests (i.e., Bonferroni correction). Moreover, the Bonferroni correction is the commonly used statistical tests in the field. To be consistent with the field and to be careful in our statistical approach, the revised manuscript did not change the post-hoc correction.</p>

<p><bold>PUBLIC REVIEWS:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1 - The authors investigated the molecular correlates in potential neural centers in the Japanese quail brain associated with photoperiod-induced life-history states. The authors simulated photoperiod to attain winter and summer-like physiology and samples of neural tissues at spring, and autumn life-history states, daily rhythms in transcripts in solstices and equinox, and lastly studies FSHb transcripts in the pituitary. The experiments are based on a series of changes in photoperiod and gave some interesting results. The experiment did not have a control for no change in photoperiod so it seems possible that endogenous rhythms could be another aspect of seasonal rhythms that lack in this study. The short-day group does not explain the endogenous seasonal response.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for the fair assessment of the manuscript. The statement ‘the experiment did not have a control for no change in photoperiod’ is not clear to us. We think the Reviewer is arguing that prolonged constant photoperiod was not conducted to examine circannual timing in avian reproduction. The constant short photoperiod in Exp3 does provide the ability to examine the initial stages of interval timing. A different endogenous mechanism used by animals. The revised manuscript has clarified the different physiological responses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2 - The manuscript would benefit from further clarity in synthesizing different sections. Additionally, there are some instances of unclear language and numerous typos throughout the manuscript. A thorough revision is recommended, including addressing sentence structure for improved clarity, reframing sentences where necessary, correcting typos, conducting a grammar check, and enhancing overall writing clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have incorporated the suggestions from both Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 that aimed to increase the clarity of the manuscript. We have provided detailed responses to each comment below and state how each comment was incorporated in the revised manuscript. We also had the manuscript reviewed by a colleague to help identify issues associated with sentence structure, grammar, and spelling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3 - Data analysis needs more clarity particularly how transcriptome data explains different physiological measures across seasonal life-history states. It seems the discussion is built around a few genes that have been studied in other published literature on quail seasonal response. Extending results on the promotor of DEGs and building discussion is an extrapolating discussion on limited evidence and seems redundant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A new statistical analysis (ie., WGCNA) was conducted to identify relations between photoperiod, physiology and transcripts. The focus on the few photoperiodic gene was kept in the discussion as the transcript expression is important to highlight the differences from the prevailing hypotheses and novel patterns of expression across seasonal timescales. See Figures S3 &amp; Table S6 and lines 166-182; 497-505).</p>

<p>Comment 4 - Last, I wondered if it would be possible to add an ecological context for the frequent change in the photoperiod schedule and not take account of the endogenous annual response. Adding discussion on ecological relevance would make more sense.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1 - This study is carefully designed and well executed, including a comprehensive suite of endpoint measures and large sample sizes that give confidence in the results. I have a few general comments and suggestions that the authors might find helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the Reviewers support for our manuscript. We have endeavoured to incorporate all suggestions in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2 - I found it difficult to fully grasp the experimental design, including the length of light treatment in the three different experiments (which appears to extend from 2 weeks up to 8 weeks). A graphical description of the experimental design along a timeline would be very helpful to the reader. I suggest adding the respective sample sizes to such a graphic, because this information is currently also difficult to keep track of.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have created a new figure panel to address the Reviewer’s concern. See figure S4 panel ‘a’. The new schematic representation was designed to illustrate the similarity in experimental design used in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. But clearly illustrates the extended short photoperiod manipulation (4 weeks and not 8 weeks). We added the sample sizes to initial drafts but felt the added text hindered the clarity of the schematic representation (particularly for Fig1a). The sample sizes for each experiment and treatment are provided in the raw data provided in the supplementary Table 1. For this reason, we have opted to not add the sample size to each diagram. We hope that the Reviewer will understand our perspective.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3 - The authors use a lot of terminology that is second nature to a chronobiologist but may be difficult for the general reader to keep track of. For example, what is the difference between &quot;photoinducibility&quot; and &quot;photosensitivity&quot;? Similarly, &quot;vernal&quot; and &quot;autumnal&quot; should be briefly explained at the outset, or maybe simply say &quot;spring equinox&quot; and &quot;fall equinox.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very helpful suggestion, and we thank the Reviewer. Two changes were made to the manuscript to address this comment. First, we revised the second introductory paragraph to describe the photoperiodic response and the terms used. Second, we have removed all reference to ‘vernal’ and replaced with ‘spring’. We opted to keep ‘autumn’ as the change to ‘fall’ did not provide the clarity of seasonal state in some statements (as fall is also used as a downward direction).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 4 What was the rationale for using only male birds in this study? The authors may want to include a brief discussion on whether the expected results for females might be similar to or different from what they found in males, and why.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer’s position that studies should include, or least describe, male and female biology. We have revised the text to address this comment. In the methods, we provide 2 sentences that state the photoperiodic response is the same for both male and females, and why males were selected. See lines (352-355). Then, in the discussion, we describe why females will be important to study how other supplementary environmental cues impact seasonal timing of reproduction. See lines (312-330; and 334-339).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 5 - The authors used the Bonferroni correction method to account for multiple hypothesis testing of measures of testes mass, body mass, fat score, vimentin immunoreactivity and qPCR analyses in Study 1. I don't think Bonferroni is ever appropriate for biological data: these methods assume that all variables are independent of each other, an assumption that is almost never warranted in biology. In fact, the data show clear relationships between these endpoint measures. Alternatively, one might use Benjamini-Hochberg's FDR correction or various methods for calculating the corrected alpha level.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This concern is not clear to us. The Benjamini-Hochberg’s FDR is a slight modification of the Bonferroni correction. Moreover, the FDR is a less-stringent statistical test compared to the Bonferroni correction. We prefer to keep the Bonferroni approach to correct for multiple tests for two reasons. First, this test is commonly used in the field of chronobiology, and second, the Bonferroni correction is more conservative. We hope the Reviewer will appreciate our perspective to be consistent with the research field and higher stringency in our statistical approach.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 6 - The graphical interpretations of the results shown in Figure 1n and Figure 3e, along with the hypothesized working model shown in Figure S5, might best be combined into a single figure that becomes part of the Discussion. As is, I do not think these interpretative graphics (which are well done and super helpful!) are appropriate for the Results section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestion. During the revision we developed a single figure to show the graphical representation for the respective experiments. Unfortunately, we found the single source to be very difficult to provide a clear description and overview of the findings. We feel that the interpretations, (admittedly unusual for Results section) are best placed in the respective figures that correspond to the different experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1a - It is well known that as seasonal day length increases, molecular cascades in the brain are triggered to ready an individual for reproduction. Some of these changes, however, can begin to occur before the day length threshold is reached, suggesting that short days similarly have the capacity to alter aspects of phenotype. This study seeks to understand the mechanisms by which short days can accomplish this task, which is an interesting and important question in the field of organismal biology and endocrinology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for their positive feedback.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 1b - The set of studies that this manuscript presents is comprehensive and well-controlled. Many of the effects are also strong and thus offer tantalizing hints about the endo-molecular basis by which short days might stimulate major changes in body condition. Another strength is that the authors put together a compelling model for how different facets of an animal's reproductive state come &quot;on line&quot; as day length increases and spring approaches. In this way, I think the authors broadly fulfill their aims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for the positive support of our research and manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 1c - I do, however, also think that there are a few weaknesses that the authors should consider, or that readers should consider when evaluating this manuscript. First, some of the molecular genetic analyses should be interpreted with greater caution. By bioinformatically showing that certain DNA motifs exist within a gene promoter (e.g., FSHbeta), one is not generating robust evidence that corresponding transcription factors actually regulate the expression of the gene in question. In fact, some may argue that this line of evidence only offers weak support for such a conclusion. I appreciate that actually running the laboratory experiments necessary to generate strong support for these types of conclusions is not trivial, and doing so may even be impossible. I would therefore suggest a clear admission of these limitations in the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer’s position. The transcription binding protein analyses was used as a means to identify potential factors involved in the regulation of transcript expression. We have written a new paragraph to address this comment. In the discussion, we that highlight the links between the well characterised circadian regulation of photoperiodic transcripts (e.g, D- &amp; E-box elements and the photoperiodic control of TSHβ. We also indicate that our bioinformatic approach identified potentially new transcription binding motifs, and provide a clear admission and state that functional analyses are required to determine necessity of these pathways (e.g., MEF2). See lines 293-295.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2 - Second, I have another issue with the interpretation of data presented in Figure 3. The data show that FSHbeta increases in expression in the 8Lext group, suggesting that endogenous drivers likely act to increase the expression of this gene despite no change in day length. However, more robust effects are reported for FSHbeta expression in the 10v and 12v groups, even compared to the 8Lext group. Doesn't this suggest that both endogenous mechanisms and changes in day length work together to ramp up FSHbeta? The rest of the paper seemed to emphasize endogenous mechanisms and gloss over the fact that such mechanisms likely work additively with other factors. I felt like there was more nuance to these findings than the authors were getting into.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer and a similar concern was raised by Reviewer 1. Our aim was to highlight that FSH expression increased in constant short photoperiod. We have revised the manuscript to address the concern raised by the Reviewer. We have added 2 sentences in the results to highlight the additive role of endogenous timing and photoperiodic effects on FSH expression (see lines 223-226). We have kept the text that describes endogenous increases in expression (e.g., FSH/GnRH) in response to short photoperiod in the manuscript as this observation is not influenced by long photoperiod.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3 - Third, studies 1 - 3 are well controlled; however, I'm left wondering how much of an effect the transitions in day length might have on the underlying molecular processes that mediate changes in body condition. While the changes in day length are themselves ecologically relevant, the transitions between day length states are not. How do we know, for example, that more gradual changes in day length that occur over long timespans do not produce different effects at the levels of the brain and body? This seemed especially relevant for study 3, where animals experience a rather sudden change in day length. I recognize that these experimental methods are well described in the literature, and they have been used by endocrinologists for a long time; nonetheless, I think questions remain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are two points raised in this comment. First, the effect of transition in day length on body condition. We are investigating the impact of photoperiodic transitions on body condition. The ongoing project has examined the changes in tissue lipid content and conducted transcriptomic analyses of multiple peripheral tissues involved in energy balance. Although we made an initial attempt to combine all the findings into a single manuscript, the large datasets resulted in an overwhelming manuscript that lacked clarity. Instead, we have opted for two manuscripts that focus on the respective physiological systems. Those data should be published shortly. We did expand the discussion by developing a single paragraph that focused on the pattern of POMC expression and changes in quail body mass and adipose tissue. See lines 300-311.</p>
<p>Second, the Reviewer raised the issue of more gradual changes in day length over longer timespans. The day length and duration of exposure selected was to replicate previously used photoperiod manipulations to ensure reproducibility in research programmes, and to reduce the impact of photoperiod history (see lines 367-369). The present manuscript is the first study in birds to examine multiple intervening (ie within the extreme long- and short-photoperiods) day length conditions and we feel this is a major and novel contribution to the field. We agree that other time points (e.g., 13L:11D), or quicker/longer timespans could provide additional insight into the molecular mechanisms that govern seasonal transitions in reproduction/energy balance. The question raised by the Reviewer requires the types of studies that use natural conditions from wild-caught animals (or semi-natural laboratory settings) and beyond the focus of the current manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1 - Abstract: Overall abstract needs more clarity in rationale, hypothesis, and result outcomes. How this study advances our knowledge in seasonal/ photoperiodic regulation of reproduction in birds. Particularly what knowledge gap FSHb results fill in.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have substantially revised the abstract considering the Reviewer’s suggestions. The abstract has clarified the rationale, hypothesis and results outcomes. We have also added new introductory and concluding statements that place the work into a wider ecological context (as suggested below).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2 - In general the introduction needs more clarity and doesn't seem to cover the ecological relevance of learning photoperiodic/seasonal response.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer the introduction could be improved. We have substantially revised the introduction with an aim to increase the clarity. This involved an addition on the ecological context, clarification of the photoperiodic states in birds, and a description of the general and specific objectives. Note we did not include an introduction to ‘learning’ of the photoperiodic response, as the term implies a cognitive component is involved which is incorrect. See lines (61-67, 71-74, 80-86, and 100-105).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3 - Line 58: What does the author mean by &quot;future seasonal environment&quot; Is it to introduce change in climate or future seasonal events? This sentence needs rephrasing and more clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to Comment 2, we have revised the introductory paragraph and the sentence was removed from the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 4 - Line 63: I would recommend the use of circannual rhythms with caution for the kind of experiments authors have proposed. The approach used here is beyond the scope of addressing circannual endogenous rhythms, which can be tested only independent of photoperiod change.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer’s concern. The use of circannual rhythms was limited to the first paragraph (lines 56-63) only to introduce the concept of endogenous rhythmicity. We were careful to not use the term ‘circannual’ for the rest of the manuscript, as the Reviewer has indicated, would be inappropriate. We have retained the use of ‘endogenous program’ to refer to the molecular and physiological changes that can occur independent of photoperiod change (ie Experiment 3). In this case, the use of endogenous is appropriate as this form of timing adheres to an interval timer. We also provided a definition for interval timer and ecological examples to illustrate the difference between circannual rhythms and annual interval timer (see lines 71-74). We also reviewed the entire manuscript to ensure the distinction for the endogenous program was clear.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 5 - Another aspect authors missed is that Quail is not an absolute photorefractory (Robinson and Follett, 1982).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that quail are not absolute photorefractory (but instead relative photorefractory). As our photoperiod manipulations do not address criterion 1, or criterion 2 of the avian photoperiodic response (MacDougall-Shackelton et al., 2009; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icp048">https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icp048</ext-link>), we feel that adding the type of photorefractory response would be a distraction and reduce the clarity of the concepts/experimental design described in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 6 - Line 223-234: &quot;Chicks were raised under constant light and constant heat lamp&quot;. Constant photoperiod experienced during development raises concern on how this pretreatment would shape the adult seasonal response, which could be different in the seasonal response of birds raised in natural photoperiod. If this is correct, the results shown are not tenable for birds inhabiting the natural environment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The light schedule used in our experiment is the most appropriate for laboratory reared chicks. The light schedule, use of an incubator and hatchery is commonly used in research laboratories. The procedure serves to increase the hatch rate and welfare of chicks. Undoubtedly there will be some early developmental programming effects on quail development. However, the gonadal response across all 3 experiments was consistent with the vast scientific literature on the avian photoperiodic response in both laboratory and wild birds. As the robust gonadal response clearly replicated previous studies, we are confident the results are tenable for birds inhabiting natural environments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 7 - Numerous studies done in mammals suggest that photoperiod experienced in the early life stage affects the circadian and seasonal response in adults (Ciarleglio et al., 2011, Perinatal photoperiod imprints the circadian clock, Nat Neurosceince; Stetson M., et al., 1986, Maternal transfer of photoperiodic information influences the photoperiodic response of prepubertal Djungarian hamsters).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that developmental programming in mammals is important for the photoperiodic response. However, there are vast differences between the avian and mammalian photoperiodic response. Critically, in mammals, the maternal transfer of information to the offspring is achieved via the melatonin hormone. Conversely, in birds, melatonin is not necessary, nor sufficient for photoperiodic time measurement (Juss et al., 1993; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1993.0121">https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1993.0121</ext-link>). It is not scientifically tenable to relate the mammalian and avian photoperiodic responses in adulthood based on early developmental programs. For this reason, we did not introduce or discuss developmental programming in our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 8 - Please give details on the month in which these birds were exposed to different short and long photoperiods. It is not clear in the method section. The birds experience long to short day transition and then back to long day in 16 weeks (~ 4 months). The annual cycle is ~12 months long in nature. Again, what is the ecological relevance of such an experimental paradigm. This could give some idea on photoperiodic response, but not on how the endogenous annual cycle would respond.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Birds were delivered in September 2019 and 2020. (We have added these details to the manuscript (see lines 351-352). We agree with the Reviewer that the ecological relevance of the experimental design is limited. Our focus was to use laboratory conditions and well characterised photoperiodic manipulations to examine the role of the environmental, initial predictive cue to time seasonal transitions in reproduction. The 2-week duration for each photoperiod state in Experiment 1 provides the ability to eliminate the impact of photoperiodic history (see lines 367-369; Stevenson et al., 2012a) and reduce the time necessary for the research project. As described above in Comment #4 – we did not examine the endogenous annual cycle – but instead focused on an endogenous interval timer. Experiment 3 was designed to best examine an endogenous interval timer.</p>

<p>The RIN values from our extraction protocol reliably produce RIN values &gt;9.0.

The Reviewer is correct that MinION is portable, however, more than one sample can be run at a time. We stated in the text (lines 454-460) that birds were counterbalanced across Flow cells so that each sequencing run had 9 samples, one from each treatment group.

<p>We agree that a positive control (ie primary Ab) is the gold standard to support specificity of the antibody. Unfortunately, we have not found a supplier of the epitope for quail/chicken vimentin. We have conducted another in silico analysis an established that the sequences for the vimentin antibody is specific for vimentin. The next closest sequence alignment is only 68% for a protein that is not expressed in the brain. The immunoreactive pattern observed in our histology reproduces work from mammalian models in which the epitope is available.

<p>Comment 17 - It is a bit unclear why the author used cherry-picking approach by talking about only a few genes that have been studied as key regulators of photoperiodic response in quail.

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that other statistical approaches could be conducted, and other genes could be discussed. However, we focussed on the key regulators of the photoperiodic response in quail as these are the well characterised genes. It is important that our discussion focused on these transcripts as most do not conform to the predicted patterns of expression. We feel it is best that we keep the focus on these genes.</p>

<p>Comment 18 - TSHb result is inconsistent with past studies, where TSHb is the first responder gene on photoinduction. The author did not pay attention to explaining it further in the discussion.</p>

<p>We respectfully disagree with the Reviewer. Our results are consistent with past studies and show that TSHβ expression is a molecular marker of long day photoperiod. Our study does not examine photoinduction; which does not provide the ability to compare between our study and previous work (eg., Nakao et al., 2008; see doi: 10.1038/nature06738). We have revised the text in consideration of the concern raised by the Reviewer. The text now states ‘Previous reports established that TSHβ expression is significantly increased during the period of photoinducibility in quail (Nakao et al., 2008). Although the present study did not directly examine photoinduction, TSHβ expression was consistently elevated in long day photoperiod (i.e., 16L).’. (see lines 262-265).</p>

<p>This comment is not clear to us, and we would incorporate a clarified comment in a revised manuscript. The increased expression of prolactin does not occur during the termination of breeding.

<p>Comment 22 - I think that it would be helpful to add a couple of caveats to provide more ecological context. First, the model is only based on males, and responses in females could be different.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer there are undoubtedly sex differences in timing seasonal biology. However, the photoperiodic response (growth and regression) is similar in both males and females. Sex differences exist in response to supplementary environmental cues (e.g., temperature). Males were used in these studies as the gonadal response to changes in photoperiod manipulations are much larger compared to ovarian changes in females. The focus on males allows for fewer animals to be used in the experiments and greater statistical power. To address the Reviewers concern, we have added a paragraph in the discussion that describes the similarity in photoperiodic responses in males and females, and the importance of supplementary cues for full reproductive development in female birds. We also provide a couple sentences in the methods that describe the justification for only males in the present study. See lines (Methods 352-355; Discussion 312-330; and 334-339).</p>

<p>Comment 23 - Last, I wondered if it would be possible to add an ecological context for the frequent change in the photoperiod schedule and not take account of the endogenous annual response. Would the procedure simulate a similar kind of underlined molecular response for a bird under natural conditions responding to changing daylight cycles on an annual time frame?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The discussion was considerably revised to address the ecological relevance of the study, and findings. We have added a sentence at the beginning of the discussion to highlight that the laboratory-based approach and photoperiodic manipulations reliable replicate previous findings using semi-natural conditions (Robinson and Follett, 1982) (See lines 248-250). We have already reduced the focus on the endogenous annual response.</p>

<p>Comment 1 - The writing is very terse and could benefit from a more narrating style, which would make it a lot easier for the reader to get through some of the very data-heavy text. Breaking up the Results with subheadings would also be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the suggestion to add subheadings to the Results. We added 3 descriptive headings for each other studies conducted in the manuscript. We feel the added revision (e.g., ecological) has improved the narrative and made the manuscript accessible to the wider readership.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2 - The transcriptome analyses could be developed a bit more. First, using the limma package would allow the authors to apply a more complete model to the DEG analyses, which would likely be superior to EdgeR. Second, the authors may want to consider WGCNA or a similar approach to discover gene co-expression modules, and then examine whether any of the resulting module eigengenes co-vary with any morphological or physiological measures and/or vary rhythmically.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent suggestion, and the new analyses was incorporated into the revised manuscript. Using the Langfelder and Horvath 2008 WCGNA package we conducted module-trait analyses to examine co-variation in our findings. These data are presented in Figure S# and lines 476-484. We agree that other DEG analyses would be useful; our main objectives was to use BioDare2.0 to identify rhythmic transcription in the seasonal transcriptomes. EdgR provides an excellent approach to identify transcripts and commonly used.</p>

<p>Comment 3 - In the Data and code availability statement (lines 226ff) the authors state that &quot;all raw data are available in Extended data Table 1.&quot; However, they should be submitted to the GEO database or a similar public repository along with all relevant metadata. Also, and maybe I overlooked this, I did not see anywhere that the &quot;R code used in Study 1 is freely available&quot; (I was not sure what &quot;the methods reference list&quot; was supposed to refer to). Instead of stating that &quot;the full R code used is available upon request&quot; I suggest making all scripts available via GitHub or Dataverse, along with all non-omics data. The advantage of the latter platform is that a citable DOI is assigned to each upload.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The data are now available in the GEO database and can be accessed see GSE241775. We have added this information to the text. The R code is now provided as a Table S11 so that the reader can directly access the script.</p>

<p>Comment 5 - Line 24f: What does &quot;pseudo-randomly&quot; mean? Maybe &quot;haphazardly&quot; would be more appropriate here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The term pseudo-randomly is used to describe the organized manner in which subjects are assigned to each treatment group. The aim is to ensure that a particular physiological variable, such as body mass, is evenly distributed across treatment groups. (Note although the term derived from the field of psychology). The aim is to reduce bias in the experiment due to an initial bias established when assigning treatment group. We are reluctant to replace pseudorandomly with haphazardly as the latter does not imply a logical organization. We have added text to help clarify the reason. The text now state: At the end of each photoperiodic treatment a subset of quail (n=12) body mass was used as a measure to pseudo randomly select birds for tissue collection and served to reduce the potential for unintentional bias.</p>

<p>Comment 6 - Figure 1e,j: The text indicates that 398 and 130 genes were &quot;rhythmically expressed&quot; in the MBH and pituitary, respectively, but considerably fewer genes are shown in the heatmaps in Figure 1e,j. How were these genes selected, and what was the rationale for doing so? Also, some autumnal and vernal expression patterns show some strong similarities (e.g., 16a and 16v in the MBH), which could be discussed. Consider showing the two heatmaps with the columns also hierarchically clustered in a supplementary figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that the full heatmap for the transcripts should be provided. The heat maps in Figure 1 are based on the transcripts with the most significant change; and were selected to provide a graphical representation that would be easily digested by the wide readership. We have created a new figure (ie. Fig. S1) that provides all the transcripts in heat maps for both the MBH and pituitary gland.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1 I do not have too much to add to this section of my review. Broadly speaking, I would suggest that the authors address some of the concerns I highlight above, and integrate their thoughts into the paper more than they currently do. I think this is particularly important with respect to the limitations of many of the bioinformatic analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their input and time assessing the manuscript. We have revised the manuscript in many sections incorporating the suggestions by Reviewer 3 above, and Reviewers 1 and 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2 Some of the methods are also a little scant. For example, the qPCR analyses are not described in sufficient detail to replicate the study. What are the efficiencies? Were samples run in duplicate? What was the housekeeping control gene used? Was there only one, or were multiple housekeeping genes used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologise for the oversight, the absence of information was a mistake that missed our previous early revisions. The revised manuscript includes all the requested information. Line 333 states that all samples were run in duplicate. The efficiency for each transcript was within the MIQE guidelines (indicated on line 342) and were within the 0.7 to 1.0 range. Actin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as the reference transcripts. The most stable reference transcript was used to calculate fold change in target gene expression (lines 343-345).</p>
