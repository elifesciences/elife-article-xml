<title>Abstract</title><p>Development of the oocyte requires physical contact with the surrounding granulosa cells of the follicle, which provide it with essential nutrients and regulatory signals. This contact is achieved through specialized filopodia, termed transzonal projections (TZPs), that extend from the granulosa cells to the oocyte surface. Transforming growth factor (TGFβ) family ligands produced by the oocyte increase the number of TZPs, but how they do so is unknown. Using an inducible Cre recombinase strategy together with expression of green fluorescent protein to verify Cre activity in individual granulosa cells, we examined the effect of depleting the canonical TGFβ mediator SMAD4. We observed a 20-50% decrease in the total number of TZPs in SMAD4-depleted granulosa cell-oocyte complexes, and a 50% decrease in the number of newly generated TZPs when the granulosa cells were reaggregated with granulosa cell-free wild-type oocytes. Three-dimensional image analysis revealed that TZPs of SMAD4-depleted cells were also longer than controls and more frequently oriented towards the oocyte. Strikingly, the transmembrane proteins, N-cadherin and Notch2, were reduced by 50% in these cells. SMAD4 may thus modulate a network of cell adhesion proteins that stabilize the attachment of TZPs to the oocyte, thereby amplifying signalling between the two cell types.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of a healthy oocyte within the ovarian follicle requires continuing contact between the germ cell and the somatic granulosa cells that surround it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Clarke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Doherty <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">El-Hayek &amp; Clarke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li &amp; Albertini, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Marchais <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Richani <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Robert, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xie <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Signals from the granulosa cells initiate the increase in volume of the oocyte when primordial (non-growing) follicles are activated to enter the growth phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nagamatsu <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saatcioglu <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Subsequently, the granulosa cells provide nucleotides, amino acids and pyruvate to the growing oocyte via gap junctions that connect the two cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Clarke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Marchais <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xie <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). When gap junctional communication between the two cell types is genetically disrupted, oocytes do not develop normally and cannot be fertilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carabatsos <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gittens &amp; Kidder, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Simon <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Winterhager &amp; Kidder, 2015</xref>). Once the oocyte reaches full-size, it acquires the ability to undergo the final stage of development, termed meiotic maturation, but is prevented from precociously doing so by cyclic GMP that is produced and transferred to it by the granulosa cells, also via gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jaffe &amp; Egbert, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Norris <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wigglesworth <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). In vitro, oocytes can develop normally when enclosed by granulosa cells but not when the granulosa cells are removed and provided in co-culture, further emphasizing the crucial importance of physical contact between the two cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Eppig, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Herta <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">O’Brien <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In primordial follicles, a single layer of squamous granulosa cells surrounds the oocyte and contact it via adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jorgensen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mora <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Following activation of growth, a glycoprotein-rich coat termed the zona pellucida becomes established around the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Litscher &amp; Wassarman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wassarman &amp; Litscher, 2018</xref>). The zona pellucida steadily thickens as growth continues, reaching a final thickness of about 7 μm in mice and 15 μm in humans. Despite the barrier imposed by the zona pellucida, the granulosa cells and oocyte maintain direct contact by a dense network of thin filopodia-like projections, termed transzonal projections (TZPs), that grow out from the granulosa cells through the zona pellucida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Albertini &amp; Rider, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baena &amp; Terasaki, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Clarke, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Macaulay <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Motta <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). The tips of the TZPs establish contact with the oocyte plasma membrane through heterotypic adherens junctions comprising N-cadherin (granulosa cell) and E-cadherin (oocyte) and harbour the gap junctions that link the two cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mora <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>) and likely also through focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">McGinnis &amp; Kinsey, 2015</xref>). New TZPs are generated throughout follicular growth, thereby increasing intercellular molecular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">El-Hayek <italic>et al</italic>, 2018a</xref>), and a genetically imposed decrease in the number of TZPs is associated with defects in oocyte gene expression and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Crozet <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Despite the essential role of TZPs during oocyte development in mammals and the presence of analogous structures in the ovarian follicles of non-mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kessel <italic>et al</italic>, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schroeder, 1981</xref>), the molecular mechanisms that govern their generation and stability are little understood.</p>
<p>The TGFβ signalling pathway regulates the functions and interactions of a wide range of cell types under various physiological and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Derynck &amp; Budi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Peng <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Binding of the ligand to a complex of type I and type II receptors located at the cell surface activates signalling within the cell, most commonly through the members of the SMAD family of transcription factors, although SMAD-independent signaling can also occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aashaq <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Derynck &amp; Budi, 2019</xref>). Upon phosphorylation of the tetrameric type II and type I receptors and subsequent phosphorylation of receptor-activated SMAD proteins (R-SMADs; SMAD1, 2, 3, 5 and 8), a heterotrimeric complex with SMAD4 is formed which enters the nucleus and regulates gene expression by binding to specific SMAD-binding DNA elements. Although R-SMADs can signal in the absence of SMAD4, evidence indicates that the presence of SMAD4 in the heterotrimer amplifies TGFβ cell signalling by stabilizing the complex and by favouring the binding of other transcriptional co-repressors or co-activators of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aragón <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Guglielmi <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The TGFβ superfamily members, growth-differentiation factor (GDF) 9 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 15 are produced by the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dong <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yan <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) and genetic, pharmacological and in vitro studies have revealed multiple roles for TGFβ/SMAD signaling during follicular growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Knight &amp; Glister, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pangas &amp; Rajkovic, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Patton <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). TGFβ signalling via SMAD3 in granulosa cells acts initially in primordial follicles to maintain their quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Granados-Aparici <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) and later, following their activation, becomes excluded from the nucleus in association with rapid granulosa cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hardy <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Female mice lacking GDF9 rarely generate more than a single layer of granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dong <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Elvin <italic>et al</italic>, 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Elvin <italic>et al</italic>, 1999b</xref>), due to an up-regulation of inhibin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), and are consequently infertile. Prior to ovulation, SMAD2/3 signalling in the cumulus granulosa cells, which is activated or maintained by homo- and/or heterodimers of GDF9 and BMP15, is necessary to up-regulate the transcription of genes whose products drive expansion of the cumulus cell layer, a pre-requisite for fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dragovic <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hao <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mottershead <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Peng <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yu <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>A potential role for TGFβ-SMAD signaling in the generation or maintenance of TZPs was suggested first by observations that TZP morphology is abnormal in mice lacking GDF9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carabatsos <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) and later by the observation that their number is reduced in follicles grown in vitro following RNAi-mediated depletion of GDF9 in the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">El-Hayek <italic>et al</italic>., 2018a</xref>). To test the role of SMAD4 specifically, we used a Cre-lox strategy to inactivate <italic>Smad4</italic> in granulosa cells. This approach has previously been used to inactivate <italic>Smad4</italic>, with Cre expression driven by the promoter of either <italic>Amhr2</italic> (anti-Mullerian hormone receptor 2), where Cre activity is observed mainly in granulosa cells of growing follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jorgez <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) or <italic>Cyp19</italic>, where activity is detected in antral follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yu <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). The former is associated with a range of phenotypes, notably including loss of contact between the oocyte and cumulus cells in some pre-ovulatory follicles and premature luteinization of the granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pangas <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In the latter, changes in granulosa cell gene expression and a failure to undergo cumulus layer expansion were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yu <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). However, the interactions between the oocyte and granulosa cells were not specifically examined in these studies.</p>
<p>Using image analysis tools and three-dimensional reconstructions, we show that depletion of SMAD4 in the granulosa cells decreases the number of TZPs that project from individual granulosa cells in both intact granulosa cell-oocyte complexes (GOCs) and in reaggregated complexes. Morphometric parameters including length and orientation are also altered. The decrease in TZP number in intact GOCs is associated with a reduction in the amount of N-cadherin and Notch2 in the granulosa cells, suggesting that the composition of the granulosa cell surface is perturbed in the absence of SMAD4. SMAD4-depleted granulosa cells are, however, able to support the generation of new TZPs as assayed using a reaggregation assay. We propose that SMAD4, through its activity to increase expression of target genes, stabilizes TZPs by promoting their adhesion to the oocyte surface, thereby helping to increase the number of TZPs and communication between the growing oocyte and its follicular microenvironment.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We began by verifying the expression of SMAD4 during folliculogenesis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref> and consistent with prior reports, SMAD4 was detectable in primordial and growing follicles as well as in the granulosa cells collected from pre-antral follicles. SMAD2 and SMAD3 were also present, with SMAD2 being the major species detected in oocytes. Two strategies were tested to deplete SMAD4 from the granulosa cells of growing follicles. First, mice were generated carrying two floxed <italic>Smad4</italic> alleles and a transgene encoding Cre recombinase under the control of the <italic>Amhr2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). These mice also carried a transgene (<italic>mTmG</italic>, see Methods) constructed such that Tomato fluorescent protein is expressed in the absence of Cre activity, whereas Cre-mediated recombination switches expression to green fluorescent protein (GFP), thus allowing us to identify cells where Cre had been active. Upon immunostaining of ovarian sections or whole-mount intact follicles, only a small number of cells expressed GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>, left). Consistent with this observation, less than 10% of FACS-sorted granulosa cells were GFP-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>, right). Thus, in our system, <italic>Amhr2-Cre</italic> did not mediate efficient recombination of floxed DNA in granulosa cells.</p>

<p>We therefore turned to mice that expressed Cre under the control of a tamoxifen-inducible form of the estrogen receptor (ER) gene promoter (<italic>ER-Cre</italic>). Because ER is expressed in pituitary gonadotropes and SMAD4 regulates the transcription of the <italic>Fshb</italic> gene encoding the β-subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), this model could not be used in vivo. Granulosa cell-oocyte complexes (GOCs) from mid-growth stage follicles (diameter 100-120 μm) were therefore isolated, exposed to tamoxifen for one day and then incubated in tamoxifen-free medium for another five days. Under these conditions, a substantial fraction of the granulosa cells underwent Cre-mediated recombination, as indicated by the expression of GFP in immunostained GOCs and by FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>). This in vitro system was used for the experiments described here.</p>
<p>To examine the efficiency of Cre-mediated <italic>Smad4</italic> recombination, the mRNA level was assessed in intact GOCs using the RNAscope technique and in purified granulosa cells using qRT-PCR. Following tamoxifen treatment and culture, there was an approximately 60% reduction in the number of foci in the granulosa cells from 5.78 +/- 0.36 (mean, s.e.m., n=21) in <italic>ER-Cre<sup>-</sup></italic>; <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice to 2.16 +/- 0.26 (n=26) in <italic>ER-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>; <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), and a 70% reduction in the amount of PCR product from granulosa cells (n=5, <italic>p</italic>=0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Immunoblotting of granulosa cells revealed a corresponding 70% reduction in SMAD4 protein in the granulosa cells of <italic>ER-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>; <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice compared to <italic>ER-Cre<sup>-</sup></italic>; <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> controls (n=11, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Thus, the in vitro ER-Cre strategy substantially reduced although did not eliminate SMAD4 from the granulosa cells.</p>
<p>To examine the effect of SMAD4 depletion on the TZPs, GOCs were isolated and cultured as above, fixed and stained using anti-GFP to label cells where Cre had been active and phalloidin to label the TZPs, and imaged them using confocal microscopy. First, the TZPs were analyzed as a population. Because TZPs arise from both the innermost and more distal granulosa cell layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baena &amp; Terasaki, 2019</xref>), it was not possible to reliably determine how many granulosa cells contributed the GFP-positive TZPs in a GOC. The total number of phalloidin-stained TZPs – irrespective of whether they were GFP-positive – that projected to the oocyte in equatorial optical sections of GOCs from control (<italic>Smad4<sup>wt/wt</sup></italic>) and experimental (<italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) mice were therefore counted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). TZP-number was normalized to the diameter of the corresponding oocyte, although the mean oocyte diameter did not differ between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>), We observed a 20.4 +/- 0.05% reduction in the number of TZPs in the GOCs from the <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (n=63 [control], 59 [experimental], <italic>p</italic>=0.002).</p>

<p>A limitation of quantifying TZPs in intact GOCs is that the granulosa cells, depending on their number and spatial distribution, can variably impair their resolution and discrimination even using confocal microscopy. Therefore, the number of TZPs was also counted after mechanically removing the granulosa cells from the GOCs. This analysis revealed a striking 51.1 +/- 0.04% reduction in the normalized number of TZPs in the GOCs from the <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (n=44 [control], 47 [experimental], p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). As observed using intact GOCs, the mean oocyte diameter did not differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). To verify the difference in TZP-number, we also compared <italic>ER-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>; <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> to a different control genotype, <italic>ER-Cre<sup>-</sup></italic>; <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. A quantitatively similar 43.6 +/- 0.04% decrease in TZPs within the <italic>ER-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> population (n=164 [control], 172 [experimental], p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>) was observed following tamoxifen treatment and culture. Together, these results indicate that depletion of SMAD4 in the granulosa cells is associated with a decrease in the number of TZPs.</p>
<p>TZPs provide the physical platform that enables essential gap junctional communication between the granulosa cells and the oocyte. To test whether the reduction in TZP number in SMAD4-depleted granulosa cells impaired this communication, we used a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay. Control and experimental GOCs were treated with tamoxifen and incubated as above. After five days, they were exposed to calcein-AM, a fluorescent dye that can pass through gap junctions. The fluorescence in the oocyte of each GOC was bleached using the laser of a confocal microscope and its recovery was then recorded. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref>, which plots the fluorescence in the oocyte as a function of time after photobleaching and at the end of the recording period normalized to the initial fluorescence, we observed no difference between groups in the rate of transfer of fluorescence from the granulosa cells to the oocyte. Thus, despite the decreased number of TZPs, depletion of SMAD4 did not detectably impair gap junctional communication between the granulosa cells and the oocyte.</p>
<p>As TZPs project not only from the cells immediately adjacent to the zona pellucida but also from those in more distal layers, it was possible that the reduced number of TZPs in <italic>ER-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>; <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> complexes reflected an impaired ability of the granulosa cells to proliferate. <italic>ER-Cre<sup>+</sup>; Smad4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>ER-Cre<sup>+</sup>; Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> GOCs were incubated for 5 hr in the presence of the thymidine analogue, EdU, added five days after the tamoxifen exposure. No difference between the groups in the fraction of EdU-positive cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>), however, implying that the reduced number of TZPs was not due to impaired proliferation of the granulosa cells.</p>
<p>We then focused our analysis on individual granulosa cells. GOCs where individual GFP-positive cells could be readily identified and the TZPs were easily attributable to a particular cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>) were selected, serial optical sections were obtained using confocal microscopy, and 3-dimensional images were reconstructed using Imaris software. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref> shows one such reconstruction, where GFP-positive granulosa cells are pseudo-coloured in green. We observed a 25% decrease in the mean volume of <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> granulosa cells compared to wild-type cells (323.2 +/- 11.2 vs 242.6 +/- 10.0; n=293, 322; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), but no difference between genotypes in the sphericity of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The TZPs in a subset of the GFP-positive granulosa cells were then analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>). In this subset, there was a 15% difference in mean cell volume (392.2 +/- 20.8 vs 334.0 +/- 21.2; n=55, 63) which did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>=0.054). However, whereas wild-type cells harbored a mean of 15.8 +/- 0.87 (n=55) TZPs per cell, this number was reduced by 35% in <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> cells to 10.5 +/- 0.71 (n=65, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). As compared to those of wild-type cells, the TZPs of the <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>cells were about 10% longer (4.64 +/- 0.08 μm vs 5.19 +/- 0.09 μm; n=893, 720; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) and very slightly narrower (0.40 +/- 0.003 μm vs 0.38 +/- 0.003 μm; n=870, 719; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>). We did not detect other differences between the genotypes in TZP morphology. These results obtained using reconstructed 3-dimensional images of GFP-positive cells establish that the number of TZPs is reduced in individual SMAD4-depleted granulosa cells.</p>

<p>A limitation of analyzing TZPs in GFP-positive cells within GOCs is that that this strategy cannot distinguish TZPs that were generated in a low-SMAD4 environment (i.e., after the Cre recombinase was expressed) from those generated earlier in a normal-SMAD4 environment. To ensure that we examined only TZPs that were generated after Cre had been expressed, we used our previously published reaggregation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">El-Hayek <italic>et al</italic>., 2018a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<p>When the entire population of granulosa cells in the reaggregated GOCs was analyzed, there was a ∼30% reduction in mean volume in the <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> cells as compared to <italic>Smad4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells (394.5 +/- 18.8 vs 279.8 +/- 16.6; n=185, 159; p&lt;0.0001) and no difference in cell sphericity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>), as observed using intact GOCs. There was no difference between genotypes, however, in mean volume among the cells whose TZPs were characterized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Within this group, the mean number of TZPs per cell was reduced by ∼50%, from 14.2 +/- 2.0 (n=16) in the <italic>Smad4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells to 6.84 +/- 1.1 (n=25) in the <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D, p</xref>=0.001). A ∼20% increase in the mean length of the TZPs of <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> cells (3.71 +/- 0.17 vs 4.40 +/- 0.28; n=174, 154; <italic>p</italic>=0.03) was also detected, as in intact GOCs, but no difference in the mean width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>The increased mean length of the TZPs of <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>cells compared to <italic>Smad4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells prompted us to analyze the trajectory of individual TZPs. We traced their path from their point of origin to their tip, then measured the distance between the point of origin and the oocyte and subtracted from this the distance between the tip and the oocyte. A large positive difference indicates that the tip of the TZP is relatively close to the oocyte; conversely, a small positive or a negative difference indicates that that tip is relatively far from the oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F</xref>). This analysis revealed that the mean difference was 50% greater in the <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>cells compared to <italic>Smad4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells (1.61 +/- 0.16 vs 2.40 +/- 0.21; n=174, 157; <italic>p</italic>=0.003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4G</xref>). This indicates that the tips of the TZPs of the <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> cells were, on average, closer to the oocyte than those of the <italic>Smad4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells. We also found that the proportion of TZPs that were oriented away from the oocyte trended towards being greater in the <italic>Smad4<sup>+/+</sup></italic>cells, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4G</xref>). Taken together, the trajectory analyses provide additional evidence that the TZPs of <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>cells differ from those of <italic>Smad4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells.</p>
<p>The observation that TZP-number was modestly reduced when intact GOCs were analyzed, yet markedly reduced when oocytes from which the granulosa cells had been stripped were analyzed, suggested that the attachment between the TZPs and oocyte might be weakened when SMAD4 was depleted. To evaluate this, the amount of N-cadherin, which is the principal cell adhesion molecule that has been identified in granulosa cells, was compared between <italic>Smad4<sup>+/+</sup></italic>and <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> granulosa cells. Consistent with the previous results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>), SMAD4 was reduced by 73.5 +/- 0.05% in the <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A, n</xref>=6, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). Strikingly, N-cadherin was reduced by 52.7 +/- 0.04 % (n = 6, <italic>p</italic>=0.0004) in the <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Moreover, Notch2, a transmembrane receptor expressed in granulosa cells that associates with membrane-bound Jagged1 expressed on the oocyte, was reduced by 52.6 +/- 0.05% (n=5; <italic>p</italic>=0.0003) in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). In contrast to the protein, however, there was no detectable reduction in the amount of encoding mRNA in either case as assayed using qRT-PCR, although <italic>Smad4</italic> was reduced in the same samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Thus, a reduction in SMAD4 in granulosa cells is associated with a reduction in certain transmembrane proteins, including those responsible for cell adhesion.</p>

<p>As we previously reported that depletion of GDF9, which is secreted by the oocyte and signals in the granulosa cells through SMAD4, was associated with a reduction in mRNAs encoding structural components of TZPs – <italic>Myo10</italic>, <italic>Fscn1</italic>, and <italic>Daam1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">El-Hayek <italic>et al</italic>., 2018a</xref>), we measured the quantity of these mRNAs using qRT-PCR.

This implies either that the SMAD4 which remained was sufficient to induce expression of these genes or the GDF9 regulates their expression through a SMAD4- independent pathway.</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have examined the role of SMAD4 establishing the TZPs that connect the granulosa cells to the oocyte. Using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase strategy, we were able to reduce SMAD4 in the granulosa cells to about 30% of its wild-type level. This reduction was associated with a decrease ranging from 20-50% in the number of TZPs in the granulosa cells assessed as a population (i) in intact GOCs and (ii) after removal of the granulosa cell bodies to increase optical resolution, and as individual cells (iii) in intact GOCs and (iv) in reconstructed complexes. Previous studies where SMAD4 was depleted from granulosa cells described a loose or loss association of the cumulus cells with the oocyte in some follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pangas <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yu <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), which is consistent with the idea that that fewer TZPs were available to anchor the cumulus cells to the oocyte. Together these observations suggest that SMAD4 regulates the size of the population of TZPs in growing follicles.</p>
<p>The population of TZPs presumably reflects the net result of the generation of new TZPs and the retraction of existing TZPs, as is the case for filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gallop, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Heckman &amp; Plummer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mattila &amp; Lappalainen, 2008</xref>). SMAD4 could thus promote either or both processes. The observation that GFP-expressing granulosa cells in reaggregated complexes generated new TZPs implies that SMAD4 is not required for this process, although it does not rule out a role in increasing the rate of generation. A clue to the function of SMAD4 may lie in the observation that the decrease in the number of TZPs in SMAD4-depleted cells was quantitatively greater when the granulosa cell bodies were removed prior to analysis. This suggests that the process of removing the cell bodies also removed the TZPs more easily in the SMAD4-depleted cells than in wild-type cells. In this context, it is intriguing that N-cadherin, which is thought to stabilize attachment of the TZP tips to the oocyte surface, was depleted in the mutant cells. We propose that, by increasing the quantity of N-cadherin in the granulosa cells, SMAD4 increases the strength of adhesion of the TZPs to the oocyte surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). This in turn would decrease the probability of retraction, thereby increasing the steady-state number of TZPs.</p>
<p>This model is consistent with the observation that the non-attached (free-ended) TZPs of SMAD4-depleted cells were on average longer and closer to the oocyte than those of wild-type cells. Specifically, if the ability of the TZPs to establish a stable contact with the oocyte were impaired in SMAD4-depleted cells, a relatively large proportion might continue to ‘search’ for an attachment and to lengthen during the searching process. Mechanistically, some reports have linked SMAD4 to transcription of the <italic>Cdh2</italic>, which encodes N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kang <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>), but we did not detect a difference in mRNA quantity between normal and SMAD4-depleted granulosa cells. In view of the reduced quantity in the latter of Notch2, also a membrane-associated protein, it may be speculated that SMAD4 might act more broadly to regulate the expression of genes whose products maintain the normal configuration of the granulosa cell plasma membrane. Regardless of the mechanism, it is noteworthy that the number of TZPs that project from an individual granulosa cells – about 15 in this study and about 40 in a previous study where more advanced (antral) follicles were examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baena &amp; Terasaki, 2019</xref>) – considerably exceeds the number of filopodia that are present on individual blastomeres of mouse embryos (5-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fierro-Gonzalez <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>) or on chick embryonic cells (∼4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sagar <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). SMAD4 may therefore act in granulosa cells to amplify an innate ability to generate filopodia, which become TZPs and increase the efficiency of communication between the growing germ cell and its somatic microenvironment.</p>

Follicles were mechanically isolated by carefully tearing the ovaries apart and using fine needles to separate the follicles from each other in HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium (MEM, pH 7.2, Life Technologies, Burlington, ON) (MEM-H). A Pipetman P1000 was used to carefully pick up and transfer the individual follicles to dishes containing fresh medium. GOCs were obtained by incubating follicles in the presence of collagenase (10 μg/ml; Cedarlane, Burlington, ON) and DNase I (10 μg/ml; Sigma) for 5 min at 37°C in air. GOCs were collected and briefly washed in NaHCO3-buffered MEM (MEM-C) and cultured in 4-well plates containing 500 μl of MEM-C supplemented with ITS (10 μg/mL insulin, 5.5 μg/mL transferrin and 5 ng/mL selenium; Sigma), FSH (10 mIU/ml; EMD Serono, Mississauga, ON), and estradiol (10 nM, Sigma, E2758) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. To induce Cre-mediated recombination of the <italic>Smad4</italic> allele, GOCs were incubated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (1 µg/ml, Sigma, T176) in the above medium for 24 hours. They were then transferred to medium without tamoxifen.</p>

<p>Cell samples were lysed in 10 μl of Laemmli buffer. After denaturation at 95◦C for 10 min, proteins were separated using 4–15% precast polyacrylamide gels (BioRad, 4568085) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Amersham, Oakville, ON, Canada) under constant voltage. The membrane was subsequently blocked using 5% BSA, in 0.1% Tween-PBS. The membrane was washed three times in Tween-PBS and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4◦C. After washing for 45 min, the membrane was incubated in secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Promega) at a dilution of 1:5000 for 1h at room temperature.

<title>RNA purification and quantitative real-time PCR</title>
<p>RNA was extracted using a Picopure RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 10 μL of the provided elution buffer, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">El-Hayek <italic>et al</italic>, 2018a</xref>). Briefly, SuperScript II Reverse Transcription kit (Life Technologies) was used to generate cDNA. PCR amplification was performed using a Corbett Rotorgene 6000 (Montreal Biotech, Montreal, QC). Each reaction contained 4 μL of EvaGreen Mix (Montreal Biotech), 13 μL of UltraPure DNase/RNase-free distilled water (Life Technologies), 1 μL of 10 mM primers and 2 μL of cDNA (diluted 1:20 from original stock). Primers were designed using Primer-BLAST (National Institutes of Health) and obtained from Sigma. For each primer pair, a standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of cDNA prepared from ovarian RNA and used to determine the efficiency of amplification. Melt-curve analysis and electrophoresis of amplified products confirmed that only a single product of the expected size was generated. Data was analyzed using software provided by the manufacturer. Relative quantities of amplified product were calculated according to 2-ΔΔCT method, using <italic>Rpl19</italic> for normalization.

GOCs were dissected from <italic>Amhr2-Cre<sup>-</sup></italic>and <italic>ER-Cre-</italic> littermates were used as negative controls of EGFP expression. They were transferred to a 4-well dish containing Ca-free MEM (Thermo Fisher, 21068028) supplement with 0.25% trypsin (Thermo Fisher, 25200056), 1mM EDTA (Sigma) and DNAse I for several minutes. After pipetting up and down for a few times to dissociate the cells, fetal bovine serum was added (4% final concentration) to inactivate the trypsin. Cells were centrifuged at 1500xg for 5 minutes and supernatant was carefully removed under the dissecting microscope to better visualise the pellet. FACs buffer containing PBS, 1%FBS, 1mM EDTA and 1mg/ml of DAPI was used to resuspend the pellet. Cells were resuspended and passed through a Flowmi® 40-µm strainer (Merck,BAH136800040) to remove oocytes and cell clumps, and then kept on ice for sorting. Resulting granulosa cells were analyzed on a BD FACSAria Fusion 8.0.2 sorter at the Immunophenotyping Facility of the RI-MUHC. All events were collected for each sample. A 488-nm excitation laser was used for both Tomato and EGFP excitation since the wavelength of 488 nm falls within the peak excitation of EGFP but only at 25% of peak excitation for tdTomato. Data were analyzed using FlowJo FACS analysis software. Cells were gated for singlets (using forward scatter vs. side scatter area), viability (DAPI scatter vs. side scatter area)], and fluorescence (FITC and PE) without compensation.</p>

<title>Measurement of granulosa cell-oocyte communication using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)</title>
<p>A protocol for FRAP was adapted from our previous study (El-Hayek &amp; Clarke, 2015). GOCs were incubated for 15 min in MEM supplemented with calcein-AM and then for 60 min in calcein-free MEM to allow transfer of calcein from the granulosa cells into oocyte. A circular region of interest of fixed diameter (10 µm, to ensure the bleaching did not extend to the surrounding granulosa cells) was set in the center of the enclosed oocyte and subjected to 60 repetitive bleaches of 50 iterations (1 min total duration) using the argon laser at 50% transmission strength. The intensity of fluorescence in the oocyte and the layer of granulosa cells immediately surrounding it was recorded before bleaching and after the 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th, 50th, and 60th bleaching. Fluorescence was calculated as intensity of fluorescence in granulosa cell layer at each time point divided by the pre-bleach intensity of the layer. As oocytes of all experimental groups were subjected to the same bleaching procedure within the fixed ROI, the loss in fluorescence was further divided by initial pre-bleach intensity of the oocyte normalized to intensity of fluorescence in oocyte at the given time point, in order to correct for differences in bleaching effect in oocytes of different sizes.</p>

They were then incubated in Ca-Mg-free PBS and drawn in and out of a mouth-controlled micropipette to generate a suspension of denuded oocytes surrounded by the zona pellucida and individual or small clumps of granulosa cells. Briefly, the granulosa cells were deposited together with oocytes from CD-1 mice into the base of a 200-μl microfuge tube and PBS was added to a total volume of 100 μl. The tube was spun at top speed in a microcentrifuge for one minute, then rotated 180° and centrifuged for one minute. This step was repeated twice more. The tube was then cut near the base and the cell-pellet was carefully scooped out and incubated for 2 days in 4-well plates in MEM supplemented with FSH, estradiol and ITS. At the end of the incubation period, complexes of oocytes surrounded by granulosa cells were fixed and processed for analysis.</p>

<title>Image analysis</title>
<p>To quantify the number of F-actin-stained-TZPs, a confocal optical section was obtained at the equatorial plane of the oocyte. Using Fiji software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), a segmented circle was drawn around the oocyte in the middle of the zona pellucida, and the fluorescence intensity at each point on the line was obtained. Each point whose value was above the background value of the oocyte cytoplasm and higher than each of its immediately neighboring points was counted as a TZP.</p>
<p>To quantify EdU incorporation in granulosa cells, Fiji was used to calculate the ratio of Edu-labelled cells per GOC by dividing the number of EdU-positive cells by the total number of cells counterstained with DAPI.</p>
<p>To individually segment granulosa cells and their corresponding TZPs, Imaris 9.7.2 Software (Bitplane) was used. First, z-stacks of 0.2 μm thickness covering the middle region of a follicle were imaged to obtain a conventional 2D Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP). Then, a 3D rendered segmentation of GFP-positive granulosa cells was created with the “Cell detection” tool where cell boundaries were detected based on GFP membrane staining. Smallest diameter was set to 100µm, membrane detail of 0.2 μm and the threshold was adjusted based on local contrast. Segmented cells with a volume less than 100µm<sup>2</sup> were deleted and fusing or fragmented cells were edited using the “merge” or “split” tools to match the original image. The oocyte was also segmented using the phalloidin red channel. After edition, cells were converted to surface objects with the tool “Convert to surfaces” to record their measurements. To render individual TZPs, the “Filament tracer” tool and semi-automated tracing with the tool “Autopath” was used to draw the path of each TZP from the granulosa cell body (start) to the oocyte surface (end) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>). TZP diameter (thickness) was calculated automatically with a minimum diameter of 0.1 μm. To determine the distance of the TZP tip to the oocyte surface, the segmented TZP was automatically divided into discrete spots using the extension “Filament to Spots”. This allowed the calculation of the distance from each spot to the oocyte surface. All measurements were exported using the “distance to oocyte surface” from each TZP spot. To determine the TZP orientation (away or towards the oocyte), the distance of the spot located at the TZP start was subtracted from the distance of the spot located at the TZP tip. A positive difference indicates that the TZP tip is closer to the oocyte and a negative difference indicates that the TZP tip is farther from the oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>This study reports a <bold>valuable</bold> new mechanism through which the TGF-beta signaling pathway promotes contacts between oocytes and their surrounding somatic cells via regulating the number of transzonal projections (TZPs) in mice. The evidence supporting the major conclusions is <bold>solid</bold>, although further assessments of the physiological significance of SMAD4-dependent formation of transzonal projection networks would have strengthened the study. The work will be of interest to biomedical researchers who work on ovarian biology and female fertility.</p>

<p>Granados-Aparici et al., investigate somatic-germline interactions in female mice. Mammalian oocytes are nurtured in multi-cellular ovarian follicles and communication with surrounding somatic cells is critical for oocyte development. This study focused on transzonal projections (TZP) extending from granulosa cells to the surface of oocytes and documented the importance of SMAD4, a TGF- β mediator, in regulating the TZPs. They propose a model in which individual TZPs contact the surface of the oocyte and stably attach if there is sufficient N-cadherin. In SMAD4-depleted cells, there is insufficient N-cadherin to stabilize the attachment. The TZP continues to elongate but eventually retracts. Their model is well supported by their experimental evidence and the manuscript is both well-formulated and written.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study proposed a new mechanism by which the TGF-beta signaling pathway promotes contacts between oocytes and the surrounding somatic cells in mice, by regulating the numbers of transzonal projections (TZPs).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The conditional Smad4 knockout and three-dimensional observation of transzonal projections are solid and sufficiently support the major conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The physiological significance of SMAD4-dependent formation of transzonal projection networks is not assessed in this study.</p>
