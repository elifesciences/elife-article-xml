<title>Abstract</title><p>Locus coeruleus (LC) projections to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory. However, the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus are currently unknown. Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions. In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norepinephrine. Here, we extend these data by characterizing the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning. We find that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation. We also demonstrate that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. Finally, we show that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation, while norepinephrine is not.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The locus coeruleus (LC) supports an array of cognitive processes by modulating brain-wide arousal states and responding to salient events in the environment. LC neurons accomplish this via two distinct modes of activity: tonic and phasic. Changes in the frequency of tonic activity are associated with corresponding changes in psychological state. Low tonic activity (∼0-2Hz) is associated with drowsiness or sleep and increasing levels of tonic activity (∼3-10Hz) are associated with increased arousal, progressing from exploration and task engagement to agitation and anxiety states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>). Bouts of phasic activity (∼10-20Hz) are most often observed during intermediate levels of tonic activity in response to salient environmental events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aston-Jones et al., 1999</xref>). When locked to task-relevant events, these phasic responses are associated with improved cognitive performance across a variety of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aston-Jones &amp; Cohen, 2005</xref> for review).</p>
<p>A large body of research supports the idea that the LC is critically involved in memory formation. Monoamine depletion in the LC, noradrenergic and dopaminergic antagonism in multiple brain regions, and direct inhibition of the LC all impair memory across a number of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Giustino and Maren, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lisman and Grace, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Selden et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wagatsuma et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, LC stimulation as well as dopamine and norepinephrine agonism can enhance memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Packard and White, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sara and Devauges, 1988</xref>). Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus (HPC) and other cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Devoto and Flore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Smith and Greene, 2012</xref>). In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the HPC may be more important for memory than norepinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wagatsuma et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>However, studies examining the effect of LC on HPC-dependent memory have generally not distinguished between tonic and phasic LC activity or between dopamine and norepinephrine signaling. In some cases, this distinction is prevented by the use of temporally imprecise manipulations like lesions and drug infusions. In others, it is difficult to determine the importance of time-locked phasic firing because of the use of spatial memory tasks that are commonly used to assess hippocampus (HPC)-dependent memory. Because space is a temporally diffuse stimulus, it is difficult to know the exact moments during spatial learning when phasic responses might be important. This does not rule out the possibility that phasic LC activity and dopamine signaling is important for spatial learning, but the lack of experimental control over the animals’ sampling of the relevant stimuli makes this possibility opaque to examination. Studies that have used discrete reward learning tasks to examine dopamine function in the HPC have also not typically distinguished between tonic and phasic release.</p>
<p>To address these issues, we used a trace fear conditioning task in which animals learn an association between a neutral and aversive stimulus that are separated in time. Because trace fear conditioning a) requires intact hippocampal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chowdhury et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Raybuck and Lattal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wilmot et al., 2019</xref>) and b) involves learning about discrete, well-controlled stimuli, it is ideally suited to characterize the rapid temporal dynamics of LC activity and LC-HPC communication during learning and examine their role in long term memory formation.</p>
<p>Here, we used fiber photometry and optogenetics to make temporally precise observations and manipulations of LC activity during learning in a trace fear conditioning task. We extend this data by providing direct evidence that LC activity increases both dopamine and norepinephrine content in the HPC and by showing that dopamine release is important for trace fear memory formation, but the release of norepinephrine is not.</p>

<title>The locus coeruleus responds to neutral and aversive environmental stimuli</title>
<p>Before examining LC activity during learning, we sought to determine whether the LC exhibits phasic responses to the basic types of stimuli used in trace fear conditioning. Because previous research indicates LC activity may be modulated by the salience, or intensity, of environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Vazey et al., 2018</xref>), we began by examining the responses of the locus coeruleus to neutral auditory stimuli of varying intensities (55dB-95dB).</p>
<p>To observe LC responses to auditory stimuli, we expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s specifically in the LC of TH-Cre transgenic mice and implanted an optical fiber above the injection site to allow fiber photometric recordings of bulk LC activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). After recovery from surgery, GCaMP fluorescence in LC was measured as the mice were exposed to five interleaved presentations of a 3000 Hz pure tone at each dB level (25 total presentations). Small phasic responses were seen at each dB level, but responses increased with tone intensity, with responses to the 95dB tone most pronounced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>), confirming that the magnitude of the LC response to an auditory stimulus is modulated by its intensity.</p>

<p>We next examined LC responses to aversive stimuli. To determine whether LC responses are modulated by the intensity of an aversive stimulus, we recorded calcium activity in the LC while mice received foot shocks of varying intensity (0-0.8mA). Consistent with the idea that LC activity is modulated by the salience of environmental stimuli, we found that LC responses to foot shock were much larger than the previously observed responses to neutral auditory stimuli (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> C-F). Additionally, consistent with previous reports, the size of the LC response to footshock increased with foot shock intensity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen and Sara, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hirata and Aston-Jones, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rasmussen and Jacobs, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). The results of these initial experiments demonstrate that the LC responds to both neutral and aversive stimuli and that LC response magnitude is positively correlated with the salience and/or valence of the stimulus.</p>

<title>Locus coeruleus activity is modulated by learning</title>
<p>Having demonstrated that the locus coeruleus is responsive to salient environmental events, we next sought to determine whether its responses are modulated by learning. Again, we began by using fiber photometry to monitor LC responses to a neutral auditory stimulus. If the LC responds to novelty or salience, we would expect the responses to diminish over repeated experiences with a stimulus as the animal habituates to its presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Thompson and Spencer, 1966</xref>). To test this idea, we recorded activity in the LC over the course of 3 days as animals were repeatedly exposed to the same tone (85dB, 3KHz) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, LC responses to the tone were largest on the first day and gradually reduced in magnitude over the next two days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B and C</xref>). The LC also responded to tone termination, and while this response also appeared to habituate across days, the effect did not reach significance (Main effect of day F(2,8) = 3.36, p = .087). This finding is consistent with prior work showing that animals process the termination of an auditory CS as a distinct, salient event that itself can undergo conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sommer-Smith, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sommer-Smith et al., 1962</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="512590v3_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, we examined the effect of associative fear learning on LC responses in a second group of mice that underwent the same procedures, except that on the first day they received ten trace fear conditioning trials instead of unpaired tone presentations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Trace conditioning trials consisted of a 20-second tone followed by a 20-second stimulus free trace interval ending in a 2-second 0.2mA footshock. The LC responses in these animals followed a similar pattern to that observed in the tone only group, with activity on Day 1 being the largest and gradually decreasing across days as the mice extinguished. However, the magnitude of the LC responses was much larger in mice that underwent trace fear conditioning on Day 1 compared to tone alone presentations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). We also found that the response to tone termination significantly decreased across the extinction sessions. These data suggest that LC responses can be modified by associative learning – LC responses to an inherently neutral stimulus are larger when the stimulus is paired with an aversive outcome than when the stimulus is experienced in isolation. Additionally, as this association is extinguished and the tone becomes less predictive of an aversive outcome, the LC response is reduced – there was no significant difference between fear conditioned and tone only mice on the second or third days of behavior when neither group was receiving footshocks. These results are consistent with previous recording studies that found individual LC neurons can acquire a learned response to the conditional stimulus during training that disappears during extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rasmussen and Jacobs, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sara and Segal, 1991</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Locus coeruleus terminals in dorsal hippocampus exhibit phasic responses during trace fear conditioning</title>
<p>Taken together, the above data show that the LC exhibits large bursts of activity during trace fear conditioning at the tone onset, tone termination, and during the shock. LC responses at these key task-related events are overtly evident in LC GCaMP traces averaged across trials and on each trial individually (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B, C). We next examined whether the specific projection from the LC to the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) exhibits similar phasic responses during trace fear conditioning. To do this, we infused a cre-dependent AAV encoding an axon-enriched calcium sensor, axon-GCaMP6s, into the LC of TH-Cre mice and implanted an optical fiber just above dorsal CA1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Broussard et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<p>When we recorded activity from LC-HPC projections during trace fear conditioning, we found that these projections responded to all relevant trace conditioning events: tone onset, tone termination, and shock (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). These results confirm that the phasic responses observed in LC during trace conditioning are also present in the specific subset of LC axons that project directly to the dHPC and suggest that LC-dHPC projections may be important for memory formation.</p>

<title>Phasic locus coeruleus activation enhances trace fear conditioning</title>
<p>Our fiber photometry experiments provide strong correlational evidence that phasic LC responses are involved in trace fear learning via the release of catecholamines, but whether this response enhances learning, as is often proposed, remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Giustino and Maren, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Likhtik and Johansen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">McGaugh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sears et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>). To determine whether phasic activation of LC enhances trace fear conditioning, we infused a cre-dependent version of the excitatory opsin ChR2 into the LC of TH-Cre mice or their wild-type littermates and optical fibers were implanted above the infusion site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B). After recovery from surgery, the mice underwent trace fear conditioning using a protocol with low tone (65dB) and shock intensity (0.2mA) to produce weak learning that would allow us to uncover an enhancement with LC stimulation, as indicated by the fact that these stimulus intensities produced relatively weak LC responses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). During the training session, 20Hz blue light was delivered to the locus coeruleus in three two-second periods beginning at each of the trial events when consistent LC responses were observed in fiber photometry experiments: tone onset, tone termination, and shock onset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>The next day, animals underwent a memory test in a novel context in which they were repeatedly exposed to the training tone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Freezing during the tone and the post-tone period was used as an index of fear memory retrieval. Phasic LC stimulation at the onset of all learning-related events significantly enhanced long-term memory formation. Cre-positive mice expressing ChR2 froze significantly more in the memory test during both the tones and the 20-second post-tone period corresponding to the trace-interval on the training day. These data indicate that increased phasic activation of the LC at specific learning-related time points during trace conditioning is sufficient to enhance long term memory formation.</p>

<title>The locus coeruleus drives both dopamine and norepinephrine release in the dorsal hippocampus</title>
<p>Our data suggest that LC projections to the hippocampus are activated by salient learning-related events and that this LC activation can enhance long term memory formation. However, it remains unclear which neurotransmitter the LC releases into the dHPC during these responses. Canonically, the LC is known as the primary source of norepinephrine in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jones and Moore, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lindvall and Björklund, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pickel et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schwarz and Luo, 2015</xref>). However, recent evidence suggests that the LC can co-release norepinephrine and dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Devoto and Flore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Smith and Greene, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wagatsuma et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To test this possibility, we expressed the genetically encoded dopamine and norepinephrine sensors GRAB-DA and GRAB-NE, respectively, in the dorsal CA1 of separate groups of mice and implanted optical fibers above the injection site (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). In the same animals, we expressed the excitatory DREADD hM3Dq in LC under the control of the PRSx8 promoter, which can be used to drive selective expression in LC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbott et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hwang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vazey and Aston-Jones, 2014</xref>). After the animals recovered from surgery, we recorded fluorescence as animals freely explored a conditioning chamber. After 10 minutes of baseline recording, we injected mice with either CNO, to activate LC neurons, or vehicle and continued to record fluorescence for 50 more minutes.</p>

<p>Mice that received CNO the first day were treated with vehicle on the second day and vice versa. On a third day, to rule out non-specific effects of CNO and confirm the function of the sensors, animals received injections of both CNO and an antagonist for the receptor that serves as the backbone of the sensors. GRAB-NE animals were injected with the α-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine and GRAB-DA mice were injected with the D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist eticlopride. These antagonists bind to the sensors and prevent them from responding to the presence of NE or DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sun et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the results for the dopamine and norepinephrine sensors were similar. First, in all groups of animals, there was a small increase in fluorescence immediately after the injection likely produced by a LC response to the highly salient I.P. injection process (data not shown). However, after this increase subsided, fluorescence continued to decrease for the rest of the session in the vehicle and CNO + antagonist groups for both sensors. This continued decrease is likely the result of a reduction in the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine in the HPC (as the chamber becomes less novel and the animals explore less) in addition to any photobleaching that occurred over the session. In contrast, CNO-only injections in mice expressing either sensor produced prolonged increases in fluorescence relative to the vehicle groups beginning approximately 10 minutes after the injection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C and D</xref>), indicating that stimulation of the LC increases both dopamine and norepinephrine concentrations in the dHPC. The time course of these increases is consistent with the latency of onset of hM3Dq effects on physiology and behavior in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jendryka et al., 2019</xref>). These data confirm that the LC activation can drive the release of both dopamine and norepinephrine into the dHPC. LC activation likely triggers co-release of DA and NE directly from LC terminals in dHPC, but we cannot fully rule out the possibility that the increase in DA is driven indirectly by LC projections to midbrain dopaminergic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schank et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schwarz and Luo, 2015</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether norepinephrine is critically involved in trace fear conditioning, we administered a high dose (20mg/kg) of the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol 30 minutes before training. Similar or lower doses of propranolol disrupt memory acquisition and consolidation in a number of tasks, including fear conditioning, spatial recognition memory, inhibitory avoidance, and object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Díaz-Mataix et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Przybyslawski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Villain et al., 2016</xref>). However, during the memory test the next day, we observed no significant differences in freezing between the propranolol-treated mice and the saline-treated controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that norepinephrine acting through β-adrenergic receptors is not required for trace fear memory. This result is consistent with prior work showing that the activation of β-adrenergic receptors is important for the retrieval, but not the acquisition or consolidation of hippocampus-dependent fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Murchison et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>To provide a more complete blockade of the effects of norepinephrine, we also tested whether simultaneous antagonism of both β– and ⍺-adrenergic receptors affects trace fear conditioning. We administered combined injections of propranolol and the ⍺1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin at two different doses (low = 0.5mg/kg prazosin + 5mg/kg propranolol; high = 1mg/kg prazosin + 10mg/kg propranolol) 30 minutes before training. We found no significant effect of the drug treatments on memory retrieval the next day (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether dopamine is required for trace fear memory formation, we administered the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (0.1mg/kg) 30 minutes before training. During the memory test the next day, SCH-treated mice froze significantly less than the saline controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). To determine whether D1 receptors in the dHPC, specifically, are required for trace fear memory formation, we implanted cannulae bilaterally in dorsal CA1 and infused SCH23390 directly into the hippocampus before trace conditioning. This significantly impaired long term fear memory (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that dHPC dopamine, but not norepinephrine, is critical for trace fear memory formation.</p>
<p>In some memory paradigms, dopamine release in the dHPC has been suggested to mediate the consolidation, rather than the encoding of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Broussard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">O’Carroll et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rossato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>). To determine whether the observed memory deficits resulted from impairments in encoding or consolidation, we administered systemic SCH23390 immediately after trace fear conditioning and tested memory the next day. We found no differences in memory performance between SCH23390 and vehicle mice during the memory test (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>), suggesting that the memory impairment observed after pre-training D1 antagonist injections is caused by effects on memory encoding, not consolidation.</p>

<title>Dopamine release in the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning</title>
<p>Because we found that LC activation can drive dopamine increases in dHPC and that dopamine release in the dHPC is required for trace fear memory formation, we next examined phasic DA release in the dHPC. To determine whether dHPC DA release increases with stimulus intensity, as LC Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity does, we infused GRAB-DA3h into dCA1 and measured dopamine transients in response to foot shocks of varying intensities. We found that dHPC dopamine increases in response to foot shocks and that the size of the dopamine transient increases with foot shock amplitude (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B,C</xref>), paralleling LC responses.</p>
<p>Next, we measured dHPC dopamine release during trace fear conditioning. Similar to the activity of LC-dHPC axons, dHPC dopamine increased at the tone onset, tone termination, and shock (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). We also sought to determine whether the dopamine response to the tone or shock changes across learning trials. If dopamine encodes a prediction error, as observed in the VTA, then we would expect to see increased responding to the tone and decreased responding to the shock across trials. While dopamine release to the shock did decrease across the training session (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>), there was no change in the size of the response to the tone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). To further rule out prediction error signaling in the dHPC dopamine signal, mice underwent a trace conditioning session in which half of the trials were unsignaled (i.e. there was no CS prior to shock) and half were signaled (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). If dHPC dopamine signaled prediction error, we would expect larger dopamine responses to the shock on unsignaled trials compared to signaled trials. However, we found no difference in dopamine transient amplitude between trial types (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>, I).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The locus coeruleus and its interaction with the hippocampus are known to be critical for hippocampus-dependent memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Compton et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lemon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wagatsuma et al., 2018</xref>). However, due to the predominant use of spatial memory tasks in which the learned information is experienced diffusely in time, the precise temporal dynamics of learning-related LC and LC-HPC activity remain poorly understood. In these experiments, we used trace fear conditioning to examine the contribution of precisely timed phasic LC and LC-HPC activity to long-term memory formation.</p>
<p>In the first experiment, we demonstrated that the LC exhibits phasic responses to both neutral and aversive stimuli. This data is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hirata and Aston-Jones, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rasmussen and Jacobs, 1986</xref>) and confirms that phasic responses in the LC can be detected using fiber photometry recordings of the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s. Our data also demonstrate that the size of the LC phasic response is modulated by the intensity, or salience, of sensory stimuli. This relationship between salience and LC response magnitude was particularly pronounced for the aversive foot-shock. Across all intensities, LC responses were larger to the aversive stimuli than to neutral auditory stimuli, suggesting that the LC may encode some information about the emotional valence of stimuli in addition to the simple sensory salience – though to determine this conclusively would require equating the salience of stimuli across the somatosensory and auditory modalities while varying the emotional valence, which may not be possible, especially in a rodent model. These data are consistent with previous work suggesting a role for LC in signaling salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Foote et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Grant et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Vazey et al., 2018</xref>) and extend them by providing a parametric characterization of LC responses to stimuli of varying intensities.</p>
<p>We also found that phasic LC responses change with learning. First, consistent with a role for LC in signaling salience or novelty, LC responses to a neutral auditory stimulus habituate across repeated exposure to a stimulus, as demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hervé-Minvielle and Sara, 1995</xref>). Additionally, we demonstrated that the LC response to the same auditory stimulus is larger when the stimulus is associated with an aversive outcome. Previous work has shown that LC neurons can respond more to conditioned than non-conditioned stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aston-Jones et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bouret and Sara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>); however, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of increased LC responding to the CS in a trace conditioning task where the CS and US are separated by an extended interval. This may indicate some level of top-down influence over the LC by the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex, as both of these regions are required for learning in this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gilmartin and Helmstetter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wilmot et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results also confirmed that the direct projections from the LC to the dHPC are phasically activated by all learning-relevant stimuli during trace conditioning. This data provides support for the idea that phasic LC input to the hippocampus is involved in memory formation. We did not observe obvious changes in tonic LC-HPC activity in our data, though these changes may be more subtle and occur over longer time scales that would be difficult to detect using fiber photometry. The presence of the same responses in the LC-HPC axon terminals that were seen in LC cell bodies fits with the canonical view of the LC as a largely homogenous structure whose neurons’ axons are highly collateralized. However, it was important to test whether LC-HPC projections respond during trace conditioning directly, as more recent work suggests the LC may be composed of many distinct “modules” of neurons that project to separate regions and it is not yet known whether these modules exhibit different response properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schwarz and Luo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). Because we only recorded from LC projections to the HPC, our data could be consistent with either a homogenous or modular LC organization. Future work could distinguish between these possibilities by recording LC projections in an array of downstream targets.</p>
<p>We also sought to determine whether LC stimulation results in the release of dopamine and/or norepinephrine into the HPC. Using DREADDs, we were able to show that direct LC stimulation drives increases in both dopamine and norepinephrine in the HPC, consistent with a number of recent studies indicating their co-release from LC terminals in the hippocampus and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Devoto and Flore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Smith and Greene, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wagatsuma et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the low number of VTA/SN fibers in dorsal HPC, it is likely that the large increase in dopamine during LC stimulation is due to direct release from LC terminals. However, it is also possible that HPC dopamine is increased indirectly via LC projections to dopaminergic midbrain regions, although there are several problems for this argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Guiard et al., 2008</xref>). First, recent studies have shown that activation of LC terminals in the dorsal hippocampus induces the release of dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>). Second, inactivation of LC but not VTA terminals in the dorsal hippocampus decreases dopamine release in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gálvez-Márquez et al., 2022</xref>). And third, neurons in the VTA that respond to aversive stimuli (ventral medial VTA) are not located in the same anatomical region that sends projections to the dorsal hippocampus (lateral VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gasbarri et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Tsetsenis et al., 2021</xref>)</p>
<p>A wide body of evidence suggests that LC activation enhances memory acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>), consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">LaLumiere et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Novitskaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>), and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Murchison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sara and Devauges, 1988</xref>). Here, we extended this data by showing that precisely timed phasic activation of the locus coeruleus enhances memory formation. Specifically, our data indicate that phasic LC activation can enhance memory formation when the relevant stimuli are not salient enough to produce significant learning on their own.</p>
<p>There are multiple possibilities as to the mechanism underlying this enhancement. First, both dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Frey et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lisman et al., 2011</xref>) and norepinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bliss et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Stanton and Sarvey, 1985</xref>) enhance synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and in other structures important for trace fear conditioning, including the prefrontal cortex and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bissière et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Huang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tully et al., 2007</xref>). Given our data showing that dopamine, and not norepinephrine, is required for trace fear memory formation, the most direct possibility is that the release of dopamine from the LC enhances learning-related plasticity in regions supporting trace fear conditioning. Our finding that systemic β-adrenergic receptor antagonism has no effect on trace fear memory formation was surprising in light of previous work demonstrating memory impairments after infusions of adrenergic antagonists into the hippocampus or amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Giustino &amp; Maren, 2018</xref> for review). However, our data is consistent with recent findings from several other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Murchison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wagatsuma et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, the work of Thomas et al. used several different methods to demonstrate that β-adrenergic receptors in the dHPC are required for the retrieval of context fear but not learning or memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Murchison et al., 2004</xref>). Based on this previous work and our data showing learning-related activity in LC-HPC projections, we believe that LC release of dopamine into the hippocampus is at least partially responsible for our observed effects. However, future work manipulating this projection directly would be required to make this conclusion.</p>
<p>The LC may also assert its effect on memory formation indirectly via its influence over sensory processing, attention, or valence processing, all of which are affected by phasic LC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bouret and Sara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">McCall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Vazey et al., 2018</xref>). Under this hypothesis, the LC could facilitate memory by enhancing the responses of neural populations involved in processing, attending, or assigning valence to the learning-relevant stimuli. For example, in our optogenetic experiment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) phasic LC stimulation may have enhanced stimulus detection and allowed the relatively weak stimuli that were used to capture the animals’ attention and produce learning when they otherwise would not. Distinguishing between these plasticity and cognitive modulation accounts of LC-driven memory enhancements would be difficult as many of the same cellular mechanisms are likely involved in both processes. Indeed, it is likely that LC enhancements of plasticity and cognitive function both contribute to its effects on memory.</p>

For photometry experiments, the constructs were AAV5-FLEX-hSyn-GCaMP6s (300nl, gift from Lin Tian), AAV9-hSyn-FLEX-axonGCaMP6s (300nl, Addgene), AAV9-hSyn-GRAB-NE1h (250nl, Addgene), AAV9-hSyn-GRAB-DA2h (250nl, Addgene), or AAV9-hSyn-GRAB-DA3h (300nL, gift from Yulong Li).</p>
<p>After AAV infusions, an optical fiber (200μm diameter for optogenetics, Thorlabs; 400μm diameter for photometry, Doric) was implanted above dorsal CA1 (dCA1) (AP –2.0mm and ML ± 1.5mm from bregma; DV –1.0mm from dura for optogenetics, DV – 1.25mm from dura for photometry) or locus coeruleus (AP –5.5mm and ML –0.9mm from bregma; DV –3.5mm). The fiber implants were secured to the skull using dental adhesive (C&amp;B Metabond, Parkell) and dental acrylic (Bosworth Company).</p>

<title>Apparatus</title>
<p>The behavioral apparatus has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wilmot et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, fear conditioning occurred in a conditioning chamber (30.5 cm x 24.1 cm x 21.0 cm) within a sound-attenuating box (Med Associates). The chamber consisted of a front-mounted scanning charge-coupled device video camera, stainless steel grid floor, a stainless steel drop pan, and overhead LED lighting capable of providing broad spectrum and infrared light. For context A, the conditioning chamber was lit with both broad spectrum and infrared light and scented with 95% ethanol. For context B, a smooth white plastic insert was placed over the grid floor and a curved white wall was inserted into the chamber. Additionally, the room lights were changed to red light, only infrared lighting was present in the conditioning chamber, and the chamber was cleaned and scented with disinfectant wipes (PDI Sani-Cloth Plus). In both contexts, background noise (65 dB) was generated with a fan in the chamber and HEPA filter in the room.</p>

<title>Behavioral Procedures</title>
<sec id="s4d1">
<title>Trace Fear Conditioning</title>
<p>All behavioral testing occurred during the light portion of the light/dark cycle. Mice were habituated to handling and optical fiber connection for 3-5 minutes/day for 5 days before the beginning of behavior. Next, the mice underwent trace fear conditioning in context A. During training, mice were allowed to explore the conditioning chamber for 3 minutes before conditioning trials began. For optogenetics and pharmacology experiments, the animals then receive 3 trace conditioning trials. For photometry experiments, animals received 10 conditioning trials. Each trial consisted of a 20 second pure tone (85dB, 3000Hz) and a 2 second shock (0.3mA for optogenetics and pharmacology, 0.2mA for photometry) separated by a 20 second stimulus-free trace interval. The intertrial interval (ITI) was 120 or 180 seconds. Mice were removed from the chamber 180 seconds after the last trial. Twenty-four hours later, the mice were placed in context B for a tone test consisting of a 2 or 3 minute baseline period followed by 6 20-second tone presentations separated by a 180 second ITI for optogenetics and pharmacology experiments and 10 20-second tone presentations separated by a 140 second ITI for photometry experiments. In photometry extinction experiments, mice underwent an extinction test in which they received 20 tone presentations separated by 90 second ITI in context B. Freezing behavior was used to index fear and measured automatically using VideoFreeze software (Med Associates).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d2">
<title>DREADDS stimulation behavior</title>
<p>For DREADDS experiments, mice were placed in the same apparatus used for trace fear conditioning experiments. Baseline fluorescence was acquired for 10 minutes, after which mice were briefly removed from the chamber to receive an injection of either CNO or vehicle. After injection, mice were immediately placed back inside the chamber and remained there for 50 more minutes. This procedure was repeated the next day, but animals that received CNO on the first day received saline on the second day and vice versa.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d3">
<title>Shock Response Curve</title>
<p>For the LC shock response curve experiment, mice were placed in the conditioning chamber and allowed to explore freely for 180 seconds. Then 1 second shocks were presented in three blocks of seven trials. Each block consisted of seven trials of different shock intensities (0mA, 0.05ma, 0.1mA, 0.2mA, 0.4mA, 0.6mA, and 0.8mA) in pseudorandom order separated by a 30s ITI. Trial blocks were separated by 180s and mice were removed from the chamber 180 seconds after the last trial. For the GRAB-DA shock response curve experiment, mice underwent 10 trials with two exposures each to 0mA, 0.2mA, 0.4mA, 0.6mA, and 0.8mA with a 120s ITI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d4">
<title>Tone Response Curve</title>
<p>Mice were placed in the conditioning chamber and allowed to explore freely for 180 seconds. Then 25 twenty second tones of varying intensity (55dB, 65dB, 75dB, 85dB, 95dB) were presented in pseudorandom order with a 60 second ITI between tones. Mice were removed from the chamber 60 seconds after the last tone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d5">
<title>Signaled vs Unsignaled Fear Conditioning</title>
<p>The procedure was the same as the basic trace fear conditioning procedure, except that a pseudorandom half of the shocks were unsignaled in that they were not proceeded by a tone CS. These trials would consist of just a 160s ITI followed by a foot shock.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Optogenetics</title>
<p>Blue light (465nm, 10mW measured at fiber tip) was delivered (20Hz, 5ms pulse width) to LC in 2 second epochs during the training session. Light onset was simultaneous with onset of the tone, termination of the tone, and onset of the shock. No light was delivered during the test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f">
<title>Fiber Photometry</title>
<p>The photometry system (Doric) consists of a fluorescence mini-cube that transmits light from a 465nm LED sinusoidally modulated at ∼209 Hz that passed through a 465-nm bandpass filter, and a 405nm LED modulated at ∼308 Hz that passed through a 405-nm bandpass filter. The fluorescence from neurons below the fiber tip was transmitted via this same cable back to the mini-cube, where it was passed through an emission filter, amplified, and focused onto a femtowatt photoreceiver (Newport). The signals generated by the two LEDs were demodulated and decimated to 120 Hz for recording to disk.</p>
<p>All preprocessing and analysis was conducted using custom Python scripts. For preprocessing of GCaMP data, a least-squares linear fit was used to predict 465-nm signal from the 405-nm isosbestic signal. Data from trials was excluded if major artifacts (large, simultaneous deflections in both channels) were present. To calculate a ΔF/F, the predicted values were then subtracted from the true 465nm signal and this value was divided by the predicted value. In short, the ΔF/F was calculated as below:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="512590v3_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
For event-based analyses, the ΔF/F was normalized to the baseline of the trial (the 20 seconds preceding delivery of the tone for fear conditioning, 2 seconds preceding the tone for tone and shock response experiments). Data was analyzed as the peak ΔF/F during the first 2 seconds of each stimulus period analyzed. For single group experiments, responses were analyzed for significance by comparing the peak ΔF/F in the two seconds before the event to the two seconds after the event.</p>
<p>For GRAB-NE and GRAB-DA DREADDs experiments, ΔF/F calculation did not use the isosbestic channel due to differential bleaching between the isosbestic and signal channels over the long time scales used in those experiments. Instead, ΔF/F was calculated via baseline normalization (i.e. subtracting the mean 465nm signal during a 5 minute baseline period from the 465nm signal and dividing the resulting value by the standard deviation of the 465nm during the baseline period).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g">
<title>Drugs</title>
<p>For DREADDs experiments, animals received 5mg/kg I.P. injections of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, Tocris) dissolved in 2% DMSO in sterile 0.9% saline. Vehicle injections were 2% DMSO in sterile 0.9% saline. All other drugs were dissolved in 0.9% sterile saline. SCH23390 (Sigma) was administered at 0.1mg/kg I.P. or intra-hippocampally (5μg/μL, 0.5μL/hemisphere) 30 minutes before behavioral experiments for pre-training experiments or immediately after animals were removed from the conditioning chamber for the consolidation experiment. Propranolol was administered at 20mg/kg I.P. 30 minutes before the behavioral session. Combined injections of propranolol and prazosin were administered at either 0.5mg/kg prazosin and 5mg/kg propranolol or 1mg/kg prazosin and 10mg/kg propranolol 30 minutes prior to the behavioral session. Yohimbine hydrochloride (Sigma) was administered at 2mg/kg I.P. 10 minutes after the start of photometry recordings. Eticlopride hydrochloride (Sigma) was administered at 2mg/kg I.P. 10 minutes after the start of photometry recordings.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry and image acquisition</title>
<p>The basic immunohistochemistry procedures have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Krueger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wilmot et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, mice were transcardially perfused with 4% PFA. Following 24-48 hours of post-fixation, 40um coronal sections were cut. Slices were washed three times in 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at the beginning of the procedure and after all antibody and counterstaining steps. All antibodies and counterstains were diluted in a blocking solution containing .2% Triton-X and 2% normal donkey serum in 1X PBS, unless otherwise indicated. First, sections were incubated for 15 minutes in the blocking solution. Then, slices were incubated for 24 hours at room temperature in primary antibody (1:5000, ABE457, Millipore). Next, slices were placed in secondary antibody for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by Streptavidin-Cy3 (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 45 minutes. Finally, sections were stained with DAPI (1:10,000 in PBS, Life Technologies) for 10 minutes, mounted on slides, and coverslipped with Vectashield anti-fade mounting media (Vector Labs). Images were acquired at 10-20X magnification using a fluorescence slide scanner (BX61VS, Olympus).</p>
<p>Primary antibodies used included anti-c-Fos rabbit primary antibody (1:5000, ABE457, Millipore), anti-c-Fos goat primary antibody (1:5000, SC52, Santa Cruz), anti-GFP chicken primary antibody (1:300, ab13970, Abcam), and anti-TH rabbit primary antibody (1:5000, AB152, Sigma). Secondary antibodies included biotinylated donkey-anti-rabbit (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch), biotinylated donkey-anti-goat (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch), biotinylated donkey-anti-chicken (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch), and donkey-anti-rabbit-Alexa555 (1:500, Fisher). Detection was performed with Streptavidin-Cy2 (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch), Streptavidin-Cy3 (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch), or Streptavidin-Cy5 (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch).</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>For analysis of behavioral data from training and tone test sessions, freezing scores in each phase type (baseline, tone, trace) were averaged across trials for each animal. All data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA, paired t-tests, or unpaired t-tests as appropriate. ANOVA was followed by Bonferroni-corrected <italic>post hoc</italic> comparisons when necessary. A threshold of p &lt;.05 was used to determine statistical significance. All data are shown as mean ± SEM. Data were analyzed with custom Python scripts and figures were generated using custom Python scripts and BioRender.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors investigate the role of the noradrenergic nucleus Locus Coeruleus (LC) in hippocampally-dependent learning and memory processes. The two stated aims of these experiments are to distinguish between 'tonic and phasic' activity and release in LC neurons and to determine the relative contribution of noradrenaline and dopamine, released from LC terminals, during learning. To address these questions, the investigators used a trace conditioning protocol (a behavior that is well established to be dependent on the hippocampus), coupled with a genetically based toolbox of sensors allowing measurements and manipulation of cell-type specific populations of neurons.</p>
<p>This includes photometric imaging of neuronal activity within the LC through Calcium signaling (Fig 1B), and in the hippocampal target site (Fig 3F), photostimulation of monoamine-containing neurons in the LC Fig 4B), measuring of extracellular dopamine and noradrenergic in the hippocampus with fluorescent sensors (GRABs) (Fig 5B). The study was complemented by a pharmacological approach to demonstrate that dopamine and not noradrenaline were essential for learning this task.</p>
<p>Results show that the calcium signal in the LC increased in response to tone or footshock in an intensity-dependent manner (Fig 1C,D,E F). LC responses can be conditioned and conditioned responses are of higher amplitude than the responses to the to-be-conditioned stimulus (Fig 2D). These results replicate sparse data gleaned over the past four decades using single and multiple-unit electrophysiological recording in LC in rats and monkeys. Calcium imaging LC axonal projections in the hippocampus showed a small but significant increase in response to tone onset and offset and to shock during conditioning.</p>
<p>Gain of function experiments show that enhancing a weak tone stimulus by phasic activation of LC through photostimulation during conditioning, facilitated subsequent memory performance (Fig 4D).</p>
<p>Fluorescent sensors demonstrated the release of both Noradrenaline and Dopamine in the hippocampus in response to activation of LC.</p>
<p>Using conventional pharmacology the essential role of dopamine was confirmed in the learning of this trace conditioning task, corroborating previous reports of hippocampal dopamine involvement in spatial learning.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The experiments confirm many of the results of the past four decades from unit recordings from the LC in behaving rats and monkeys. The available data are sparse, due to the difficulty of recording from this tiny pontine nucleus; the reports emanate from only a few laboratories. Given the large amount of theorizing based on sparse data, it is important that the observations concerning the environmental contingencies driving the activity of LC be corroborated.</p>
<p>That dopamine is released from LC terminals in the forebrain has been known for 20 years (Devoto 2004), but this was largely ignored until recently when a few laboratories demonstrated the functional importance of this projection in hippocampal-dependent learning. The present corroboration should lend further credence and promote further studies of the factors governing this release of dopamine from LC terminals, into specific forebrain regions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
--One criticism the authors have made of previous studies was that they have not distinguished between 'tonic' and 'phasic' LC activity and could not demonstrate 'time-locked phasic firing'. This has not been achieved in the present report, as an examination of Fig 1 C,D and 2 C,D shows. Previous reports in rats and monkeys, using unit recording in rats and monkeys clearly show that the latency of LC 'phasic' responses to salient or behaviorally relevant stimuli are in the range of tens of milliseconds, with a very short duration, often followed by a long-lasting inhibition. This kind of temporal precision concerning the phasic response cannot be gleaned from the time scale shown in the Figures (assuming the time scale is in seconds). We can discern a long-lasting increase in tonic firing level for the more salient stimuli (Fig 1C) (although the authors state in the discussion that &quot;we did not observe obvious changes in tonic LC-HPC activity). This calcium imaging methodology as used in the present experiments can give us a general idea of the temporal relation of LC response to the stimulus, but apparently does not afford the millisecond resolution necessary to capture a phasic response, at least as the data are presented in the Figures.</p>
<p>--Much of the data presented here can be regarded as 'proof of concept' i.e. demonstrating that Photometric imaging of calcium signalling yields similar results concerning LC responses to salient or behaviorally relevant stimuli as has been previously reported using electrophysiological unit recording. The role of dopamine as the principal player in hippocampal-dependent learning also corroborates previous reports.</p>
<p>-- No attempt was made to address the important current question of the modular organisation of Locus Coeruleus, although the authors recognize the importance of this question and propose future experiments using their methodology to record simultaneously in several LC projection sites.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, Wilmot et al., ran a series of experiments to describe a dopaminergic projection from LC to dHPC, and its functional role in trace fear conditioning (TFC). Using fiber photometry in LC, they show convincingly that the activity of LC TH neurons is increased to both cues and footshock, and that this increases with acquisition or TFC, and decreases during extinction of this association. Projections from LC to dHPC show a similar pattern of activity, and dopamine release (measured by the fluorescent sensor GRAB-DA) is also comparable to calcium activity from LC. While the authors do show that activity at the dopamine D1R/D5R is necessary for TFC, a direct test of the necessity of dopamine release from LC during TFC is not shown.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
• The authors clearly and effectively show that the LC-dHPC projection is activated by an aversive outcome (i.e. shock), and that activity in this pathway changes in response to learning about a neutral cue that predicts this shock (i.e. TFC). Furthermore, they show that increased dopamine release in dHPC can be observed if LC is chemogenetically activated. A critical role for dopamine receptors (but not β- and ⍺-adrenergic receptors) in TFC was demonstrated, and intra-dHPC injection of a D1R/D5R antagonist blocks this learning. Finally, dopamine release (measured by GRAB-DA) in dHPC was shown to also occur during trace fear conditioning.</p>
<p>• The authors have conclusively shown that activity at the dopamine receptors in the dPHC during trace fear conditioning is of the same pattern as calcium activity recorded both in LC cell bodies, but more importantly in the axonal projections from LC to dHPC. This is very good evidence that this pathway is recruited during TFC.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
• The claim that dopamine release in dHPC is caused by LC neurons is not directly tested. Unfortunately, the most critical experiment for the claims that dopamine release comes from LC during conditioning is not tested. A lack of dopamine signal in dHPC caused by inhibition of LC during TFC would show this. It is indeed an interesting observation that chemoegenetic activation of LC causes dopamine release in the dHPC. However, in the absence of concurrent VTA inhibition or lesion, it remains a possibility that the dopamine release is mediated through indirect actions on other dopamine-expressing neurons. The authors do a good job of arguing against this interpretation in the discussion, and the literature seems appropriate for this. However, the title is still an overstatement of the data presented in this study.</p>
<p>• The primary alternative interpretations of the phasic activation experiment are whether only stimulation to the cue events (both on and off), or whether only stimulation to the shock. Thus this experiment would benefit from additional data showing either a no shock control, to show that enhanced activity of the LC to the tone is not inherently aversive, or manipulations to the tone but not to the shock.</p>
<p>• Specificity of the GRAB-NE and GRAB-DA sensors should be either justified through additional experiments testing the alternative antagonist (i.e. GRAB-NE CNO+eticloprode / GRAB-DA CNO+yohimbine) or additional citations that have tested this already. It is critical for the claims of the paper to show that these sensors are specific to dopamine or norepinephrine.</p>
<p>• The role of dopamine in prediction error was tested through a series of conditions whereby the shock was presented either signaled (i.e. predicted), or not. However, another way that prediction error is signaled is through the absence of an expected outcome. Admittedly it might not be possible to observe a decrease in dopamine signaling with this methodology.</p>
<p>• The difference between Fig. 6E and 6H needs to be clarified. What is shown in Fig. 6E is that the response to the shock decreases through experience (i.e. by the 10th trial). However in Fig 6H, there is no difference between signaled and signaled shock, but this is during conditioning, and not after learning (based on my understanding of the methods, line 482).</p>
<p>• Unless I missed it, at no point in the manuscript is the number of subjects described. Please add the n per experiment within each section describing each experiment in the methods (Behavioral procedures). Some more details in the photometry statistical analysis would be helpful. For example, what is the n per group for every data set that is presented? How many trials per analysis?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript examines an important question, namely how the brain associates events spaced in time. It uses a variety of neural methods including fiber photometry as well as area-specific and pathway-silencing methods with the exquisite dissociation of norepinephrine and dopamine. The data show that neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) respond to auditory cue onset, offset, and shock. These responses are stronger if the cue is paired with shock in a trace procedure. Optogenetic stimulation similar to the neural response captured by fiber photometry enhances associative learning. LC terminals in the dorsal hippocampus also showed phasic responses during fear conditioning and drove dopamine and norepinephrine responses. Pharmacological methods revealed that dopamine and not norepinephrine is critical for fear learning.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The examination of the neural signal to different tone intensities, different shock intensities, repeated tone presentation (habituation), and conditioning, offers an unprecedented account of the neural signal to non-associative and associative processes. This kind of deconstruction of the elements of conditioning offers a strong account of how the brain processes the stimuli used and their interaction during learning.</p>
<p>Excellent use of data acquired with fiber photometry in the optogenetic interrogation study.</p>
<p>The use of pharmacology to disentangle dopamine and norepinephrine was excellent.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
While the optogenetic study was lovely, a control using the same stimulation but delivered at different time points would have been a good addition to show how critical the neural signal at tone onset, tone offset, and shock is.</p>
<p>Justification for the focus on D1 receptors was lacking.</p>
<p>The manuscript provides convincing evidence that the neural signal is not an error-correcting one by including a predicted (by a tone) and unpredicted shock. One possibility is that perhaps the unpredicted shock could be predicted by the context. Some clarification on the behavioural procedures would help understand if indeed the unsignaled shock could be predicted by the context or not.</p>
