<title>Abstract</title><p>Hypoxia is an important physiological stress causing nerve injuries and several brain diseases. However, the mechanism of brain response to hypoxia remains unclear, thus limiting the development of interventional strategies. This study conducted combined analyses of single-nucleus transcriptome sequencing and extracellular vesicle transcriptome sequencing on hypoxic mouse brains, described cell-cell communication in the brain under hypoxia from intercellular and extracellular dimensions, confirmed that hemoglobin mRNA was transferred from non-neuronal cells to neurons, and eventually expressed. Then we further explored the role of exosomal hemoglobin transfer <italic>in vitro</italic>, clarified that hypoxia promoted the transfer and expression of exosomal hemoglobin between endothelial cells and neurons. And we found the vital function of exosomal hemoglobin to protect against neurological injury by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons. In conclusion, this study identified a novel mechanism of ‘mutual aid’ in hypoxia responses in the brain, involving exosomal hemoglobin transfer, clarified the important role of exosomal communication in the process of brain stress response, and provided a novel interventional perspective for hypoxia-related brain diseases.</p>

<label>1</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-enclosed vesicles secreted by cells into the extracellular environment, and are an important means of cell communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. EV-mediated communication can participate in the regulation of intercellular signals in physiological and pathological conditions by transferring different contents, such as bioactive lipids, non-coding RNAs, mRNAs, and proteins, and the process is closely related to the occurrence and development of various diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Current research on the biological function of EVs is mostly focused on EVs in body fluids, such as plasma and saliva; however, although their acquisition is relatively simple, such EVs have low tissue specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In contrast, more in-depth studies have obtained and analyzed EVs from the extracellular environment in organs with complex structures, thus improving tissue specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, this still fails to identify the cell type from which they are derived, making it impossible to carry out more detailed analyses of directional interactions between cells. The development of single-cell/nuclear transcriptome sequencing (snRNA-seq) technology allows us to explore the heterogeneity of cells in complex organs, and the combination of snRNA-seq and tissue EVs transcriptome sequencing (EVs-RNA-seq) can help us to clarify the source of tissue EVs and analyze the complex physiological and pathological conditions of organs, using the dual advantages of intracellular and extracellular approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Hypoxia is a common stress response in the body that can mediate a series of physiological reactions, including embryonic development and bone marrow hematopoiesis. Hypoxia is also an important factor in various pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. As the most O2-dependent organ, the brain accounts for 20% of the resting O2 consumption in humans and is thus highly sensitive to hypoxic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Hypoxia is a key cause of many neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease (PD), and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Although there is known to be a close relationship between hypoxic stress and neurodegeneration, the responses of and damage to brain cells in hypoxic environments remain unclear. The application of snRNA-seq combined with tissue EVs-RNA-seq analysis can be used to comprehensively analyze the interactions among various cell types in the brain under hypoxic stress, thus helping us to understand the mechanisms of neurodegenerative injury and to identify potential therapeutic molecules for interventions.</p>
<p>Hemoglobin is a major protein involved in the transport and utilization of O2 in the body. It is composed of globin and heme and is mainly expressed in red blood cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Previous studies found that hemoglobin also existed in the brain, mainly in neurons, where it was involved in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis and the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis, and its expression level was significantly increased under hypoxic stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. However, recent studies found that hemoglobin may also be involved in the development of neurodegeneration; for example, α-synuclein pathology-hemoglobin-mitochondrial aggregates were found in Lewy bodies in patients with PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In addition, neuronal hemoglobin induced dopaminergic neuron loss and cognitive deficits in the substantia nigra in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and hemoglobin deposited in the cerebral cortex after intracerebral hemorrhage exerted neurotoxicity and induced neuronal death in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In summary, the specific role of hemoglobin expression in neurons is controversial, and the role of hypoxia in the function of hemoglobin in neurons is still unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we established a chronic hypoxia mouse model and identified one of the brain’s responses to hypoxia. Specifically, we found that non-neuronal cells in the brain regulate neuronal hemoglobin levels via EV-communication under hypoxic conditions, as revealed by the combined analyses of snRNA-seq and EVs-RNA-seq. We also established an <italic>in vitro</italic> hypoxia neuron model to investigate the specific molecular mechanism of neuroprotection, demonstrating that exosomal hemoglobin helped neurons resist hypoxic damage by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. In summary, this study found a new mechanism of exosomal hemoglobin delivery in the brain’s hypoxic response ‘ mutual aid ’, and clarified the important role of exosomal communication in the brain’s hypoxic stress response and resistance to injury. It provides a new research perspective for the prevention and treatment of hypoxic-ischemic-related brain diseases.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Hypoxia induced cognitive and motor dysfunction and neuropathological damage</title>
<p>In order to clarify the damage caused by hypoxia in the brain, we established a chronic hypoxia model in C57/BL mice using a closed and controllable hypoxic box, the mice were divided into a control group (Con) and a hypoxic treatment group (hypoxia for 28 days, H28d) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Behavioral tests and neuropathological staining were used to examine the effect of chronic hypoxia on neurological impairment and nerve damage. The results of the Y maze tests showed that the alternation behavior was significantly decreased, and the novel object recognition tests showed that the exploration time of new objects was significantly reduced after hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxia induced cognitive dysfunction in mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). To evaluate spontaneous movement, we performed an open-field tests and recorded the motor function and cognitive function indicators of the two groups. The movement trajectory in the open field were significantly reduced in H28d group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Assuming that the total exercise times were similar in both groups, the exercise distance and speed were also significantly reduced in H28d mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). These results suggested that the motor function was impaired after hypoxia. In addition, H28d mice spent less time exploring the central area of the open field and crossing the central area, indicating anxiety-like behavior (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

<p>We subsequently examined the brains in the two groups of mice by neuropathological staining to determine if this chronic hypoxic treatment induced nerve damage. Nissl staining showed that neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region were disordered in H28d group, with gaps, abnormal arrangement, and darker cytoplasm compared with Con group, suggested that the hippocampus was damaged in H28d group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). It was also found that the hippocampal region of H28d group showed obvious atrophy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Neuronal degeneration staining (Fluoro-Jade B staining, FJB) showed neurodegeneration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal region in mice in H28d group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). We also carried out Golgi staining to reveal the morphology and structure of neurons in the brains in the two groups of mice, and showed that the density of dendritic spines on neurons was significantly lower in H28d group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">K</xref>). Above all, chronic hypoxia induced cognitive and motor dysfunction and nerve damage in mice.</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>Hypoxia induced transcription of hemoglobin in non-neuronal cells</title>
<p>To explore the molecular mechanism responsible for chronic hypoxia-induced nerve injury in the brain, we performed snRNA-seq of two groups, and visualized the distribution of gene expression in all samples using UMAP visualization and identified 13 cell types according to the expression of cell-specific markers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). We described the proportions of cells before and after hypoxia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Differentially up- and down-regulated genes in different cell types were analyzed by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref> to <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">L</xref>). Among these, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in endothelial cells (Endo) was the highest after hypoxia, and most of them were up-regulated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We subsequently displayed DEGs in all cell subsets, labeled the top 10 genes, and found the mRNA expression levels of hemoglobin subunits (<italic>Hba-a1</italic>, <italic>Hba-a2</italic>, <italic>Hbb-bs</italic>, <italic>Hbb-bt</italic>) were significantly up-regulated in most non-neuronal cells after hypoxia, indicated that might be a common mechanism whereby various non-neuronal cells in the brain respond to hypoxic stress (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>We further clarified the interactions among various cell types in the brain under chronic hypoxic stress using the circle diagram and heat map, to show the changes in communication among different cell types in the H28d group compared with the Con group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). We found that the number and intensity of intercellular communications in the brain both increased after hypoxia. Above all, these results suggested that various non-neuronal cells in the brain jointly transcribed hemoglobin under chronic hypoxic stress, which might represent a common mechanism in response to hypoxic stress.</p>

<label>2.3</label><title>Hypoxia induced the release of non-neuronal EVs carrying hemoglobin mRNA</title>
<p>SnRNA-seq analysis showed that chronic hypoxia increased intercellular communication in the brain; however, the effects of hypoxia on EVs-mediated communication remain unclear. Hypoxia has been shown to be an important factor inducing EVs release by cells, suggesting that the EVs-mediated communication pathway may be an important mechanism for cells to respond to hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We therefore performed EVs-RNA-seq of two groups to analyze the mechanisms involved in the brain’s resistance to hypoxic damage from the perspective of EVs regulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We identified EVs isolated from mouse brain tissue. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the diameter of the EVs was approximately 100 nm and displayed a characteristic cup-shaped morphology (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed positive expression of EV markers TSG101, HSP90, and CD9, while calnexin was not detected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Nanoparticle tracking analysis indicated that the predominant size of the isolated EVs ranged from 50 to 200 nm, with increased EV secretion observed in the brains following hypoxia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>After the transcriptome sequencing of EVs isolated from Con and H28d mice, we analyzed the DEGs between these two groups (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). A total of 2257 DEGs were identified, of which 1493 were up-regulated and 764 were down-regulated after hypoxia. Hemoglobin mRNA was also significantly up-regulated in EVs after hypoxia, consistent with the snRNA-seq results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). We conducted gene enrichment analysis on all identified up- and down-regulated DEGs and selected the top 5 enriched pathways for presentation. We found that several pathways related to RNA metabolism were significantly up-regulated, while several pathways associated with energy metabolism were down-regulated (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref> to <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). These results suggested that energy metabolism pathways in the brain may have been damaged by hypoxia, and various cell types in the brain may regulate RNA metabolism via the EVs pathway to resist hypoxic injury. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis yielded results consistent with the aforementioned analysis (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref> to <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). And the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that the function of mitochondria in the brain was also severely impaired after hypoxia (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2I</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">J</xref>).</p>
<p>We compared the DEGs obtained from EVs-RNA-seq with the snRNA-seq, and screened out DEGs that changed consistently within the cell and in the extracellular environment after hypoxia. Our findings revealed the proportion of cells releasing EVs in each group, indicating a significant increase in EVs secretion solely by brain Endo following hypoxia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Multiple differential mRNAs were present in EVs secreted by various types of cells after hypoxia, including mRNAs of hemoglobin subunits, suggesting that this may be a common way for multiple cells to respond to hypoxia via the EVs pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). We therefore analyzed the hemoglobin mRNA levels in EVs from the two groups, and found that exosomal mRNA levels of hemoglobin were significantly increased after hypoxia, but only existed in EVs secreted by non-neuronal cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3I</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">J</xref>). We subsequently performed GO analysis on all DEGs with consistent changes in both snRNA-seq and EVs-RNA-seq according to cell types for GO analysis, and presented the common signaling pathways accumulated in three or more cell types. Many of these pathways were related to hemoglobin function, suggesting that changes in hemoglobin after hypoxia induction could be a common means by which various types of cells respond to hypoxia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>). Above all, chronic hypoxia can enhance EVs communication in the brain, and induce non-neuronal cells to transcribe hemoglobin and release them in the form of EVs.</p>

<p>Combined analysis of snRNA-seq and EVs-RNA-seq showed numerous hemoglobin mRNA existed in the intracellular and extracellular environments in the brain after hypoxia, which may provide a common mechanism for various cell types to cope with hypoxic injury. However, changes in hemoglobin protein levels after hypoxia were still unclear.

<p>Although previous studies showed that transient hypoxia induced the expression of hemoglobin in neurons in the brain, its specific function is still unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We therefore speculated that hemoglobin expression levels may also be increased in neurons after hypoxia. We labeled Hba and Map2 by immunofluorescence, found that the Hba fluorescence intensity in Map2-positive cells increased significantly after hypoxia, indicating that hypoxia induced hemoglobin specifically expressed and accumulated in neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref> to <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">J</xref>). SnRNA-seq and EVs-RNA-seq showed that chronic hypoxia-induced hemoglobin transcription was mainly increased in non-neuronal cells and their secreted EVs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3J</xref>), but immunofluorescence showed that hypoxia-induced increased hemoglobin was specifically present in neurons, confirming that non-neuronal cells in the brain could dynamically regulate hemoglobin levels in neurons via the EVs pathway under hypoxia, thus helping neurons to resist the hypoxic damage.</p>
<p>Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a recently discovered type of oxygen-carrying globin, which under hypoxic conditions can facilitate the diffusion of oxygen into mitochondria, enhancing tissue oxygen utilization. Particularly, it plays a crucial protective role in neural tissues during cerebral ischemia and hypoxia. To elucidate whether Ngb exerts protective effects in the brains of H28d mice, we conducted an analysis of snRNA-seq data. Visualization of Ngb transcription levels revealed consistently low expression levels across various brain cell types before and after hypoxia, contrasting with the behavior of hemoglobin. Consequently, this study continued its focus on elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms underlying hemoglobin’s response to hypoxia.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are the main organelles involved in aerobic respiration and are highly sensitive to oxygen concentrations. We therefore determined if hypoxia induced mitochondrial damage in brain. Western blotting showed that mitochondrial complex I and IV were both significantly decreased in the brain after hypoxia, through analysing the markers of mitochondrial complex I (NDUFB8) and complex IV (citrate synthase) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref> to <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">M</xref>). We further detected the activity of mitochondrial complex I in the brain in both groups, and showed that its activity was significantly decreased after hypoxia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref>). These results confirm that chronic hypoxia can damage mitochondrial activity in the brain. Above all, these results indicate that hypoxia induced non-neuronal transcriptionally increased hemoglobin is transmitted to neurons via the EVs pathway.</p>

<p>We constructed an <italic>in vitro</italic> hypoxia model to clarify the specific protective mechanism of exosomal hemoglobin produced in hypoxia-induced neurons on mitochondria. In view of the most significant increase in cell communication intensity and the highest transcription of hemoglobin in endothelial cells (EC) after hypoxia, we used the human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hcMEC/D3 cells) as a representative of non-neuronal cells in the brain, and the human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells) as a cell model of hypoxia-induced nerve injury. We established four different hypoxia-duration groups using an oxygen concentration of 1%, and detected the effects on cell viability and cytotoxicity.

<p>Considering the mitochondrial damage in the mouse hypoxia models, we detected the mitochondrial status of SH-SY5Y cells before and after hypoxia. We labeled the mitochondria using MitoTracker and detected the fluorescence intensity in each group of SH-SY5Y cells by flow cytometry to determine the number of mitochondria (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Fluorescence intensity in SH-SY5Y cells decreased gradually with hypoxia time, indicating that the number of mitochondria was significantly reduced by prolongation of hypoxia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). The mitochondrial membrane potential is an important indicator of mitochondrial function. Its reduction will induce mitochondrial homeostasis damage in cells, which in turn induces cell damage. We therefore evaluated the effects of hypoxia by JC-1 staining, and found the mitochondrial membrane potential also significantly decreased with prolongation of hypoxia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). These results indicate that severe mitochondrial damage occurred when neurons encountered hypoxic stress, which may be a key factor in hypoxic nerve injury.</p>
<p>To further simulate the response of non-neuronal cells to transcribed hemoglobin and EVs to neurons and express in the former research, we first detected <italic>HBA1</italic> mRNA levels in hcMEC/D3 and SH-SY5Y cells in each group. Level of <italic>HBA1</italic> mRNA was significantly up-regulated in hcMEC/D3 cells in the H4h group, and then slowly decreased to pre-hypoxia levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). However, level of <italic>HBA1</italic> mRNA in SH-SY5Y cells was unaffected by hypoxia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). We then isolated and analyzed EVs from hcMEC/D3 cells under different treatment durations and showed that EVs were significantly increased in the H8h group compared with the H0h group, indicating that hypoxia for 8 h induced EVs release by hcMEC/D3 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref> to <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on the results showing that hypoxia treatment for 8 h had no significant toxic effect on hcMEC/D3 cells, and hcMEC/D3 cells showed the most significant increase in <italic>HBA1</italic> transcription and the largest release of EVs, we selected conditioned medium from H8h hcMEC/D3 cells as the donors of hemoglobin mRNA EVs in subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, with conditioned medium from H0h hcMEC/D3 cells as the control. To determine if the EVs secreted by EC under hypoxia were taken up and utilized by neurons, we first isolated EVs from hcMEC/D3 H8h cells by ultracentrifugation, and co-cultured them with SH-SY5Y cells after fluorescence labeling. The results showed that hcMEC/D3 H8h EVs were actively taken up by SH-SY5Y cells, thus providing a basis for subsequent exploration of the neuroprotective effect of EC-derived EVs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). In order to determine if EVs secreted by EC helped neurons to dynamically regulate hemoglobin levels and resist hypoxia-induced nerve damage, we used EC-conditioned medium exchange experiments. Cells were subjected to hypoxia for 0 (H0h) or 8 h (H8h), hypoxia for 8 h + control medium (H8h + H0h (EC)), and hypoxia for 8 h + conditioned medium (H8h + H8h (EC)). In the H8h + H0h (EC) and H8h + H8h (EC) groups, endothelial cell H0h (+H0h (EC)) and H8h medium (+ H8h (EC)) were exchanged into SH-SY5Y cells, followed by hypoxic treatment.

<p>We detected <italic>HBA1</italic> mRNA levels in SH-SY5Y cells in each group. <italic>HBA1</italic> mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated in the H8h + H8h (EC) group, suggesting that conditioned medium from EC treated with hypoxia for 8 h could increase the transcription of hemoglobin after hypoxia (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). We also detected the protein levels of Hba by immunofluorescence, and showed that Hba protein levels were significantly increased in the H8h + H8h (EC) group, confirming that H8h conditioned medium from EC could increase hemoglobin levels in neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>).</p>
<p>We confirmed that hypoxia treatment for 8 h decreased SH-SY5Y cell viability, the number of mitochondria, and mitochondrial membrane potential. We therefore detected the cell and mitochondrial viability of SH-SY5Y cells supplemented with EC-derived conditioned medium and hypoxia, according to the above experimental protocol (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Treatment with H8h EC-conditioned medium improved the number of mitochondria and mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">G</xref>), and improved the viability of neurons after hypoxia for 8 h (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>).</p>
<p>To verified the function of exosomal hemoglobin in helping neurons to resist hypoxic injury in primary neurons (PN) <italic>in vitro</italic>, we designed the following experiments. The results of immunofluorescence showed that hcMEC/D3 H8h EVs were actively taken up by PN (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). The PN were then subjected to EC-conditioned medium exchange combined with hypoxia treatment to determine if conditioned medium could increase the transcription and expression levels of hemoglobin.

JC-1 staining showed that the mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly higher in the H8h + H8h (EC) group than in the H8h group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6M</xref>). MitoTracker staining showed that mitochondrial numbers were significantly increased in the H8h + H8h (EC) group compared with the H8h group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6N</xref>). We also evaluated the viability of PN in each group by PI/Hoechst staining and showed that their cell viability was significantly reduced after 8 h of hypoxia treatment, and that this damage could be attenuated by EC-conditioned medium (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6O</xref>).

<label>3</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The brain is the most vulnerable organ to hypoxic injury and hypoxia is associated with the occurrence and development of various central nervous system diseases; however, the specific molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Beyond the hypoxia-inducible factor signaling pathways, intercellular communication among diverse brain cell types is imperative for mitigating stress-induced damage in hypoxic conditions. Mounting evidence suggests that hypoxia enhances intercellular communication primarily through interactions involving EVs, thereby facilitating the transmission of various cargoes with distinct functional roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Our research findings also indicate that hypoxia induces a significant enhancement in EVs-mediated communication among various cell types in the brain. Through the isolation and purification of tissue-derived EVs followed by transcriptomic sequencing analysis, we are able to describe changes in intercellular communication within the brain from an extracellular perspective. However, this method does not provide a comprehensive map of intracellular communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Through the combined analysis of snRNA-seq and EVs-RNA-seq, we can accurately identify the cellular origin of brain-derived EVs, thus comprehensively revealing changes in intercellular communication within the brain induced by hypoxia. This study elucidates a novel mechanism whereby various non-neuronal cells in the brain regulate hemoglobin levels in neurons through EV-communication under hypoxic stress, emphasizing the crucial role of extracellular vesicle communication in the brain’s response to hypoxia.</p>
<p>Hemoglobin, as the main protein carrying and transporting oxygen molecules in the body, is also expressed in neurons, but its precise function remains controversial <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Current research suggests that hemoglobin expressed in the brains of PD patients participates in regulating intraneuronal oxygen homeostasis and maintaining mitochondrial stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. However, other studies indicate that hemoglobin may exert neurotoxic effects by inducing oxidative stress and neuronal death, thereby contributing to the onset and progression of neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. To clarify the role of hemoglobin in the brain under hypoxic stress, this study, based on the elucidation of the mechanism by which non-neuronal cells regulate neuronal hemoglobin through extracellular vesicles, conducted in vitro experiments. These experiments revealed that increased expression of extracellular vesicle-derived hemoglobin in neurons under hypoxia helps maintain mitochondrial homeostasis by sustaining mitochondrial membrane potential, thus aiding neurons in resisting hypoxic damage. This study clarified that the expression of exosomal hemoglobin in neurons contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis under stress, expanded the function of hemoglobin except transporting oxygen over a long range.</p>
<p>However, our research also had some limitations. First, we only clarified the hypoxic protective effect of hemoglobin on neuronal mitochondria <italic>in vitro</italic>, and were unable to explain the inconsistency between the increase in neuronal hemoglobin expression and the decrease of mitochondrial activity observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. We speculated that some pathological changes may make hemoglobin, which is increased in response to hypoxia, unable to exert its mitochondrial protective effect, even more than making hemoglobin transform and exacerbating nerve damage. For example, previous studies reported large numbers of phosphorylated α-synuclein and hemoglobin aggregates in Lewy bodies in PD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and we previously confirmed that chronic hypoxia increased α-synuclein phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. We therefore speculate that hemoglobin is increased in response to hypoxia and then phosphorylated by α-synuclein binding to stay in the cytoplasm, thus losing its mitochondrial protective ability and form pathological depositions, inducing cell death. However, further studies are needed to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>In summary, we used the combined analysis of snRNA-seq and EVs-RNA-seq to examine the effects of hypoxia on interactions among different cell types in the brain, and to clarify the hypoxic response mechanism of non-neuronal EVs communication pathways to dynamically regulate hemoglobin levels in neurons. We revealed that increased levels of exosomal hemoglobin in neurons may help neurons to resist hypoxic injury by protecting mitochondrial function. These results clarify the molecular mechanism by which various non-neuronal cells interact via the EVs pathway to help neurons resist hypoxic injury, and highlight the important role of hemoglobin in hypoxia-related nerve injury, thus providing a new perspective for the prevention and treatment of various hypoxic-ischemic brain diseases.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> paper seeks to determine the role of endogenous CNS hemoglobin in protecting mitochondrial homeostasis in hypoxia. There is merit in the work, although it remains <bold>incomplete</bold> as there is a question as to the validity of the hypoxia model as relevant to CNS-specific ischemia/hypoxia that should be considered. In particular, a whole-body hypoxia model may liberate exosomes from other hypoxic organs, which should be addressed by the authors. Overall, this work has the potential to be of broad interest to the neuroscience and hypoxia communities.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the hypoxia rescue mechanisms of neurons by non-neuronal cells in the brain from the perspective of exosomal communication between brain cells. Through multi-omics combined analysis, the authors revealed this phenomenon and logically validated this intercellular rescue mechanism under hypoxic conditions through experiments. The study proposed a novel finding that hemoglobin maintains mitochondrial function, expanding the conventional understanding of hemoglobin. This research is highly innovative, providing new insights for the treatment of hypoxic encephalopathy.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is well organized and written, however, there are some minor/major points that need to be revised before this manuscript is accepted.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) Hypoxia can induce endothelial cells to release exosomes carrying hemoglobin, however, how neurons are able to actively take up these exosomes? It is possible for other cells to take up these exosomes also? This point needs to be clarified in this study.</p>
<p>(2) The expression of hemoglobin in neurons is important for mitochondrial homeostasis, but its relationship with mitochondrial homeostasis needs to be further elucidated in the study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an interesting study with a lot of data. Some of these ideas are intriguing. But a few major points require further consideration.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) What disease is this model of whole animal hypoxia supposed to mimic? If one is focused on the brain, can one just use a model of focal or global cerebral ischemia?</p>
<p>(2) If this model subjects the entire animal to hypoxia, then other organs will also be hypoxic. Should one also detect endothelial upregulation and release of extracellular vesicles containing hemoglobin mRNA in non-CNS organs? Where do these vesicles go? Into blood?</p>
<p>(3) What other mRNA are contained in the vesicles released from brain endothelial cells?</p>
<p>(4) Where do the endothelial vesicles go? Only to neurons? Or to other cells as well?</p>
<p>(5) Neurons can express endogenous hemoglobin. Is it useful to subject neurons to hypoxia and then see how much the endogenous mRNA goes up? How large is the magnitude of endogenous hemoglobin gene upregulation compared to the hypothesized exogenous mRNA that is supposed to be donated from endothelial vesicles?</p>
<p>(6) Finally, it may be useful to provide more information and data to explain how the expression of this exogenous endothelial-derived hemoglobin binds to neuronal mitochondria to alter function.</p>
