<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Fluorescent biosensors toggle between two states and for the vast majority of biosensors one state is bright and the other state is dim. As a consequence, there is a substantial difference in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the two states. The dim state has a low signal-to-noise ratio, which is problematic when precise, quantitative measurements are needed. During the engineering of a red-shifted variant of an mTurquoise-based calcium sensor, we serendipitously generated a green-emitting sensor that shows high brightness in both the calcium-bound and -unbound state, while still showing a calcium dependent lifetime change of &gt;1 nanosecond. This sensor, named G-Ca-FLITS, is comparable in brightness to the bright state of GCaMP3 and jGCaMP7c in mammalian cells. The calcium induced loss in fluorescence intensity is only around 30% and therefore we observe little variation in the SNR when calcium levels change. G-Ca-FLITS shows negligible sensitivity to pH in the physiological range, like its turquoise parent. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), we measured the calcium concentration with G-Ca-FLITS in various organelles and observed in HeLa cells transient and spatially heterogeneous calcium elevations in mitochondria. Finally, we evaluated the use of G-Ca-FLITS and its turquoise predecessor for two-photon FLIM in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECIs) are by far the largest family of biosensors, with over 100 members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Greenwald et al., 2018</xref>) including the well-known GCaMP series. Many GECIs harboring a single fluorescent protein (FP), like GCaMPs, are optimized for a large intensity change, and have a (very) dim state when calcium levels are below the K<sub>D</sub> of the probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, the fluorescence of most sensors is a non-linear function of calcium concentration, usually with Hill coefficients between 2 and 3. This is ideal when the probe is used as a binary detector for increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, but it makes robust quantification of low, or even intermediate, calcium concentrations extremely challenging. For precise quantification of low calcium concentrations a biosensor with an inverted response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barykina et al., 2016</xref>) is a good alternative, as these variants are bright in the calcium-free state. However, this only partially resolves the issue, reducing the precision of measurements for the conditions where the calcium concentration exceeds the K<sub>D</sub> of the probe.</p>
<p>The fluorescence intensity is affected by many factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Culley et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Waters, 2009</xref>), complicating the measurement of absolute calcium concentrations with biosensors that use intensity contrast as a read-out. Therefore, we and others have engineered genetically encoded biosensors that use other read-outs. New biosensors that report with a change in photochromic behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bierbuesse et al., 2022</xref>), anisotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Laskaratou et al., 2021</xref>), or fluorescence lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Díaz-García et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Klarenbeek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>) have been developed. In all these approaches the precision of the measurement depends on the number of emitted photons. The turquoise lifetime sensor Tq-Ca-FLITS that we developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>) shows a 3-fold intensity change, with the low intensity (and low SNR) at low calcium concentrations. To better measure both states accurately, i.e., with high SNR, one would want a biosensor that is bright in both states. Such a sensor could be used for imaging low concentrations of calcium and subsequent increases, for example in various organelles of unstimulated mammalian cells, including mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Parry et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Calcium signaling in mitochondria is reported to be linked with several pathophysiological processes including inflammatory responses, diabetes, heart failure, neurological diseases and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Delierneux et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Giorgi et al., 2018</xref>). Over the years, mitochondrial calcium concentrations have been measured with imaging techniques; however, there are discrepancies between the reported values. The affinity of a sensor is of major importance: a low K<sub>D</sub> can underestimate high concentrations and vice versa. Differences can also arise due to the method of calibration, i.e. when the absolute minimum and maximum signal are not reached in the calibration procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fernandez-Sanz et al., 2019</xref>). Also, the sensor’s kinetics should be sufficiently fast enough to be able to follow the calcium changes.. Aside from the previously discussed fluorescent biosensors, imaging has also been performed with fluorescent calcium dyes (Rhod-2) and aequorin bioluminescent sensors. However, fluorescent calcium dyes appear to have difficulties following repetitive imaging in comparison to protein-based biosensors and morphological changes to cells are observed, especially after light exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fonteriz et al., 2010</xref>). Also, fluorescent dyes are difficult to target to mitochondria, so cytoplasmic signals can easily contaminate the measurements. Bioluminescence sensors are unfavorable when cell-to-cell variation is studied due to their low signal intensity, which hinders single cell imaging. Finally, regardless of the biosensor that is used, it should give a stable signal at the high mitochondrial pH of 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cano Abad et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Llopis et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a need for robust calcium sensors that perform well in all criteria discussed above. In this paper we document the development of a green calcium sensor by an optimized bacterial screening method. We report the spectroscopic properties of the purified sensor and show its use for robust measurements of calcium levels in mitochondria of HeLa cells and endothelial cells by lifetime imaging.</p>

<title>A high throughput method to screen sensors in bacterial lysate</title>
<p>Before creating sensor variants, we developed a high-throughput method to screen different calcium sensors in bacterial lysate. The aim was to grow and isolate 96 bacterial cultures in parallel in a deep well plate. A previously developed lysis buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Danilevich et al., 2008</xref>) served as a starting point for optimization of the protocol. Bacteria expressing the sensor Tq-Ca-FLITS were used to compare the lysis efficiency. The following variables were tested in a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer: 1) presence or absence of a freeze/thawing cycle, 2) presence or absence of lysozyme, 3) different concentrations of urea (0, 0.5 and 1 M), 4) different concentrations of deoxycholic acid (DOC, 1, 2 and 3%). After lysis, the fluorescence intensity of the bacterial lysates was compared (Figure S1).</p>
<p>In general, a freezing and thawing cycle resulted in a higher fluorescence intensity for most conditions. However, this doubled the duration of the protocol. A high concentration of DOC and urea combined was too harsh for the fluorescent sensor: no intensity was detected. All other conditions were comparable. We favored a buffer without urea to maintain the native state of the proteins, and without lysozyme to omit the need to freshly add this component before each use. Therefore, we chose a protocol with 2% DOC and without a freezing step. The obtained lysates were of sufficient brightness and purity to use for spectral measurements and lifetime measurements.</p>
<p>We explored the possibility of replacing the 2% DOC with other detergents, but no improvements were found. Triton-X100 (0.1-1%) gave lower intensities compared to DOC and caused a problematic amount of foam during handling. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 0.1-0.5%), an anionic surfactant in contrast to non-ionic Triton-X100 and DOC, also gave lower intensities and poses the risk of denaturation of the proteins (Figure S2). Therefore, we chose the 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer with 2% DOC for further experiments.</p>

<title>Creating a red shifted calcium sensor with lifetime contrast</title>
<p>We aimed to generate a green biosensor with lifetime contrast. Therefore, we used the previously developed turquoise sensor (Tq-Ca-FLITS) and mutated residues that potentially induce a red-shift. We subjected the Tq-Ca-FLITS to directed mutagenesis of residues T203 (mTurquoise2 numbering, T81 in the full sensor) and I167 (mTurquoise2 numbering, I45 in the full sensor) to aromatic amino acids. Both residues are located close to the chromophore. The mutation T203Y is known to cause a red shift in green fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ormö et al., 1996</xref>) and mTurquoise2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gorbachev et al., 2017</xref>). We anticipated that π-π stacking of the aromatic residue with the chromophore would result in the color shift in Tq-Ca-FLITS as well. The candidate sensors were expressed in bacteria and the bacteria were subjected to the optimized bacterial lysis protocol. The lysates were screened for a lifetime change and a change in excitation and emission spectra, measured in both the calcium-bound and calcium-free states by addition of CaCl<sub>2</sub> or EDTA (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Figure S3).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Mutations T203Y and T203F both resulted in a red-shifted excitation and emission spectrum in both calcium states, but the shift was more pronounced for the T203Y mutation. This Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y variant also showed a large phase lifetime contrast of Δ<italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>φ</italic></sub> = -0.9 ns. Surprisingly, this change is inverted compared to Tq-Ca-FLITS (Δ<italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>φ</italic></sub> = 1.1 ns). The T203F mutation also inverted the lifetime response; however, the contrast was about half of the Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y variant. A mutation of I167F or I167H in the background of the T203Y variant, or a separate I167F mutation on Tq-Ca-FLITS reduced the lifetime contrast and did not result in a (further) red shift.</p>
<p>We also tested the T203Y and T203H mutations on different circular permutations (cp) of Tq-Ca-FLITS, which we created in during the development of the turquoise sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>). In almost all cp variants with the T203Y mutation, the same red shift in both the excitation and emission spectra was observed as for Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y. An exception was the cp150-T203Y variant, where we observed a red shift only for the calcium-bound state in both excitation and emission spectra (Table S1, Figure S3). This variant differs from Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y by only a F146Y mutation. A T203H mutation did not cause a red shift in any of the cp variants.</p>

<title>Improving the green lifetime sensor by mutagenesis</title>
<p>We aimed to further improve Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y by mutagenesis in the regions linking the calcium binding domains to the FP. Using a PCR approach, we created a library of sensors with any possible amino acid on positions V27 and N271 (numbering according to the sensor). Bright green fluorescent colonies on an agar plate were selected for the bacterial lysis test. We found three sensors with an improved lifetime contrast: with alanine or valine on position 27, and aspartic acid or serine at position 271 (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The sensor with V27A and N271D gave the best results with a contrast of Δτ<sub><italic>φ</italic></sub> = -1.4 ns. Notably, the lifetime contrast of Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y is larger than measured in the previous screen (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which is due to a difference in temperature: the first screen was performed at 37 °C while this second one was performed at room temperature.</p>

<p>Next, we measured the lifetime response of the three improved variants in HeLa cells (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), before and after saturation of the sensor with ionomycin and calcium. Again, the variant with V27A and N271D gave the best results, with a lifetime change of -1.2 ns (both Δτ<sub><italic>φ</italic></sub> and Δτ<sub>M</sub>, high calcium minus low calcium), which is an improvement of ∼0.3 ns in lifetime change with respect to the parental sensor Tq-Ca-FLITs.

<title>Characterization of G-Ca-FLITS</title>
<p>In order to characterize its biophysical properties, we isolated G-Ca-FLITS from bacteria and purified the protein by a Ni-NTA column. The intermediate sensor Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y and a mTurquoise2 with T203Y mutation (mTq2_T203Y) were also purified for comparison (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). G-Ca-FLITS shows excitation and emission spectra that are evidently red-shifted when compared to the Turquoise variant. The same is true for any of the versions that contain the T203Y mutation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Figure S4).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="622032v1_fig1.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We determined the quantum yield (QY) of G-Ca-FLITS to be 41% for the calcium-free state, and 26% for the calcium-bound state (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, Figure S5). This difference of 15% is slightly higher than in the intermediate variant Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y (13%). Interestingly, the quantum yield of mTq2_T203Y is 24%, comparable to the calcium-bound state of G-Ca-FLITS. For G-Ca-FLITS, the extinction coefficient is for both states around 30,000 M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>, which is slightly higher than mTq2_T203Y (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, Figure S6).</p>
<p>We measured the pH sensitivity of G-Ca-FLITS and mTq2_T203Y (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Figure S7). In the calcium-free state the G-Ca-FLITS an increase in fluorescence lifetime in the range pH 4-6, followed by a stable lifetime above pH = 6. In contrast, in the calcium-bound state, the lifetime increases until pH = 5.5, followed by a drop and a stable lifetime above pH = 7. The mTq2_T203Y protein also shows a maximum of fluorescence lifetime at a low pH (pH = 4) followed by a drop and a stable lifetime above pH = 6.</p>

<p>Fluorescence lifetime of proteins diluted in pH buffer was measured (n=3). In case of G-Ca-FLITS, this was done in presence (gray, 0.1 mM CaCl2) or absence of calcium (black, 5 mM EGTA).

<p>The calcium affinity of the lifetime readout of G-Ca-FLITS was determined at 37°C. To this end, we measured the lifetime of the sensor in a range of calcium buffers using Frequency-Domain FLIM (FD-FLIM) and plotted this in a polar space (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Figure S8). The two extreme values (zero calcium and 39 μM free calcium) are located on different coordinates in the polar plot and all intermediate concentrations are located on a straight line between these two extremes. Based on the position in the polar plot, we determined the fraction of sensor in the calcium-bound state, while considering the intensity contribution of both states (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>The intensity contribution was determined based on the excitation and emission spectra, the extinction coefficient per wavelength, the QY and the properties of the microscope, i.e. the excitation/emission filters, the excitation source and the detector sensitivity profile (Supplemental Note 1, Figure S9). A calibration curve was fitted to the fraction of sensors in the calcium-bound state for each concentration, from which the calcium affinity was determined to be K<sub>D</sub> = 209 nM (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Using the variation in the measurements of the two extremes, we determined that we can reliably measure calcium concentration with G-Ca-FLITS at 37 °C between 14 nM and 16 μM. The same calibration was also performed at RT (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, Figure S8). Here, the calcium affinity was K<sub>D</sub> = 339 nM, higher compared to the calibration at 37°C. This is in line with the notion that binding strength generally increases with decreasing temperature.</p>

<title>Little change in intensity between the two states</title>
<p>During engineering and characterization of G-Ca-FLITS, we noted a low intensity contrast for the two extreme states. For a quantitative brightness analysis in cells, we co-expressed G-Ca-FLITS and the red fluorescent protein mScarlet-I in HeLa cells from a single plasmid, using a P2A sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We determined the ratio of green fluorescence over red fluorescence, to mitigate the effects of transfection efficiency, timing and cell thickness. The measurement was performed on both unstimulated cells, with a low intracellular calcium level, and cells stimulated with ionomycin and extra calcium to raise the calcium concentration to saturation of the sensor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). To normalize the GFP/RFP ratio, we used EGFP-mScarlet-I and a construct without a green FP. G-Ca-FLITS and all its intermediate variants showed a higher intensity in both states compared to mTq2_T203Y. We measured a 0.70-fold change in GFP/RFP ratio for G-Ca-FLITS between the calcium saturated cells and the unstimulated cells.</p>

<p>To compare G-Ca-FLITS to other green GECIs, we repeated the experiment with G-GECO and several variants of GCaMP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast to G-Ca-FLITS, these sensors show a high GFP/RFP ratio in the calcium saturated state and a low ratio in resting cells, resulting in a large ratio difference between the two states. The fold change was 5.6, 3.1, 4.6 and 6.3 for GCaMP3, GCaMP6s, jGCaMP7c and G-GECO1.1 respectively. The relative intensity of the GCaMPs/GECO in resting cells is much lower compared to the dimmest state of G-Ca-FLITS. We also found a larger standard variation in GFP/RFP in resting cells expressing GCaMP/G-GECO compared to G-Ca-FLITS.</p>
<p>The precision of the fluorescence lifetime depends on the number of photons. We hypothesized that the fluorescence lifetime of G-Ca-FLITS would have a similar precision in both low and high concentrations of calcium, given the small change in intensity. To examine this, we determined the signal to noise ratio (SNR = mean / standard deviation) of the fluorescence lifetime of G-Ca-FLITS in cells, measuring an area of 400 pixels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, Figure S10). Indeed, the SNR of G-Ca-FLITS is on average only 13% lower for the high calcium state. In comparison, the SNR of Tq-Ca-FLITS increases more than 2-fold when going from the low to high calcium state, in agreement with its 3-fold change in intensity. In all cases, the variation of the average lifetime of all cells is similar, meaning the average lifetime in the 400 pixels could be properly determined.</p>

<title>Measurement of calcium in organelles</title>
<p>Several tags were added to G-Ca-FLITS to target different organelles: the cytosol, the nucleus, the mitochondrial matrix, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). With the bright fluorescence of the probe independent of calcium, we could easily confirm the correct localization of the sensor to all targeted organelles, in both HeLa cells and Blood Outgrowth Endothelial Cells (BOECs) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we measured the calcium concentration in the various organelles in the same two cell types, using widefield FD-FLIM. Without stimulation, Hela cells showed an average calcium concentration of 57 nM in the cytosol, 79 nM in the nucleus and 148 nM in the mitochondria. After addition of 5 μg/mL ionomycin and 5 mM calcium, the average concentration was raised above 1 μM. In the ER the concentration was above 1 μM in all experiments. BOECs showed the same pattern, with average concentrations of 73 nM in the cytosol, 101 nM in the nucleus, 119 nM in the mitochondria and above 1 μM in the ER. After stimulation, the concentration in all organelles was elevated to above 1 μM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>In both cell types, no spatial differences were observed in unstimulated cells, except for the mitochondria of HeLa cells. Here, about 20% of the cells, had in peripheral parts a higher calcium concentration, comparable to the concentration in mitochondria after stimulation with ionomycin. These areas are not included in the calculations of the aforementioned averages.</p>
<p>HeLa cells expressing G-Ca-FLITS in the cytosol were stimulated with 1 μM histamine. We observed various patterns of oscillating calcium concentrations, confirming that binding of calcium to G-Ca-FLITS is reversible (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). The calcium concentration was elevated to about 1 μM after addition of ionomycin and calcium, as seen before. The same experiment was repeated with HeLa cells expressing G-Ca-FLITS in the mitochondria (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Stimulation with histamine resulted in either no reaction or an elevation of the calcium concentration followed by a drop to basal level. Addition of ionomycin and calcium resulted in high concentrations as expected.</p>
<p>Since confocal imaging of fluorescence lifetime results in images with a better spatial resolution, we used a confocal microscope with a Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) detector to examine the heterogeneity that we observed in mitochondria. From the confocal lifetime images, it is evident that several cells have mitochondria that show a decreased lifetime in the periphery of the cell (supplemental figure 11). This indicates that mitochondria show heterogeneity and that a pool of mitochondria has increased calcium levels.</p>
<p>The confocal TCSPC system needs relatively long integration times (several minutes) and we turned to a Leica Stellaris system which allows for a &gt;10-fold higher temporal resolution to study calcium dynamics. We introduced the 4mts-G-Ca-FLITS into HeLa cells and acquired a timelapse of lifetime images. At the end of the experiment digitonin was added to acquire the minimal lifetime, reflecting maximal calcium. Using the calibration curve that was generated using purified protein incubated with different calcium buffers (supplemental figure 12) we transformed the FLIM data into calcium concentration images as we did before. The calcium concentration images show the heterogeneity in calcium concentration and its dynamics over time (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). The elevated calcium concentrations are reversible but can last several minutes. Intriguingly, there is substantial difference in the dynamics between patches of mitochondria.</p>

<p>jGCaMP7f exhibited large changes in fluorescence intensity several minutes after we elevated external [K<sup>+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). After a number of minutes (with the exact number varying from fly to fly), calcium levels fluctuated between low and high states synchronously across the field of view (including the EPG neurites visible in the middle of <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref> and the neurites of off-target cells in the bottom corners of the same images). The sample with jGCaMP7f showed only a very small change in lifetime in response to elevated calcium (0.030 nanoseconds ± 0.003, mean ±sd) despite the many-fold shift in fluorescence intensity (5.79 ΔF/F ± 0.503 (mean ± sd).</p>
<p>Tq-Ca-FLITS fluorescence was higher than that of jGCaMP7f at baseline (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). In contrast, despite the high brightness of G-Ca-FLITS in the apo state in other systems, the baseline intensity of G-Ca-FLITS in these fly neurons was much lower than both jGCaMP7f and Tq-Ca-FLITS, for unclear reasons. Even with increased laser power, G-Ca-FLITS was dimmer than jGCaMP7f at baseline (see Methods) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, top row). In response to elevated [K<sup>+</sup>], Tq-Ca-FLITS showed large increases in fluorescence (1.672 ΔF/F ± 0.299, mean ± sd) and empirical lifetime (0.893 nanoseconds ± 0.043, mean ± sd) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). The response of G-Ca-FLITS was also consistent with increases in intracellular calcium: this sensor exhibited large decreases in empirical lifetime (−0.465 nanoseconds ± 0.101 (mean ± sd)) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>), and a modest decrease in intensity (−0.339 ΔF/F ± 0.043, mean ± sd) after perfusion of elevated external [K<sup>+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B, 8E</xref>). The lifetime response of Tq-Ca-FLITS and the ΔF/F response of jGCaMP7f resembled each other, with both signals gradually increasing over the span of 3-4 minutes after we increased external [K<sup>+</sup>]; the two signals then hit a plateau for ∼1 min, followed by a return to baseline and often additional plateaus (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B-C</xref>). By comparison, G-Ca-FLITS responses were more variable, typically exhibiting a smaller ramping phase and seconds-long spikes of activity rather than minutes-long plateaus (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, all three fluorophores exhibit calcium-dependent signals in an intact brain using 2P-FLIM. The Tq-Ca-FLITS lifetime response is particularly large and shows much higher brightness under 2P excitation than G-Ca-FLITS in both the baseline and high calcium states.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most fluorescent biosensors toggle between a dim and a bright state. The dim fluorescence decreases the SNR, thereby increasing the measurement error in quantitative imaging. Here, we present a green calcium biosensor, G-Ca-FLITS, that maintains a consistent brightness over its full dynamic range. The calcium-dependent lifetime decrease of 1.2 ns when calcium is elevated can be used to quantify calcium concentrations in cells. In comparison, the cyan/turquoise sensor Tq-Ca-FLITS we previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>) shows a 3-fold change in intensity combined with a similar change in lifetime. The intensity of G-Ca-FLITS is higher than the dim (calcium-free) state of several popular green GCaMPs, and comparable to the bright state of most tested sensors, as determined by ratio imaging with co-expression of mScarlet-I. Of the tested GCaMPs, GCaMP6s seems to have a fairly bright calcium-free state, and we believe this is due to the higher calcium affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 144 nM) of this sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the affinities are 339 nM, 298 nM and 618 nM at room temperature, for G-Ca-FLITS, jGCaMP7c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dana et al., 2019</xref>) and G-GECO1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>), respectively.</p>
<p>The minimal change in fluorescence intensity compared to other commonly used calcium biosensors results in a similar SNR for both states of G-Ca-FLITS. Therefore, low concentrations of calcium can be precisely measured in unstimulated mammalian cells, as well as increased concentration after stimulation. The quantitative measurements require calibration of the biosensor response to different calcium concentrations. Although the calibration is equipment independent under ideal conditions, and only needs to be performed once, we prefer to repeat the calibration for different set-ups to account for differences in temperature or pulse frequency.</p>
<p>Our measured concentrations in resting cells agree with literature, 20 - 100 nM is reported for cytoplasm and nucleus, and a slightly higher concentration of 50 - 300 nM in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arnaudeau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berridge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dalal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Palmer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rotrosen and Gallin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Worthen and Nollert, 2000</xref>). Free calcium in the ER is reported to be &gt;300 µM, well above saturation of G-Ca-FLITS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arnaudeau et al., 2001</xref>). Another advantage of a consistently bright probe is that cells and structures labeled with the biosensor can be readily visualized.</p>
<p>Using G-Ca-FLITS, we were able to detect various (oscillating) patterns of calcium in HeLa cells after stimulation with histamine. These data show that the sensor is suitable for detection of repeated transient calcium elevations. Importantly, G-Ca-FLITS gives a stable read-out at the high pH of 8.0 in mitochondria. We observed high calcium level in some peripheral mitochondria in HeLa cells, but not in endothelial cells. Others have shown heterogenous responses of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Greotti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Palmer et al., 2006</xref>) and electrical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Collins et al., 2002</xref>) in mitochondria. However, this is different from the sustained high levels we observed in exclusively peripheral parts of the cells, without any stimulation. Studies show that mitochondria can be distinguished in different pools based on their location and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ngo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Park et al., 2001</xref>). Peripheral mitochondria are one of these groups and have less connections to the ER compared to other pools. These connections play an important role in calcium signaling of the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Giorgi et al., 2018</xref>). In cancerous cells, like HeLa cells, the mitochondrial calcium homeostasis can be dysregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Delierneux et al., 2020</xref>). We speculate that this leads to the sustained high levels of calcium in some peripheral mitochondria, possibly linked to aberrant connections to the ER.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, the sustained high levels we observed in mitochondria have not been reported yet. The types of probes used so far might be a contributing factor. Detecting the sustained high levels without stimulation is hardly possible with a probe that only shows an intensity response, like the widely used Rhod-2 or Aequorin. It is possible by using filterFRET/sensitized emission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gadella, 2009</xref>), but this requires extensive controls. Also, much research in mitochondria has been focused on the rise in calcium after stimulation, and therefore probes with a high K<sub>D</sub> (over 1 μM) have been used preferably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arnaudeau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fernandez-Sanz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fonteriz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Palmer et al., 2006</xref>). This low affinity might be too low to detect the effect we have seen.</p>
<p>G-Ca-FLITS shares its &gt; 1 ns lifetime contrast and pH stability with the cyan/turquoise sensor Tq-Ca-FLITS we previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>), but the green emission is advantageous for several reasons: 1) excitation for green FPs is installed on virtually every lifetime microscope, while excitation for cyan FPs is less common, 2) the phototoxicity will be less and the penetration depth will be improved, and 3) it provides possibilities for multiplexing with Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-FLIM sensors that often harbor a cyan-yellow FP pair, for example EPAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Klarenbeek et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent effort to generate a green emitting lifetime biosensor used a GFP variant as a template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Koveal et al., 2022</xref>), and the resulting biosensor was pH sensitive in the physiological range. On the other hand, biosensors with a CFP-like chromophore are largely pH insensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhong et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, we expect that a circular permuted fluorescent protein with a CFP chromophore and the T203Y mutation is a good template to generate pH-insensitive green lifetime-based sensors</p>
<p>The unique properties of the new green calcium sensor are evident from its photophysical properties. The extinction coefficient of the calcium-bound and -free states of G-Ca-FLITS is very similar, but the difference in QY is significant. Interestingly, the lower QY is observed in the calcium-bound state and is very similar to the QY of mTq2_T203Y, the FP that is used in this probe. This, combined with the resemblance in spectral shape and pH sensitivity, indicates that in the calcium-bound state the FP-barrel is probably in roughly the same closed conformation as mTq2_T203Y. When calcium is removed, a more open state is assumed with a more favorable QY, linked to a higher lifetime. Usually, a higher QY results in a higher intensity; however, in G-Ca-FLITS the open state has a differential shaped excitation spectrum which leads to a decreased intensity. These effects combined have resulted in a sensor where the two different states have a similar intensity despite displaying a large QY and lifetime contrast. Possibly, the lifetime contrast could be further improved by increasing the QY of the calcium-free state; however, it remains uncertain which effect that might have on the (lack of) intensity change.</p>
<p>We evaluated the use of Tq-Ca-FLITS and G-Ca-FLITS for 2P-FLIM and observed a surprisingly low brightness of the green variant in an intact fly brain. This result is consistent with a study finding that red-shifted fluorescent-protein variants that are much brighter under one-photon excitation are, surprisingly, dimmer than their blue cousins in multi-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Molina et al., 2017</xref>). The responses of both probes were in line with their properties in single photon FLIM, but given the low brightness of G-Ca-FLITS under 2-photon excitation, the Tq-Ca-FLITS may be a better choice for 2P-FLIM experiments.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we developed a green fluorescent GECI, named G-Ca-FLITS, with a lifetime contrast of over 1 ns, and a modest intensity change. This sensor does not have one (very) dim state unlike other green GECIs, therefore the variation in the measurement is comparable in both states. In addition, the lifetime response is stable above pH 7. We successfully measured the calcium concentration in various organelles in both HeLa cells and BOECs, including the mitochondria. A portion of HeLa cells show sustained high levels of calcium in some peripheral mitochondria, but further research is required to determine the origin of this heterogeneity. We anticipate that the G-Ca-FLITS will be a valuable tool to examine the heterogeneity of calcium concentrations in mitochondria and other cellular compartments.</p>

Colonies visually showing a (bright) green fluorescence (excitation filter 470/40 nm, emission filter 525/50 nm) under a stereomicroscope (MZFLIII, Leica) were selected. Bacteria were grown overnight in 1.5 mL SKR in a deep well plate (732-2893, VWR) covered with an adhesive seal (AB-0718, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C while shaking at 280 rpm. The next day, 1 µL of culture was spotted on a SKR plate for storage, and the remainder of the bacteria were harvested by 15 min centrifugation at 2683 ×g in a swing-out centrifuge (5810 R, Eppendorf). Supernatant was removed and 200 µL of lysis buffer (2% Deoxycholic acid in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) was added. During optimization of the lysis protocol, the lysis buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with DOC (0, 1, 2 or 3%), urea (0, 0.5 or 1 M), lysozyme (1 mg/mL), Sodium dodecyl sulfate (0, 0.1, 0.25 or 0.5%) and/or Triton-X100 (0, 0.1, 0.5 or 1%).

In addition, mTq2_T203Y was measured diluted in a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). First, a quartz cuvette was filled with 1 mL of the required buffer and the absorbance spectrum (250 - 550 nm, 1 nm step size) was measured using a spectrophotometer (Libra S70, Biochrom). The cuvette was transferred to a JASCO FP-8500 spectrofluorometer and the emission spectrum was recorded at 460 - 700 nm with a 2.5 nm bandwidth and 1 nm intervals, while exciting at 450 nm with 2.5 nm bandwidth, using a scan speed of 500 nm/min, 1 s response time and a medium sensitivity. A small amount of purified protein was added, and the absorbance and emission spectra were recorded again. This was repeated for in total 4 dilutions per protein and while the absorbance at 450 nm was always below 0.05 for the highest concentration. An additional absorbance spectrum was recorded with a peak absorbance “<italic>A</italic><sub>peak</sub>” of 0.5. The same procedure was followed for rhodamine as a reference in 1 mM NaOH.</p>
<p>Absorbance spectra were corrected by subtraction of the offset of the spectrum between 541 and 550 nm, followed by subtraction of the spectrum of only buffer. The resolution of the spectrophotometer is too low for the low protein levels, so the resulting spectra are not smooth. Therefore, the additionally taken absorbance spectrum with <italic>A</italic><sub>peak</sub> = 0.5 were fitted to the low-resolution spectra. From this fit, the absorbance at 450 nm (<italic>A</italic><sub>450</sub>) was determined for each dilution of protein. Emission spectra were corrected for spectral sensitivity of the detector and the spectrum of the only buffer sample was subtracted. The spectral area “<italic>I</italic><sub>em</sub>” under corrected emission spectra was calculated by integration between 460 - 700 nm.</p>

The ratio GFP/RFP was calculated for each cell. As a control, we used a sample with only mScarlet-I (ratio GFP/RFP = 0) and a sample with EGFP and mScarlet-I (ratio GFP/RFP = 1). The ratio of all cells was normalized to the controls. The experiment was performed twice per construct.</p>

<title>Confocal imaging</title>
<p>Confocal images of HeLa cells and BOECs expressing G-Ca-FLITS were taken with a Leica Sp8 system (Leica) with a ×63 objective (HL PL Apo, C2S NA 1.40 oil) at 37 °C and 7% (HeLa cells) or 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (BOECs). HeLa cells were imaged in MM and BOECs in growth medium, as stated before. A 488 nm Argon laser was used for imaging, combined with an Acousto-Optical Beam Splitter (AOBS), and fluorescence was collected with a HyD at 500 - 780 nm. The pinhole was set to 1 AU.</p>

<title>Confocal TCSPC imaging - Picoharp TCSPC module</title>
<p>Confocal fluorescence lifetime images of G-Ca-FLITS expressed in mitochondria of Hela cells were acquired at an FV1000 (Olympus) confocal microscope equipped with a Picoharp TCSPC module (PicoQuant). A field of view of 256×256 pixels (207 - 331 nm per pixel) was illuminated with a pulsed 485 nm Picoquant diode laser (20 MHz, 0.4 kW·cm<sup>-2</sup>) using an Olympus UPLS Apo 60x water NA1.2 objective lens. The fluorescence signal was detected in confocal mode with the pinhole diameter set at 130 µm. The fluorescence passed a 405/480/560/635 dichroic mirror, was filtered by a 505 - 540 nm emission filter and detected by avalanche photodiodes (MPD).</p>
<p>In order, to obtain a reliable fluorescence lifetime the measurement times of the sample channel was set such that at least 10<sup>5</sup> photons were collected. An image of the median arrival times per pixel was inspected for heterogeneity. Based on the image, one or more regions were manually selected for fitting of a decay curve. The full fluorescence decay curves (5-6 minutes integration time) were fitted in the Symphotime64 software (PicoQuant) using a bi-exponential decay model including an instrumental response function generated from the same dataset. On basis of visual inspection of the fit, the fit residuals and the minimal Chi square the fitted results were accepted or discarded. The fitting of the decay curves was repeated for all areas, but now an integration time of 1 minute was used. The fitting was repeated for every minute, to obtain information about temporal variation.</p>

<title>Confocal TCSPC imaging – Leica Stellaris</title>
<p>Confocal fluorescence lifetime images of G-Ca-FLITS expressed in mitochondria of Hela cells were acquired with a Leica Stellaris8 equipped with a pulsed white light laser set to 40 MHz and a 40x NA 0.95 air PL APO objective. The excitation was at 474 nm and the emission was detected between 490 nm and 600 nm by the HyDX2 detector. The pinhole was set to 4.4 airy units, the imaging speed to 400 Hz per line (pixel dwell time 3.16 µs) with 8 line repetitions and a frame size of 512×512 (pixel size 0.259 µm). For live-cell imaging, the images were acquired every minute.</p>
<p>The data was saved as .ptu file and a custom script was used to convert these data into G and S images. The G and S data, together with the K<sub>D</sub> determined by the calibration, were used to convert the data into calcium concentration.</p>

<title>Imaging and analysis of 2P-FLIM of Drosophila</title>
<p>We imaged the brain of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> females attached to a custom physiology platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Maimon et al, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mussells Pires et al., 2024</xref>). This platform keeps the fly’s body dry and in air, with the brain exposed to an experimentally determined saline. The flies were freely dangling and we did not track their behavior. We removed the superior cuticle of the head (the frons and anterior ocellar cuticle) to access the brain dorsally for optical imaging. Extracellular saline was prepared as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mussells Pires et al., 2024</xref>), consisting of (in mM): 103 NaCl, 3 KCl, 5 TES, 10 trehalose dihydrate, 10 glucose, 2 sucrose, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub> titrated with Milli-Q water to an osmolarity of 280-285 mOsm. The high [K+] solution exchanged the concentrations of NaCl with KCl, keeping the osmolarity and [Cl-] unchanged.</p>
<p>The saline was kept at ∼21°C for the duration of all experiments using a Warner Instruments temperature controller (CL-100) driving a Peltier device (SC-20). The Peltier device was placed in-line with tubing (Tygon 2375) that perfused the preparation with saline at a rate of ∼3 mL per minute. A thermistor in the bath was used to regulate the Peltier device in closed loop. The high [K+] solution was applied by allowing flow through the perfusion line to exchange with the extracellular solution, which was gradually aspirated out of the chamber using a glass pipette attached to a vacuum. Each recording was given ∼10 minutes to respond to the new solution and we estimate that the saline composition of the preparation was fully replaced within ∼1 min.</p>
<p>The 2P-FLIM setup uses an Olympus 20x 1.0 NA water immersion objective (XLUMPLFLN) on a customized Sutter MIMMs to be detailed in a later manuscript by SCT and GM. A Coherent Discovery NX laser’s tunable beam set to 920 nm (with -12,500 fs2 of dispersion compensation) was used to excite all three fluorophores.</p>
<p>Frames were collected at a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels and the time series data shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> are plotted at ∼1 Hz. Flies expressing jGCaMP7f or Tq-Ca-FLITS were imaged with ∼20 mW of laser power measured after the objective, while flies expressing G-Ca-FLITS were imaged with ∼30 mW laser power.</p>
<p>The fluorescence lifetime was computed by fitting the first 1200 frames to a biexponential distribution convolved with a Gaussian plus randomly distributed uniform noise by minimizing the chi-squared statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Thornquist et al., 2020</xref>). The offset of this fit was used to adjust the mean photon arrival time within each frame (empirical lifetime), and the contribution of the estimated noise was subtracted out. Explicitly, the arrival time histogram was fit to the equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="622032v1_eqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where
<disp-formula id="eqn7">

</disp-formula>
is the single exponential response with a time constant <italic>τ</italic> convolved with a Gaussian centered at <italic>μ</italic> with standard deviation <italic>σ</italic> and <italic>ϵ</italic> + <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub> = 1. To compute the empirical lifetime <italic>L</italic> of a collection of photons we computed the mean arrival time of the photons <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="622032v1_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, then removed the offset and the estimated noise due to the uniform signal (which had mean arrival time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="622032v1_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> because it is uniformly distributed):
<disp-formula id="eqn8">

where <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> refers to the intensity of the <italic>k</italic> th frame, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> refers to the mean lifetime of the <italic>k</italic>th frame, and ⟨∘⟩ refers to the average across frames.</p>

<p>This manuscript reports on an FLIM-based calcium biosensor, G-CaFLITS. It represents an <bold>important</bold> contribution to the field of genetically-encoded fluorescent biosensors, and will serve as a practical tool for the FLIM imaging community. The paper provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence of G-CaFLITS's photophysical properties and its advantages over previous biosensors such as Tq-Ca-FLITS. Although the benefits of G-Ca-FLITS over Tq-Ca-FLITS are limited by the relatively small wavelength shift, it presents some advantages in terms of compatibility with available instrumentation and brightness consistency.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>van der Linden et al. report on the development of a new green-fluorescent sensor for calcium, following a novel rational design strategy based on the modification of the cyan-emissive sensor mTq2-CaFLITS. Through a mutational strategy similar to the one used to convert EGFP into EYFP, coupled with optimization of strategic amino acids located in proximity of the chromophore, they identify a novel sensor, G-CaFLITS. Through a careful characterization of the photophysical properties in vitro and the expression level in cell cultures, the authors demonstrate that G-CaFLITS combines a large lifetime response with a good brightness in both the bound and unbound states. This relative independence of the brightness on calcium binding, compared with existing sensors that often feature at least one very dim form, is an interesting feature of this new type of sensors, which allows for a more robust usage in fluorescence lifetime imaging. Furthermore, the authors evaluate the performance of G-CaFLITS in different subcellular compartments and under two-photon excitation in Drosophila. While the data appears robust and the characterization thorough, the interpretation of the results in some cases appears less solid, and alternative explanations cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The approach is innovative and extends the excellent photophysical properties of the mTq2-based to more red-shifted variants. While the spectral shift might appear relatively minor, as the authors correctly point out, it has interesting practical implications, such as the possibility to perform FLIM imaging of calcium using widely available laser wavelengths, or to reduce background autofluorescence, which can be a significant problem in FLIM.</p>
<p>
- The screening was simple and rationally guided, demonstrating that, at least for this class of sensors, a careful choice of screening positions is an excellent strategy to obtain variants with large FLIM responses without the need of high-throughput screening.</p>
<p>
- The description of the methodologies is very complete and accurate, greatly facilitating the reproduction of the results by others, or the adoption of similar methods. This is particularly true for the description of the experimental conditions for optimal screening of sensor variants in lysed bacterial cultures.</p>
<p>
- The photophysical characterization is very thorough and complete, and the vast amount of data reported in the supporting information is a valuable reference for other researchers willing to attempt a similar sensor development strategy. Particularly well done is the characterization of the brightness in cells, and the comparison on multiple parameters with existing sensors.</p>
<p>
- Overall, G-CaFLITS displays excellent properties for a FLIM sensor: very large lifetime change, bright emission in both forms and independence from pH in the physiological range.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The paper demonstrates the application of G-CaFLITS in various cellular sub-compartments without providing direct evidence that the sensor's response is not affected by the targeting. Showing at least that the lifetime values in the saturated state are similar in all compartments would improve the robustness of the claims.</p>
<p>
- In some cases, the interpretation of the results is not fully convincing, leaving alternative hypotheses as a possibility. This is particularly the case for the claim of the origin of the strongly reduced brightness of G-CaFLITS in Drosophila. The explanation of the intensity changes of G-CaFLITS also shows some inconsistency with the basic photophysical characterization.</p>
<p>
- While the claims generally appear robust, in some cases they are conveyed with a lack of precision. Several sentences in the introduction and discussion could be improved in this regard. Furthermore, the use of the signal-to-noise ratio as a means of comparison between sensors appears to be imprecise, since it is dependent on experimental conditions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Van der Linden et al. describe the addition of the T203Y mutation to their previously described fluorescence lifetime calcium sensor Tq-Ca-FLITS to shift the fluorescence to green emission. This mutation was previously described to similarly red-shift the emission of green and cyan FPs. Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y behaves as a green calcium sensor with opposite polarity compared with the original (lifetime goes down upon calcium binding instead of up). They then screen a library of variants at two linker positions and identify a variant with slightly improved lifetime contrast (Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y_V27A_N271D, named G-Ca-FLITS). The authors then characterize the performance of G-Ca-FLITS relative to Tq-Ca-FLITS in purified protein samples, in cultured cells, and in the brains of fruit flies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work is interesting as it extends their prior work generating a calcium indicator scaffold for fluorescent protein-based lifetime sensors with large contrast at a single wavelength, which is already being adopted by the community for production of other FLIM biosensors. This work effectively extends that from cyan to green fluorescence. While the cyan and green sensors are not spectrally distinct enough (~20-30nm shift) to easily multiplex together, it at least shifts the spectra to wavelengths that are more commonly available on commercial microscopes.</p>
<p>The observations of organellar calcium concentrations were interesting and could potentially lead to new biological insight if followed up.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The new G-Ca-FLITS sensor doesn't appear to be significantly improved in performance over the original Tq-Ca-FLITS, no specific benefits are demonstrated.</p>
<p>Although it was admirable to attempt in vivo demonstration in Drosophila with these sensors, depolarizing the whole brain with high potassium is not a terribly interesting or physiological stimulus and doesn't really highlight any advantages of their sensors; G-Ca-FLITS appears to be quite dim in the flies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authours present a variant of a previously described fluorescence lifetime sensor for calcium. Much of the manuscript describes the process of developing appropriate assays for screening sensor variants, and thorough characterization of those variants (inherent fluorescence characteristics, response to calcium and pH, comparisons to other calcium sensors). The final two figures show how the sensor performs in cultured cells and in vivo drosophila brains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is presented clearly and the conclusion (this is a new calcium sensor that could be useful in some circumstances) is supported by the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are probably few circumstances where this sensor would facilitate experiments (calcium measurements) that other sensors would prove insufficient.</p>
