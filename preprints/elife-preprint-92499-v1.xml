<title>Abstract</title><p>The environmental challenges the human malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, faces during its progression into its various lifecycle stages warrant the use of effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation. Microrchidia (MORC) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms. Accumulating evidence has shed light into the role MORC protein plays as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites. In this study, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches, we demonstrate that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle, but is also essential to the parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments suggest that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binds to not only sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation but is also most likely a key modulator of stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) studies indicate that downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death. All together these findings confirm that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Among the five human-infecting species, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is the deadliest, with over 600,000 deaths in 2021<sup>1</sup>. To adapt to extreme environmental challenges, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> possesses unique strategies that direct the tightly coordinated changes in gene expression and control transcriptional switching in genes encoded by multigene families to ensure antigenic variation and immune evasion. Changes in gene expression throughout the parasite life cycle are controlled by a surprisingly low repertoire of transcription factors (TFs) encoded in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The 27 apicomplexan APETALA2 (ApiAP2) DNA-binding proteins are the only well documented parasite TFs known to contribute to the modulation of gene expression throughout various stages of the parasite’s development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Since the discovery of the AP2 gene family <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, evidence has alluded to their role as master regulators of gene expression throughout transitory phases of the parasite life cycle. The most well documented are the gametocyte specific TFs (AP2-G, AP2-G2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> with subsequent discovery of those associated with transition to sexual differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> as well as sporozoite (AP2-SP) and liver stages (AP2-L) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genome, however, encompasses well over 5,000 protein-coding genes suggesting there are most likely other molecular components responsible for gene expression. It is believed that, to offset the relatively low TF range, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> has evolved additional mechanisms regulating gene expression including mechanisms that use epigenetics factors, RNA binding proteins or regulate chromatin structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. All together these components work in combination to regulate the dynamic organization of DNA and the cascade of gene expression required for the parasite life cycle progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Despite their importance, the identification and functional characterization of regulatory players controlling chromatin remains a challenge in this intractable organism. However, with the advent of sensitive technologies capable of capturing important chromatin associated regulatory complexes such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), chromatin conformation capture Hi-C technologies, and chromatin enrichment for proteomics (ChEP), we can now solve important facets of molecular components controlling epigenetics and chromatin structure.</p>
<p>Microrchidia (MORC) belong to a highly conserved nuclear protein superfamily with widespread domain architectures that link MORCs with signaling-dependent chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation across plant and animal kingdoms including the apicomplexan parasites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In all organisms, MORC contains several domains that form a catalytically active ATPase. Apicomplexan MORC ATPases are encircled by Kelch-repeat β- propellers as well as a CW-type zinc finger domain functioning as a histone reader <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In higher eukaryotes, MORCs were first identified as epigenetic regulators and chromatin remodelers in germ cell development. Currently, these proteins are shown to be involved in various human diseases including cancers and are expected to serve as important biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In the apicomplexan parasite, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, <italic>Tg</italic>MORC was shown to recruit the histone deacetylase HDAC3 to particular genome loci to regulate chromatin accessibility, restricting sexual commitment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. <italic>Tg</italic>MORC-depleted cells also resulted in change in gene expression with up regulation of secondary AP2 factors and a significant shift from asexual to sexual differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Recently, ChEP experiments done in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> identified <italic>Pf</italic>MORC as one of the highest enriched chromatin-bound proteins at different stages of the parasite intraerythrocytic development cycle (IDC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. <italic>Pf</italic>MORC was also detected at a relatively high level throughout the parasite life cycle including sporozoites and liver stages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and has been identified in several protein pull down experiments as targeting both AP2 TFs and epigenetic factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC seems to interact with AP2-G2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, a TF that plays a critical role in the maturation of gametocytes. However, the genome wide distribution and exact function of this protein throughout the parasite life cycle remained elusive.</p>
<p>In this study, we apply CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing technologies to determine the function, genome distribution, and indispensability of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC throughout the parasite’s IDC. Immunoprecipitation of an HA-tagged parasite line validates the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in heterochromatin structure maintenance. Using downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC induced through TetR-DOZI system, we demonstrate the functional significance of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in heterochromatin stability and gene repression. Immunofluorescence based assays and ChIP-seq experiments show that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC localizes to heterochromatin clusters at or near <italic>var</italic> genes with significant overlap with a well-known signature of the parasite heterochromatin post-translational modification (PTM) H3K9-trimethylation (H3K9me3) mark, confirming a possible role in gene repression. Our findings also shed light on the function of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC as a potential chromatin insulator near transcriptionally active genes required for cell cycle progression. Finally, Hi-C analyses demonstrate that downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC results in significant dysregulation of chromatin architectural stability resulting in parasite death. All together our work provides significant insight into the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in the maintenance of the pathogens’ chromosomal architectural integrity and validates this protein as a promising target for novel therapeutic interventions.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>P</italic>fMORC-HA transgenic line shows nuclear localization in heterochromatin clusters</title>
<p>To characterize the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool to add a 3X-HA tag at the C-terminal coding region of the <italic>Pfmorc</italic> locus (PF3D7_1468100) in an NF54 line <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, Sup. data 1</bold>). Recovered transgenic parasites were cloned using limiting dilution and the correct incorporation of the tag into the parasite genome was validated via PCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, Sup. data 2</bold>). WGS analysis confirmed the presence of the HA tag at the expected locus with no obvious off-target effect but uncovered an additional nonsense mutation in the <italic>gametocyte development protein 1</italic> (<italic>gdv1</italic>) gene (PF3D7_0935400) at amino acid position 561 out of 599 total. Mutations in <italic>gdv1</italic> have been detected in the past and seem to emerge relatively often indicating a fitness benefit in the in <italic>vitro</italic> culture system used in the laboratory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The involvement of GDV1 as essential in sexual commitment is well substantiated and further study involving the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in sexual commitment could not be fully addressed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> (<bold>Sup. data 2</bold>). Despite this finding, we were able to design experiments to determine the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC throughout the IDC as no other major detrimental mutations were detected in the genome. We first validated <italic>Pf</italic>MORC protein expression through Western blot analysis (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>). Regardless of potential protein degradation, results showed an expected band size within the ∼290 kDa range that was absent in NF54 control compared to our tagged line (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>). Immunofluorescence (IFA) analysis of intracellular parasites revealed that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC is localized in the nucleus throughout the parasite IDC in punctate patterns (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). A single foci per parasite was detected in the nuclear periphery at the ring stage. An increased number of foci with a more diffuse signal could be detected as the number of DNA copies increased at the schizont stage. Moreover, punctuates were shown to have strong colocalization signals with histone H3K9me3 marks present at the different parasite developmental stages analyzed. This was most evident during the early ring stage of the parasite IDC where the chromatin organization is more compact with a single DNA copy. Altogether, our findings indicated that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC is a true nuclear protein that is most likely associated with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> heterochromatin cluster(s).</p>

<title><italic>Pf</italic>MORC interacting partners include proteins involved in heterochromatin maintenance, transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling</title>
<p>To confirm the association of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC with proteins involved in heterochromatin cluster(s), we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by mass-spectrometry (MS) analysis using mature stages of <italic>P</italic>fMORC-HA and parental line as control. Our IP-MS analysis matched 1109 spectra to 105 unique peptide sequences corresponding to the <italic>Pf</italic>MORC protein (on average) consistent with HA-affinity enrichment of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC. To define a set of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC associated proteins, we used the QPROT statistical framework <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> to compare proteins detected in <italic>Pf</italic>MORC samples and controls. We identified 73 <italic>Pf</italic>MORC associated proteins (log2 FC ≥ 2 and Z statistic &gt; 5) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, Sup. data 3</bold>). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that these proteins are nuclear and associated with heterochromatin, DNA binding, and transcription factor activity (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref></bold>). Detailed analysis showed the detection of 8 AP2 transcription factors, including AP2-G2, AP2-O2, AP2-G5, and SIP2. The latter is involved in heterochromatin formation and chromosome end regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Among the other AP2s detected, 5 were previously identified by ChIP-seq as <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> AP2 Heterochromatin-associated Factors (<italic>Pf</italic>AP2-HFs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Additional chromatin remodeling proteins were detected such as ISWI chromatin-remodeling complex ATPase (PF3D7_0624600) and SWIB/MDM2 domain-containing protein (PF3D7_0611400), as well as the epigenetic readers BDP3 (PF3D7_0110500) and PHD2 (PF3D7_1433400) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. We also detected a significant enrichment of histone erasers and writers such as a N-acetyltransferase (PF3D7_1020700), HDAC1 (PF3D7_0925700), and SET3 (PF3D7_0827800). These data indicated that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC interacts with multiple ApiAP2 TFs, chromatin remodelers, and epigenetic players associated with heterochromatin regions.</p>

<title>Genome-wide distribution of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC indicates dual functionality</title>
<p>Given the multifunctional role of MORC proteins throughout apicomplexan parasites, we further explored the association of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC with chromatin accessibility and stage-specific gene regulation by assessing the genome-wide distribution of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP–seq) in duplicate at the ring, trophozoite and schizont stages. Inspection of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding sites across each chromosome revealed a strong signal for telomeric and subtelomeric regions of the parasite genome, as well as the internal clusters of genes responsible for antigenic variation such as <italic>var</italic> and <italic>rifin</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-b</xref>, Sup. data 4</bold>). We found that while only 47% of reads mapped to antigenic genes in the ring stage, 95% of reads mapped to the same genes during the trophozoite stage and 82% during the schizont stage. Although a vast majority of the genome is actively transcribed during the trophozoite stage, these antigenic gene families are under tight regulatory control to ensure mutually exclusive expression and participate in immune evasion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.

Although most gametocyte genes contain low levels of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding compared to antigenic gene families (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>), the transcription factor AP2-G, known to be repressed during the IDC and required for sexual commitment, contains high levels of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC throughout the gene body (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). For some of the <italic>msp</italic> genes that are usually expressed later during the IDC to prepare the parasite for egress and invasion of new erythrocytes, <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding was detected in the gene bodies at the trophozoite stage.

This data implicates <italic>Pf</italic>MORC as a potential insulator for some of these genes in addition to its role as a transcriptional repressor. <italic>Pf</italic>MORC most likely moved away from the gene body to the regulatory regions surrounding the transcription start site (TSS) to guide RNA Polymerase and transcription factors and aid in activating expression of genes at the schizont stage that are crucial for egress and invasion.

<title>Effect of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC Knockdown on parasite transcriptome</title>
<p>To define the effects of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC KD on transcription, we conducted detailed time-course measurements of mRNA levels using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) throughout the parasite asexual cycle on (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC lines. Parasites were first synchronized and aTC was removed from one set of samples. Total RNA was then extracted at the trophozoite (24 hpi) and the schizont (36 hpi) stages to allow for detection of early and late changes in gene expression after aTC removal. Pairwise correlations analysis (<bold>Fig. S4a</bold>) between (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC treated lines at the two different time points confirmed appropriate reproducibility of our RNA-seq experiments.</p>
<p>Our results identified a relatively low number of differentially expressed genes at 24 hpi with 96 and 93 upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively (FDR &lt; 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub> FC &gt; 0.5 or &lt; -0.5) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>, Sup. data 6</bold>). This data is in agreement with the absence of major phenotypic changes observed in (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC parasite cultures after 24 hours. GO enrichment analysis indicated upregulation of genes in response to xenobiotic stimulus including several phosphatases, hydrolases and heat shock proteins suggesting stress sensing of the parasites at this stage (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>). At 36 hpi the number of genes that exhibit changes in gene expression were significantly higher with 1319 upregulated and 1150 downregulated (FDR &lt; 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub> FC &gt; 0.5 or &lt; -0.5) in (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC conditions, here also confirming the significant changes observed at the phenotypic level (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>). These results emphasize the cascading effects of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC KD as the parasite progressed throughout its cell cycle. GO analysis indicated an enrichment of upregulated genes involved in multiple pathways including ATP metabolic process, mitochondria, translation, food vacuole and protein folding (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref></bold>); characteristic of not only stress, but also a clear signal of cell cycle arrest in (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC samples. Among upregulated genes, we also observed several <italic>var</italic> genes and genes exported at the surface of the red blood cell that could be linked to significant decreased in <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding of these genes families as well as a disorganization of the heterochromatin cluster(s) at the trophozoite and schizont stages. GO enrichment analysis for genes that were downregulated included many genes involved in DNA replication, chromosome organization and mitotic spindle further emphasizing a strong cell cycle arrest and absence of potential major compensatory mechanisms for cell division and chromatin organization (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref></bold>). Additional downregulated genes were required for invasion such as several merozoite surface proteins.

<title>Knockdown of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC expression results in the loss of tightly regulated heterochromatin structures</title>
<p>To better understand the effect that downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC has on the chromatin structure and investigate whether changes in chromatin accessibility may explain large changes in gene expression observed using RNA-seq, we performed Hi-C on (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC cultures at 24 hpi (trophozoite) and 36 hpi (schizont). Biological replicates for each sample were collected and used to generate Hi-C libraries with &gt;37 million reads per replicate/sample, ensuring comprehensive coverage of both intrachromosomal and interchromosomal interactions. After processing (pairing, mapping, and quality filtering) the raw sequences via HiC-Pro <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, there were approximately 15 million (σ = ∼10 million) high quality interaction pairs per sample. Due to the high number of reads and relatively small size of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome (23.3 Mb) compared to higher eukaryotes, we elected to bin our Hi-C data at 10-kb resolution, which allowed the identification of genome-wide patterns while not introducing much noise by binning at too high of a resolution. A high stratum-adjusted correlation (<bold>Fig. S4</bold>), especially at the 24 hpi time point, suggested that the chromatin structure was consistent between biological replicates, therefore we chose to combine replicates for downstream analyses and visualization.</p>
<p>Because of variation in the number of valid interaction pairs between (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC samples, 100 iterations of random sampling were performed on samples with higher read count to obtain ∼35 million and ∼9 million interaction pairs at 24 hpi and 36 hpi, respectively. ICED normalized intrachromosomal heatmaps displayed a high proportion of interactions at distances less than 10% the length of each chromosome as well as strong subtelomeric interactions and internal regions containing genes involved in antigenic variation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-b</xref>, Fig. S6-S9</bold>) This pattern was similar to those observed previously at various stages of the life cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> and confirm that genes involved in antigenic variation are usually confined within dense heterochromatin rich regions to aid the tight control of <italic>var</italic> genes necessary for their mutually exclusive expression and immune evasion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.

<p>To pinpoint which regions were most strongly affected by knockdown of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC, we used Selfish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> to identify differential intrachromosomal and interchromosomal interactions in the (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC samples. Although the 24 hpi and 36 hpi time points shared similarities in loci most highly affected by <italic>Pf</italic>MORC KD on many chromosomes, the changes at 36 hpi were more significant with a higher log<sub>2</sub> FC (FDR &lt; 0.05) at most loci (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c-d</xref>, Fig. S10-S11</bold>). We also observed consistent loss of interactions between most regions containing <italic>var</italic> genes. These results indicate a failed attempt of the (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC parasites to maintain their overall chromatin structure with a significant weakening of the tightly controlled heterochromatin cluster.</p>
<p>We further validated our results using PASTIS to generate coordinate matrices and subsequently visualize a consensus three-dimensional model of the chromosome folding and their overall organization within the nucleus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. This can indicate changes in spatial distance that best describe the interaction data. The overall change in the chromatin 3D structure was clearly shown by our models of (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC samples (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref></bold>). While the co-localization of centromeres and telomeres in different regions of the nucleus were conserved, the 3D chromatin structure of (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC at 36 hpi displayed clear opening of the chromatin and loss of interactions in most regions.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite intensive investigations on the dynamic nature of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> chromatin, progress has been slow in capturing the regulatory factors that maintain and control chromatin structure and gene expression throughout parasite development. Preliminary studies done by our lab and others have identified <italic>Pf</italic>MORC as one of the most abundant chromatin-bound proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. MORC proteins from plant to animal cells have a broad range of binding sites within the genome and participate in either DNA methylation establishment or heterochromatin formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. They have also been shown to co-localize with TFs in unmethylated promoter regions to alter chromatin accessibility and regulate TF binding and gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Protein pull-down experiments in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. and <italic>T. gondii</italic> studies have detected MORC in complexes with several AP2 TFs. In <italic>T. gondii, Tg</italic>MORC was characterized as an upstream transcriptional repressor of sexual commitment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. In <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC was still poorly understood. Conflicting results on the essentiality of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC using either KD or KO strategies remained unresolved <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool, we have determined the nuclear localization, genome-wide distribution, and regulatory impacts of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC on the parasite chromatin, transcriptome, and cell cycle development. We now have powerful evidence demonstrating that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC is not only critical for parasite cell cycle progression and its survival but has a direct role in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing, including regulating immune evasion through antigenic variation. Disparities observed in the essentiality of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC for the parasite survival in previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> are most likely the results of weak protein disruption highlighting the need for a significant downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC for true functional analysis. Using IFA and protein pull downs, we have confirmed that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC localizes to the nucleus and interacts with multiple ApiAP2 TFs, chromatin remodelers, and epigenetic players associated with heterochromatin regions including H3K9me3, SIP2 and the ISWI chromatin-remodeling complex (SWIB/MDM2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). Using a combination of ChIP-seq, protein knock down, RNA-seq and Hi-C experiments, we have demonstrated that the MORC protein is essential for the tight regulation of gene expression through chromatin compaction, preventing access to gene promoters from TFs and the general transcriptional machinery in a stage specific manner. It is, however, important to recognize that the many pathways affected at the transcriptional level throughout the asexual stages in (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC lines are not only the direct results of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC downregulation and decrease of its targeted DNA binding site. They are most likely a combination of direct and indirect effects of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC KD warranted by the cell cycle arrest observed at the phenotypic level and the collapse of the chromatin organization confirmed using chromatin conformation capture experiment. These direct and indirect effects should be carefully considered, and a combination of functional genomic studies should be completed when interpreting changes in gene expression in mutant generated lines.</p>
<p>We also demonstrated that in addition to its direct role in heterochromatin formation and antigenic variation, <italic>Pf</italic>MORC may act as a potential repressor and insulator to control a set of parasite specific genes including genes involved in parasite egress and invasion between the trophozoite to schizont stage transition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. While MORC amino acid sequences reveal some conservation across species in their N-terminal portions including the tripartite GHKL ATPase domains, there is less conservation in their carboxy-terminal domains. As our data confirm the importance of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC and the parasite specificity of several interacting partners, it is tempting to speculate that drugs targeting these protein complexes could lead to novel antiparasitic strategies.</p>

<title>Variant analysis by genome-wide sequencing</title>
<p>To call variants (SNPs/indels) in the transfected lines compared to a previously sequenced control 3D7 line, genomic DNA reads were first trimmed to adapters and aligned to the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> genome (assembly GRCh38) to remove human-mapped reads. Remaining reads were aligned to the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 genome using bwa (version 0.7.17) and PCR duplicates were removed using PicardTools (Broad Institute). GATK HaplotypeCaller (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us">https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us</ext-link>) was used to call variants between the sample and the 3D7 reference genome for both the transfected lines and the NF54 control.

<title>Immunofluorescence assays</title>
<p>A double-staining immunofluorescence assay was used on NF54 control and transgenic parasite lines of mixed parasite population growth stages. Parasites were washed in incomplete medium prior to fixing onto coverslips with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT under darkness. After fixation, samples were washed 3-5 times with 1x PBS followed by permeabilization with 0.5%Triton X-100 in PBS for 25 min at RT. Subsequently, samples were subjected to PBS washes and then incubated overnight at 4°C in blocking buffer (2mg/ml BSA solution in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 solution). Following overnight blocking, samples were washed and incubated for 1 hr at RT with Anti-HA Rb Ab (1:500, Abcam, ab9110) in blocking buffer. After primary Ab incubation, samples were subject to 3x washes with wash buffer (1x PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20) followed by incubation with anti-rabbit DyLight 550 (Abcam ab98489; 1: 500) secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation and series of washes with wash buffer, slides were incubated with anti-H3K9me3 antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Millipore 07–442-AF488; 1:100) for 1 hr at RT. Slides are then washed and mounted in Vectashield Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, H-1200).

<p>Parasites were synchronized twice at 8 hr. intervals between synchronizations. After one cycle, culture was washed 3x with complete media to remove residual aTC followed by dividing the cultures into two equal conditions. Parasites were grown with or without 500 nM aTC for 24 and 36 hrs. after which RBCs were lysed using 0.15 % saponin and parasites were collected after being washed with ice cold 1X PBS. Proteins were recovered from the lysed parasites after 30 min of incubation in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.5 % NP40, 50 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors) and 10 sec of sonication. Proteins were quantified with Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher 23227). 40 µg of proteins were loaded onto 3–8% precast polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad, 3450129). After migration, proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane and the membrane was blocked and then probed overnight with anti-HA tag antibody (1:2500, Abcam, ab9110). After primary Ab incubation, blots were subsequently washed 3x with a washing buffer followed by HRP-labeled Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (1:10,000, Novex<sup>TM</sup>, A16104). Clarity<sup>TM</sup> Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad, 1705060) was applied to reveal the blots.

<p><italic>Pf</italic>MORC-HA asexual stage parasites were supplemented with and without aTC along with NF54 parasites (as a control) and were harvested at 24 and 36 HPS and cross linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37°C followed by quenching with 150 mM glycine and 3 x washing with 1 x PBS. The pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of nuclear extraction buffer (10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM AEBSF and 1x Protease inhibitor cocktail), and incubated on ice for 30 min before addition of NP-40/Igepal to a final of 0.25%. After lysis, the parasites are subject to homogenization by passing through a 26.5G needle/syringe to burst the nucleus. After centrifugation for 20 min at 2,500 x g at 4°C, samples were resuspended in 130 µL of shearing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail) and transferred to a 130 µL Covaris sonication microtube. The samples were then sonicated using a Covaris S220 Ultrasonicator for 8 min (Duty cycle: 5%, intensity peak power:140, cycles per burst: 200, bath temperature: 6°C).

For each sample, 13 μL of protein A agarose/salmon sperm DNA beads were washed three times with 500 µL ChIP dilution buffer by centrifuging for 1 min at 1,000 rpm at room temperature. For pre-clearing, the diluted chromatin samples were added to the beads and incubated for 1 hour at 4°C with rotation, then pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min at 1,000 rpm. Before adding antibody, ∼10% of each sample was taken as input. 2 µg of anti-HA tag antibodies (1:2500, Abcam, ab9110) were added to the sample and incubated overnight at 4°C with rotation. For each sample, rabbit IgG antibody (Cat.689 No. 10500c, Invitrogen) was used as a negative-control library. Per sample, 25 µL of protein A agarose/salmon sperm DNA beads were washed with ChIP dilution buffer (no inhibitors), blocked with 1 mg/mL BSA for 1 hour at 4°C, and then washed three more times with buffer. 25 µL of washed and blocked beads were added to the sample and incubated for 1 hour at 4°C with continuous mixing to collect the antibody/protein complex.

<p>Summary: The authors investigated the function of Microrchidia (MORC) proteins in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Recognizing MORC's implication in DNA compaction and gene silencing across diverse species, the study aimed to explore the influence of PfMORC on transcriptional regulation, life cycle progression and survival of the malaria parasite. Depletion of PfMORC leads to the collapse of heterochromatin and thus to the killing of the parasite. The potential regulatory role of PfMORC in the survival of the parasite suggests that it may be central to the development of new antimalarial strategies.</p>
<p>Strengths: The application of the cutting-edge CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool, combined with other molecular and genomic approaches, provides a robust methodology. Comprehensive ChIP-seq experiments indicate PfMORC's interaction with sub-telomeric areas and genes tied to antigenic variation, suggesting its pivotal role in stage transition. The incorporation of Hi-C studies is noteworthy, enabling the visualization of changes in chromatin conformation in response to PfMORC knockdown.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Although disruption of PfMORC affects chromatin architecture and stage-specific gene expression, determining a direct cause-effect relationship requires further investigation. Furthermore, while numerous interacting partners have been identified, their validation is critical and understanding their role in directing MORC to its targets or in influencing the chromatin compaction activities of MORC is essential for further clarification. In addition, the authors should adjust their conclusions in the manuscript to more accurately represent the multifaceted functions of MORC in the parasite.</p>

<p>Summary: This paper, titled &quot;Regulation of Chromatin Accessibility and Transcriptional Repression by PfMORC Protein in Plasmodium falciparum,&quot; delves into the PfMORC protein's role during the intra-erythrocytic cycle of the malaria parasite, P. falciparum. Le Roch et al. examined PfMORC's interactions with proteins, its genomic distribution in different parasite life stages (rings, trophozoites, schizonts), and the transcriptome's response to PfMORC depletion. They conducted a chromatin conformation capture on PfMORC-depleted parasites and observed significant alterations. Furthermore, they demonstrated that PfMORC depletion is lethal to the parasite.</p>
<p>Strengths: This study significantly advances our understanding of PfMORC's role in establishing heterochromatin. The direct consequences of the PfMORC depletion are addressed using chromatin conformation capture.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: The study only partially addressed the direct effects of PfMORC depletion on other heterochromatin markers.</p>

<p>We greatly appreciate the overall positive feedback . Our application of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools coupled with complementary cellular and functional approaches shed light on the importance ofPfMORC in maintaining chromatin structural integrity in the parasite and highlight this protein as a promising target for novel therapeutic intervention.</p>

<p>Weaknesses: Although disruption of PfMORC affects chromatin architecture and stage-specific gene expression, determining a direct cause-effect relationship requires further investigation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our conclusions were made on the basis of multiple, unbiased molecular and functional assays that point to the relevance of the PfMORC protein in maintaining the parasite’s chromatin landscape. Although we do not claim to have precise evidence on the step-by-step pathway to which PfMORC is involved, we bring forth first-hand evidence of its overall function in heterochromatin binding and gene-regulation, its association with major TF regulatory players, and essentiality for parasite survival. We however agree with the comment regarding the lack of direct effects of PfMORC KD and will provide additional evidence by performing ChIP-seq experiments against additional histone marks in WT and PfMORC KD lines.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, while numerous interacting partners have been identified, their validation is critical and understanding their role in directing MORC to its targets or in influencing the chromatin compaction activities of MORC is essential for further clarification. In addition, the authors should adjust their conclusions in the manuscript to more accurately represent the multifaceted functions of MORC in the parasite.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do agree with the reviewer's comment. Validation of the identified interacting partners is critical and most likely essential to understanding their role in directing MORC to its targets. However, our protein pull down experiments have been done using biological replicates. Several of the interacting partners have also been identified and published by other labs. A direct comparison of our work together with previous published work will be incorporated in a revised version of the manuscript to further validate the identified interacting partners and the accuracy of the data we obtained in this manuscript. Molecular validation of all proteins identified in our protein may take a few more years and will be submitted for publication in futur manuscripts.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Here again, we agree with the reviewer’s comment and intend to perform additional experiments to delve deeper into the multifaceted roles of PfMORC. We have begun to explore the effects of PfMORC depletion on heterochromatin marks using ChIP-seq experiments at distinct stages of parasite development. We hope our new results will shed light on the direct implications of PfMORC in heterochromatin regulation.</p>
