<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Disturbed shear stress-induced endothelial atherogenic responses are pivotal in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, contributing to the uneven distribution of atherosclerotic lesions. This study investigates the role of Aff3ir-ORF2, a novel nested gene variant, in disturbed flow-induced endothelial cell activation and atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that disturbed shear stress significantly reduces Aff3ir-ORF2 expression in athero-prone regions. Using three distinct mouse models with manipulated AFF3ir-ORF2 expression, we demonstrate that AFF3ir-ORF2 exerts potent anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. RNA sequencing revealed that interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), a key regulator of inflammatory processes, mediates inflammatory responses associated with AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency. AFF3ir-ORF2 interacts with IRF5, promoting its retention in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting the IRF5-dependent inflammatory pathways. Notably, IRF5 knockdown in AFF3ir-ORF2 deficient mice almost completely rescues the aggravated atherosclerotic phenotype. Moreover, endothelial-specific AFF3ir-ORF2 supplementation using the CRISPR/Cas9 system significantly ameliorated endothelial activation and atherosclerosis. These findings elucidate a novel role for AFF3ir-ORF2 in mitigating endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis by acting as an inhibitor of IRF5, highlighting its potential as a valuable therapeutic approach for treating atherosclerosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Atherosclerosis, characterized by the formation of fibrofatty lesions in the arterial wall, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, contributing to most myocardial infarctions and many strokes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Herrington, Lacey, Sherliker, Armitage, &amp; Lewington, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Libby et al., 2019</xref>). The activation of vascular endothelial cells (ECs), induced by various chemical and mechanical stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide and shear stress, is an initial step in the development of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Davignon &amp; Ganz, 2004</xref>). Consequently, atherosclerotic lesions preferentially develop at the branches and curvatures of the arterial tree, where blood flow is disturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Davis, Earley, Li, &amp; Chien, 2023</xref>). For decades, researchers have been interested in exploring the mechanisms underlying mechanotransduction during endothelial activation caused by disturbed flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Davis et al., 2023</xref>). Several mechanosensitive proteins, such as YAP/TAZ (B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Li et al., 2019</xref>), Annexin A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), BMP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sorescu et al., 2004</xref>), and NAD(P)H oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hwang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jo, Song, &amp; Mowbray, 2006</xref>), have been identified as key regulators of disturbed shear stress in ECs and have been implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis. Emerging evidence has revealed that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of endothelial YAP activation ameliorates the progression of atherosclerotic plaques in mice (B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), indicating that targeting disturbed flow-induced endothelial activation could be a promising therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis. However, the precise mechanisms by which the disturbed flow exerts detrimental effects remain unclear.</p>
<p>The interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, comprising nine members (IRF1-IRF9) in mammals, is primarily characterized by its role in mediating antiviral responses and type I interferon production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sato, Taniguchi, &amp; Tanaka, 2001</xref>). Although these members share a conserved DNA-binding domain in their N-terminal region that recognizes similar DNA sequences, IRF5 plays a central role in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Almuttaqi &amp; Udalova, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Takaoka et al., 2005</xref>). IRF5 mediates the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-12b and IL-23a, and promotes the expression of inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cai, Yao, &amp; Li, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Saliba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Weiss, Blazek, Byrne, Perocheau, &amp; Udalova, 2013</xref>). It promotes inflammatory responses in various immune cells, including macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Seneviratne et al., 2017</xref>), neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>), and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Savitsky, Yanai, Tamura, Taniguchi, &amp; Honda, 2010</xref>). Global or myeloid-specific knockouts of IRF5 have been shown to exert anti-atherosclerotic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Leipner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Seneviratne et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the established importance of IRF5 in immune cells, its restrictively regulatory mechanism and role in shear stress-induced endothelial activation remain unknown.</p>
<p>We recently reported that a novel protein-coding nested gene, <italic>Aff3ir</italic>, contributes to endothelial maintenance by promoting the differentiation of vascular stem/progenitor cells (SPCs) into ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhao Y et al., 2024</xref>). AFF3ir-ORF2, encoded by the <italic>Aff3ir</italic> transcript variant 2, is predominantly expressed in the EC layer of the mouse aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhao Y et al., 2024</xref>). Notably, our recent study indicated that the overexpression of AFF3ir-ORF2 could enhance laminar flow-induced mRNA levels of essential EC markers in SPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhao Y et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that AFF3ir-ORF2 may be a novel mechanotransduction protein in ECs. However, the regulation of Aff3ir-ORF2 under disturbed flow and its role in atherosclerosis remain unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which disturbed blood flow induces endothelial activation and atherosclerosis. Our study showed that disrupted Aff3ir-ORF2 expression in athero-prone regions led to inflammatory responses and development of atherosclerosis. Aff3ir-ORF2, the expression of which is reduced by disturbed shear stress, exerts critical anti-inflammatory effects by binding to IRF5 and mitigating disturbed shear stress-induced IRF5 activation. Additionally, we demonstrated that endothelial-specific supplementation with Aff3ir-ORF2 significantly ameliorated disturbed flow-induced endothelial activation and the development of atherosclerotic plaques, highlighting its promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</p>

<title>Disturbed shear stress reduces the expression of AFF3ir-ORF2</title>
<p>Our recent study showed the active participation of <italic>Aff3ir</italic> in EC differentiation from vascular SPCs induced by laminar shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhao Y et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting the potential involvement of this novel protein-encoding nested gene in mediating hemodynamic stimulation. To further elucidate the functional role of <italic>Aff3ir</italic> and its encoded proteins in disturbed shear stress-induced EC activation, we examined the expression of <italic>AFF3</italic> and <italic>AFF3ir</italic> in the intima of mouse aorta. We found that the mRNA level of <italic>AFF3ir</italic>, but not its parent gene <italic>AFF3</italic>, was significantly lower in the intima of the aortic arch, an area exposed to disturbed shear stress, compared to the intima of the thoracic aorta, which was exposed to steady unidirectional shear stress (B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Li et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>Aff3ir</italic> transcript variants can generate two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhao Y et al., 2024</xref>), therefore, we measured the protein levels of AFF3ir-ORF1 and AFF3ir-ORF2. While AFF3ir-ORF1 and AFF3 showed comparable expression levels in the intima of aortic arch and thoracic aorta of mice, the expression of AFF3ir-ORF2 showed an 87% reduction in the intima of aortic arch compared to the intima of thoracic aorta (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, C</xref>), suggesting that AFF3ir-ORF2 may be a novel mechanosensitive protein that responds to disturbed shear stress. Enface immunofluorescence staining confirmed a marked reduction in AFF3ir-ORF2 expression in the inner curvature of aortic arch compared to both the outer curvature of aortic arch and the thoracic aorta (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Moreover, to demonstrate the change in AFF3ir-ORF2 within the same visual field, we examined its expression in longitudinal sections of the mouse aorta (B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Li et al., 2019</xref>). We found that the expression of AFF3ir-ORF2, but not AFF3, was notably downregulated in athero-prone regions (the inner curvature of the aortic arch and bifurcation of the carotid artery) compared to that in the protective region in the outer curvature of the aortic arch (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Additionally, we found that the expression of AFF3, AFF3ir-ORF1, and AFF3ir-ORF2 in the media and adventitia was comparable between the aortic arch and the thoracic aorta (Figure S1A, B).</p>

<p>Next, we explored the impact of disturbed shear stress on AFF3ir-ORF2 expression <italic>in vitro</italic>. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit responses consistent with those of ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wen et al., 2013</xref>), therefore, we investigated AFF3ir-ORF2 expression in MEFs from WT mice exposed to static or disturbed flow (0.5 ± 4 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1 Hz). Consistent with our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings, while disturbed shear stress increased the expression of VCAM-1, a critical inflammatory marker of ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nakashima, Raines, Plump, Breslow, &amp; Ross, 1998</xref>), it significantly reduced both the protein and mRNA levels of AFF3ir-ORF2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G–I</xref>). The expression of AFF3 in response to the disturbed flow was minimally affected at both the mRNA and protein levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G–I</xref>). These results collectively demonstrate that disturbed shear stress induces a reduction in AFF3ir-ORF2 expression both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>AFF3ir-ORF2 ameliorates disturbed shear stress-induced inflammation and atherosclerosis</title>
<p>Disturbed shear stress-induced atherogenic responses are initial events in atherosclerotic plaque formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Davis et al., 2023</xref>). To elucidate the regulatory role of AFF3ir-ORF2 in disturbed shear stress-induced inflammation, we overexpressed AFF3ir-ORF2 in MEFs. AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression attenuated ICAM-1 expression induced by disturbed shear stress at both the protein and mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>, Figure S2A). To further validate our findings in ECs, we overexpressed AFF3ir-ORF2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Consistent with our previous results, AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression reduced the protein level of ICAM-1 induced by disturbed shear stress in HUVECs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref>). Moreover, AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression attenuated disturbed shear stress-induced expression of several inflammatory genes, including VCAM-1, IL-6, and IL-1β, in both MEFs and ECs. (Figure S2A-B). Interestingly, we found that AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression did not affect the basal expression of these inflammatory genes under ST conditions (Figure S2A-B), likely due to the relatively low levels of inflammatory gene expression under ST compared to OSS conditions. Furthermore, we measured the concentrations of inflammatory factors, including IL-6 and IL- 1β, in the culture medium of MEFs. As expected, while AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression had little effect on the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1β under ST condition, it significantly reduced their release induced by disturbed shear stress (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the anti-inflammatory effects of AFF3ir-ORF2, we speculated that it may ameliorate disturbed shear stress-induced inflammation and atherosclerosis <italic>in vivo</italic>. ApoE knockout (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mice were subjected to partial ligation surgery to induce disturbed flow in the left carotid arteries (LCAs). The endothelium of the LCAs was intravascularly infected with adenovirus (Ad-Scramble or Ad-AFF3ir-ORF2) prior to surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Enface immunofluorescence staining confirmed the successful AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression in the left carotid artery (Figure S2C-D). Mice infected with Ad-AFF3ir-ORF2 exhibited a significant decrease in lesion area in the LCAs compared to those infected with Ad-Scramble (23±17% vs 63±14%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-H</xref>), with no obvious plaque formation observed in the right carotid arteries (Figure S2E). Overexpression of AFF3ir-ORF2 also attenuated disturbed flow-induced inflammatory responses, as evidenced by decreased VCAM-1 expression in the endothelium of LCAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I-J</xref>). These findings suggested that AFF3ir-ORF2 ameliorates shear stress-induced inflammation and atherosclerosis.</p>

<title>AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency aggravates inflammation and atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice</title>
<p>To explore the effects of AFF3ir-ORF2 on inflammation and atherosclerosis, we generated AFF3ir-ORF2 global knockout (AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Genotyping PCR (Figure S3A) and western blot analysis of AFF3ir-ORF2 expression in mouse aortas (Figure S3B-C) confirmed the successful knockout. No obvious phenotypic abnormalities were observed in AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice up to 20 weeks of age and monitoring was discontinued thereafter. Additionally, AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency did not alter systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or mean arterial pressure (Figure S3D), suggesting that AFF3ir-ORF2 is dispensable for physiological blood pressure maintenance. We then isolated MEFs from WT and AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the deficiency of AFF3ir-ORF2 in AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (Figure S3E). Interestingly, the AFF3ir-ORF2 knockdown efficiency showed discrepancies between the western blot (Figure S3B) and RT-PCR results (Figure S3E). In addition to the technical differences between PCR and western blot, the characteristics of AFF3ir-ORF2 may also contribute to this inconsistency. The parent gene, AFF3, is located in a genetically variable region, and it can be excised via intron 5 to form a replicable transposon that translocates to other chromosomes, potentially contributing to leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chinen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hiwatari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Miller, Leventaki, Harker-Murray, Drendel, &amp; Bone, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">von Bergh et al., 2002</xref>). AFF3ir, located in intron 6, exists within this transposon, which may complicate the measurement of its expression. Furthermore, we found that AFF3ir-ORF2 deficient MEFs displayed higher expression of inflammatory genes, including <italic>ICAM-1, VCAM-1,</italic> and <italic>IL-1b</italic>, compared to those in WT MEFs, under disturbed flow stimulation (Figure S3F).</p>
<p>Next, we crossed AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice with ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice to generate double-knockout (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Eight-week-old ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> and ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks to induce atherosclerosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>En face</italic> Oil-Red O staining indicated that AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency accelerated the development of atherosclerosis in the entire aorta, AA, and TA. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Furthermore, AFF3ir-ORF2 deletion increased the lesion area and lipid deposition in the aortic roots of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice without altering the collagen fiber content (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D, E</xref>). Similar results were observed in distributing arteries (LCAs) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F, G</xref>). Given that the expression of adhesion proteins, such as VCAM-1 in ECs is crucial for monocyte infiltration into plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kobiyama &amp; Ley, 2018</xref>), we assessed VCAM-1 expression in the aortic roots of these mice. We found that AFF3ir-ORF2 deletion increased VCAM-1 expression in the aortic roots of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H, I</xref>), indicating that the atherogenic effects of AFF3ir-ORF2 deletion may result from endothelial inflammation. Additionally, there were no significant differences between the two groups in body weight or triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol levels (Figure S4A, B), indicating that the atherogenic effect of AFF3ir-ORF2 silencing is unlikely to be related to lipid metabolism. Taken together, these results indicate that AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency aggravates inflammation and atherosclerotic lesions in mice.</p>

<title>AFF3ir-ORF2 mitigates disturbed shear stress-induced inflammation by interacting with IRF5 and retaining it within the cytosol</title>
<p>To explore the mechanism by which AFF3ir-ORF2 mitigates atherogenesis, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on MEFs from WT and AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The Principal component analysis plot depicted clear clustering of WT versus AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

GO analysis of these genes revealed enrichment in processes related to cell−cell adhesion and leukocyte activation involved in immune response (Figure S5B), which is highly consistent with the observed effects of AFF3ir-ORF2 on VCAM- 1 expression.</p>

<p>To further identify the upstream transcriptional regulators of these genes, we used the list of differentially expressed genes from the RNA-seq data to predict upstream transcription factors using the ChEA3 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Keenan et al., 2019</xref>). Then, the top 20 transcription factors obtained from the ChEA3 database were mapped to the atherosclerotic disease-related gene list in the Disgenet database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pinero et al., 2017</xref>). Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) and IRF8 were identified as key upstream regulators (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). IRF5 and IRF8, which are members of the same family of transcription factors originally implicated in interferon production, have been identified as critical regulators of the inflammatory response and contribute to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Almuttaqi &amp; Udalova, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Salem, Salem, &amp; Gros, 2020</xref>). However, their potential roles in disturbed shear stress-induced inflammation remain unclear. We speculated that AFF3ir-ORF2 interacts with IRF5 and/or IRF8. Coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated that endogenous AFF3ir-ORF2 could bind to both IRF5 and IRF8 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). To determine which transcription factor that mediates the inflammatory effects of AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency, we silenced IRF5 and IRF8 in WT and AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs exposed to disturbed flow. Notably, silencing IRF5, but not IRF8, blunted the upregulation of inflammatory genes, including <italic>ICAM-1, VCAM-1, IL-6,</italic> and <italic>IL-1β</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that IRF5 was the predominant factor mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of AFF3ir-ORF2 in the context of disturbed shear stress. Consistently, we found that IRF5 silencing significantly inhibited the upregulation of ICAM-1 protein levels induced by AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency under disturbed shear stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G, H</xref>). In addition, neither IRF5 nor IRF8 expression levels were affected by AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency (Figure S5C). However, we found that AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency significantly increased the expression of IRF5-targeted genes (predicted by the ChEA3 database), including ICAM-1, CCL5, and CXCL10 (Figure S5D). Notably, the protein level of IRF5 was not significantly affected by disturbed shear stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G, H</xref>). Consistently, the mRNA levels of IRF5 were previously reported to be barely changed in the context of disturbed shear stress (GSE276195, Figure S5E) or the atherosclerotic environment (GSE222583, Figure S5F). Given that the transcriptional activity of IRF5 depends on its nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lv et al., 2024</xref>), we next explored whether AFF3ir-ORF2 affects the subcellular localization of IRF5. Subcellular fractionation assays indicated that IRF5 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm under static conditions, but exhibited obvious nuclear localization when exposed to disturbed shear stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I, J</xref>). While the total expression of IRF5 was barely affected by AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency or overexpression, nuclear localization of IRF5 increased with AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I, J</xref>). To further ascertain the role of AFF3ir-ORF2 in regulating the transcriptional activity of IRF5, we performed a luciferase reporter assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Qiao, Lv, Qiao, Wang, &amp; Miao, 2022</xref>). AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression significantly decreased the transcriptional activity of IRF5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). In summary, these results suggested that AFF3ir-ORF2 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of IRF5 and exerts anti-inflammatory effects by retaining IRF5 in the cytosol.</p>

ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> and ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were subjected to partial ligation surgery in the LCAs and intravascularly infected with lentiviruses expressing either IRF5-specific shRNA (lenti-shIRF5) or Scramble shRNA (lenti-shScramble). En-face immunofluorescence staining confirmed successful IRF5 deletion in the left carotid artery (Figure S6A). After a 4-week high-fat diet challenge, IRF5 deletion resulted in an approximately 60% reduction in plaque area in the LCAs of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B</xref>). In addition, IRF5 deletion attenuated endothelial activation, as evidenced by reduced VCAM-1 expression in the endothelium of LCAs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, D</xref>). Notably, although ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited an increased plaque area in the LCAs compared to ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice, IRF5 deletion almost completely abolished these differences, reducing both the plaque area and VCAM-1 expression in the endothelium of the LCAs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A–D</xref>).

<title>Endothelial-specific AFF3ir-ORF2 supplementation ameliorates EC activation and atherosclerosis in mice</title>
<p>Given the significant anti-inflammatory effects of AFF3ir-ORF2 on endothelial activation and atherosclerosis, we explored the potential use of gene therapy targeting AFF3ir-ORF2 to treat atherosclerosis. Endothelial-specific AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression was achieved using an EC- enhanced AAV-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system controlled by an EC-specific ICAM2 promoter as we previously reported (Z. Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Swiech et al., 2015</xref>).

Endothelial-specific AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression had a minimal effect on triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol levels in the plasma of mice (Figure S7C). However, compared to the negative control, endothelial-specific AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression significantly reduced the Oil-red O- positive lesion area in the whole aortas of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice (19±5% vs 54±8%) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B, C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Endothelial activation is a critical initial event in the development of atherosclerosis, and emerging evidence suggests that targeting disturbed shear stress-induced endothelial activation is a promising therapeutic strategy. In the present study, we elucidated the role of the novel nested gene-encoded protein, AFF3ir-ORF2, in sensing disturbed shear stress. Moreover, we demonstrated that AFF3ir-ORF2 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of IRF5, a key regulator of the inflammatory response, thereby exerting potent anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Using three mouse models (global AFF3ir-ORF2 knockout, locally AFF3ir-ORF2 endothelial expression, and endothelial-specific AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression), we demonstrated that AFF3ir-ORF2 exerted potent anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerosis effects in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Notably, while AFF3ir-ORF2 knockout increased VCAM-1 expression in the endothelium and enlarged the plaque area in the aortic roots, it had a minimal effect on collagen deposition within the plaques. This discrepancy may be attributed to the differential expression patterns of IRF5 across various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Roberts, Collado, &amp; Barnes, 2024</xref>). Phenotypically modulated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within the fibrous cap produce extracellular matrix molecules critical for plaque composition and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bennett, Sinha, &amp; Owens, 2016</xref>). A previous study has shown minimal colocalization between IRF5 and the VSMC marker, α- smooth muscle actin, in aortic root lesions of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Seneviratne et al., 2017</xref>), indicating a relatively low IRF5 expression level in VSMCs. Consequently, AFF3ir-ORF2 likely exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily through endothelial IRF5. Consistently, endothelial-specific AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression reduced the aortic plaque area, but had minimal effects on collagen deposition. Our findings establish the potent anti-atherosclerotic role of AFF3ir-ORF2 in early and advanced atherosclerosis mouse models. However, given the multiple critical roles of ECs throughout the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, further investigations are needed to explore the potential role of AFF3ir-ORF2 in other atherosclerotic processes, including endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, plaque rupture, and atherothrombotic occlusion. Additionally, we found that disturbed shear stress transcriptional downregulated the expression of AFF3ir. However, the protein levels of AFF3ir-ORF2, but not those of AFF3ir-ORF1, were reduced by disturbed shear stress. Since both AFF3ir-ORF1 and AFF3ir-ORF2 are derived from AFF3ir, different translation mechanisms may be involved in the production of AFF3ir-ORF1/2.</p>
<p>In addition to ECs, various other cell types, particularly immune cells, play crucial roles in the progression of atherosclerotic plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wolf &amp; Ley, 2019</xref>). Although our results indicated the potent anti-inflammatory role of AFF3ir-ORF2 in ECs, the potential contributions of other cell types may also be involved, which could be further elucidated using AFF3ir-ORF2 tissue-specific knockout or overexpression mouse models. Macrophage polarization and inflammatory responses accelerate plaque development, leading to an increase in necrotic core and vulnerable plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Krausgruber et al., 2011</xref>). Elevated IRF5 expression and nuclear localization have been observed in macrophages within plaques of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Seneviratne et al., 2017</xref>). IRF5 has been demonstrated to drive macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory state, thereby affecting plaque stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Seneviratne et al., 2017</xref>). Global or myeloid cell-specific deletion of IRF5 stabilizes atherosclerotic plaques by suppressing the inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Leipner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Seneviratne et al., 2017</xref>). Despite these findings, the role of IRF5 in shear stress-induced endothelial activation remains largely unknown. Our study provides evidence that disturbed shear stress is sufficient to induce IRF5 nuclear translocation and activation in ECs. Furthermore, IRF5 knockdown in ECs significantly reduced disturbed flow-induced plaque formation in LCAs. These findings suggest that targeting endothelial IRF5 may be an effective strategy for combating the early stages of atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Given the key role of IRF5 in mediating inflammatory responses, it has been considered as an attractive therapeutic target, and various strategies have been developed to study and modulate its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Almuttaqi &amp; Udalova, 2019</xref>). For example, nanoparticle-delivered siRNA targeting IRF5 in macrophages promotes inflammation resolution, improves infarct healing, and attenuates post-myocardial infarction remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Courties et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, manipulating IRF5 protein levels through the E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM21, has been explored as a strategy for modulating its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lazzari et al., 2014</xref>). Given the crucial physiological role of IRF5, strategies aimed at suppressing its pathophysiological activation without altering basal levels may offer additional benefits. Our study introduces a novel approach to inhibit IRF5 activation. We found that the novel nested gene-encoded protein, AFF3ir-ORF2, interacts with IRF5, leading to cytoplasmic retention and inactivation under disturbed shear stress conditions. Importantly, endothelium-specific supplementation with AFF3ir-ORF2 effectively attenuated endothelial activation and reduced the atherosclerotic plaque area in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting that targeting endothelial IRF5 activation with AFF3ir-ORF2 holds promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, as emerging studies have highlighted the substantial contributions of IRF5 to autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Graham et al., 2006</xref>), neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Masuda et al., 2014</xref>), obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dalmas et al., 2015</xref>), and hepatic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alzaid et al., 2016</xref>), future research should investigate whether AFF3ir-ORF2 has beneficial effects in these contexts.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides novel evidence that the disruption of AFF3ir-ORF2 expression under disturbed flow promotes endothelial inflammatory responses and atherosclerosis. AFF3ir-ORF2 serves as an endogenous inhibitor of IRF5 by binding to IRF5 and preventing its nuclear translocation. Supplementation with endothelial AFF3ir-ORF2 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>C57BL/6 and Apolipoprotein E-null (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mice were purchased from the Experimental Animal Centre of Military Medical Science Academy (Beijing, China). AFF3ir-ORF2- heterozygote (AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>+/-</sup>) mice were acquired from Dr. Lingfang Zeng’s Laboratory at King’s College London. Briefly, gRNAs targeting the mouse AFF3ir-ORF2 locus (gRNA1: GCAACCCACGGAGTTGCAGTTGG; gRNA2: GTCATTAACTCCTTTAATATAGG; gRNA3: TGCAACTCCGTGGGTTGCTGTGG; gRNA4: GACCACACATAACAGTGAATAGG) and Cas9 mRNA were co-injected into fertilized mouse eggs to generate targeted knockout offspring. F0 founder animals were identified by PCR followed by sequence analysis, and then bred to WT mice to test germline transmission and produce F1 animals. Heterozygous targeted mice were intercrossed to generate homozygous targeted mice. The genotyping primer used were: 5’- GGAAAGACCACAGAATCAATGACA-3’, 5’-AACATTGCTATACCCCACTATA-3’. To generate ApoE and AFF3ir-ORF2 double knockout mice (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup>), ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were crossed with AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The animals were maintained at 21 ± 1°C under a 12-hour light/dark cycle (lights on at 07:00, lights off at 19:00) with ad libitum access to water and standard chow unless specified otherwise. This study adhered to the <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85- 23, revised 2011).

<title>Carotid artery partial ligation surgery</title>
<p>The surgery was performed as we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2-3%). A ventral midline incision (4-5 mm) was made in the neck and the left carotid artery was exposed through blunt dissection of subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue. The left external carotid, internal carotid, and occipital arteries were ligated with a 6-0 silk suture, leaving the superior thyroid artery intact. For adenovirus and lentivirus infection studies, adenovirus (Ad-ORF2 or Ad-Scramble) or lentivirus (lenti-shRNA-IRF5 or lenti-shRNA-Scramble) was introduced into the lumen of the left carotid artery and kept inside for 40 min. After infection, the adenovirus or lentivirus was released, and blood flow to the common carotid artery was restored. Mice were fed with a high-fat diet (TD88137, ENVIGO, USA) immediately after surgery and continued for 4 weeks.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors report the role of a novel gene Aff3ir-ORF2 in flow induced atherosclerosis. They show that the gene is anti-inflammatory in nature. It inhibits the IRF5 mediated athero-progression by inhibiting the causal factor (IRF5). Furthermore, authors show a significant connection between shear stress and Aff3ir-ORF2 and its connection to IRF5 mediated athero-progression in different established mice models which further validates the ex vivo findings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Adequate number of replicates were used for this study.</p>
<p>
(2) Both in vitro and in vivo validation was done.</p>
<p>
(3) Figures are well presented</p>
<p>
(4) In vivo causality is checked with cleverly designed experiments</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Inflammatory proteins must be measured with standard methods e.g ELISA as mRNA level and protein level does not always correlate.</p>
<p>
(2) RNA seq analysis has to be done very carefully. How does the euclidean distance correlate with the differential expression of genes. Do they represent neighborhood? If they do how does this correlation affect the conclusion of the paper?</p>
<p>
(3) Volcano plot does not indicate q value of the shown genes. It is advisable to calculate q value for each of the genes which represents the FDR probability of the identified genes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors recently uncovered a novel nested gene, Aff3ir, and this work sets out to study its function in endothelial cells further. Based on differences in expression correlating with areas of altered shear stress, they investigate a role for the isoform Aff3ir-ORF2 in endothelial activation and development of atherosclerosis downstream of disturbed shear stress. Using a knockout mouse model and in vivo overexpression experiments, they demonstrate a strong potential for Aff3ir-ORF2 to alleviate atherosclerosis. They find that Aff3ir-ORF2 interacts with the pro-inflammatory transcription factor IRF5 and retains it in the cytoplasm, hence preventing upregulation of inflammation-associated genes. The data expands our knowledge of IRF5 regulation which could be relevant to researchers studying various inflammatory diseases as well as adding to our understand of atherosclerosis development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The in vivo data is convincing using immunofluorescence staining to assess AFF3ir-ORF2 expression, a knockout mouse model, overexpression and knockdown studies and rescue experiments in combination with two atherosclerotic models to demonstrate that Aff3ir-ORF2 can lessen atherosclerotic plaque formation in ApoE-/- mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The effect on atherosclerosis is clear and there is sufficient evidence to conclude that this is the result of reduced endothelial cell activation. However, other cell types such as smooth muscle cells or macrophages could be contributing to the effects observed. The mouse model is a global knockout and the shRNA knockdowns (Fig. 5) and overexpression data in Figure 2 are not cell type-specific. Only the overexpression construct in Figure 6 uses an ICAM-2 promoter construct, which drives expression in endothelial cells, though leaky expression of this promoter has been reported in the literature.</p>
<p>The in vitro experiments are solidly executed, but most experiments are performed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and results extrapolated to endothelial cell responses. However, several key experiments are repeated in HUVEC, thereby making a solid case that Aff3ir-ORF2 can regulate IRF5 in both MEFs and HUVEC. It is important to note that the sequence of AFF3ir-ORF2 is not conserved in humans and lacks an initiation codon, hence the regulatory pathway is not conserved. However, the overexpression studies in HUVEC suggest that mouse AFF3ir-ORF2 can also regulate human IRF5 and hence the mechanism retains relevance for possible human health interventions.</p>
<p>Overall, the paper succeeds in demonstrating a link between Aff3ir-ORF2 and atherosclerosis. The study shows a functional interaction between Aff3ir-ORF2 and IRF5 in embryonic fibroblasts, but makes a solid case that this mechanism is relevant for atherosclerosis development via endothelial cell activation.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Inflammatory proteins must be measured with standard methods e.g ELISA as mRNA level and protein level does not always correlate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We have followed your advice and performed ELISA experiments to measure the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-1β. The newly acquired results have been included in Figure 2E (Line 160-163) in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>We thank the reviewer for this professional comments and apologize for the confusion. The heatmap using Euclidean distance was generated based on the expression levels of all differentially expressed genes (calculated with deseq2). Since its interpretation overlaps with the volcano plot presented in Figure 4B, we have moved the heatmap to Figure S5A in the revised manuscript and provided a detailed description in the figure legend (Lines 106-108 in the supporting information). Additionally, to better illustrate the variation among all samples, we have performed PCA analysis and included the new results in Figure 4A of the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Thank you for your careful review. We apologize for the incorrect labeling.</p>
<p>It was <italic>P</italic>.adj value. The label for Figure 4B has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) GO enrichment was done against the Global gene set or a local geneset? The authors should provide more detailed information about the analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. We performed GO enrichment analysis against the global gene set. The description of the results has been updated in the revised manuscript (Lines 222–224).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) If the analysis was performed against a global gene set. How does that connect with this specific atherosclerotic microenvironment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments. We have followed your advice and investigated the functional characteristics of these differentially expressed genes in the context of the atherosclerotic microenvironment. The RNA-seq differential gene list was further mapped onto the atherosclerosis-related gene dataset (PMID: 27374120), resulting in 363 overlapping genes. The 363 genes were subjected to bioinformatics enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) databases. GO analysis of these genes revealed enrichment in processes related to cell−cell adhesion and leukocyte activation involved in immune response (Figure S5B), which is highly consistent with the observed effects of AFF3ir-ORF2 on VCAM-1 expression. The newly acquired data are presented in Figure S5B and the description of the results is included in the revised manuscript (Line 227-233).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) What was the basal expression of genes and how did the DGE (differential gene expression) values differ?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comments. The RNA-sequencing data has been submitted to GEO datasets (GSE286206), making the basal gene expression data available to readers.</p>
<p>The differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (v1.4.5) (PMID: 25516281) with a criterion of 1.5-fold change and P&lt;0.05. We has included the description in the revised manuscript in Lines 220-222 and Lines 575-576.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) How was IRF5 picked from GO analysis? was it within the 20 most significant genes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sorry for the confusion. IRF5 was not identified through GO analysis. To determine the upstream transcriptional regulators, we used the ChEA3 database to predict potential upstream transcription factors based on all differentially expressed genes. The top 20 transcription factors were selected based on their scores. To further explore their relationship with atherosclerosis, these top 20 transcription factors were mapped to the atherosclerosis-related gene list in the DisGeNET database. IRF5 and IRF8 were the only two overlapping genes. To clarify this process, we have included a more detailed description of the IRF prediction approach in the revised manuscript (Lines 234–239).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors recently uncovered a novel nested gene, Aff3ir, and this work sets out to study its function in endothelial cells further. Based on differences in expression correlating with areas of altered shear stress, they investigate a role for the isoform Aff3ir-ORF2 in endothelial activation and development of atherosclerosis downstream of disturbed shear stress.

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for your positive remarks.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the in vivo data is generally convincing, a few data panels have issues and will need addressing. Also, the knockout mouse model will need to be described, since the paper referred to in the manuscript does not actually report any knockout mouse model. Hence it is unclear how Aff3ir-ORF2 is targeted, but Figure S2B shows that targeting is partial, since about 30% expression remains at the RNA level in MEFs isolated from the knockout mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for the valuable comments.</p>
<p>First, we have followed your advice and included detailed information regarding the animal construction in the revised manuscript in Line 405-415. Additionally, the genotyping results have been included in new Figure S3A.</p>
<p>Second, we acknowledge your concern about the knockout efficiency of ORF2 in mice. While the PCR assay indicated approximately 30% residual expression, our Western blot analysis of aorta samples demonstrated that ORF2 protein was barely detectable in knockout mice, as shown in new Figure S3B-C. Besides, our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments using MEF from WT and AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (Figure 4I) further confirmed successful knockout.</p>
<p>Third, we have included a discussion addressing the discrepancies between PCR and Western blot results. In addition to technical differences between the two methods, the nature of AFF3ir-ORF2 may also contribute to these inconsistencies. The parent gene AFF3 is located in a genetically variable region and can be excised via intron 5 to form a replicable transposon, which translocates to other chromosomes and has been linked to leukemia (PMID: 34995897, 12203795, 12743608, and 17968322). AFF3ir is located in the intron 6, thus it exists in the transposon, which may complicate the measurement of its expression. Replicable transposons can exist as extrachromosomal elements, allowing them to be inherited across generations. We have included these discussion in the revised manuscript in Line 188-196.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While the effect on atherosclerosis is clear, the conclusion that this is the result of reduced endothelial cell activation is not supported by the data. The mouse model is described as a global knockout and the shRNA knockdowns (Figure 5) and overexpression data in Figure 2 are not cell type-specific. Only the overexpression construct in Figure 6 uses an ICAM-2 promoter construct, which drives expression in endothelial cells, though leaky expression of this promoter has been reported in the literature. Therefore, other cell types such as smooth muscle cells or macrophages could be responsible for the effects observed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your critical comment. To address your concern, we have made the following three revisions:</p>
<p>First, we have analyzed the expression of AFF3ir-ORF2 in the vascular wall with or without intima in WT and AFF3ir-ORF2 knockout mice. As shown in Figure 1B and Figure S1A, while the expression of AFF3ir-ORF2 was notably downregulated in the aortic intima of athero-prone regions compared to the protective region, it remained largely unchanged in the aortic wall without intima across different regions of the aorta. This suggested that AFF3ir-ORF2 might play a predominant role in endothelial cells rather than other cell types in the context of shear stress.</p>
<p>Second, we have used human endothelial cells (HUVECs) to further confirm our findings. As shown in Figure 2C and Figure S2B, we found that AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression could attenuate disturbed shear stress-induced IRF5 nuclear translocation and the expression of inflammatory genes in HUVECs, suggesting the potential anti-inflammatory effects of AFF3ir-ORF2 in endothelial cells.</p>
<p>Third, we agree with the reviewer’s comment that we cannot completely exclude the potential involvement of other cell types. Hence, we have included a limitation statement in the discussion part in Lines 341-344.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The weakest part of the manuscript is the in vitro experiment using some nonidentifiable expression differences. The data is used to hypothesise on a role for IRF5 in the effects observed with Aff3ir-ORF2 knockout.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comments. To address your concerns, we have made the following two changes:</p>
<p>First, we have further investigated the functional features of the differential genes from the RNA-seq in the context of atherosclerotic microenvironment. The differential gene list was mapped onto the atherosclerosis-related gene dataset (PMID: 27374120), and a total of 363 genes overlapped. These 363 genes were subjected to bioinformatics enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) databases. GO analysis showed that these genes were mainly enriched in cell−cell adhesion and leukocyte activation involved in immune response, which aligns with the expression of VCAM-1 affected by AFF3ir-ORF2. The newly acquired data are presented in Figure S5B and the description of the results has been updated in the revised manuscript (Line 227-233).</p>
<p>Second, we have further verified the RNA-seq results <italic>in vitro</italic>. Several classical inflammatory factors, including ICAM-1, CCL5, and CXCL10, which mRNA levels were significantly downregulated in RNA-seq and were also identified as target genes of IRF5, were analyzed. We found that AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency aggravated, while AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression attenuated, the expression of ICAM-1, CCL5, and CXCL10 induced by disturbed shear stress (New Figure S5D). Besides, the regulation of ICAM-1 by AFF3ir-ORF2 was confirmed at both protein and mRNA levels in HUVECs (Figure 2C-D and Figure S2B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, the paper succeeds in demonstrating a link between Aff3ir-ORF2 and atherosclerosis, but the cell types involved and mechanisms remain unclear. The study also shows a functional interaction between Aff3ir-ORF2 and IRF5 in embryonic fibroblasts, but any relevance of this mechanism for atherosclerosis or any cell types involved in the development of this disease remains largely speculative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for all the valuable comments. The specific responses have been provided above. Briefly, we have followed your advice and further confirmed the regulation of AFF3ir-ORF2 on IRF5 in endothelial cells. Besides, the RNA-seq results have been further analyzed, and partial results have been verified in endothelial cells to support the anti-inflammatory role of AFF3ir-ORF2. We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments, which guided our revisions and contributed to significantly improving the paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This study is to demonstrate the role of Aff3ir-ORF2 in the atheroprone flow-induced EC dysfunction and ensuing atherosclerosis in mouse models. Overall, the data quality and comprehensiveness are convincing. In silico, in vitro, and in vivo experiments and several atherosclerosis were well executed. To strengthen further, the authors can address human EC relevance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for your positive remarks and insightful comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The tissue source in Figures 1A and 1B should be clarified, the whole aortic segments or intima? If aortic segment was used, the authors should repeat the experiments using intima, due to the focus of the current study on the endothelium.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for the suggestion. The tissue used in Figures 1A and 1B was from aortic intima. The description has been updated for clarity in the revised manuscript on Lines 114-125.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Why were MEFs used exclusively in the in vitro experiments? Can the authors repeat some of the critical experiments in mouse or human ECs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this insightful comment. Isolation and culture of mouse primary aortic ECs were notorious technically difficult and shear stress experiment require a large number of cells. Considering MEFs exhibit responses consistent with those of ECs, which has been delicately proved (PMID: 23754392), we used MEFs in our in vitro experiments.</p>
<p>However, following your valuable advice, we have now employed human ECs (HUVECs) to confirm our findings. Consistent with our results in MEFs, we found that AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression reduced the expression of inflammatory genes induced by disturbed shear stress at both protein and mRNA levels in HUVECs (Figure 2C, Figure S2B). Notably, despite the significant anti-inflammatory effects of AFF3irORF2, the sequence of this gene is not conserved in Homo sapiens and lacks an initiation codon, which is why we did not further proceed with the loss-of-function experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors should explain why AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression did not affect the basal level expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, IL-1b, and IL-6 under ST conditions (Figure 2A-C).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for raising this critical question. Indeed, we found that AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression did not affect the basal level of inflammatory genes under ST conditions, while it exerted anti-inflammatory effects under OSS conditions. One underlying reason might be the relative low level of expression of inflammatory genes under ST compared to OSS conditions. Additionally, as our findings suggested, AFF3ir-ORF2 exerted its anti-inflammatory role by binding to IRF5 and inhibiting IRF5 nuclear translocation. However, as shown in Figure 4I, IRF5 might be predominantly localized in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus under ST conditions.</p>
<p>We have included the description in the revised manuscript on Lines 157-163.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Please include data from sham controls, i.e., right carotid artery in Figure 2E.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have followed your advice and included sham controls (staining of the right carotid arteries) in Figure S2E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Given that the merit of the study lies in the effect of different flow patterns, the legion areas in AA and TA (Figure 3B, 3C) should be separately compared.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have followed your valuable suggestion and included the additional statistical results in Figure 3C in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) For confirmatory purposes for the variations of IRF5 and IRF8, can the authors mine available RNA-seq or even scRNA-seq data on human or mouse atherosclerosis? This approach is important and could complement the current results that are lacking EC data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. In the present study, we found that disturbed flow did not alter the protein level of IRF5 but promoted its nuclear translocation. Following your advice, we analyzed the expression of IRF5 in human ECs (GSE276195) and atherosclerotic mouse arteries (GSE222583) using public databases. Consistently, IRF5 did not show significant changes in mRNA levels under these conditions (Figure S5E-F), suggesting that the regulation of IRF5 in the context of disturbed flow or atherosclerosis is primarily post-translational.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) With the efficacy of using AAV-ICAM2-AFF3ir-ORF2 in atherosclerosis reduction (Figure 6), the authors are encouraged to use lung ECs isolated from the AFF3ir-ORF2/-mice to recapitulate its regulation of IRF5.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate your valuable suggestion to use lung ECs from mice. We have observed that AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency enhanced the nuclear translocation of IRF5 induced by OSS. Noteworthy, the transcriptional levels of IRF5 were minimally affected by AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency. Hence, to recapitulate the regulation of IRF5 with lung ECs isolated from the AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, it would require treating lung ECs with OSS followed by isolation of subcellular components. However, both in vitro shear stress treatment and subcellular fraction isolation require a large number of cells, and mouse lung ECs are difficult to culture and pass through several passages. Therefore, we hope the reviewer understands that these experiments were not performed. As an alternative, we have confirmed the transcriptional activity changes of IRF5 due to AFF3ir-ORF2 manipulation by analyzing the expression of its target genes indicated from RNA-seq results in both the intima of mouse aorta (Figure S5C-D) and HUVECs (Figure 2C-D and Figure S2B). Our findings show that AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency increases, while its overexpression decreases, the expression levels of IRF5-targeted genes in endothelial cells.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>My major concern is the use of MEFs for all in vitro experiments. All experiments should be done in endothelial cells if the aim is to show a mechanism relevant to endothelial activation and atherosclerosis. Lines 314-316 of the conclusion are absolutely not supported by the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the insightful comment. Following your advice, we have employed human ECs (HUVECs) to confirm our findings. Consistent with the findings in MEFs, we found that AFF3ir-ORF2 decreased the expression of inflammatory genes induced by disturbed shear stress, both at protein and mRNA levels in HUVECs (Figure 2C, Figure S2B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Since the in vivo experiments are not cell type-specific, it would be important to test and compare the expression of Aff3ir-ORF2 in endothelial cells as well as smooth muscle and macrophages to support any claim of cell type involvement in the effects observed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for the valuable suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have followed your suggestion and analyzed the expression pattern of AFF3ir-ORF2 in different regions of the aorta with or without endothelium. We observed a marked reduction in AFF3ir-ORF2 expression in the intima of the aortic arch compared to that in the intima of the thoracic aorta (Figure 1B-C). In contrast, the expression of AFF3irORF2 in the media and adventitia was comparable between the aortic arch and thoracic aorta (Figure S1A-B). These findings provide further evidence supporting the predominant role of endothelial cells. The description has been modified accordingly in the revised manuscript on Lines 121-134.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The results of the RNA-seq experiment should be disclosed. The experiment should be deposited on GEO or similar and a table of differentially expressed genes added to the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have followed your advice and submitted the RNA-sequencing data to GEO datasets (GSE286206). Besides, a table of differentially expressed genes has been included in the revised manuscript as Table S3.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 1D. Cell alignment in AA compared to TA suggests that the image is of the outer curvature, but Figure 1F is showing that the outer curvature is expressing more ORF2 than the inner. Why was the outer curvature chosen for this panel and is it true to conclude on that assumption that expression of ORF2 compares as TA &gt; Outer &gt; Inner curvature?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for the insightful suggestion. We have followed your advice and performed en-face immunofluorescence staining of AFF3ir-ORF2 and quantification of AFF3ir-ORF2 expression in AA inner, AA outer, and TA regions. As shown in new Figure 1D-E, the results indeed indicated that expression of AFF3irORF2 compares as TA &gt; AA outer &gt; AA inner.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. Corrected.</p>

<p>(4) Figure S1A. VE-cad staining and cell shape differ between control and overexpression. Is this a phenotype or are different areas of the vasculature shown, which would make it hard to interpret since Aff3ir-ORF2 levels differ in different vessel areas?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important question. For Figure S1A, only common carotid arteries were used for the staining. The potential differences in cell shape observed might be due to variations in the procedure during immunofluorescence staining. To avoid any misinterpretation, more representative images have been provided in the revised Figure S2C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 3D-G. Images are not representative of the quantification results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. More representative images have been replaced in the revised Figure 3D and Figure 3F.</p>

<p>(6) Line 220. Data for IRF8 are not shown in the figure to support this claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. The expression level of IRF8 has been included in Figure S5C.</p>

<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>(1)  The rationale for the following sentence (lines 126-128) is lacking: &quot;Moreover, 126 we observed the expression of AFF3ir-ORF2 in longitudinal sections of the mouse aorta (B. 127 Li et al., 2019)&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. The rationale for these experiments have been included in the revised manuscript on Line 127-129.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The source of antibodies against AFF3ir-ORF1 and AFF3ir-ORF2 used in western blot and immunostaining experiments were not mentioned in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. The antibody information has been included in the method part on Line 456-457, 510-511.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The rationale and data interpretation is not clear for the following sentence (lines 220-221): &quot;In addition, neither IRF5 nor IRF8 expression was regulated by AFF3irORF2 220 (Figure 4F)&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. The expression level of IRF8 has been included in Figure S5C. The sentence has been modified accordingly on Lines 253254.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The quality of AFF3ir-ORF2 blot in Figure 4I needs improvement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. More representative images have been included in Figure 4I.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) It appears that AFF3ir-ORF2 was present in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Does AFF3ir-ORF2 have a nuclear entry peptide? Also, the nuclear entry of AFF3ir-ORF2 can be enhanced by an immunofluorescence staining experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments. Indeed, although we did not observe any significant subcellular changes in the localization of AFF3ir-ORF2 under shear stress conditions, our immunostaining results revealed that AFF3ir-ORF2 is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. To explore whether AFF3ir-ORF2 contains nuclear localization signals, we utilized the NLStradamus tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/NLStradamus/">http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/NLStradamus/</ext-link>) to analyze its sequence. The predication indicated that AFF3ir-ORF2 lacks a nuclear localization signal.</p>
