<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Light-gated ion channels from protists (channelrhodopsins or ChRs) are optogenetic tools widely used for controlling neurons and cardiomyocytes. Multiplex optogenetic applications require spectrally separated molecules, which are difficult to engineer without disrupting channel function. Scanning numerous sequence databases, we identified three naturally blue-shifted ChRs from ancyromonads. They form a separate branch on the phylogenetic tree and contain residue motifs characteristic of anion ChRs (ACRs). However, only two conduct chloride, whereas the closely related <italic>Nutomonas longa</italic> homolog generates inward cation currents in mammalian cells under physiological conditions, significantly exceeding those by previously known tools with similar spectral maxima (peak absorption at ∼440 nm). Measurements of transient absorption changes and pH titration of purified proteins combined with mutant analysis revealed the roles of the residues in the photoactive site. Ancyromonad ChRs could be activated by near-infrared two-photon illumination, a technique that enables the deeper-tissue optogenetic activation of specific neurons in three dimensions. Both ancyromonad ACRs allowed optogenetic silencing of mouse cortical neurons in brain slices. <italic>Ancyromonas sigmoides</italic> ACR (<italic>Ans</italic>ACR) expression in cholinergic neurons enabled photoinhibition of pharyngeal muscle contraction in live worms. Overall, our results deepen the mechanistic understanding of light-gated channel function and expand the optogenetic toolkit with potent, blue-shifted ChRs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are retinylidene proteins acting as photoreceptors that mediate photomotility in green flagellate algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sineshchekov, Jung et al. 2002</xref>) and are also found in other protist lineages. The chromophore is attached via a retinylidene Schiff base (RSB) linkage to a conserved lysine residue in the 7<sup>th</sup> transmembrane helix (TM7). Upon photoexcitation, ChRs generate passive ionic currents across the cell membrane and are used for optical control of excitable animal cells (optogenetics) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deisseroth 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Piatkevich and Boyden 2023</xref>). The seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain is sufficient for channel activity; the role of the C-terminal domain, which comprises up to half of the polypeptide chain, remains unclear. A considerable diversity within the ChR family suggests a convergent evolution of light-gated channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Govorunova, Sineshchekov et al. 2022</xref>). ChRs form dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Volkov, Kovalev et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li, Huang et al. 2019</xref>) or trimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Tucker, Sridharan et al. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Morizumi, Kim et al. 2023</xref>), but their ionic conductance is intrinsic to individual protomers, unlike voltage- or ligand-gated channels, in which several protomers contribute to the channel pore. Anion channelrhodopsins (ACRs) generate photoinduced anion influx in mammalian cells; cation channelrhodopsins (CCRs) generate H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> influx; and kalium channelrhodopsins (KCRs) generate K<sup>+</sup> efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Govorunova, Sineshchekov et al. 2022</xref>, Govorunova, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sineshchekov et al. 2023</xref>). ACRs and KCRs are used for optogenetic neuronal inhibition, and CCRs are used for neuronal activation.</p>
<p>Increasingly popular all-optical electrophysiology, i.e., simultaneous perturbation and measurement of membrane potential using light-sensitive actuators and reporters, respectively, in the same genetically defined cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hochbaum, Zhao et al. 2014</xref>) requires spectrally non-overlapping optogenetic tools. Even the most red-shifted ChRs retain sufficient sensitivity to blue light due to their relatively wide spectral bandwidth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oda, Vierock et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Govorunova, Sineshchekov et al. 2020</xref>). The development of red-light-absorbing genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors for monitoring neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sakamoto and Yokoyama 2025</xref>) opened up the possibility of pairing them with blue-shifted ChRs. Molecular engineering yielded several blue-shifted ChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kato, Kamiya et al. 2015</xref>), but mutagenetic perturbations of the binding pocket frequently harm channel function. A complementary approach is exploring natural ChR diversity to search for molecules with desired biophysical properties optimized by evolution. Approximately ∼1,000 ChR sequences are currently known, but a much smaller number has been functionally characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Govorunova, Sineshchekov et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we identified and characterized three ChR variants from bacterivorous ancyromonad flagellates. Ancyromonads (also known as planomonads) represent a distinct major clade near the most commonly inferred root of the eukaryote tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown, Heiss et al. 2018</xref>). We conducted automated and manual patch clamp analyses of photocurrents upon expression of ancyromonad ChR cDNAs in cultured mammalian cells under one- and two-photon excitation and monitored transient light absorption changes using detergent-purified proteins. We show that two ancyromonad ChRs are anion-selective, while the third and most blue-shifted ChR conducts metal cations. We expressed ancyromonad ACRs in mouse cortical pyramidal neurons and demonstrated photoinhibition of action potentials in acute brain slices. The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is an attractive model for analyzing nervous system function by optogenetic manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bergs, Henss et al. 2022</xref>). We used this model organism to demonstrate that a blue-shifted ancyromonad ACR enables efficient optogenetic inhibition of pharyngeal activity upon expression in the cholinergic neurons.</p>

<p>Our bioinformatic search identified ChR homologs in the ancyromonads <italic>Ancyromonas sigmoides, Fabomonas tropica,</italic> and <italic>Nutomonas longa; Ancoracysta twista,</italic> a predatory flagellate placed in the newly established supergroup Provora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tikhonenkov, Mikhailov et al. 2022</xref>); the diatom <italic>Odontella aurita</italic>; and <italic>Paraphysoderma sedebokerense</italic>, a chytrid-like fungus from the phylum Blastocladiomycota.

The <italic>A. twista</italic> and <italic>O. aurita</italic> homologs clustered with known stramenopile ACRs.

<p>We expressed cDNAs encoding the 7TM domains of seven homologs fused to a C-terminal mCherry tag in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and recorded photocurrents using manual patch clamping. All three ancyromonad ChRs generated robust photocurrents and showed maximal sensitivity in the blue spectral range (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on their ionic selectivities (see the next section), we named the <italic>A. sigmoides, F. tropica,</italic> and <italic>N. longa</italic> homologs <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, and <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, respectively. The spectral sensitivity of the <italic>A. twista</italic> and <italic>O. aurita</italic> homologs was in the blue-green range (<xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2</xref>, left). Partial replacement of Cl<sup>-</sup> in the bath with non-permeable aspartate shifted reversal potential (Vr) to more positive values, confirming their anion selectivity (<xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2</xref>, middle and right). We named them <italic>At</italic>ACR, <italic>Oa</italic>ACR1, and <italic>Oa</italic>ACR2. However, their photocurrents were smaller than those of the ancyromonad homologs or exhibited strong desensitization (reduction of photocurrents during illumination), so we did not characterize them in more detail. No photocurrents were detected in cells transfected with the <italic>P. sedebokerense</italic> homolog, although its expression and membrane targeting were evident from the tag fluorescence. Therefore, we named this protein <italic>Pars</italic>R, where R means “rhodopsin”.</p>
<p>Next, we expressed the constructs encoding ancyromonad ChRs in <italic>Pichia pastoris.</italic> We purified the proteins using a mild detergent yielding 0.25, 0.35, and 0.15 mg purified protein per L culture for <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, and <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, respectively. The absorption spectra of the purified proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) were slightly blue-shifted from the respective photocurrent action spectra (<xref rid="figs1c" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3</xref>), likely due to the presence of non-electrogenic <italic>cis</italic>-retinal-bound forms. The presence of such forms, explaining the discrepancy between the absorption and the action spectra, was verified by HPLC in KCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tajima et al. 2023</xref>, Morizumi et al., 2025). To test the possibility of using <italic>Ans</italic>ACR in multiplex optogenetics, we co-expressed it with the red-shifted CCR Chrimson (Klapoetke et al., 2014) fused to an EYFP tag in HEK293 cells. We measured the action spectrum of the net photocurrents with 4 mM Cl<sup>-</sup> in the pipette, matching the conditions in the neuronal cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Doyon, Vinay et al. 2016</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, black shows that the direction of photocurrents was hyperpolarizing upon illumination with λ&lt;500 nm and depolarizing at longer wavelengths.

<title>Characterization of ancyromonad ChRs by automated patch clamping</title>
<p>We used the fully automated planar patch clamp platform SyncroPatch 384 to characterize ancyromonad ChRs’ photocurrents.

<p>The voltage dependencies of photocurrents (IV curves) are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-F</xref>. <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR showed similarly negative Vr values, suggesting higher relative permeability to Cl<sup>-</sup> than F-, as earlier found in <italic>Gt</italic>ACRs by manual patch clamping (Govorunova, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sineshchekov et al. 2015</xref>). The Vr values of the peak current and that at the end of illumination were not significantly different by the two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), indicating no change in the relative permeability during illumination. Unexpectedly, the <italic>Nl</italic>CCR photocurrents reversed near 0 mV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F, G</xref>). One reason for this behavior could be equal permeabilities of this ChR to Cl<sup>-</sup> and F<sup>-</sup>. However, when Cl<sup>-</sup> in the external solution was partially replaced with bulky, non-permeable aspartate, only <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR showed substantial Vr shifts to more positive values, which confirmed their permeability to Cl<sup>-</sup>, but no such shift was detected in <italic>Nl</italic>CCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H-J</xref>, red symbols). Control experiments conducted by manual patch clamping with the Cl<sup>-</sup>-based pipette solution confirmed these observations (<xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 2</xref>). Upon replacing Cl<sup>-</sup> with NO3<sup>-</sup>, <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, but not <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, showed Vr shifts to more negative values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H-J</xref>, green), as did <italic>Gt</italic>ACRs examined by manual patch clamping (Govorunova, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sineshchekov et al. 2015</xref>), which indicated higher relative permeability to NO3<sup>-</sup> than to Cl<sup>-</sup>. <italic>Ft</italic>ACR exhibited a larger Vr shift in NO3<sup>-</sup> than <italic>Ans</italic>ACR (p = 2.6E10-5 by the two-tailed Mann-Whitney test). Replacing Na<sup>+</sup> with N-methyl-D-gluconate (NMDG<sup>+</sup>) resulted in a negative Vr shift in <italic>Nl</italic>CCR but not the other tested variants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H-J</xref>, blue), suggesting that <italic>Nl</italic>CCR is permeable to Na<sup>+</sup>. <xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1C, D</xref> compares <italic>Nl</italic>CCR with the typical cation-selective <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> channelrhodopsin 2 (<italic>Cr</italic>ChR2), assessed using the same assay.

<title>Channel gating and photochemical transitions under single-turnover conditions</title>
<p>Photocurrents evoked by continuous light pulses do not accurately reflect channel kinetics because different ChR molecules absorb photons at different times. Further complications result from photon absorption by photocycle intermediates. We conducted manual patch clamp recordings upon 6-ns laser flash excitation to analyze channel gating. <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR photocurrents exhibited biphasic rise and decay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, D), as the earlier characterized <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 (Sineshchekov, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Govorunova et al. 2015</xref>). The IV curves of all kinetic components revealed the same Vr values (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), meaning no ion selectivity changes occur during the single-turnover photocycle. Next, we analyzed transient absorption changes in detergent-purified <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR. In contrast to <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1, we could not find a clear indication of the accumulation of a blue-shifted L intermediate. After an initial (unresolved) decay of a K-like intermediate, red-shifted absorbance temporally increased in both ancyromonad ACRs, reaching a maximum at 100-200 μs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, E</xref>, red), i.e., in the time domain of fast channel opening. This red-shifted intermediate could be a long-lived K or an unusual red-shifted L. In <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, an additional slower increase in the red-shifted absorbance likely reflected the formation of an O-like intermediate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, red). Accumulation of the M intermediate absorbing in the UV range was only 10 (<italic>Ans</italic>ACR) or 2 times (<italic>Ft</italic>ACR) slower than channel opening (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, F</xref>), although in <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 it was 50 times slower (Sineshchekov, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Govorunova et al. 2015</xref>). Also, in contrast to prior observations in <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1, no temporal correlation was found between M formation and fast channel closing and between M decay and slow channel closing in ancyromonad ACRs. <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, the most blue-shifted among the ancyromonad ChRs we identified, has negligible absorption at 532 nm, the excitation laser’s wavelength; therefore, its photochemical conversions could not be probed with our flash photolysis setup. In contrast to <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, <italic>Nl</italic>CCR’s laser-flash-induced photocurrent kinetics showed single exponential opening and closing in Cl<sup>-</sup> and did not change upon its substitution with Asp<sup>-</sup> in the bath solution (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p>

<p>While all ACRs have a non-carboxylate residue homologous to Asp85 in BR, the second counterion homologous to Asp212 in BR remains protonatable (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1</xref>, red arrow). To estimate the pKa of this counterion, we performed pH-titration of the absorption spectra (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>). The titration curves revealed two transitions in all ancyromonad ChRs. Acidification caused a transition to longer peak absorption wavelengths, as expected upon protonation of the counterion, with pKa1s ∼3.9, 2, and 3.4 for <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, and <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, respectively. The maximum amplitude of this transition in <italic>Ans</italic>ACR (∼8 nm) exactly corresponded to the 8-nm red shift of the photocurrent action spectrum in the <italic>Ans</italic>ACR_D226N mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). The D226N mutation did not suppress photocurrent, but simplified its kinetics (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Instead of the biphasic opening and closing observed in the WT, only two exponentials were sufficient to fit the D226N mutant’s current, one for opening and one for closing. This observation suggested the role of Asp226 in channel gating, which was confirmed by analysis of the voltage dependence of the closing τ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Upon shifting to positive voltages, both components of channel closing accelerated in the WT, but the single-exponential closing slowed in the mutant, which suggests that oppositely directed charge movements control channel closing in the WT and the mutant.</p>

<p>Further acidification caused a transition to shorter wavelengths with similar pKa2s in both purified ancyromonad ACRs and only a slightly lower pKa2 in <italic>Nl</italic>CCR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>). It most probably reflects binding Cl<sup>-</sup> in the photoactive site, as in archaeal rhodopsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shimono, Kitami et al. 2000</xref>). On the other hand, in contrast to <italic>Natronomonas pharaonis</italic> halorhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Váró, Brown et al. 1996</xref>), no blue spectral shift was detected in detergent-purified <italic>Ans</italic>ACR at neutral pH upon an increase in the Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration (<xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1</xref>), which argued against Cl<sup>-</sup> binding in the RSB region under these conditions.</p>
<p>Mutagenetic introduction of Glu in <italic>Ans</italic>ACR in the position of the primary acceptor in BR (the G86E mutation) led to the appearance of an additional spectral transition with pKa 7.4 upon pH titration of purified protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). An extremely fast M-like UV-absorbing intermediate absent in the WT was observed in the mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>, red). Its rise and decay τ corresponded to the rise and decay τ of the fast positive current recorded from <italic>Ans</italic>ACR_G86E at 0 mV and neutral pH, superimposed on the fast negative current reflecting the chromophore isomerization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>, upper black trace). We interpret this positive current as an intramolecular proton transfer to the mutagenetically introduced primary acceptor (Glu86), which was suppressed by negative voltage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>, lower black trace). Acidification increased the amplitude of the fast negative current ∼10-fold (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>, black arrow) and shifted its Vr ∼100 mV to more depolarized values (<xref rid="figs4b" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 2A</xref>). This can be explained by passive inward movement of the RSB proton along the large electrochemical gradient. Remarkably, the G86E mutation suppressed channel current at neutral pH, but acidification of the bath to pH 5.4 recovered it (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>, red arrow). The full current trace recorded under acidic conditions could be deconvoluted into four components with τ 30 μs, 80 μs, 1.5 ms, and 640 ms, revealing that the mutation slowed channel closing 6-fold. Replacement of Cl<sup>-</sup> with Asp<sup>-</sup> caused a ∼40-mV shift of the channel current’s Vr (<xref rid="figs4b" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 2B</xref>), indicating that the mutant channel remained Cl<sup>-</sup> selective. These results confirm that the absence of a negative charge at the site corresponding to BR’s primary acceptor is the ultimate condition for anion channel function.</p>
<p>Strong alkalization caused simultaneous depletion of absorption in the visible range, the appearance of the M-like states (at 368 nm in the wild-type <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and 355 nm in the <italic>Ans</italic>ACR_G86E mutant), and a substantial absorption increase at 297 nm, reflecting deprotonation of the RSB and a strong perturbation of the protein band (<xref rid="figs4b" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 2C</xref>). Analysis of the pH dependence of three parameters (absorption depletion in the visible range, absorption rise in the M-like states’ range, and absorption rise at 297 nm) yielded similar pKa values, which were 11.1 and 10.7 for the WT and G86E, respectively (<xref rid="figs4b" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 2D</xref> ). These high pKa values may explain the high photostability of this protein, as hundreds of laser flashes did not cause its measurable bleaching.</p>
<p>The glutamate in the middle of TM2 corresponding to Glu68 of <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 is conserved in most ACRs, including <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, but is replaced with Gln in <italic>Ans</italic>ACR (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1</xref>, black arrow). Introducing the Q48E mutation in <italic>Ans</italic>ACR accelerated channel closing and slowed channel opening, making the photocurrent rise and decay monophasic (<xref rid="figs4c" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 3A,B</xref> ).</p>

<title>The retinal-binding pocket and color tuning</title>

<p>In blue-shifted ChRs such as <italic>Ps</italic>ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Govorunova, Sineshchekov et al. 2013</xref>) and <italic>Klebsormidium nitens</italic> channelrhodopsin (<italic>Kn</italic>ChR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tashiro, Sushmita et al. 2021</xref>), the position of BR’s Met118 is occupied by Gly or Ala (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), which, together with the Ala four residues downstream (BR’s Gly122), rotates the β-ionone ring out of the plane of the polyene chain, shrinking the <italic>p</italic>-conjugation and blue-shifting the spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wang, Natsume et al. 2025</xref>). The Ala corresponding to BR’s Gly122 is also found in <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Nl</italic>CCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), but the <italic>Ans</italic>ACR_M134A/G and <italic>Nl</italic>CCR_M141A/G mutations did not change the spectra, nor did the <italic>Ft</italic>ACR_M140G_V144A mutation (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). These observations suggest that the residue geometry and/or interactions in the retinal-binding pocket in ancyromonad ChRs differ from the earlier studied microbial rhodopsins.</p>
<p>The residue position corresponding to BR’s Leu93 is the color switch between blue- and green-absorbing proteorhodopsins (BPRs and GPRs, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Man, Wang et al. 2003</xref>)). <italic>Ans</italic>ACR exhibits a Gln residue in this position, as do BPRs, but <italic>Ft</italic>ACR has Leu, as do GPRs, and <italic>Nl</italic>CCR has Met (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The <italic>Ft</italic>ACR_L96Q and <italic>Nl</italic>CCR_M93Q mutations blue-shifted the spectra 20 and 7 nm, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>, J), indicating that this residue position contributes to color tuning in ancyromonad ACRs. <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, the most blue-shifted among ancyromonad ChRs, differs from <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR at the positions corresponding to Ser89 and Glu233 (<italic>Nl</italic>CCR numbering), and from <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, also at the position of Pro235 (the corresponding residues in <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 are Thr101, Asp234, and Leu236, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The S89T, E233D, and P235I mutations red-shifted the <italic>Nl</italic>CCR spectrum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>), indicating that these three positions contribute to the blue shift of wild-type <italic>Nl</italic>CCR compared with <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR. However, the T90S mutation did not change the <italic>Ans</italic>ACR spectrum, and the D226E mutation and a combination of the two mutations caused red spectral shifts in <italic>Ans</italic>ACR (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 1D</xref>).

<title>Two-photon excitation</title>
<p>Optical manipulation of neuronal activity in dense tissue commonly relies on two-photon (2P) excitation, which is based on the nearly simultaneous absorption of two infrared photons, equivalent to the absorption of one photon in the visible range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Emiliani, Entcheva et al. 2022</xref>). To determine the 2P activation range of <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, and <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, we conducted raster scanning using a conventional 2P laser, varying the excitation wavelength between 800 and 1,080 nm (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 1</xref>). All three ChRs generated detectable photocurrents with action spectra showing maximal responses at ∼925 nm for <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, 945 nm for <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, and 890 nm for <italic>Nl</italic>CCR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

<title>Optogenetic inhibition of pharyngeal function in live C. elegans</title>
<p>To test <italic>Ans</italic>ACR as an optogenetic inhibitory tool in the context of an intact behaving animal, we expressed the encoding construct fused to a C-terminal EYFP tag in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> cholinergic neurons using the <italic>unc-17</italic> promoter (a scheme of the expression construct is shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). C. <italic>elegans</italic> feeds on bacteria by rhythmic contractions and relaxations (pumping) of its pharynx. The cholinergic pharyngeal neurons, primarily MC neurons, entrain the pharyngeal muscle rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Trojanowski, Raizen et al. 2016</xref>). Neuronal and muscular electrical activity leading to pharyngeal contractions can be monitored non-invasively by electropharyngeogram (EPG) recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Raizen and Avery 1994</xref>). An EPG contains transients reflecting pharyngeal muscle action potentials (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>), the frequency of which can be easily quantified. In the presence of 10 mM serotonin required to maintain regular pharyngeal pumping, its frequency in the dark was not significantly different in the transgene and wild-type worms (4.07 ± 0.05 and 4.19 ± 0.08 Hz, respectively, mean ± SEM, n = 26 transgenic and 11 wild-type worms, respectively; the p-value by the two-tailed Mann-Whitney test is 0.21), indicating that <italic>Ans</italic>ACR expression did not affect the pharyngeal function in the darkness. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref> shows representative EPG recordings from a transgenic worm fed on bacteria supplemented with all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal. The onset of 470-nm illumination caused an immediate inhibition of pumping in such transgene worms but not in the WT worms fed on the same bacteria or transgene worms in the absence of retinal (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes LITE-1 and GUR-3 UV/blue light receptors (unrelated to ChRs) responsible for photoinhibition of pharyngeal pumping at high light levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhatla, Droste et al. 2015</xref>). However, no photoinhibition was detected in the absence of retinal in either wild-type or transgenic worms. This indicates that the irradiance used in our experiments was insufficient to stimulate these endogenous photoreceptors. The magnitude of the <italic>Ans</italic>ACR-mediated photoinhibition depended on the irradiance (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). The maximal irradiance (2.1 mW mm<sup>-2</sup>) completely abolished the pumping for 15 s in all tested worms (n = 13). In five of 13 worms, individual action potentials were observed during the second half of the 30-s illumination period, an indication of adaptation. Two independently created transgenic lines showed the same degree of photoinhibition (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>, filled and empty symbols). The photoinhibition was fully reversible: after switching off the maximal-irradiance light, the pumping frequency returned to the pre-illumination level with τ ∼9 s.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ChRs, also known as “<italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> sensory rhodopsins,” were first discovered as the photoreceptors guiding phototaxis and the photophobic response in the chlorophyte <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sineshchekov, Jung et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Govorunova, Jung et al. 2004</xref>). Since then, ChRs have been identified in the genomes and transcriptomes of several other eukaryotic supergroups, including cryptophytes, haptophytes, stramenopiles, and alveolates (Govorunova, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sineshchekov et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Govorunova, Sineshchekov et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Govorunova, Sineshchekov et al. 2021</xref>). Furthermore, ChRs appear in the genomes of giant viruses, which likely facilitate the spread of ChR genes by horizontal transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rozenberg, Oppermann et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zabelskii, Alekseev et al. 2020</xref>). Our identification and characterization of ChRs in ancyromonads, phylogenetically placed near the most commonly inferred root of the eukaryote tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown, Heiss et al. 2018</xref>), suggests that eukaryotes acquired ChR genes at the early steps of their evolution. Consistent with the role of the encoded proteins as phototaxis receptors as shown in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, ChR genes or transcripts have been found only in protists that develop flagella at some stage of their life cycle. The diatom <italic>O. aurita</italic>, in which we identified ChRs, is no exception: the flagella are lost in the vegetative state of this protist but are still present in its male gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nanjappa, Sanges et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Prediction of biophysical properties such as ionic selectivity from protein sequences is a major unresolved problem in ChRs research. The <italic>Nl</italic>CCR sequence shows ∼29% identity and ∼49% similarity in the 7TM domain to each of the two ancyromonad ACRs and contains a neutral residue in the counterion position (Asp85 in BR), typical of all ACRs (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1</xref>, red arrow). Yet, <italic>Nl</italic>CCR does not conduct anions, showing instead permeability to Na<sup>+</sup>. In the earlier known ChRs, the presence of conserved Glu residues in TM2 and the TM2-TM3 loop, corresponding to Glu82, Glu83, Glu90, and Glu101 of <italic>Cr</italic>ChR2, correlates with cation selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Govorunova, Sineshchekov et al. 2021</xref>). However, TM2 of <italic>Nl</italic>CCR contains no carboxylated residues (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1</xref>), which suggests a unique mechanism of cation selection in this channel. <italic>Nl</italic>CCR is the most blue-shifted among ancyromonad ChRs and generates larger photocurrents than the earlier known <italic>Ps</italic>ChR2 with a similar absorption maximum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Govorunova, Sineshchekov et al. 2013</xref>), which makes <italic>Nl</italic>CCR a good candidate for optogenetic stimulation of neuronal activity with blue light.</p>
<p>All ancyromonad ChRs absorb light in the blue spectral range. The λmax of retinylidene proteins is determined by the energy gap between the electronic ground (S0) and first excited (S1) state of the chromophore and depend on the chromophore geometry, the protonation state of the Schiff base counterion, and the interaction of the chromophore with other residues of the retinal-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ernst, Lodowski et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Engqvist, McIsaac et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kato, Kamiya et al. 2015</xref>). Paradoxically, the retinal-binding pockets of all three ancyromonad ChRs contain the residues corresponding to Met118 and Ala215 of bacteriorhodopsin, the well-known “color switches” characteristic of red-shifted microbial rhodopsins. The role of the near-ring Met118 homolog in red-shifting the spectrum has been experimentally verified in <italic>Haloquadratum walsbyi</italic> BR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sudo, Okazaki et al. 2013</xref>), <italic>Gloeobacter violaceus</italic> rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Engqvist, McIsaac et al. 2015</xref>), archaeorhodopsin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kato, Kamiya et al. 2015</xref>), and Chrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oda, Vierock et al. 2018</xref>). It is thought that the bulky Met side chain pushes away the C7 atom of retinal, increasing the ring-chain coplanarity, expanding the π-conjugation, and red-shifting absorbance, as theoretically predicted in the <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1_C133M mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tsujimura, Noji et al. 2021</xref>). The red-shifting effect of the Ala215 homolog has been demonstrated in <italic>N. pharaonis</italic> sensory rhodopsin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shimono, Iwamoto et al. 2000</xref>), <italic>H. salinarum</italic> BR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Spudich, Ozorowski et al. 2012</xref>), Chrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oda, Vierock et al. 2018</xref>), sodium-pumping rhodopsin KR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Inoue, Del Carmen Marin et al. 2019</xref>), and <italic>Mantoniella squamata</italic> ACR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Oppermann, Rozenberg et al. 2024</xref>), and is explained by electrostatic interactions between the polar residue in this position and the RSB. However, in ancyromonad ChRs, mutations of the Met118 homolog to smaller residues and the Ala215 homolog to polar residues caused a red spectral shift or no shift. Furthermore, the mutagenetic introduction of the ring-rotating residues responsible for the blue-shifted spectra of <italic>Hyphochytrium catenoides</italic> kalium channelrhodopsin 2 (<italic>Hc</italic>KCR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tajima, Kim et al. 2023</xref>) and <italic>Kn</italic>ChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wang, Natsume et al. 2025</xref>) did not change the ancyromonad ChR spectra, which suggests that either the torsion around the C6-C7 bond is already enforced by a different geometry of the Met118 homolog or that the blue-shifted absorbance of ancyromonad ChRs arises by a different mechanism. Atomic structures of ancyromonad ChRs are needed to investigate the unexpected spectral shifts we observed when mutating residues of the retinal binding pocket.</p>
<p>ACRs are widely used to inhibit neuronal activity with light. We evaluated <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR as neuronal silencers in mouse brain slices and <italic>Ans</italic>ACR in the context of a live animal, the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We previously showed that <italic>Gt</italic>ACRs could inhibit action potentials at the soma while triggering synaptic transmission due to high axonal Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Messier, Chen et al. 2018</xref>). <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR showed similar phenomena in our brain slice experiments. These ACRs can inhibit action potentials in cortical neurons but depolarize axonal terminals and trigger synaptic transmission at the onset of light stimulation. Fusing these new ACRs with somatodendritic trafficking motifs to reduce axonal expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mahn, Gibor et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Messier, Chen et al. 2018</xref>) could lead to potent inhibition with reduced axonal excitation. Nevertheless, this undesired excitatory effect needs to be taken into consideration when using ACRs.</p>
<p>Optogenetic inhibition of <italic>C. elegans</italic> pharyngeal pumping has been demonstrated earlier upon expression of the <italic>Leptosphaeria maculans</italic> proton-pumping rhodopsin known as Mac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Trojanowski, Padovan-Merhar et al. 2014</xref>) or <italic>N. pharaonis</italic> halorhodopsin (<italic>Np</italic>HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Schuler, Fischer et al. 2015</xref>) in the cholinergic neurons. However, ion-pumping rhodopsins such as these transport only one ion per absorbed photon and, therefore, require almost 20 times higher irradiance for photoinhibition than the maximal irradiance used in this study. All ACRs, including <italic>Ans</italic>ACR that we tested in the worms, transport multiple anions during the open state and, therefore, are more efficient optogenetic silencers than the ion-pumping rhodopsins. One possible explanation of the partial recovery of pharyngeal pumping that we observed after 15-s illumination, even at the highest tested irradiance, is continued attenuation of photocurrent during prolonged illumination (desensitization). However, the rate of <italic>Ans</italic>ACR desensitization (<xref rid="figs1d" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 4A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1e" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 5A</xref>) is much faster than the rate of the pumping recovery, reducing the likelihood that desensitization is driving this phenomenon. Another possible reason for the observed adaptation is an increase in the cytoplasmic Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration owing to <italic>Ans</italic>ACR activity and hence a breakdown of the Cl<sup>-</sup> gradient on the neuronal membrane. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> pharynx is innervated by 20 neurons, 10 of which are cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pereira, Kratsios et al. 2015</xref>). A pair of MC neurons is the most important for regulation of pharyngeal pumping, but other pharyngeal cholinergic neurons, including I1, M2, and M4, also play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Trojanowski, Padovan-Merhar et al. 2014</xref>). Moreover, the pharyngeal muscles generate autonomous contractions in the presence of acetylcholine tonically released from the pharyngeal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Trojanowski, Raizen et al. 2016</xref>). Given this complexity, further elucidation of pharyngeal pumping adaptation mechanisms is beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<p>In summary, our characterization of ancyromonad channelrhodopsins (ChRs) reveals that their blue-shifted spectral sensitivity and unique ionic selectivity arise from distinct residue motifs not found in previously characterized ChRs. These findings broaden our understanding of how protein sequence modulates light-gated channel function. The blue-shifted absorption properties of ancyromonad ChRs hold promise for multiplexed applications alongside red-shifted indicators and warrant further evaluation across diverse experimental systems.</p>

<title>HEK293 cell culture and transfection</title>
<p>No cell lines from the list of known misidentified cell lines maintained by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee were used in this study. HEK293 cells used in one-photon (1P) excitation experiments were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Cat. #CRL-1573). The cells were plated on 2-cm diameter plastic dishes 48-72 hrs before experiments, grown for 24 hrs, and transfected with 10 μl of Lipofectamine LTX with Plus Reagent (ThermoFisher, Cat. #15338100) using 3 μg DNA per dish for manual patch clamping, and 6 μg DNA per dish for automated patch clamping.

<title>Automated whole-cell patch clamp recording from HEK293 cells</title>
<p>Automated patch clamp recording was conducted at room temperature (21°C) with a SyncroPatch 384 (Nanion Technologies) based on a Biomek i5 automated liquid handler (Beckman Coulter), using NPC-384T S-type chips (Nanion, Cat. #222101) with one hole per well, as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Govorunova, Sineshchekov et al. 2022</xref>). Transfected cells (48-72 h after transfection) were dissociated using TrypLE Express, diluted with CHO-S-SFM-II medium (both from ThermoFisher, Cat.# 12604013 and 31033020, respectively), and resuspended in External Physiological solution (Nation, Cat.# 08 3001). The compositions of this and other solutions used in automated patch clamp recordings and the corresponding liquid junction potential (LJP) values calculated using the ClampEx LJP calculator are listed in Supplementary File 1. The voltages in all IV curves for HEK293 cells studied under 1P excitation in this manuscript were corrected for LJPs; the holding voltage values in the figures showing traces correspond to the amplifier output before the LJP subtraction. Illumination was provided with LUXEON Z Color Line light-emitting diodes (LEDs) Cat.# LXZ1-PB01 (470 ± 10 nm) arranged in a 6×16 matrix. The forward LED current was 900 mA (which corresponded to the irradiance of ∼2 mW mm<sup>-2</sup>), the illumination duration was 200 ms (limited by the LED duty cycle), and the interval between successive light pulses was 60 s. The LEDs were driven by a derivative of CardioExcyte 96 SOL (Nanion, Cat. #191003) and controlled by Biomek commands. PatchControl384 v. 2.3.0 (Nanion Technologies) software was used for data acquisition at a 5 kHz sampling rate (200 μs per point). The photocurrent amplitudes at the peak and the end of illumination were calculated using DataControl384 software v. 2.3.0 (Nanion Technologies). Further analysis was performed using the Origin Pro 2016 software (OriginLab Corporation).</p>

<title>Manual patch clamp recording using 1P excitation in HEK293 cells</title>
<p>Manual patch clamp recordings were performed with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). The pipette solution contained (in mM) KCl 130, MgCl2 2, HEPES 10 pH 7.4, and the bath solution contained (in mM) NaCl 130, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 2, glucose 10, HEPES 10 pH 7.4. In experiments to test the relative permeability of ChRs for Cl<sup>-</sup>, NaCl in the bath was replaced with Na aspartate, and in experiments in cells co-transfected with <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and Chrimson, KCl in the pipette solution was replaced with K gluconate. The low-pass filter of the amplifier output was set to 2 kHz. The signals were digitized with a Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices) at a 250-kHz sampling rate (4 μs per point) in experiments with laser flashes, and at a 5-kHz sampling rate (200 μs per point) in experiments with continuous light pulses using pClamp 10.7. Patch pipettes with 2-3 MΩ resistances were fabricated from borosilicate glass. Laser excitation was provided by a Minilite Nd:YAG laser (532 nm, pulse width 6 ns, energy 5 mJ; Continuum). The current traces were logarithmically filtered using Logpro software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Spudich 2022</xref>). Curve fitting was performed using Origin Pro software. Continuous light pulses were provided by a Polychrome V light source (T.I.L.L. Photonics GMBH) in combination with a mechanical shutter (Uniblitz Model LS6, Vincent Associates; half-opening time 0.5 ms). The action spectra of photocurrents were constructed by calculating the initial slope of photocurrent recorded in response to 15-ms light pulses at the intensity &lt;25 µW mm<sup>-2</sup>, corrected for the quantum density measured at each wavelength, and normalized to the maximal value. To analyze the dependence of photocurrents on the photon flux density, 1-s light pulses were applied with 60-s dark intervals starting from the lowest density. Calibrated neutral density filters (Newport, Cat. #FSQ-OD50, #FSQ-OD100, #FSQ-OD150, and #FSQ-OD200) were used to adjust the density.</p>

<title>Manual patch clamp recording using 2P excitation in HEK293A cells</title>
<p>2P excitation of <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1, and <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2 expressed in HEK293A cells was conducted using an inverted microscope with multiphoton capability (A1R-MP, Nikon Instruments) at room temperature (23°C). A coverslip seeded with the transfected cells was placed in a custom glass-bottom chamber based on Chamlide EC (Live Cell Instrument) with a glass bottom made with a 24×24 mm cover glass #1 (Erie Scientific, Cat. #89082-270). Cells were perfused continuously with the external solution as described in the 1P excitation section. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Cells were held at −20 mV for power dependency and spectral measurements, and at +20 mV for desensitization measurements. The holding voltages were compensated for the 4.4 mV LJP calculated using the ClampEx v.11.1 (Molecular Devices) built-in calculator. The signals were digitized with an Axon Digidata 1550B1 Low Noise system with a HumSilencer (Molecular Devices), and the current was recorded at 10 kHz using pClamp. The near-IR excitation was generated by a titanium:sapphire femtosecond laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent) with a repetition rate of 80 MHz and a tuning range between 680 and 1,080 nm. Laser pulses were not pre-compensated for dispersion in the microscope optical path. Laser power was tuned using an acousto-optic modulator and delivered to the sample plane through a 40×0.95-numerical aperture (NA) objective (CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda, Nikon Instruments). Scanning across 40.96×40.96 μm regions-of-interest was achieved using resonant scanning at 33.3 Hz.</p>
<p>To determine the 2P action spectra of <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, and <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, the excitation wavelength was varied from 800 to 1,080 nm in 40-nm increments. At each wavelength, the laser power at the sample plane was adjusted to 7.5 mW for <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, 5 mW for <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, and 3 mW for <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, as measured using a microscope slide power sensor (S170C, Thorlabs). Excitation power levels were selected to elicit robust photocurrents while minimizing ChR desensitization, by operating at or near the quadratic regime, where doubling the excitation power results in an approximate fourfold increase in the initial photocurrent slope. Deviations from the target power level were kept below 10% and corrected by considering the quadratic dependence of photocurrents on power under 2P excitation. Illumination consisted of 30 consecutive raster scans (total duration ∼1 s) over a 40.96×40.96 μm region (512×512 pixels), approximating the average size of a HEK293A cell. Scans were performed back-to-back without temporal gaps, except for the brief interval required for the laser to return to the starting scan position. To mitigate desensitization, we spaced illumination pulses ∼54 s apart. We verified that the power ramp and spectral scan protocols caused a less than 20% reduction in the peak photocurrent, as measured at the beginning and end of each protocol using peak-wavelength light pulses at 7.5 mW for <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, 5 mW for <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, and 3 mW for <italic>Nl</italic>CCR. The 2P action spectra were constructed by measuring the initial linear slope of the photocurrent rise at each wavelength and plotted using Origin Pro 2016 software.</p>
<p>For desensitization experiments, cells expressing <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1, and <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2 were illuminated near their respective peak wavelengths: <italic>Ans</italic>ACR (920 nm), <italic>Ft</italic>ACR (960 nm), <italic>Nl</italic>CCR (920 nm), <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 (1040 nm), and <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2 (940 nm) at 15 mW for 5 s. Current traces were low-pass filtered at 100 Hz and, for presentation purposes, downsampled by substituting an average value for each 100 data points. The <italic>Ft</italic>ACR trace was additionally smoothed by the 5-point Savitzky-Golay algorithm in Origin. Peak currents were quantified as the maximal currents over the 5-sec traces. End currents were calculated as the mean current over the final 0.1 s of the 5-sec photoactivation pulse.</p>

<title>Reproducibility and statistics</title>
<p>Plasmids encoding different ChR variants were randomly assigned to transfect identical cell batches. Three independent transfections were performed on different experimental days; the data obtained were pooled together. In automated patch clamp studies, cells were blindly selected by the machine and randomly drawn into the wells. For an unbiased estimation of the photocurrent amplitude, the data from wells that formed seals with a resistance &lt;500 MΩ were excluded. For a more accurate estimation of the Vr values by plotting the IV curves, wells with a seal resistance &lt;500 MΩ and photocurrents of the absolute magnitude &lt;50 pA at −80 mV were excluded. In manual patch clamp experiments, the cells were selected for patching by inspecting their tag fluorescence; non-fluorescent cells and cells in which no GΩ seal was established or lost during recording were excluded from the analysis. Recordings with the access resistance (Ra) &gt;20 MΩ were excluded from the analysis. In automated and manual patch clamp experiments, the photocurrent traces recorded from different cells transfected with the same construct were considered biological replicates (reported as n values). These values indicate how often the experiments were performed independently. In experiments using continuous light pulses, only one photocurrent trace was recorded from one cell for each condition. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio for computer approximations of the photocurrent traces under single-turnover conditions, six replicates recorded from the same cells were considered technical replicates and averaged for further analysis.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis of the patch clamp data was performed using Origin Pro 2016 software. The normal distribution of the data was not assumed. The non-parametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to compare the means. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but the sample sizes were similar as those reported in the previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Govorunova, Gou et al. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Morizumi, Kim et al. 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In the cortical neuron patch clamp experiments, fluorescently labelled or negative neurons were randomly selected from the densely labelled area of brain slices. The criteria for data exclusion were the same as in manual patch clamp recordings from HEK cells. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using ClampFit 10.7 (Molecular Devices) and Prism 10.3 (GraphPad). The multiple Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test with Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli’s corrections was used for evaluating the efficiency of action potential inhibition.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic> experiments, the EPG recordings were excluded from the analysis, if the worm moved out of the illuminated area during recording. No data was excluded in flash photolysis experiments.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study describes newly identified light-gated ion channel homologs (channelrhodopsins, ChRs) in several protist species, with a primary focus on the biophysical characterization of ChRs of ancyromonads. The authors employed a powerful combination of bioinformatics, manual and automated patch-clamp electrophysiology, absorption spectroscopy, and flash photolysis. Additionally, they evaluated the applicability of the newly discovered anion-conducting ChRs in cortical neurons of mouse brain slices and in living C. elegans worms. The evidence supporting most of the claims is <bold>compelling</bold>, and this work will be of interest to the microbial rhodopsin community and neuro- and cardioscientists utilizing optogenetics in their research.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work by Govorunova et al. identified three naturally blue-shifted channelrhodopsins (ChRs) from ancyromonads, namely AnsACR, FtACR, and NlCCR. The phylogenetic analysis places the ancyromonad ChRs in a distinct branch, highlighting their unique evolutionary origin and potential for novel applications in optogenetics. Further characterization revealed the spectral sensitivity, ionic selectivity, and kinetics of the newly discovered AnsACR, FtACR, and NlCCR. This study also offers valuable insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the function of these ChRs, including the roles of specific residues in the retinal-binding pocket. Finally, this study validated the functionality of these ChRs in both mouse brain slices (for AnsACR and FtACR) and in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans (for AnsACR), demonstrating the versatility of these tools across different experimental systems.</p>
<p>
In summary, this work provides a potentially valuable addition to the optogenetic toolkit by identifying and characterizing novel blue-shifted ChRs with unique properties.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study provides a thorough characterization of the biophysical properties of the ChRs' properties and demonstrated the versatility of these tools in different ex vivo and in vivo experimental systems. The authors also explored the potential of AnsACR for multiplexed optogenetics. Finally, the mutagenesis experiments revealed the roles of key residues in the photoactive site that can affect the spectral and kinetic properties of the channelrhodopsins.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The revised manuscript has addressed most of the previous major weaknesses.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Govorunova et al present three new anion opsins that have potential applications silencing neurons. They identify new opsins by scanning numerous databases for sequence homology to known opsins, focusing on anion opsins. The three opsin identified, are uncommonly fast, potent, and are able to silence neuronal activity. The authors characterize numerous parameters of the opsins and compare these opsins to the existing and widely used GtACR opsins.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper follows the tradition of the Spudich lab, presenting and rigorously characterizing potentially valuable opsins. Furthermore, they explore several mutations of the identified opsin that may make these opsins even more useful for the broader community. The opsins AnsACR and FtACR are particularly notable having extraordinarily fast onset kinetics that could have utility in many domains. Furthermore, the authors show AnsACR is useable in multiphoton experiments having a peak photocurrent in a commonly used wavelength. Overall, the author's detailed measurements and characterization make for an important resource - both presenting new opsins that may be important for future experiment, and providing characterizations to expand our understanding of opsin biophysics in general.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the novel ChRs identified in this work are spectrally blue-shifted, there still seems to be some spectral overlap with other optogenetic tools. The authors should provide more evidence to support the claim that they can be used for multiplex optogenetics and help potential end-users assess if they can be used together with other commonly applied ChRs. Additionally, further engineering or combination with other tools may be required to achieve truly orthogonal control in multiplexed experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To demonstrate the usefulness of ancyromonad ChRs for multiplex optogenetics as a proof of principle, we co-expressed AnsACR with the red-shifted cation-conducting ChR Chrimson and measured net photocurrent generated by this combination as a function of the wavelength. We found that it is hyperpolarizing in the blue region of the spectrum, and depolarizing at the red region. In the revision, we added a new panel (Figure 1D) showing these results and the following paragraph to the main text:</p>
<p>“To test the possibility of using AnsACR in multiplex optogenetics, we co-expressed it with the red-shifted CCR Chrimson (Klapoetke et al., 2014) fused to an EYFP tag in HEK293 cells. We measured the action spectrum of the net photocurrents with 4 mM Cl<sup>-</sup> in the pipette, matching the conditions in the neuronal cytoplasm (Doyon, Vinay et al. 2016). Figure 1D, black shows that the direction of photocurrents was hyperpolarizing upon illumination with λ&lt;500 nm and depolarizing at longer wavelengths. A shoulder near 520 nm revealed a FRET contribution from EYFP (Govorunova, Sineshchekov et al. 2020), which was also observed upon expression of the Chrimson construct alone (Figure 1D, red)”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the C. elegans experiments, partial recovery of pharyngeal pumping was observed after prolonged illumination, indicating potential adaptation. This suggests that the effectiveness of these ChRs may be limited by cellular adaptation mechanisms, which could be a drawback in long-term experiments. A thorough discussion of this challenge in the application of optogenetics tools would prove very valuable to the readership.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the following paragraph to the revised Discussion:</p>
<p>“One possible explanation of the partial recovery of pharyngeal pumping that we observed after 15-s illumination, even at the highest tested irradiance, is continued attenuation of photocurrent during prolonged illumination (desensitization). However, the rate of AnsACR desensitization (Figure 1 – figure supplement 4A and Figure 1 – figure supplement 5A) is much faster than the rate of the pumping recovery, reducing the likelihood that desensitization is driving this phenomenon. Another possible reason for the observed adaptation is an increase in the cytoplasmic Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration owing to AnsACR activity and hence a breakdown of the Cl<sup>-</sup> gradient on the neuronal membrane. The C. elegans pharynx is innervated by 20 neurons, 10 of which are cholinergic (Pereira, Kratsios et al. 2015). A pair of MC neurons is the most important for regulation of pharyngeal pumping, but other pharyngeal cholinergic neurons, including I1, M2, and M4, also play a role (Trojanowski, Padovan-Merhar et al. 2014). Moreover, the pharyngeal muscles generate autonomous contractions in the presence of acetylcholine tonically released from the pharyngeal neurons (Trojanowski, Raizen et al. 2016). Given this complexity, further elucidation of pharyngeal pumping adaptation mechanisms is beyond the scope of this study.”</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>First, while the authors frequently reference GtACR1, a well-used anion opsin, there is no side-by-side data comparing these new opsins to the existing state-of-the-art. Such comparisons are very useful to adopt new opsins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>GtACR1 exhibits the peak sensitivity at 515 nm and therefore is poorly suited for combination with red-shifted CCRs or fluorescent sensors, unlike blue-light-absorbing ancyromonad ACRs. Nevertheless, we conducted side-by-side comparison of ancyromonad ChRs, GtACR1 and GtACR2, the latter of which has the spectral maximum at 470 nm. The results are shown in the new Figures 1E and F, and the new multipanel Figure 1 – figure supplement 4 added in the revision. We also added the following text, describing these results, to the revised Results section:</p>
<p>“Figures 1E and F show the dependence of the peak photocurrent amplitude and reciprocal peak time, respectively, on the photon flux density for ancyromonad ChRs and GtACRs. The current amplitude saturated earlier than the time-to-peak for all tested ChRs. Figure 1 – figure supplement 4A-E shows normalized photocurrent traces recorded at different photon densities. Quantitation of desensitization at the end of 1-s illumination revealed a complex light dependence (Figure 1, Figure Supplement 4F). Figure 1 – figure supplement 5 shows normalized photocurrent traces recorded in response to a 5-s light pulse of the maximal available intensity and the magnitude of desensitization at its end.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Next, multiphoton optogenetics is a promising emerging field in neuroscience, and I appreciate that the authors began to evaluate this approach with these opsins. However, a few additional comparisons are needed to establish the user viability of this approach, principally the photocurrent evoked using the 2p process, for given power densities. Comparison across the presented opsins and GtACR1 would allow readers to asses if these opsins are meaningfully activated by 2P.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We carried out additional 2P experiments in ancyromonad ChRs, GtACR1 and GtACR2 and added their results to a new main-text Figure 6 and Figure 6 – figure supplement 1. We added the new section describing these results, “Two-photon excitation”, to the main text in the revision:</p>
<p>“To determine the 2P activation range of AnsACR, FtACR, and NlCCR, we conducted raster scanning using a conventional 2P laser, varying the excitation wavelength between 800 and 1,080 nm (Figure 6 – figure supplement 1). All three ChRs generated detectable photocurrents with action spectra showing maximal responses at ~925 nm for AnsACR, 945 nm for FtACR, and 890 nm for NlCCR (Figure 6A). These wavelengths fall within the excitation range of common Ti:Sapphire lasers, which are widely used in neuroscience laboratories and can be tuned between ~700 nm and 1,020-1,300 nm. To assess desensitization, cells expressing AnsACR, FtACR, or NlCCR were illuminated at the respective peak wavelength of each ChR at 15 mW for 5 seconds. GtACR1 and GtACR2, previously used in 2P experiments (Forli, Vecchia et al. 2018, Mardinly, Oldenburg et al. 2018), were included for comparison. The normalized photocurrent traces recorded under these conditions are shown in Figure 6B-F. The absolute amplitudes of 2P photocurrents at the peak time and at the end of illumination are shown in Figure 6G and H, respectively. All five tested variants exhibited comparable levels of desensitization at the end of illumination (Figure 6I).”</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study does not exhibit major methodological weaknesses. The primary limitation of the study is that it includes only a limited number of comparisons to known ChRs, which makes it difficult to assess whether these newly discovered tools offer significant advantages over currently available options.</p>

<p>We conducted side-by-side comparison of ancyromonad ChRs and GtACRs, wildly used for optical inhibition of neuronal activity. The results are shown in the new Figures 1E and F, and the new multipanel Figure 1 – figure supplement 4 and Figure 1 – figure supplement 5 added in the revision.

<p>Additionally, although the study aims to present ChRs suitable for multiplex optogenetics, the new ChRs were not tested in combination with other tools. A key requirement for multiplexed applications is not just spectral separation of the blue-shifted ChR from the red-shifted tool of interest but also sufficient sensitivity and potency under low blue-light conditions to avoid cross-activation of the respective red-shifted tool. Future work directly comparing these new ChRs with existing tools in optogenetic applications and further evaluating their multiplexing potential would help clarify their impact.</p>

<p>The reviewers suggest that direct comparison to GtACR1 is the most important step to make this work more useful to the community.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We followed the Reviewers’ recommendations and carried out side-by-side comparison of ancyromonad ChRs and GtACR1 as well as GtACR2 (Figure 1E and F, Figure 1 – figure supplement 4, Figure 1 – figure supplement 5, and Figure 6). Note, however, that GtACR1’s spectral maximum is at 515 nm, which makes it poorly suitable for blue light excitation. Also, ChRs are known to perform very differently in different cell types and upon expression of their genes in different vector backbones, so our results cannot be generalized for all experimental systems. Each ChR user needs to select the most appropriate tool for his/her purpose by testing several candidates in his/her own experimental setting.</p>

<p>(1) The figure legend for Figure 2D-I appears to be incomplete. Please provide a detailed explanation of the panels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revision, we have expanded the legend of Figure 2 to explain all individual panels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The meaning of the Vr shift (Y-axis in Figure 2H-I) should be clarified in the main text to aid reader understanding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revision, we added the phrase “which indicated higher relative permeability to NO<sub>3</sub> than to Cl<sup>-“</sup> to explain the meaning of the Vr shift upon replacement of Cl<sup>-</sup> with NO<sub>3</sub>-.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Adding statistical analysis for the peak and end photocurrent values in Figure 2D-F would strengthen the claim that there is minimal change in relative permeability during illumination.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revision, we added the V<sub>r</sub> values for the peak photocurrent to Figure 2H-I, which already contained the V<sub>r</sub> values for the end photocurrent, and carried out a statistical analysis of their comparison. The following sentence was added to the text in the revision:</p>
<p>“The V<sub>r</sub> values of the peak current and that at the end of illumination were not significantly different by the two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test (Fig. 2G), indicating no change in the relative permeability during illumination.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 4H and I seem out of place in Figure 4, as the title suggests a focus on wild-proteins and AnsACR mutants. The authors could consider moving these panels to Figure 3 for better alignment with the content.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted below, we changed the panel order in Figure 4 upon the Reviewer’s request. In particular, former Figure 4I is Figure 4C in the revision, and former Figure 4H is now panel C in Figure 3 – figure supplement 1 in the revision. We rearranged the corresponding section of the text (highlighted yellow in the manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The characterization section could be strengthened by including data on the pH sensitivity of FtACR, which is currently missing from the main figures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Upon the Reviewer’s request, we carried out pH titration of FtACR absorbance and added the results as Figure 4B in the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The logic in Figure 4A-G appears somewhat disjointed. For example, Figure 4A shows pH sensitivity for WT AnsACR and the G86E mutant, while Figure 4 B-D shifts to WT AnsACR and the D226N mutant, and Figure 4E returns to the G86E mutant. Reorganizing or clarifying the flow would improve readability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We followed the Reviewer’s advice and changed the panel order in Figure 4. In the revised version, the upper row (panels A-C) shows the pH titration data of the three WTs, the middle row (panels D-F) shows analysis of the AnsACR_D226N mutant, and the lower row (panels G-I) shows analysis of the AnsACR_G88E mutant. We also rearranged accordingly the description of these panels in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Figure 5A, &quot;NIACR&quot; should likely be corrected to &quot;NlCCR&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We corrected the typo in the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The statistical significance in Figure 6C and D is somewhat confusing. Clarifying which groups are being compared and using consistent symbols would improve interoperability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revision, we improved the figure panels and legend to clarify that the comparisons are between the dark and light stimulation groups within the same current injection.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) The authors pointed out that at rest or when a small negative current was injected, the neurons expressing Cl- permeable ChRs could generate a single action potential at the beginning of photostimulation, as has been reported before. The authors could help by further discussing if and how this phenomenon would affect the applicability of such tools.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We mentioned in the revised Discussion section that activation of ACRs in the axons could depolarize the axons and trigger synaptic transmission at the onset of light stimulation, and this undesired excitatory effect need to be taken into consideration when using ACRs.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Govorunova et al present three new anion opsins that have potential applications in silencing neurons. This paper follows the tradition of the Spudich lab, presenting and rigorously characterizing potentially valuable opsins. Furthermore, they explore several mutations of the identified opsin that may make these opsins even more useful for the broader community. In general, I feel positively about this manuscript. It presents new potentially useful opsins and provides characterization that would enable its use. I have a few recommendations below, mostly centered around side-by-side comparisons to existing opsins.</p>
<p>(1) My primary concern is that while there is a reference to GtACR1, a highly used opsin first described by this team, they do not present any of this data side by side.</p>
<p>When evaluating opsins to use, it is important to compare them to the existing state of the art. As a potential user, I need to know where these opsins differ. Citing other papers does not solve this as, even within the same lab, subtle methodological differences or data plotting decisions can obscure important differences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we explained in the response to the public comments, we carried out side-by-side comparison of ancyromonad ChRs and GtACRs as requested by the Reviewer. The results are shown in the new Figures 1E and F, and the new multipanel Figure 1 – figure supplement 4 and Figure 1 – figure supplement 5, added in the revision. However, we would like to emphasize a limited usefulness of such comparative analysis, as ChRs are known to perform very differently in different cell types and upon expression of their genes in different vector backbones, so our results cannot be generalized for all experimental systems. Each ChR user needs to select the most appropriate tool for his/her purpose by testing several candidates in his/her own experimental setting.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Multiphoton optogenetics is an emerging field of optogenetics, and it is admirable that the authors address it here. The authors should present more 2p characterization, so that it can be established if these new opsins are viable for use with 2P methods, the way GtACR1 is. The following would be very useful for 2P characterization:</p>
<p>Photocurrents for a given power density, compared to GtACR1 and GtACR2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The new Figure 6 (B-F) added in the revision shows photocurrent traces recorded from the three ancyromonad ChRs and  two GtACRs upon 2P excitation of a given power density.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comparing NICCR and FtACR's wavelength specificity and photocurrent. If these opsins are too weak to create reasonable 2P spectra, this difference should be discussed.</p>

<p>The new Figure 6A shows the 2P action spectra of all three ancyromonad ChRs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A Trace and calculated photocurrent kinetics to compare 1P and 2P. This need not be the flash-based absorption characterization of Figure 3, but a side-by-side photocurrent as in Figure 2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, photocurrent traces recorded from ancyromonad ChRs and GtACRs upon 2P excitation are shown in the new Figure 6 (B-F). However, direct comparison of the 2P data with the 1P data is not possible, as we used laser scanning illumination for the former and wild-field illumination for the latter.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Characterization of desensitization. As the authors mention, many opsins undergo desensitization, presenting the ratio of peak photocurrent vs that at multiple time points (probably up to a few seconds) would provide evidence for how effectively these constructs could be used in different scenarios.</p>
<p>We conducted a detailed analysis of desensitization under both 1P and 2P excitation. The new Figure 1 – figure supplement 4 and Figure 1 – figure supplement 5 show the data obtained under 1P excitation, and the new Figure 6 shows the data for 2P conditions.</p>
<p>I have to admit, that by the end of the paper, I was getting confused as to which of the three original constructs had which property, and how that was changing with each mutation. I would suggest that a table summarizing each opsin and mutation with its onset and offset kinetics, peak wavelength, photocurrent, and ion selectivity would greatly increase the ability to select and use opsins in the future.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revision, we added a table of the spectroscopic properties of all tested mutants as Supplementary File 2. This study did not aim to analyze other parameters listed by the Reviewer. We added the following sentence referring to this table to the main text:</p>
<p>“Supplementary File 2 contains the λ values of the half-maximal amplitude of the long-wavelength slope of the spectrum, which can be estimated more accurately from the action spectra than the λ of the maximum.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It may be out of the scope of this manuscript, but if a soma localization sequence can be shown to remove the 'axonal spiking' (as described in line 441), this would be a significant addition to the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our previous study (Messier et al., 2018, doi: 10.7554/eLife.38506) showed that a soma localization sequence can reduce, but not eliminate, the axonal spiking. We plan to test these new ACRs with the trafficking motifs in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>NICCR appears to have the best photocurrents of all tested opsins in this paper. It seems odd that it was omitted from the mouse cortical neurons experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have not included analysis of NlCCR behavior in neurons because we are preparing a separate manuscript on this ChR.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 6 would benefit from more gradation in the light powers used to silence and would benefit from comparison to GtACR. I suggest using a fixed current with a series of illumination intensities to see which of the three opsins (or GtACR) is most effective at silencing. At present, it looks binary, and a user cannot evaluate if any of these opsins would be better than what is already available.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revision, we added the data comparing the light sensitivity of AnsACR and FtACR with previously identified GtACR1 and GtACR2 (new Figure 1E and F) to help users compare these ACRs. Although they are less sensitive to light comparing to GtACR1 and GtACR2, they could still be activated by commercially available light sources if the expression levels are similar. Less sensitive ACRs may have less unwanted activation when using with other optogenetic tools.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggested Improvements to Experiments, Data, or Analyses:</p>
<p>(1) Line 25: &quot;significantly exceeding those by previously known tools&quot; and Line 408: &quot;NlCCR is the most blue-shifted among ancyromonad ChRs and generates larger photocurrents than the earlier known CCRs with a similar absorption maximum.&quot; As noted in the public review, this statement applies only to a very specific subgroup of ChRs with spectral maxima below 450 nm. If the goal was to claim that NlCCR is a superior tool among a broader range of blue-light-activated ChRs, direct comparisons with state-of-the-art ChRs such as ChR2 T159C (Berndt et al., 2011), CatCh (Kleinlogel et al., 2014), CoChR (Klapoetke et al., 2014), CoChR-3M (Ganjawala et al., 2019), or XXM 2.0 (Ding et al., 2022) would be beneficial. If the goal was to demonstrate superiority among tools with spectra below 450 nm, I suggest explicitly stating this in the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer correctly inferred that we emphasized the superiority of NlCCR among tools with similar spectral maxima, not all blue-light-activated ChRs available for neuronal photoexcitation, most of which exhibit absorption maxima at longer wavelengths. To clarify this, we added “with similar spectral maxima” to the sentence in the original Line 25. The sentence in Line 408 already contains this clarification: “with a similar absorption maximum”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Lines 111-113: &quot;The absorption spectra of the purified proteins were slightly blue-shifted from the respective photocurrent action spectra (Figure 1D), likely due to the presence of non-electrogenic cis-retinal-bound forms.&quot; I would be skeptical of this statement. The spectral shifts in NlCCR and AnsACR are small and may fall within the range of experimental error. The shift in FtACR is more apparent; however, if two forms coexist in purified protein, this should be reflected as two Gaussian peaks in the absorption spectrum (or at least as a broader total peak reflecting two states with close maxima and similar populations). On the contrary, the action spectrum appears to have two peaks, one potentially below 465 nm. Generally, neither spectrum appears significantly broader than a typical microbial rhodopsin spectrum. This question could be clarified by quantifying the widths of the absorption and action spectra or by overlaying them on the same axis. In my opinion, the two spectra seem very similar, and just appearance of the &quot;bump&quot; in the action spectum shifts the apparent maximum of the action spectrum to the red. If there were two states, then they should both be electrogenic, and the slight difference in spectra might be explained by something else (e.g. by a slight difference in the quantum yields of the two states).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the Reviewer suggested, in the revision we added a new figure (Figure 1 – figure supplement 2), showing the overlay of the absorption and action spectra of each ancyromonad ChR. This figure shows that the absorption spectra are wider than the action spectra (especially in AnsACR and FtACR), which confirms our interpretation (contribution of the non-electrogenic blue-shifted cis-retinal-bound forms to the absorption spectrum). Note that the presence of such forms explaining a blue shift of the absorption spectrum has been experimentally verified in HcKCR1 (doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2023.08.009; 10.1038/s41467-025-56491-9). Therefore, we revised the text as follows:</p>
<p>“The absorption spectra of the purified proteins (Figure 1C) were slightly blue-shifted from the respective photocurrent action spectra (Figure 1 – figure supplement 3), likely due to the presence of non-electrogenic cis-retinal-bound forms. The presence of such forms, explaining the discrepancy between the absorption and the action spectra, was verified by HPLC in KCRs (Tajima et al. 2023, Morizumi et al., 2025).”</p>

<p>(3) Lines 135-136: &quot;The SyncroPatch enables unbiased estimation of the photocurrent amplitude because the cells are drawn into the wells without considering their tag fluorescence.&quot; While SyncroPatch does allow unbiased selection of patched cells, it does not account for the fraction of transfected cells. Without a method to exclude non-transfected cells, which are always present in transient transfections, the comparison of photocurrents may be affected by the proportion of untransfected cells, which could vary between constructs. To clarify whether the statistically significant difference in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test could indicate that the fraction of transfected cells after 48-72h differs between constructs, I suggest analyzing only transfected cells or reporting fractions of transfected cells by each construct.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer correctly states that non-transfected cells are always present in transiently transfected cell populations. However, his/her suggestion to “exclude non-transfected cells” is not feasible in the absence of a criterion for such exclusion. As it is evident from our data, transient transfection results in a continuum of the amplitude values, and it is not possible to distinguish a small photocurrent from no photocurrent, considering the noise level. We would like, however, to emphasize that not excluding any cells provides an estimate of the overall potency of each ChR variant, which depends on both the fraction of transfected cells and their photocurrents. This approach mimics the conditions of in vivo experiments, when non-expressing cells also cannot be excluded.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 176: &quot;AnsACR and FtACR photocurrents exhibited biphasic rise.&quot; The fastest characteristic time is very close to the typical resolution of a patch-clamp experiment (RC = 50 μs for a 10 pF cell with a 5 MΩ series resistance). Thus, I am skeptical that the faster time constant of the biphasic opening represents a protein-specific characteristic time. It may not be fully resolved by patch-clamp and could simply result from low-pass filtering of a specific cell. I suggest clarifying this for the reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer is right that the patch clamp setup acts as a lowpass filter. Earlier, we directly measured its time resolution (~15 μs) by recording the ultrafast (occurring on the ps time scale) charge movements related to the trans-cis isomerization (doi: 10.1111/php.12558). However, the lowpass filter of the setup can only slow the entire signal, but cannot lead to the appearance of a separate kinetic component (i.e. a monophasic process cannot become biphasic). Therefore, we believe that the biphasic photocurrent rise reflects biphasic channel opening rather than a measurement artifact. Two phases in the channel opening have also been detected in GtACR1 (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1513602112) and CrChR2 (10.1073/pnas.1818707116).</p>

<p>(5) Line 516: &quot;The forward LED current was 900 mA.&quot; It would be more informative to report the light intensity rather than the forward current, as many readers may not be familiar with the specific light output of the used LED modules at this forward current.</p>

<p>We have added the light intensity value in the revision:</p>
<p>“The forward LED current was 900 mA (which corresponded to the irradiance of ~2 mW mm<sup>-2</sup>)…”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Lines 402-403: &quot;The NlCCR ... contains a neutral residue in the counterion position (Asp85 in BR), which is typical of all ACRs. Yet, NlCCR does not conduct anions, instead showing permeability to Na+.&quot; This is not atypical for CCRs and has been demonstrated in previous works of the authors (CtCCR in Govorunova et al. 2021, ChvCCR1 in Govorunova et al. 2022). What is unique is the absence of negatively charged residues in TM2, as noted later in the current study. However, the absence of negatively charged residues in TM2 appears to be rare for ACRs as well. Not as a strong point of criticism, but to enhance clarity, I suggest analyzing the frequency of carboxylate residues in TM2 of ACRs to determine whether the unique finding is relevant to ion selectivity or to another property.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer is correct that some CCRs lack a carboxylate residue in the D85 position, so this feature alone cannot be considered as a differentiating criterion. However, the complete absence of glutamates in TM2 is not rare in ACRs and is found, for example, in HfACR1 and CarACR2. We have discussed this issue in our earlier review (doi: 10.3389/fncel.2021.800313) and do not think that repeating this discussion in this manuscript is appropriate.</p>

<p>(4) Line 216-219: &quot;Acidification increased the amplitude of the fast current ~10-fold (Figure 4F) and shifted its Vr ~100 mV (Figure 3 - figure supplement 1D), as expected of passive proton transport. The number of charges transferred during the fast peak current was &gt;2,000 times smaller than during the channel opening, from which we concluded that the fast current reflects the movement of the RSB proton.&quot; The claim about passive transport of the RSB proton should be clarified, as typically, passive transport is not limited to exactly one proton per photocycle, and the authors observe the increase in the fast photocurrents upon acidification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out the confusing character of our description. To clarify the matter, we added a new photocurrent trace to Figure 4I in the revision recorded from AnsACR_G86E at 0 mV and pH 7.4. We have rewritten the corresponding section of Results as follows:</p>
<p>“Its rise and decay τ corresponded to the rise and decay τ of the fast positive current recorded from AnsACR_G86E at 0 mV and neutral pH, superimposed on the fast negative current reflecting the chromophore isomerization (Figure 4I, upper black trace). We interpret this positive current as an intramolecular proton transfer to the mutagenetically introduced primary acceptor (Glu86), which was suppressed by negative voltage (Figure 4I, lower black trace). Acidification increased the amplitude of the fast negative current ~10-fold (Figure 4I, black arrow) and shifted its V<sub>r</sub> ~100 mV to more depolarized values (Figure 4 – figure supplement 2A). This can be explained by passive inward movement of the RSB proton along the large electrochemical gradient.”</p>
