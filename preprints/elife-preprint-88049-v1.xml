<title>Summary</title>
<p>Triglycerides (TG) in adipocytes provide the major stores of metabolic energy in the body. Optimal amounts of TG stores are desirable as insufficient capacity to store TG, as in lipodystrophy, or exceeding the capacity for storage, as in obesity, results in metabolic disease. We hypothesized that mice lacking TG storage in adipocytes would result in excess TG storage in cell types other than adipocytes and severe lipotoxicity accompanied by metabolic disease. To test this hypothesis, we selectively deleted both TG-synthesis enzymes, DGAT1 and DGAT2, in adipocytes (ADGAT DKO mice). As expected with depleted energy stores, ADGAT DKO mice did not tolerate fasting well and, with prolonged fasting, entered torpor. However, ADGAT DKO mice were unexpectedly otherwise metabolically healthy and did not accumulate TGs ectopically or develop associated metabolic perturbations, even when fed a high-fat diet. The favorable metabolic phenotype resulted from activation of energy expenditure, in part via BAT activation and beiging of white adipose tissue. Thus, the ADGAT DKO mice provide a fascinating new model to study the coupling of metabolic energy storage to energy expenditure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Because energy sources are not always available from the environment, many metazoan organisms have evolved the ability to store large amounts of metabolic energy as triglycerides (TG) in adipose tissue. TG is particularly optimal for energy storage because it serves as stores of highly reduced carbon and does not require water for its storage. In cells, such as adipocytes, TGs are stored in organelles called lipid droplets (LDs). In adipocytes of mammals, TGs are stored in a unilocular adipocyte that fills the majority of the aqueous cytoplasm. Although TGs can also be found in LDs in other cell types (i.e., myocytes, hepatocytes, enterocytes), adipocytes represent by far the major energy depots in mammals. Abundant evidence from many studies suggests that there is an optimal range for adipocyte TG storage in an organism. Exceeding the capacity to store TG in adipocytes occurs in obesity, and is often accompanied by deposition of TG in other tissues and metabolic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Conversely, insufficient TG storage such as occurs in lipodystrophy is usually associated with adipocyte endocrine deficiency and similar metabolic derangements.</p>
<p>Here, we sought to test the requirement for TG storage in adipocytes in murine physiology at baseline and in response to high-fat feeding. We generated mice lacking both known TG synthesis enzymes, DGAT1 and DGAT2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, in adipocytes. We expected to generate a mouse model similar to those of classic lipodystrophy due to defects of TG storage in adipose tissue. Moreover, we hypothesized that these mice would have accumulation of TGs in other tissues, such as the liver or skeletal muscle, resulting in lipotoxicity and metabolic derangements, such as insulin resistance or fatty liver disease. To our surprise, we found the opposite result. We report here that selectively impairing TG storage in adipocytes leads to a unique murine model in which depletion of energy stores is not accompanied by metabolic derangements but instead results in protection from adverse metabolic effects, even with high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, due to activation of energy dissipation pathways.</p>

<title>ADGAT DKO mice have reduced fat mass and triglycerides in adipose tissue</title>
<p>To generate mice lacking TGs in adipose tissue (ADGAT DKO), we crossed adipose tissue-specific <italic>Dgat1</italic> knockout mice (Cre-transgene expressed under control of the mouse adiponectin promoter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>) with <italic>Dgat2</italic> flox mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Validation of gene knockouts showed mRNA levels of <italic>Dgat1</italic> were decreased by â¼95% and <italic>Dgat2</italic> by â¼90% in both inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref></bold></italic>). Western blot analysis showed that DGAT1 and DGAT2 proteins were absent in iWAT and BAT (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref></bold></italic>). <italic>In vitro</italic> DGAT activity in lysates of adipose tissue of ADGAT DKO mice was decreased by â¼80% in iWAT and â¼95% in BAT (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref></bold></italic>). Similarly, <italic>in vitro</italic> DGAT activity in isolated adipocytes of iWAT was decreased by â¼80% (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref></bold></italic>).</p>
<p>ADGAT DKO mice appeared healthy (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref></italic></bold>) and yielded offspring with the predicted Mendelian ratio of genotypes. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging showed that fat depots were decreased in chow-fed ADGAT DKO mice (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></italic></bold>). Body weights of 12-week-old chow-fed control mice (<italic>Dgat1</italic> and <italic>Dgat2</italic> double-floxed mice, D1D2 flox) and ADGAT DKO mice were similar (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></italic></bold>), but dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) analysis revealed that the fat mass was decreased by â¼60% in ADGAT DKO mice. The reduction in fat mass was persistent: DEXA analysis of 1-year-old ADGAT DKO mice showed that the fat mass was reduced by â¼75% and that lean mass was increased by â¼15% (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref></bold></italic>). Visceral white adipose tissue depots (gonadal, mesenteric, pericardial, and perirenal fat depots) were markedly atrophied in ADGAT DKO mice (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>,</italic></bold> <italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref></bold></italic>). Gonadal adipose tissue (gWAT) and subcutaneous inguinal WAT (iWAT) in ADGAT DKO mice appeared distinctly âbeigeâ in color (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></italic></bold>, <italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref></bold></italic>). In ADGAT DKO mice, iWAT and BAT were denser, as demonstrated by their sinking in a liquid fixative (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>The interscapular BAT depot in ADGAT DKO mice appeared darker brown than that in control mice (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref></bold></italic>). TGs and lipid droplets (LD) were undetectable in BAT of ADGAT DKO mice (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B,C</xref></bold></italic>). Positron emission tomography-computed tomography scanning using <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>-fluoro-deoxyglucose (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>-FDG-PET/CT) showed that, after injection of Î²-3-adrenoceptor agonist (CL 316,243), BAT of chow-fed ADGAT DKO mice took up more glucose than BAT of control mice (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref></bold></italic>), presumably to fuel thermogenesis. In agreement with increased glucose uptake, glycogen levels in BAT of ADGAT DKO mice were increased in all conditions except 4Â°C cold exposure (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E</xref></bold></italic>). The latter condition may reflect increased glycogen requirements in BAT of ADGAT DKO mice to maintain thermogenesis. This phenotype of DGAT-deficient BAT exhibiting increased glucose uptake and glycogen stores as an alternate fuel is consistent with our previous findings of BAT-specific knockout of both DGAT enzymes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>ADGAT DKO mice gradually activate an alternative mechanism to synthesize and store triglycerides</title>
<p>DGAT1 and DGAT2 appear to account for most of TG synthesis in mice. Newborn mice lacking both DGAT enzymes have &gt;95% reduction in whole body TGs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, and adipocytes derived from fibroblasts lacking both enzymes fail to accumulate TGs or LDs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In agreement with this, histological analysis of WAT of 8-week-old ADGAT DKO mice showed fewer and much smaller LDs than control WAT (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></italic></bold>). However, by age 15 weeks, ADGAT DKO mice exhibited more LDs in iWAT than 8-week-old ADGAT DKO mice, suggesting that they activate alternate pathways to accumulate neutral lipids (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref></bold></italic>). This finding was more prominent in iWAT than in BAT. The neutral lipid that accumulated was BODIPY-positive (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></italic></bold>), and TLC analysis of adipose tissue lipids from 15-week-old ADGAT DKO mice revealed the lipids to be TGs (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref></italic></bold>). Feeding ADGAT DKO mice a HFD increased levels of TGs by â¼twofold in iWAT at age 15 weeks, but the TG content of iWAT remained â¼70% less than control mice (<italic><bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref></bold></italic>). The mass reduction of iWAT fat pads was accounted for predominantly by a decrease in TG mass per fat pad (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref></italic></bold>); protein levels per fat pad were similar to controls, and no other neutral lipids were detected. Lipid analyses of iWAT by mass spectrometry revealed that TG levels were reduced by â¼80% across all detected TG species (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C</xref></italic></bold>). In contrast, several phospholipids were substantially increased in iWAT of ADGAT DKO mice (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref></italic></bold>), which may have contributed to the residual fat mass of the iWAT fat pads. Enzyme assays revealed that adipose tissues and isolated white adipocytes from 15-week-old chow-diet-fed ADGAT DKO mice had detectable (â¼20% of normal) DGAT activity in iWAT that was not inhibited by DGAT1-or DGAT2-specific inhibitors (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C,D</xref></bold></italic>). These data suggest that deletion of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in WAT induces a DGAT activity from an alternative enzyme, possibly from other candidates in the DGAT2 gene family <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Adipose tissue TG stores are required to maintain activity and body temperature during fasting</title>
<p>Because ADGAT DKO mice have severely decreased TG stores, we expected that they would not tolerate fasting well. After 14 hours of fasting, 15-week-old ADGAT DKO mice had lost 10% of body weight (vs. control mice) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic></bold>) and entered a torpor-like state with decreased physical activity and huddling together (<italic><bold>Figure 2âfigure supplement movie 1</bold></italic>). Fasting of ADGAT DKO mice also resulted in hypothermia, with body temperatures dropping to â¼30Â°C (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></italic></bold>), a phenotype exacerbated by cold exposure (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E,F</xref></italic></bold>). This differs from the phenotype of BAT DGAT DKO mice, which maintain body temperature during fasting <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, presumably because energy stores in WAT are present. Fasting levels of ketone bodies were â¼10% lower, and glucose levels were moderately higher in ADGAT DKO mice than control mice (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref></italic></bold>), possibly reflecting their greater dependency on glucose as fuel. Thus, as expected, deletion of TG stores in adipose tissue resulted in reduced fuel stores that dramatically altered the physiological responses of the mice to fasting or cold.</p>

<title>Endocrine function of WAT is maintained in ADGAT DKO mice</title>
<p>Lipodystrophy is a metabolic disease characterized by altered fat distribution, often with severely reduced amounts of adipose tissue and TG storage. Classically, lipodystrophy in humans and mice is accompanied by reduced levels of adipocyte-derived endocrine hormones and often results in insulin resistance and diabetes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. ADGAT DKO mice share an impaired capacity to store TG in adipose tissue with lipodystrophy models. However, despite this, in these mice adiponectin and leptin mRNA levels were moderately increased in iWAT (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic></bold>), whereas the mRNA levels of <italic>Plin1</italic> were unchanged (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic></bold>), and plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin were normal and 40% decreased, respectively (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></italic></bold>). When normalized to adipose tissue weight, leptin levels were similar to control mice (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></italic></bold>). Glucose levels in ADGAT DKO mice fasted for 4 h were slightly lower (169 Â± 16 mg/dl vs. 144 Â± 14 mg/dl, respectively, p&lt;0.01) than in control mice, and insulin levels were not different (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></italic></bold>). Analysis of plasma metabolites showed a â¼30% reduction in non-esterified fatty acids, a â¼15% reduction in glycerol (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></italic></bold>), and a â¼50% reduction in ketones in chow-diet-fed ADGAT DKO mice (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></italic></bold>). Glucose and insulin tolerances were similar in chow-diet-fed ADGAT DKO and control mice (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G,H</xref></italic></bold>). Thus, despite the impairment of fat storage in adipose tissue, ADGAT DKO mice had substantial levels of adipocyte-derived endocrine hormones and apparently normal glucose metabolism.</p>

<p>Lipodystrophy is also typically accompanied by ectopic lipid deposition, particularly manifesting as hepatic steatosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In contrast, livers of ADGAT DKO mice appeared normal (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref></italic></bold>), with moderately increased weights in 15-week-old chow-diet-fed mice (1.7 Â± 0.2 g vs. 2.1 Â± 0.3 g, p&lt;0.05). TG levels were only modestly increased (â¼10%) in livers of ADGAT DKO mice and were unchanged in skeletal muscle (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref></italic></bold>). Thus, ADGAT DKO mice, with markedly reduced TG storage in adipocytes, were remarkably metabolically healthy, with essentially none of the metabolic derangements typically associated with lipodystrophy.</p>

<title>ADGAT DKO mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and associated metabolic derangements</title>
<p>We next tested whether the metabolically heathy phenotype of ADGAT DKO mice would persist with feeding of a western-type high-fat diet (HFD), which normally causes obesity and insulin resistance. We hypothesized that fatty acids from the HFD would not be stored in adipocytes of ADGAT DKO mice and as a consequence ectopically accumulate, resulting in tissue lipotoxicity. However, after feeding ADGAT DKO mice a HFD for 12 weeks, they appeared healthy and remained relatively lean, with both male and female mice gaining â¼40% less body weight than control D1D2 flox mice (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4AâC</xref></italic></bold>). The reduction in body weight was due to a â¼70% reduction in fat mass (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></italic></bold>). Food intake during HFD feeding was similar (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></italic></bold>), implying ADGAT DKO mice have increased energy expenditure. This was validated by indirect calorimetry, where ADGAT DKO mice exhibited increased energy expenditure that was particularly prominent during night-time, when the mice were eating (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></italic></bold>). The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was lower in ADGAT DKO mice during HFD feeding (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></italic></bold>), consistent with increased fat oxidation.</p>

<p>We also examined metabolic parameters in the HFD-fed ADGAT DKO mice. Plasma glucose levels were slightly lower in ADGAT DKO, and insulin levels were not different (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B,C</xref></bold></italic>). ADGAT DKO mice were protected from HFD-induced glucose intolerance (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></italic></bold>). The insulin response was similar in ADGAT DKO and control mice, although the ADGAT DKO mice basal levels of glucose were reduced (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref></italic></bold>). Liver weights and hepatic TG levels were markedly increased with HFD in both ADGAT DKO mice and controls and were â¼20% and â¼10% higher in ADGAT DKO mice, respectively (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref></italic></bold>). Hepatic cholesterol levels were similar (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref></italic></bold>). HFD-induced activation of ER-stress response in the livers was similar to control mice (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref></bold></italic>). Thus, surprisingly, despite not being able to robustly store TGs in adipocytes, ADGAT DKO mice were resistant to most effects of an HFD, and our studies indicate that they activate compensatory mechanisms of energy expenditure that increase fat oxidation.</p>

<title>ADGAT DKO mice activate energy dissipation mechanisms, including adipocyte beiging in WAT</title>
<p>We next investigated the mechanisms for improved metabolic health in ADGAT DKO mice. Browning or beiging of adipose tissue is associated with improved metabolic health in mice and humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and the âbeigeâ appearance in iWAT and gWAT depots of ADGAT DKO mice (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,E</xref></italic></bold>) suggested that beiging adaptations may be present. Histological examination showed almost all adipocytes in both iWAT and gWAT contained multi-locular LDs (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,C</xref></italic></bold>). mRNA levels of signature genes of adipocyte beiging, such as <italic>Ucp1</italic> (â¼600-fold), <italic>CideA</italic> (â¼20-fold), <italic>PparÎ±</italic> (â¼10-fold), and <italic>Pgc1Î±</italic> (â¼sixfold), were markedly increased in iWAT and gWAT of room temperature housed chow-fed ADGAT DKO mice (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B,D</xref></italic></bold>). Fatty acid levels were decreased; intermediates of glycolysis and Krebs cycle were enriched in both iWAT and BAT of ADGAT DKO mice, consistent with increased glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref></bold></italic>). Protein levels of UCP1 and respiratory complex proteins were also markedly greater in iWAT of room-temperature-housed chow-fed ADGAT DKO mice than controls and were even further increased under HFD conditions (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></italic></bold>). Beiging of adipocytes in iWAT appeared independent of ambient temperature and was also present in ADGAT DKO mice after 6 weeks of thermoneutral housing (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref></italic></bold>), and blood glucose levels were moderately lower in thermoneutral housed male and female mice (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref></italic></bold>). Beiging appeared to be non-cell-autonomous, as the changes found in beige fat were largely absent in cells differentiated from pre-adipocytes, with the exception of a twofold increase of <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA levels (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2AâD</xref></bold></italic>), suggesting that beiging in ADGAT DKO mice is activated in part through the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Hormones, such as FGF21, also can activate beiging, either via the SNS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> or in a paracrine manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report a novel mouse model with impaired TG synthesis in adipocytes. The resultant defect in TG stores had both expected and surprising effects on murine physiology. First, as expected, ADGAT DKO mice did not tolerate fasting well. At room temperature, fasted ADGAT DKO mice entered a torpor-like state, characterized by decreased ambulation and a drop in body temperature. Torpor is a physiological state that enables conservation of metabolic energy and the signals to induce this state are poorly understood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The phenotype of ADGAT DKO mice suggests that depletion of adipocyte TG stores is sufficient to induce energy conservation and is somehow sensed.</p>
<p>A surprising feature of this mouse model is the apparent metabolic health, despite the reduced capacity to store lipids in the adipose tissue. Typically, loss of white adipose tissue (WAT) leads to a condition known as lipodystrophy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Lipodystrophy patients nearly always present with many metabolic derangements, including ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis), hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance or diabetes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. A characteristic feature of lipodystrophy is the decrease in levels of adipose tissue-derived hormones, such as leptin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and many derangements of lipodystrophies are corrected by leptin therapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the lipodystrophic ADGAT DKO mice with marked reductions in fat storage were metabolically healthy and did not develop metabolic derangements, such as diabetes or hepatic steatosis, even when fed an HFD. The metabolic health of the ADGAT DKO mice likely is due to their intact ability to make adipose tissue and to maintain adipose tissue endocrine function. These findings are consistent with previous data showing that cultured adipocytes differentiate normally in the absence of TG storage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Adipose tissue of ADGAT DKO mice maintained the ability to synthesize and secrete adipose-derived hormones, such as leptin, which is crucially absent in typical lipodystrophy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Leptin levels often correlate with adiposity and TG stores <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, but ADGAT DKO mice exhibit a dissociation of TG stores with leptin expression, thereby showing that these parameters appear not to be causally related. Instead, leptin levels may be better correlated with other adipose properties, such as the number of adipocytes, as reflected in the observed correlation of leptin with adipose tissue mass.</p>
<p>Our studies revealed that, in response to the compromised ability to store TG in white and brown adipose tissue, mice activate pathways of energy expenditure, including the generation of beige adipocytes and activation of BAT. Aspects of this phenotype were present even at thermoneutral conditions. The mechanisms underlying the activation of energy expenditure and beiging in ADGAT-DKO mice are presently unclear, but likely involve SNS stimulation. The lack of fatty acids in adipocytes may result in other available fuels (fatty acids and glucose) being routed to the BAT and beige adipocytes to maintain body temperature. One possible mechanism for the beiging and increased energy expenditure is that the ADGAT DKO mice secrete a factor (or factors) that activates the SNS and beiging pathway. Although currently such a factor remains to be identified, this model is reminiscent of global DGAT1 knockout mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, which exhibit increased energy expenditure, enhanced glucose metabolism, protection from diet-induced obesity, and increased leptin sensitivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. For global DGAT1 knockout mice, fat transplant studies suggested the adipose tissue is the source of such factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Hormones that activate beiging, such as FGF21, are also testable candidate factors that may contribute to the ADGAT DKO phenotype. Many of the beneficial metabolic effects that we found in ADGAT DKO mice, including increased energy expenditure, increased glucose uptake by BAT, and torpor and browning, are found in murine models with increased levels of FGF21 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. However, an endocrine effect of FGF21 seems unlikely in these mice due to similar levels of the hormone in plasma of HFD-fed mice. We note, however, that a paracrine effect is not excluded.</p>
<p>In summary, ADGAT DKO mice represent an intriguing model in which a marked reduction in the ability to store TG in adipocytes triggers organismal pathways of energy dissipation. This suggests that exceeding the capacity to store energy in adipocytes is somehow sensed and triggers thermogenesis in adipose tissue. This phenotype likely requires an intact adipocyte endocrine system, which was found in ADGAT DKO mice but if often deficient in other models of lipodystrophy. The exact mechanism for how a TG storage defect triggers energy dissipation is currently unclear, but unraveling of this mechanism could lead to new strategies for treating or reducing obesity.</p>

Lipids were extracted by Folch method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, briefly, 6 mL of ice-cold chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v) and 1.5 mL of water were added to the samples, and tubes were vortexed thoroughly to mix the samples homogenously with a polar and non-polar solvent. SPLAH mix internal standards were spiked in before the extraction. The organic phase of each sample was normalized by total soluble protein amounts and measured by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, 23225, Waltham, MA). After vortexing, samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 1100 rpm at 4Â°C to separate the organic and inorganic phases. Using a sterile glass pipette, the lower organic phase was transferred into a new glass tube, taking care to avoid the intermediate layer of cellular debris and precipitated proteins. The samples were dried under nitrogen flow until the solvents were completely dried. Samples were resuspended in 250 Î¼L of chloroform: methanol 2:1 and stored in â80 until mass spectrometer (MS) analysis. Lipids were separated using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with tandem MS. Briefly, UHPLC analysis was performed on a C30 reverse-phase column (Thermo Acclaim C30, 2.1 x 250 mm, 3 Î¼m operated at 55Â° C; Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC system and a QExactive orbitrap MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a heated electrospray ionization probe. 5 Î¼L of each sample was analyzed separately, using positive and negative ionization modes. Mobile phase contained 60:40 water:acetonitrile (v:v), 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of 90:10 2-propanol/acetonitrile, also including 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid. MS spectra of lipids were acquired in full-scan/data-dependent MS2 mode. For the full-scan acquisition, the resolution was set to 70,000, the AGC target was 1e6, the maximum injection time was 50 msec, and the scan range was m/z = 133.4â2000. For data-dependent MS2, the top 10 ions in each full scan were isolated with a 1.0 Da window, fragmented at a stepped normalized collision energy of 15, 25, and 35 units, and analyzed at a resolution of 17,500 with an AGC target of 2e5 and a maximum injection time of 100 msec. Peak identification and data analysis were carried out using Lipid Search software version 4.1 SP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Metabolomic Analysis</title>
<p>BAT and iWAT was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground at cryogenic temperature with a cyromill (Retsch, Newtown, PA). The tissue was extracted with â20Â°C 40: 40: 20 methanol: acetonitrile: water at a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Samples were vigorously vortexed and centrifuged at 4 Â°C at 16,000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to LC-MS vials for analysis. Chromatographic separation was performed using XBridge BEH Amide XP Column (2.5 Âµm, 2.1 mm Ã 150 mm) with associated guard column (2.5 Âµm, 2.1 mm X 5 mm) (Waters, Milford, MA). The mobile phase A was 95% water and 5% acetonitrile, containing 10 mM ammonium hydroxide and 10 mM ammonium acetate. The mobile phase B was 80% acetonitrile and 20% water, with 10 mM ammonium hydroxide and 10 mM ammonium acetate. The linear elution gradient was: 0 â¼ 3 min, 100% B; 3.2 â¼ 6.2 min, 90% B; 6.5. â¼ 10.5 min, 80% B; 10.7 â¼ 13.5 min, 70% B; 13.7 â¼ 16 min, 45% B; and 16.5 â¼ 22 min, 100% B. The flow rate was 0.3 mL/ min. The autosampler was maintained at 4Â°C. The injection volume was 5 ÂµL, and needle wash was performed between samples using 40: 40: 20 methanol: acetonitrile: water. The MS used was Q Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA), and scanned from 70 to 1000 <italic>m/z</italic> with switching polarity. The resolution was 120,000. Metabolites were identified based on accurate mass and retention time using an in-house library, and the software used was EI-Maven (Elucidata, Cambridge, MA). Data was analyzed using R software (version 4.2.0). The ion intensity of each sample was first normalized to the corresponding sample protein content. Differentially abundant metabolites were analyzed with the limma R/Bioconductor package, and the multiple comparisons were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (adjusted <italic>p</italic> value; q value). The volcano plots were generated using the ggplot and ggrepel packages.</p>

<p>This study introduces a <bold>valuable</bold> paradigm in the filed of adipose biology field: blocking triglyceride storage in adipose tissue does not lead to lipodystrophy and impaired glucose homeostasis but instead improves metabolic health. The evidence supporting these claims are <bold>convincing</bold>, with the authors providing a comprehensive metabolic analysis.

<p>The present study examined the physiological mechanisms through which impaired TG storage capacity in adipose tissues affects systemic energy homeostasis in mice. To accomplish this, the authors deleted DGAT1 and DGAT2, crucial enzymes for TG synthesis, in an adipocyte-specific manner. The authors found that ADGAT DKO mice substantially lost the adipose tissues and developed hypothermia when fasted; however, surprisingly, ADGAT KO mice were metabolically healthy on a high-fat diet. The authors found that it was accompanied by elevated energy expenditure, enhanced glucose uptake by the BAT, and enhanced browning of white adipose tissues. This unique animal model provided exciting opportunities to identify new mechanisms to maintain systemic energy homeostasis even in a compromised energy storage capacity. Overall, the data are compelling and well support the conclusion of this paper. The manuscript is clearly written.</p>

<p>Here, Chitraju et al have studied the phenotype of mice with an adipocyte-specific deletion of the diglycerol acyltransferases DGAT1 and DGAT2, the two enzymes catalyzing the last step in triglyceride biosynthesis. These mice display reduced WAT TG stores but contrary to their expectations, the TG loss in WAT is not complete and the mice are resistant to a high-fat diet intervention and display a metabolically healthier profile compared to control littermates. The mechanisms underlying this are not entirely clear, but the double knockout (DKO) animals have increased EE and a lower RQ suggesting that enhanced FA oxidation and WAT &quot;browning&quot; may be involved. Moreover, both adiponectin and leptin are expressed in WAT and are detectable in circulation. The authors propose that &quot;the capacity to store energy in adipocytes is somehow sensed and triggers thermogenesis in adipose tissue. This phenotype likely requires an intact adipocyte endocrine system....&quot; Overall, I find this to be an interesting notion.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors sought to test the hypothesis that blocking triglyceride storage in adipose tissue by knockout of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in adipocytes would lead to ectopic lipid deposition, lipodystrophy, and impaired glucose homeostasis. Surprisingly, the authors found the opposite result, with DGAT1/2 DKO in adipocytes leading to increased energy expenditure, minimal ectopic lipid deposition, and improved glucose homeostasis with HFD feeding. These metabolic improvements were largely attributed to increased beiging of the white fat and increased brown adipose tissue activity. This study provides an interesting new paradigm whereby impairing fat storage, the major function of adipose tissue, does not lead to severe metabolic disease, but rather improves it. The authors provide a comprehensive assessment of the metabolism of these DKO mice under chow and HFD conditions, which support their claims. The study lacks in mechanistic insight, which would strengthen the study, but does not detract from the authors' major conclusions.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well-supported, but some aspects should be clarified and extended.</p>
<p>1. The authors claim the beiging of WAT of ADGAT DKO mice is partially through the SNS; however, housing these mice at thermoneutrality did not block the beiging, which seems to negate that claim. Is there evidence of increased cAMP/PKA activation in the adipose tissues of ADGAT DKO to support the premise that the beiging is activated by the SNS, even at thermoneutrality? Alternatively, if the authors block beta-adrenergic receptors with antagonists, such as propranolol, does this block the beiging?</p>
<p>2. It's been shown that autocrine FGF21 signaling is sufficient to promote beiging of iWAT (PMID 34192547). The authors show Fgf21 mRNA is increased in iWAT of chow-fed ADGAT DKO mice. Is Fgf21 also increased in iWAT of HFD-fed mice? This and measurement of local FGF21 secretion by adipocytes would strengthen this study.</p>
<p>3. The primary adipocytes in Figure S6A do not appear to have any depletion in TG stores, suggesting this may not be an appropriate model to study the cell autonomous effects of ADGAT DKO on beiging. The authors should use DGAT inhibitors instead to corroborate or investigate this question.</p>
<p>4. Multiple studies have shown the importance of lipolysis for the activation of brown and beige thermogenic programs (PMID 35803907, 34048700) and can be potentiated by HFD feeding (PMID 34048700). In the absence of DGAT activity in ADGAT DKO mice, it seems plausible that free fatty acids could be elevated, especially in the context of HFD. Are free fatty acids elevated in the adipose tissues, which could promote thermogenic gene expression?</p>
<p>5. The lack of ectopic lipid deposition in the ADGAT DKO mice is striking, especially under HFD conditions. Can the increased energy expenditure fully account for the difference in whole body fat accumulation between Control and DKO mice or have the mice activated other energy disposal mechanisms? Please discuss or include measurement of fat excretion in the feces to strengthen this study.</p>
