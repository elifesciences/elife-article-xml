<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Mitochondria-mediated cell death is critically regulated by bioactive lipids derived from sphingolipid metabolism. The lipid aldehyde trans-2-hexadecenal (t-2-hex) induces mitochondrial dysfunction from yeast to humans. Here we apply unbiased transcriptomic, functional genomics and chemoproteomic approaches in the yeast model to uncover the principal mechanisms and biological targets underlying this lipid-induced mitochondrial inhibition. We find that loss of Hfd1 fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase function efficiently sensitizes cells for t-2-hex inhibition and apoptotic cell death. Excess of t-2-hex causes a profound transcriptomic response with characteristic hallmarks of impaired mitochondrial protein import like activation of mitochondrial and cytosolic chaperones or proteasomal function and severe repression of translation. We confirm that t-2-hex stress induces rapid accumulation of mitochondrial pre-proteins and protein aggregates and subsequent activation of Hsf1- and Rpn4-dependent gene expression. By saturated transposon mutagenesis we find that t-2-hex tolerance requires an efficient heat shock response and specific mitochondrial and ER functions and that mutations in ribosome, protein and amino acid biogenesis are beneficial upon t-2-hex stress. We further show that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of protein translation causes t-2-hex resistance indicating that loss of proteostasis is the predominant consequence of the pro-apoptotic lipid. Several TOM subunits, including the central Tom40 channel, are lipidated by t-2-hex <italic>in vitro</italic> and mutation of accessory subunits Tom20 or Tom70 confers t-2-hex tolerance. Moreover, the Hfd1 gene dose determines the strength of t-2-hex mediated inhibition of mitochondrial protein import and Hfd1 co-purifies with Tom70. Our results indicate that transport of mitochondrial precursor proteins through the outer mitochondrial membrane is sensitively inhibited by the pro-apoptotic lipid and thus represents a hotspot for pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mitochondria are universal and essential organelles, which beyond fundamental functions in energy metabolism, the biogenesis of Fe/S clusters and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, are the central regulators of the most common form of programmed cell death found in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bock and Tait, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chipuk et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, mitochondrial function and dysfunction critically establish cell survival or deterioration during aging, neurodegeneration and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Area-Gomez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Porporato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Son and Lee, 2021</xref>). In this process of intrinsic apoptosis, cellular stress triggers pro-death signals, which converge at the organelle and induce the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane (MOMP). As a consequence, the release of several soluble mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from the intermembrane space into the cytosol executes programmed cell death via caspase-dependent and –independent routes. Because MOMP is the earliest irreversible death trigger, its misregulation is causally linked to many diseases and a promising target for therapeutic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jeng et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, the mitochondria-mediated death decision needs to be strictly controlled. In higher eukaryotes, it is known that the entry into the death program depends on the functional interplay of different members of the BCL-2 protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jeng et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, BCL-2 protein BAX can transform under stress conditions from a latent cytosolic form to the pro-apoptotic oligomeric form, which initiates the perforation of the outer mitochondrial membrane and commit the cell to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Walensky and Gavathiotis, 2011</xref>). One important induction mechanism of mitochondrial cell death is triggered by lipids derived from sphingolipid metabolism at the endoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondria devoid of ER membranes are resistant to pro-apoptotic inhibition, and specific lipid species alone, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate or trans-2-hexadecenal (t-2-hex), efficiently activate Bax-driven MOMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chipuk et al., 2012</xref>). The pro-apoptotic function of externally added t-2-hex has been generally confirmed in cultures from yeast to mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amaegberi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Manzanares-Estreder et al., 2017</xref>). One explicit pro-apoptotic mechanism of t- 2-hex has been recently discovered consisting in the direct lipidation and subsequent activation of Bax at C126 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cohen et al., 2020</xref>). However, t-2-hex covalently and specifically modifies hundreds of different human proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jarugumilli et al., 2018</xref>), which motivated our present study to identify biologically important t-2-hex targets in an exhaustive manner.</p>
<p>99% of the mitochondrial proteins are synthesized at cytosolic ribosomes and thus have to be imported into the organelle mostly post-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Pfanner et al., 2019</xref>). This large variety of precursor proteins needs to pass through the mitochondrial membrane(s), sent to the correct mitochondrial subcompartment, be correctly folded and eventually assembled into protein complexes. Mitochondrial protein import is a proteostatic challenge for the cell and recent research has revealed that multiple quality control mechanisms exist to avoid the accumulation of non-imported or aggregated precursor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Song et al., 2021</xref>). The multisubunit TOM complex (translocase of the outer membrane) is the entry channel for the vast majority of mitochondrial precursors. The β-barrel Tom40 protein forms the actual protein-transporting pore at the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hill et al., 1998</xref>). The majority of the mitochondrial pre-proteins made in the cytosol has to be guided and maintained in an unfolded, import-competent state, which critically requires the function of cytosolic chaperones, such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Young et al., 2003</xref>). This is important for cell homeostasis as prematurely folded pre-proteins cannot pass through and eventually clog the TOM complex, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and triggers a strong stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boos et al., 2019</xref>). Cellular rescue pathways, which prevent clogging of the TOM complex, have been recently discovered in yeast. The mitochondrial protein translocation-associated degradation pathway (mito TAD) continuously monitors protein import at the TOM complex upon normal growth conditions and removes stalled pre-proteins with the help of the ubiquitin binding protein Ubx2 and the AAA protein unfoldase Cdc48 by facilitating their proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mårtensson et al., 2019</xref>). Whenever mitochondrial protein import is diminished by either mutation of translocase subunits, overexpression of clogging-prone pre-proteins or a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the mitochondrial compromised protein import response (mitoCPR) is activated. Upon prolonged mitochondrial import stress, the stress-induced Cis1 protein recruits the Msp1 AAA ATPase at the TOM complex to remove arrested precursor proteins by proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Weidberg and Amon, 2018</xref>). In situations when these internal rescue systems are overwhelmed, the accumulation of non-imported mitochondrial precursor proteins in the cytosol poses a serious threat to cellular proteostasis and causes a strong proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>). Under these conditions, the cell responds with a massive transcriptional remodeling, which involves heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) and Rpn4 in order to induce the expression of cytosolic chaperones and the ubiquitin proteasome system, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boos et al., 2019</xref>). The efficiency of mitochondrial protein import is of central importance for general cytosolic protein folding and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boos et al., 2020</xref>). It has been very recently demonstrated that the toxic aggregation of polyQ, amyloid β and α-synuclein proteins relevant for neurodegenerative and aging phenotypes is dependent on the efficiency of mitochondrial protein import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nowicka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schlagowski et al., 2021</xref>). Here we demonstrate that mitochondrial protein import is inhibited by the naturally occurring pro-apoptotic sphingolipid degradation intermediate t-2-hex, the accumulation of which leads to a massive proteostatic response in the cytosol to prevent general protein aggregation. Our results connect pro-apoptotic lipid function with protein misfolding and aggregation via a block in mitochondrial protein import.</p>

<title>The stress-regulated fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase Hfd1 is the major detoxifier of pro-apoptotic t-2-hex</title>
<p>Intracellular production of the pro-apoptotic lipid t-2-hex occurs in eukaryotic cells via the evolutionarily conserved sphingolipid degradation pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In human cells, t-2-hex causes mitochondrial dysfunction by directly stimulating Bax oligomerization at the outer mitochondrial membrane. In yeast, however, t-2-hex efficiently interferes with mitochondrial function and cell growth in a Bax independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Manzanares-Estreder et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we wanted to identify novel lipid-mediated apoptotic mechanisms in the yeast model. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the degradation of sphingosine to palmitic acid occurs through enzymatic steps, which seem to be transcriptionally activated upon cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Manzanares-Estreder et al., 2017</xref>). The fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase Hfd1 acts as a potential direct detoxifier by oxidizing t-2- hex. We analyzed the regulation of <italic>HFD1</italic> by cytotoxic stresses with time-elapsed luciferase assays <italic>in vivo</italic>. We applied different treatments including NaCl for the induction of osmotic stress, menadione for the induction of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Flattery-O’Brien et al., 1993</xref>) and acetic acid for the induction of pro-apoptotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chaves et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, <italic>HFD1</italic> expression was fast, robustly, and transiently induced by the three types of stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The sensitivity of the observed activation was comparable to that of a generic stress-inducible gene, <italic>GRE2</italic>, except for oxidative stress, where <italic>HFD1</italic> showed a less sensitive response (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggested that the yeast sphingolipid degradation pathway is generally induced by diverse stresses and that increased Hfd1 levels might be necessary to reduce toxic t-2- hex levels under all these conditions. We next asked whether increased t-2-hex levels itself triggered at all a transcriptional stress response in yeast cells. External addition of the bioactive lipid indeed caused a dose-dependent activation of the <italic>HFD1</italic> and <italic>GRE2</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Of note, in contrast to the transient stimulation of gene expression caused by “conventional” abiotic stresses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), t-2-hex overload activated gene expression in a much more sustained manner. This suggested that the lipid caused intracellular damage, which builds up slowly and affects cell function over a prolonged time. We tested whether the amount of Hfd1 enzyme was critical for the extent of t-2- hex inflicted damage. We compared how the sensitivity to the lipid changed upon absent or constitutively high Hfd1 activity. <italic>hfd1Δ</italic> cells exhibited a very pronounced growth delay upon t-2-hex treatment, while constitutively Hfd1 overexpressing cells gained robust growth upon the same conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These results confirmed that <italic>HFD1</italic> gene dose and enzyme activity were critical determinants for the tolerance to the pro-apoptotic lipid. Finally, we found that the loss of Hfd1 function greatly enhanced the adaptive activation of gene expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>hfd1</italic> mutants proliferated less efficiently upon pro-apoptotic stress conditions, while cells with constitutive <italic>HFD1</italic> were slightly resistant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). These data suggest that the growth arrest by pro-apoptotic t-2-hex is modulated by the efficiency of internal t-2-hex detoxification, which depends on the Hfd1 enzyme levels. <italic>hfd1Δ</italic> cells are highly sensitized to t-2-hex toxicity exhibiting a several fold enhanced response, a fact that will be exploited next to discover the complete transcriptomic response to the pro-apoptotic lipid.</p>

<title>The transcriptomic response to t-2-hex reveals global features of proteostatic imbalance</title>
<p>Our results indicated that cells lacking Hfd1 activity remain for many hours in a non-proliferative state when challenged with a t-2-hex overload. In this period of time, a strong regulation of gene expression occurs, presumably in order to prepare defense mechanisms against the toxic effects of the lipid. We were interested in capturing as many aspects as possible of this adaptive response and determined the transcriptomic changes upon heavy t-2-hex overload in <italic>hfd1Δ</italic> cells by RNA-seq (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that adaptation to the pro-apoptotic lipid involved the profound remodeling of the yeast transcriptome. The expression of approximately 30% of the transcriptome was more than 3 fold up- or down-regulated upon t-2-hex stress (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Very strong (&gt; 10 fold) activation was observed for a remarkably high number of protein encoding genes (263), which were preferentially distributed in categories such as “stress-related enzyme function”, “mitochondrial function”, “transport function”, or “chaperones”. The most repressed gene functions fell into the categories “ribosome and translation”, “pheromone response and mating”, “nucleotide biosynthesis”, or “cell cycle”. Next, genes up-regulated (&gt;2 log<sub>2</sub>FC) or down-regulated (&lt;-2 log<sub>2</sub>FC) by t-2-hex were selected and subjected to GO category enrichment analysis (up-regulated, Supplemental Table 1; down-regulated, Supplemental Table 2). We found that “Mitochondrial organization” was the most numerous GO group activated by t-2-hex, while it was “Ribosomal subunit biogenesis” for t-2-hex repression. We therefore analyzed the most strongly t-2-hex induced genes encoding mitochondrial proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Remarkably, <italic>CIS1</italic> showed an extraordinarily high induction (&gt; 250 fold) and thus represented the most inducible gene with a known mitochondrial function. Cis1 is the central protein of the MitoCPR pathway, which is specifically induced upon and protects from mitochondrial protein import stress, together with the Msp1 AAA-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Weidberg and Amon, 2018</xref>). <italic>MSP1</italic> expression, although more moderately, is also significantly induced upon t-2-hex stress. These data suggested that mitochondrial protein import might be impaired by the action of the pro-apoptotic lipid. Accordingly, we found the expression of a large group of mitochondrial chaperones to be significantly activated upon t-2-hex exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We compared our t-2-hex transcriptomic response with the previously described specific response to mitochondrial protein import block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Weidberg and Amon, 2018</xref>), taking into account only robustly (&gt; 3 fold) induced genes. We found that 69% of all genes induced by mitochondrial import stress were also positively affected by t-2-hex stress (Supplemental Table 3). The number of coinciding genes increased to 85%, when we exclusively compared mitochondrial functions in both datasets, indicating that the response to the bioactive lipid included a specific adaptation to a failure in the mitochondrial protein import.</p>

<p>The accumulation of non-imported mitochondrial proteins triggers a global transcriptional proteostatic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boos et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore investigated whether the t-2-hex response contained general features of this proteostatic adaptation. Strikingly, the expression of many cytosolic chaperone systems of the Hsp70, Hsp90, Hsp40 and other groups was highly activated by t-2-hex overload (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), with some chaperone genes showing extraordinary induction levels of 100 to 1000- fold. Notably, these chaperones are key players in the maintenance of proteostasis in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sontag et al., 2017</xref>). The expression of other chaperone systems, such as the Cct chaperonin or the prefoldin complexes, dedicated to the correct assembly of cytoskeleton components, is not significantly affected by the lipid aldehyde (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, we observed a remarkably homogeneous upregulation of the expression of all proteasomal subunits and strong activation of positive proteasomal regulators, such as the Rpn4 transcriptional activator of proteasomal genes or the Roq1, Fes1 and Tma17 stimulators of proteasomal assembly and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gowda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hanssum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Szoradi et al., 2018</xref>). In parallel, our RNA seq data revealed that t-2-hex repressed very strongly the expression of genes involved in the <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of ribosomes and proteins. This inhibition was observed in a highly consistent manner for specific RNA polymerase I and ribosomal subunits, as well as ribosome assembly factors, translational elongation factors and co-translationally acting chaperones (CLIPs). These data indicated that adaptation to the pro-apoptotic t-2-hex involved the activation of cytosolic chaperone systems and the proteasomal protein degradation machinery, as well as a general repression of translation, presumably as a consequence of imbalances in the cytosolic proteostasis caused by impaired mitochondrial protein import. This seems to be accompanied by a general arrest of cell cycle progression, because we observed strong repression of all cyclin genes and simultaneous up-regulation of the Xbp1 transcriptional master regulator of quiescence and cell cycle repression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to further characterize the gene groups, which were most significantly affected by t-2-hex stress, we examined the significantly up- and down-regulated promoters by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis for enriched transcription factor binding motifs. Within the t-2-hex induced promoter regions, we found a consistent and strong enrichment of binding sites for Hsf1 and Rpn4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In yeast, Hsf1 is the essential master regulator of proteostasis, controlling both basal and heat stress induced expression of many chaperone encoding genes by binding to heat shock promoter elements (HSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akerfelt et al., 2010</xref>). Rpn4 is a non-essential, general activator of proteasome genes, which binds to so called proteasome-associated control elements (PACE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Xie and Varshavsky, 2001</xref>). In turn, for the t-2-hex-repressed gene promoters, we identified the binding motifs for Stb3, Sfp1 and Rap1 as the most significantly enriched regulatory elements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Stb3 is a general activator of yeast ribosomal RNA genes and binds to the ribosomal RNA processing elements (RRPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liko et al., 2007</xref>). Sfp1 and Rap1 stimulate the expression of ribosomal protein and biogenesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lieb et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Marion et al., 2004</xref>). These data suggested that t-2-hex triggered the upregulation of chaperone and proteasome genes via the Hsf1 and Rpn4 transcriptional activators as the main adaptive response, while it massively repressed ribosomal biogenesis. We wanted to experimentally prove the prevalence of the heat shock and proteasomal response in the case of t-2-hex pro-apoptotic stimulation. To this end, we constructed a set of live cell reporters expressing destabilized luciferase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) under the control of transcription factor-specific response elements. We included binding sites for the Hsf1 and Rpn4 factors responding to protein aggregation and misfolding (HSE and PACE, respectively), the Pdr1/3 factors responding to xenobiotic stress (PDRE), and the Yap (Yap1 and other Yap TFs) and Sko1 factors responding to oxidative stress (AP-1 and CRE, respectively). We quantified the dose response of each reporter separately upon continuous increase of t-2-hex concentrations by time elapsed luciferase measurements. While all transcriptional reporters were robustly activated by the bioactive lipid, we found important differences in the sensitivity of the response for the different stress types. The Hsf1- and Rpn4-mediated transcriptional regulation showed the most sensitive activation upon t-2-hex stress with the lowest EC<sub>50</sub> values of 8 and 10μM, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). In contrast, the oxidation specific reporters were activated with significantly lower sensitivity. Importantly, very low t-2-hex concentrations (10μM) added from the outside to yeast wild type cells induced a significant up-regulation of PACE-dependent gene expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). These results confirmed that the transcriptional heat shock and proteasomal responses were preferentially triggered by the pro-apoptotic lipid at low μM concentrations, presumably because it caused an important problem of protein misfolding in the cell.</p>

<title>Pro-apoptotic t-2-hex causes cytosolic protein aggregation</title>
<p>t-2-hex is an α/β unsaturated lipid aldehyde. In mammalian cells, t-2-hex exerts specific apoptotic functions by nucleophilic addition and direct lipidation of sulfhydryl groups of cysteines in the Bax protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cohen et al., 2020</xref>). We wanted to discern the biological effects of t-2-hex in yeast by comparing it to the saturated t-2-hex analogue hexadecanal or t-2-hex-H<sub>2</sub>. It is specifically missing the ability to perform a nucleophilic addition and direct lipidation, therefore an absence of response upon exposure to the saturated compound indicates it is the lipidation that is responsible for the biological effects of t- 2-hex. We found that the lack of α/β unsaturation in the lipid aldehyde changed the spectrum and intensity of stress responsive transcriptional activation according to our live cell luciferase reporter assays. t-2-hex-H<sub>2</sub> mainly triggered an antioxidant and xenobiotic stress response, while it did not activate the protein misfolding response through Hsf1 or Rpn4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Interestingly, t-2-hex-H<sub>2</sub> caused a typical transient activation of stress gene expression as compared to the sustained response triggered by t-2-hex. Accordingly, we found that t-2-hex-H<sub>2</sub> caused a significantly shorter growth inhibition as compared to the unsaturated t-2-hex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). These data indicated that the pro-apoptotic t-2-hex induced a long lasting proteostatic emergency in the cell, possibly by direct lipidation of effector proteins. We next wanted to know whether t-2-hex was able to induce a general protein folding and aggregation problem in the cytosol. We monitored the intracellular distribution of the protein chaperone Hsp104, which was tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Hsp104, together with Hsp70, is a molecular disaggregase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</xref>) and can be used to visualize the cytosolic accumulation of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jacobson et al., 2017</xref>). The exposure to t-2-hex caused the appearance of multiple foci of protein aggregates in wild type cells, which increased in number over the first 6 hours of lipid stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Larger protein aggregates were observed in cells with impaired proteasome function (<italic>rpn4Δ</italic>), indicating that proteasomal activity was needed to clear lipid-induced protein aggregates in the cytosol. Interestingly we observed that t-2-hex-H<sub>2</sub> only caused a modest and transient protein aggregation within the first hour of exposition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, the massive protein aggregation, which mounts slowly over time, was specifically induced by the unsaturated t-2-hex molecule. Protein aggregation can occur at mature and/or newly synthesized proteins depending on the nature of the proteostatic stress. Accordingly, the application of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide revealed that Hsp104-foci are formed independently of protein synthesis in the case of heat stress, but their formation depends on protein synthesis in the case of arsenite stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jacobson et al., 2012</xref>). We found that cycloheximide pre-treatment of the cells completely abolished t-2-hex triggered protein aggregates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that the pro-apoptotic lipid caused misfolding of <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized proteins.</p>

<p>The ubiquitin proteasome system is a main controller of cellular proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dikic, 2017</xref>). Our transcriptomic data identified a uniform up-regulation of proteasomal subunits and activators upon t-2-hex stress. On the other hand, the proteasome cannot directly degrade aggregated proteins and instead is sensitively inhibited by aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bence et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Tyedmers et al., 2010</xref>). To further explore the function of the proteasome during pro-apoptotic lipid stress, we determined the regulation of proteasomal activity. We measured the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome in cell extracts using a synthetic substrate and found that t-2-hex, but not t-2-hex-H<sub>2</sub>, severely diminished the activity of the proteasome in wild type yeast cells to levels comparable with the proteasome deficient <italic>rpn4Δ</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). We next quantified the protein levels of the proteasomal subunit Rpn8 and confirmed a continuous up-regulation upon exposure to t-2-hex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), thus confirming the RNA seq results. These data might be explained by an inhibition of the proteasomal activity by extensive protein aggregates formed upon t-2-hex stress, which the cell might want to counteract by stimulated proteasomal gene expression. We further confirmed that <italic>rpn4Δ</italic> cells were hypersensitive to pro-apoptotic t-2-hex treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>

<title>Pro-apoptotic t-2-hex efficiently impairs mitochondrial protein import</title>
<p>Having established that pro-apoptotic lipid stress elicits a strong activation of mitochondrial protein import surveillance and general proteostatic rescue systems, we tested directly, whether t-2-hex impaired the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins. A defect in the import of mitochondrial proteins with a cleavable signal peptide can be visualized by the immunological detection of the larger, unprocessed pre-protein. We chose three different mitochondrial proteins for this survey: Aim17, whose expression is strongly activated upon t-2-hex stress (42 fold according our RNA Seq study), the Cox5a subunit of CIV at the inner mitochondrial membrane and the Ilv6 regulator of isoleucine and valine biosynthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. We found for all three proteins that t-2-hex treatment of wild type cells led to the rapid appearance of the corresponding pre-proteins, indicating an efficient block of mitochondrial protein import by the lipid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The Aim17 and Cox5a pre-proteins correlated with the same precursors induced by the general mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP. However, in the Ilv6 case, we observed the appearance of yet an additional precursor form specific for t-2-hex. The behavior of Aim17 is especially interesting, because this protein is massively made <italic>de novo</italic> in response to t-2-hex exposure. We observe that its pre-protein quickly accumulates to very high levels, which equal the abundance of the mature Aim17 protein. This strongly suggests that t-2-hex very efficiently blocks mitochondrial pre-protein transport and processing, and that most of the newly synthesized mitochondrial precursors are not correctly introduced into mitochondria upon pro-apoptotic lipid stress. We next confirmed that this inhibition was specific for the unsaturated t-2-hex form, as we did not detect precursor accumulation of four different mitochondrially imported proteins by the saturated t-2-hex-H<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). We additionally determined general mitochondrial fragmentation, which had been reported previously for t-2-hex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Manzanares-Estreder et al., 2017</xref>). Also in this case, we found that mitochondrial inhibition was specific for the unsaturated lipid aldehyde (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that mitochondrial fragmentation and inhibition of protein import depended on the protein lipidation capacity of t-2-hex.</p>

</fig>
<p>The observation that newly made Aim17 was not processed properly and accumulated in large amounts during the first hour of t-2-hex stress, prompted us to investigate the long-term effects of t-2-hex on proteostasis. For these studies, we initially selected two more highly inducible mitochondrial proteins apart from Aim17, the cytochrome c variant Cyc7 targeted to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the pyruvate carrier subunit Mpc3 targeted to the inner mitochondrial membrane. All proteins were visualized in yeast wild type cells, which were treated with t-2-hex for up to 6 hours. As expected, we found that the Aim17 pre-protein also accumulated at prolonged t-2-hex exposure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). However, we additionally were able to see a smear of aberrant, SDS resistant protein forms in the larger molecular weight range, which could be an indication of aggregated Aim17. Aberrant protein forms were also detected for Cyc7 and, in a very abundant manner, for Mpc3, which both lack a defined cleavable signal peptide. Although the expression of all three mitochondrial proteins was activated, the amount of the mature protein forms did not increase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). This suggested that the newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins never get properly incorporated in the organelle upon t-2-hex stress and instead remain in the cytoplasm, where they increasingly misfold and aggregate. Indeed, cycloheximide treatment completely abolished the formation of Mpc3 and Aim17 aggregates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating that t-2- hex only affects the proteostasis of <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized mitochondrial precursor proteins.</p>
<p>Clogging the mitochondrial import machinery has been shown to cause a generalized proteostatic problem in the cytoplasm, most likely by saturating the cellular chaperone system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore looked at other t-2-hex inducible proteins, which are not transported through the mitochondrial membranes, Cis1 and Tma10. The MitoCPR protein Cis1 is induced upon mitochondrial protein import stress and attaches to the outer mitochondrial transport complex without being imported. Tma10 is the most up-regulated protein upon t-2-hex stress according to our RNA-Seq analysis and localizes to the cytoplasm. For both proteins, we confirm a strong increase in abundance upon t-2-hex treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). More importantly, also Cis1 and Tma10 show an abundant aggregation when they are massively synthesized in the presence of the pro-apoptotic lipid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting that t-2-hex probably affects correct folding of a large number of newly synthesized mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins. We next tested how sensitively t-2-hex interfered with mitochondrial protein import by applying low lipid doses. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, Aim17 pre-protein accumulated by the external addition of just 10μM of t-2-hex. This inhibition was aggravated in a <italic>hfd1Δ</italic> mutant and alleviated by <italic>HFD1</italic> overexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). These data indicated that mitochondrial pre-protein accumulation was induced by physiological t-2-hex concentrations and that its extent was regulated by the activity of detoxifying enzymes such as Hfd1. Misfolded cytosolic proteins are rapidly marked by ubiquitination for their proteolytic degradation by the proteasome. We therefore tested whether t-2-hex overload increased overall protein ubiquitination. We performed anti-Ub western blot analyses in a time course of t-2-hex treatment in whole cell extracts. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>, t-2-hex induced general protein ubiquitination in a rapid and transient manner.</p>
<p>We next examined the inhibition of mitochondrial protein import by t-2-hex by flow cytometric GFP assays in live yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sirk et al., 2003</xref>). We compared the induced expression and maturation of GFP, either targeted to the cytosol or to the mitochondrial matrix (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>). We found that low t-2-hex doses (β5μM) significantly inhibited mitochondrial GFP (mt-GFP) activity as compared to cytosolic GFP in wild type cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>). This inhibition was not observed with the saturated t-2- hex-H<sub>2</sub>. We further examined whether t-2-hex could modulate mitochondrial protein import indirectly by interfering with the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Cytometric rhodamine123 assays revealed that t-2-hex did not alter ΔΨm in the range of concentrations which efficiently inhibited mt-GFP activity (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1C</xref>). We additionally tested whether the t-2-hex induced decrease in proteasome activity could indirectly reduce mitochondrial protein import. This was not the case, as <italic>rpn4</italic> mutant cells exhibited a normal mt-GFP activity (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1D</xref>). These data suggested that t-2-hex sensitively inhibited mitochondrial pre-protein import.</p>

<title>A functional genomics approach reveals pro- and anti-apoptotic gene functions in response to t-2-hex</title>
<p>In order to identify genetic determinants, which would modulate pro-apoptotic t-2-hex toxicity, we performed a saturated transposon mutagenesis screen (SATAY; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Michel et al., 2017</xref>)). We generated a yeast mutant library consisting of several millions of independent transposon insertion mutants in an <italic>hfd1Δ</italic> background (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The pooled library was then grown in the presence or absence of growth-limiting amounts of t-2-hex. The transposon insertion sites (TNs) were mapped along the entire yeast genome by massive sequencing. The total number of transposon reads or the number of different TNs per gene was then used as an indicator of the fitness of all mutants upon pro-apoptotic lipid stress conditions. In this scenario, under-represented genes (statistically lower number of TNs in a given gene in the t-2-hex versus the untreated library) have potentially anti-apoptotic functions against the bioactive lipid (Supplemental Table 4), while over-represented genes (statistically higher number of TNs in a given gene) have potentially pro-apoptotic functions supporting the toxicity of t-2-hex (Supplemental Table 5). We analyzed the potential anti-apoptotic SATAY hits with a log<sub>2</sub> &lt; −0.75 according to expected detoxification pathways (heat shock response, pleiotropic drug response), to their function in the ER (the intracellular site where t-2- hex is generated) or in mitochondria (the major t-2-hex target identified so far). As depicted in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, transposon mutations in the <italic>HSF1</italic> gene encoding heat shock factor are strongly counter-selected by t-2-hex stress. <italic>HSF1</italic> is essential in yeast, however, mutations in the Hsf1 C-terminal region are viable and reduce the activity of the transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 1993</xref>). Untreated cells accumulate TN insertions in this region, however, the Hsf1 C-terminus becomes essential upon t-2-hex treatment, thus demonstrating that the heat shock response is rate limiting during the cellular defense against the lipid. Additionally, the pleiotropic drug response (PDR) is identified here as an important layer of defense against t-2-hex. Both the dominant PDR transcriptional activator Pdr1 and the Snq2 PDR extrusion pump of the ABC type are among the gene functions, which are not allowed to accumulate TN insertions upon t- 2-hex overload. Furthermore, we identify several mitochondrial functions (<italic>FMP52</italic>, <italic>CYC3</italic>, <italic>HEM14</italic>, <italic>MRP7</italic>), which become important upon apoptotic lipid stress. They play essential functions in heme biosynthesis (Hem14) and cytochrome c maturation (Cyc3), or in mitochondrial protein synthesis (Mrp7). Fmp52, however, is a mitochondrial protein with unknown function. Of note, Fmp52 is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, which suggests a function in the enzymatic detoxification of t-2-hex additionally to Hfd1. We furthermore identify a group of ER- resident proteins as crucial for t-2-hex tolerance. Apart from the ER membrane proteins Agp2, Nnf2, Cwh43 and Spf1, we found two proteins, Eps1 and Usa1, specifically involved in the ER associated protein degradation pathway (ERAD) as important for t-2- hex tolerance.</p>

    <title>Functional genomics screen SATAY for the identification of pro- and anti-apoptotic functions upon t-2-hex stress.</title>
    <p>(A) Schematic outline of the SATAY experiment. <italic>hfd1Δ</italic> cells harboring the galactose inducible transposase (TPase) and a transposon (TN) disrupting the <italic>ADE2</italic> gene were grown in galactose-containing medium to induce transposition. TN generated mutant cells were inoculated in synthetic glucose medium lacking adenine in the presence or absence of 50μM t-2-hex, grown for several generations and harvested for DNA extraction and sequencing of transposon insertion sites (TNs). TNs are mapped to the genome to identify genes that become required for proliferation under t-2-hex stress conditions (red) or genes whose mutation is beneficial for t-2-hex tolerance (green).

<p>Unexpectedly, the SATAY screen revealed a large number of genes, which upon TN mutation, favored proliferation upon pro-apoptotic t-2-hex stress (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). A closer inspection of these gene functions with a log<sub>2</sub> &gt; 1.5 revealed that most of them belonged to the functional groups “Cytosolic ribosome and translation” and “Amino acid metabolism”. Related to cytosolic protein biosynthesis, we identified proteins involved in ribosomal RNA processing (<italic>DIM1</italic>, <italic>RIO2</italic>, <italic>ROK1</italic>, <italic>RRP3</italic>, <italic>RRP15</italic>, <italic>SRM1</italic>), ribosome biogenesis (<italic>MRT4</italic>, <italic>NOP8</italic>, <italic>BCP1</italic>, <italic>TMA23</italic>, <italic>UTP25</italic>), aa-tRNA synthesis (<italic>ALA1</italic>, <italic>CRS1</italic>, <italic>FRS1</italic>, <italic>ILS1</italic>, <italic>TRM9</italic>), pre-RNA processing (<italic>PRP5</italic>), translation (<italic>CDC123</italic>, <italic>NIP1</italic>, <italic>NAM7</italic>), and ribosomal protein subunits (<italic>RPL6A</italic>, <italic>RPS1A</italic> + 12 others). Related to amino acid metabolism, enzymes providing precursors for general amino acid biosynthesis (<italic>ARO10</italic>, <italic>DFR1</italic>, <italic>SHM2</italic>), as well as regulators and enzymes of the synthesis of specific amino acids (<italic>ARG7</italic>, <italic>ARG82</italic>, <italic>ASP1</italic>, <italic>GFA1</italic>, <italic>ILV3</italic>, <italic>LYS12</italic>, <italic>LYS14</italic>, <italic>ORT1</italic>, <italic>SER2</italic>) were identified in this group of potential pro-apoptotic functions. Taken together, these results suggested that an efficient heat shock and PDR response, as well as specific mitochondrial and ER functions were required, while a high rate of cytosolic protein biogenesis was detrimental, for the survival upon apoptotic lipid stress.</p>
<p>Indeed, we confirmed that loss of function of the PDR transcriptional activator Pdr1 caused a moderate, but consistent growth delay in the presence of t-2-hex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that deletion of mitochondrial Fmp52 function caused a severe sensitivity to t-2-hex exposure (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Fmp52 belongs structurally to the NAD- binding short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family and localizes to highly purified mitochondrial outer membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zahedi et al., 2006</xref>). This might suggest that Fmp52 participates in the enzymatic detoxification of t-2-hex in addition to Hfd1.</p>

<p>We next wanted to know whether a general connection existed between the <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis rate and the susceptibility to pro-apoptotic t-2-hex. As a first approach, we tested several deletion mutants in specific subunits of the small and large ribosomal subunits from the yeast knock out collection for their individual t-2-hex tolerance. As it is known that ribosomal subunit mutants have divergent effects on protein synthesis rates and rapidly accumulate compensatory mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Steffen et al., 2008</xref>), we included several mutant strains with diverse impact on overall growth rates in this study. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, the <italic>rps30b</italic> mutant had the greatest reduction in proliferation rate and showed the highest tolerance to t-2-hex. The <italic>rpl16a</italic> mutant with a minimal growth reduction was only slightly resistant to the apoptotic lipid, while other ribosomal subunit mutants (<italic>rps28a</italic>, <italic>rpl40a</italic>) with unaffected growth rates were t-2-hex sensitive comparable to the wild type. This indicated that the loss of particular ribosomal subunits was able to improve t-2-hex tolerance in cases where growth rate and presumably protein synthesis rates were decreased. We then tested this hypothesis directly by the application of the ribosomal inhibitor diazaborine (DAB), which specifically interferes with ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Pertschy et al., 2004</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, growth inhibitory DAB concentrations consistently made yeast cells more tolerant to t-2-hex, indicating that a slow cytosolic protein synthesis was beneficial to counteract the apoptotic lipid. Finally, we applied an independent intervention to slow down protein synthesis, which is the switch from glucose to galactose growth. Metabolic flux through the galactose pathway is reduced by &gt;30% as compared to glucose, which slows down cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ostergaard et al., 2000</xref>). We confirmed that galactose growth improved the resistance of yeast cells to t-2-hex inhibition, both in the wild type and the <italic>hfd1Δ</italic> background (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>We next compared the pro- and anti-apoptotic gene functions indicated by the SATAY assay with the previously generated RNAseq profiles. We found that anti-apoptotic functions such as heat shock factor, pleiotropic drug response and specific mitochondrial proteins showed consistently positive transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>, red), while the expression of the majority of pro-apoptotic functions involved in cytosolic protein synthesis and general amino acid metabolism was down-regulated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>, green).</p>

<title>Apoptotic lipid signaling via t-2-hex and its detoxification take place at the mitochondrial TOM complex</title>
<p>Having found that the pro-apoptotic lipid t-2-hex impaired mitochondrial protein import and caused a general proteostatic readjustment in the cell, we next wanted to know whether t-2-hex and its detoxifier Hfd1 target the mitochondrial pre-protein import machinery. The essential import pore at the outer mitochondrial membrane is formed by the TOM complex. The yeast core TOM complex contains the Tom40, Tom22, Tom5, Tom6 and Tom7 subunits, which associate with the Tom70 and Tom20 receptor proteins to form the functional translocase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Araiso et al., 2022</xref>). We first focused on the interaction of Hfd1 with the TOM complex. It had been previously shown that the Hfd1 lipid aldehyde dehydrogenase co-purified with Tom22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Opaliński et al., 2018</xref>) and Tom70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Burri et al., 2006</xref>) in high throughput studies. Additionally Hfd1 seems to co-localize with a Tom70 containing complex in a recent high-resolution complexome profiling study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Schulte et al., 2023</xref>). We therefore studied the interaction of Hfd1 with Tom22 and Tom70 in targeted pulldown experiments from whole cell extracts. As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, we found that Hfd1 co-purified weakly with Tom22, however, it was more efficiently pulled down with Tom70. These data suggested that at least a portion of Hfd1 is physically associated with the TOM mitochondrial protein import machine with Tom70 as a potential interactor. These data indicated that t-2-hex might act directly at the TOM complex. We therefore proceeded with biochemical assays to elucidate a possible direct modification of TOM subunits by the apoptotic lipid.</p>

<p>We performed <italic>in vitro</italic> chemoproteomic experiments using the clickable t-2-hex analogue t-2-hex-alkyne on enriched intact mitochondrial fractions of yeast wild type cells, applying both high (100μM) and low (10μM) lipid doses (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). After alkylation of mitochondrial proteins and the subsequent addition of biotin, we identified the t-2-hex targets by mass spectrometry. We found that several subunits of the TOM complex, including the Tom40 core channel and the accessory Tom70 and Tom71 proteins, were significantly enriched in the t-2-hex treated samples (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>, Supplemental Table 6). We additionally identified with less intensity the small Tom5 and Tom7 subunits, which lack cysteine residues and thus are most likely pulled down in these assays because of their physical association with truly lipidated Tom subunits. Very interestingly, we additionally identified several essential subunits of the Tim23 inner mitochondrial membrane protein import complex as t-2-hex targets (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). This indicates that apart from the TOM complex, the pro-apoptotic lipid directly modifies subunits of the Tim23 protein translocator. Of the core TOM complex from yeast, only the Tom40 channel contains cysteine residues and interestingly has been identified as a t-2-hex target in a chemoproteomic screen on whole human cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jarugumilli et al., 2018</xref>). We next tested for direct lipidation of Tom40 in mitochondrial fractions of yeast cells with physiological levels of HA-tagged Tom40. Low micromolar concentrations (25μM) of the t-2-hex probe were sufficient to specifically modify Tom40 in these lipidation assays (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>), showing that the Tom40 protein is a direct lipidation target <italic>in vitro</italic>. Competition assays with free thiol groups confirmed that t-2- hex likely adds to cysteine residues in the Tom40 channel (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). We next addressed the question whether individual TOM subunits were important to mediate t-2-hex toxicity. We first characterized a mutant, which expressed a cysteine-free version of Tom40 (Tom40CFREE), thus impairing cysteine lipidation at Tom40. As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, the Tom40CREE strain showed undistinguishable tolerance to t-2-hex as compared to wild type, suggesting that Tom40 lipidation alone did not explain the growth arrest of the pro-apoptotic lipid. We therefore extended our study to other, non-essential accessory TOM subunits Tom20 and Tom70. In this case (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>), we observed a significant increase in t-2-hex tolerance caused by the deletion of either <italic>TOM20</italic> or <italic>TOM70</italic>. We further confirmed that a <italic>tom20</italic> mutant strain accumulated less Aim17 pre-protein upon t-2-hex stress (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). These results identify the mitochondrial protein import machinery as a physiologically important target for the pro-apoptotic lipid t-2-hex, which is mediated by several Tom subunits and not just the Tom40 import channel. In context with all previous results of our study, we propose a model where pro-apoptotic lipid signaling and cell proteostasis are functionally linked via mitochondrial protein import (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Upon excess of t-2-hex or lack of Hfd1 function, lipidation of the TOM complex and subsequent failure of mitochondrial precursor import causes a general proteostatic imbalance. If this imbalance persists it can engage the cell in apoptotic cell death.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Maintaining proteostasis is essential for cell survival and is tightly regulated to prevent the accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins. Proteostatic imbalance is known to be a key driver for the induction of apoptotic cell death and cellular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kaushik and Cuervo, 2015</xref>). Although it has been well established that many extracellular stresses trigger the entry into apoptotic self-destruction programs and many executors of these apoptotic programs have been revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kist and Vucic, 2021</xref>), it remains largely unknown how intracellular signals perturb mitochondrial function and proteostasis in order to push the balance towards a regulated cell death. Our present work reveals a novel pro-apoptotic mechanism, which consists of the direct inhibition of mitochondrial protein import by bioactive lipids generated from the sphingolipid degradation pathway, thereby directly linking pro-apoptotic lipids with mitochondrial and general protein homeostasis and aggregation.</p>
<p>It was a groundbreaking discovery that bioactive lipids such as t-2-hex in ER microsomes were in great part necessary and responsible for MOMP and mitochondrial cell death in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chipuk et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Renault and Chipuk, 2013</xref>). The recent finding that t-2-hex is a direct pro-apoptotic modulator of a single cysteine residue in human Bax provided an explicit molecular mechanism of MOMP induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cohen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jarugumilli et al., 2018</xref>). However, t-2-hex belongs to a group of lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs), which are capable of directly modifying free cysteines in target proteins in a non-enzymatic manner and have been suggested to act as endogenous messengers to modulate signal transduction pathways within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fritz and Petersen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sousa et al., 2017</xref>). This implies that t-2-hex has potentially many protein targets in the cell, which has been further demonstrated by <italic>in vitro</italic> chemoproteomic experiments in human cells, revealing several hundred alkylation targets including Tom40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jarugumilli et al., 2018</xref>). It remains challenging and important to identify the biologically relevant protein targets of LDEs and especially t-2-hex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Our combination of <italic>in vitro</italic> lipidation assays and functional genomics surveys identifies the mitochondrial outer membrane protein transport machine as a selective target for apoptotic signaling mediated through t-2- hex. Moreover, the lipid-mediated inhibition of the mitochondrial TOM complex, here detailed in the yeast model, provides a general apoptotic mechanism, which might have been established early in evolution, given the conservation of the core subunits Tom40 or Tom70 from fungi to man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mani et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Mitochondrial protein import might be a strategic target for apoptotic signaling, because the import of more than thousand cytoplasmatically synthesized pre-proteins into mitochondria is a major traffic hub in eukaryotic cells, which is under exquisite surveillance to avoid clogging of the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Song et al., 2021</xref>). The aberrant accumulation of mitochondrial precursor proteins in the cytosol leads to proteotoxic stress, which negatively affects cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nargund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>). This phenomenon has been studied by the use of specific import mutants or the overexpression of artificial clogger proteins to induce a specific protein traffic jam at mitochondria. Indeed, the chronic impairment of mitochondrial protein import leads to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Coyne et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>). Cells have developed a coordinated and multifaceted response network to counteract the accumulation of these precursor proteins. This response network is known as the mitoprotein-induced stress response and includes several pathways that were previously described independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boos et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2019</xref>). Here we show that this mitochondrial stress response is highly and specifically induced by a natural lipid compound, t-2-hex, providing evidence and a molecular mechanism of an endogenous modulation of mitochondrial protein import. As a consequence, the accumulated precursor proteins trigger the heat shock response, which increases the production of chaperones and enhances the proteolytic capacity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Weidberg and Amon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>). This cellular response to mitochondrial dysfunction is also known as the unfolded protein response activated by mistargeting of proteins (UPRam). The heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 plays a central role in this response, as it is activated not only by heat stress but also during the transition from fermentation to respiration and in the presence of mitochondrial import impairment, all of which result in the accumulation of mitochondrial precursors in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Groh et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hahn and Thiele, 2004</xref>). The sequestration of cytosolic chaperones by these precursor proteins leads to the release and activation of Hsf1. This activation triggers a cascade of gene expressions, including the transcription factor Rpn4, which induces the expression of proteasomal genes to enhance UPS capacity. According to our results, lipidation of the TOM complex at various subunits upon pro-apoptotic conditions blocks the mitochondrial protein entry gate and triggers the heat shock response and proteasomal activity to counteract mislocalized protein accumulation in the cytoplasm. Several TOM subunits are lipidated by low t-2-hex doses <italic>in vitro</italic>, lack of function mutants in specific TOM subunits are resistant to t-2-hex, and t-2-hex inhibits specifically mitochondrial GFP activity and not its cytosolic counterpart independently of ΔΨm changes, which indicates that the pro-apoptotic lipid directly inhibits mitochondrial protein import. It will be interesting to link specific t-2-hex lipidation events at the TOM complex with the apoptotic inhibition of mitochondrial protein import and cell death. Additionally, t-2-hex could directly act on mitochondrial pre-proteins or cytosolic chaperones rendering the precursors aggregation prone. However, this seems to be less likely as the mitochondrial and cytosolic GFP used in the import studies here only differ in the small and cysteine-free Pre Su9 pre-peptide.</p>
<p>The external addition of the pro-apoptotic lipid aldehyde t-2-hex is an efficient experimental model to study the induction of apoptosis in various cell types or in purified mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amaegberi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chipuk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Manzanares-Estreder et al., 2017</xref>). The internal trigger of apoptosis comes from the sphingolipid degradation pathway, which is induced upon different cellular stress situations. Genetic manipulations to either favor production of t-2-hex or avoid its further degradation cause mitochondrial damage and inhibit proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Manzanares-Estreder et al., 2017</xref>). The first enzymatic steps in this pathway from ceramide to sphingosine-1-phosphate and t-2-hex altogether take place in the ER. The t-2-hex detoxifyer Hfd1 localizes in foci along the mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Manzanares-Estreder et al., 2017</xref>) and associates with the outer membrane of the organelle probably by interacting with TOM. Here, Hfd1 would serve as a surveillance factor in order to avoid an impairment of pre-protein import caused by increasing lipidation of the TOM entry gate. This is in line with recent findings, which reveal association of the core TOM complex with an increasing variety of quality control factors such as chaperones, ubiquitin ligases, deubiquitilases and proteases to constantly monitor the protein import process at the mitochondrial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Opaliński et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Schulte et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Mitochondrial protein import is a tightly monitored traffic hub in eukaryotic cells. Its prolonged malfunction leads to cell death and subtle perturbations cause diseases including neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Coyne et al., 2023</xref>). Insufficient clearance of stalled mitochondrial precursor proteins from the TOM complex leads to their accumulation in the cytosol and more generally, impairments in mitochondrial protein import lead to the formation of aberrant cytosolic deposits containing high-risk precursor and immature mitochondrial proteins. These deposits further accumulate and cause aggregation of disease-related proteins, including α-synuclein and amyloid β, resulting in cytosolic protein homeostasis imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nowicka et al., 2021</xref>). Here we show that this proteostatic imbalance is efficiently created by the t-2-hex lipid aldehyde, which cannot be counteracted by proteasomal clearance given its inefficiency in breaking down protein aggregates. This provides evidence that pro-apoptotic lipid signaling produces a collapse of protein homeostasis via mitochondrial protein import defects. Of note, the capacity of mitochondrial protein import has been recently directly correlated with the clearance of toxic protein aggregates in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Ruan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schlagowski et al., 2021</xref>), further strengthening the concept that mitochondrial protein import is a crucial modulator of general proteostasis and specific detoxification of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Maruszczak et al., 2023</xref>). In line with the results presented in this study, the levels of pro-apoptotic lipid effectors such as t-2-hex are decisive for the entry into apoptotic death by increasing aggregate formation. Apart from triggering a cell death decision, this balance might also be crucial for cellular lifespan. A response to a mild mitochondrial protein import defect extends lifespan in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sladowska et al., 2021</xref>), and more generally, proteasomal activity or a reduced or better controlled protein synthesis rate correlate with longevity in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kruegel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Martinez-Miguel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mittal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Steffen et al., 2008</xref>). Given that a slowed protein synthesis rate is also beneficial to counteract the pro-apoptotic function of t-2-hex, the action of anti-apoptotic enzymes such as Hfd1 could have effects on cellular lifespan as well. It will be crucial for future studies to evaluate the impact of mitochondrial protein import during lipid-mediated cell death in higher eukaryotic models, which has the potential of significantly broaden our comprehension of the mechanisms leading to intrinsic cell death and their regulation.</p>

Cells were washed 1x with cold H<sub>2</sub>O and 1x with cold TSB buffer (10mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 0.6M sorbitol). Cells were lysed by mechanical rupture with 0.5mm glass beads in TSB buffer supplemented with 1mM PMSF and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The mitochondrial fraction was enriched from the lysates by two rounds of differential centrifugation: 5min at 3500g discarding the pellet and subsequent centrifugation of the supernatant at 16000g for 10min. The final mitochondria enriched pellet was resuspended in 250μl of Hepes lysis buffer (50mM Hepes pH 7.4, 0.5% NP-40) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Total protein was quantified with the Bradford method, and the mitochondrial fractions adjusted to 0.1mg/ml in Hepes lysis buffer. 500μl aliquots were used for <italic>in vitro</italic> lipidation experiments. The indicated concentrations of t-2-hex-alkyne ((E)-2-Hexadecenal Alkyne, 20714 Cayman Chemicals) or solvent alone were added from a 1mg/ml stock in ethanol and the samples were rotated at room temperature for 1h. In the thiol competition experiments, 1mM DTT was added to the samples before addition of t-2-hex-alkyne. After removal of the input samples (100μl), the rest of the samples was treated with the click reaction mix (40μl) of 100μM TBTA (678937 Sigma), 1mM TCEP (C4706 Sigma), 1mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, 100μM Azide-PEG3-biotin conjugate (762024 Sigma) for 1h at room temperature. Samples were finally precipitated by adding 3.4ml chilled methanol over night at −80°C. Proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 17000g for 15min and dried in a Speed Vac centrifuge for 5min. Proteins were first dissolved by addition of 50μl PBST (8mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 150mM NaCl, 2mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3mM KCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 1% SDS and then diluted in 950μl PBST. Protein mixtures were incubated with 40μl PBST washed Streptavidin agarose resin (50% slurry, 69203-3 Merck) and incubated for 2h at room temperature on a roller. Agarose beads were washed 3x with PBST and proteins eluted with 80μl of elution buffer (95% formamide, 10mM EDTA) for 5min at 95°C. The supernatant was supplied with 1x Laemmli buffer and proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies.</p>
<p>For the chemoproteomic analysis of t-2-hex targets, the mitochondria enriched fraction was prepared from wild type cells as described above. A total of 50μg of mitochondrial fraction was treated with 100μM or 10μM t-2-hex-alkyne or solvent alone and the samples were rotated at room temperature for 1h. Samples were click chemistry treated and methanol precipitated as described above. Dried protein pellets were dissolved first in 500μl in resuspension buffer containing 50mM Tris/HCl pH7.4, 150mM NaCl, 10mM EDTA, 1% SDS. Samples were further diluted by adding 500μl of resuspension buffer containing 50mM Tris/HCl pH7.4, 150mM NaCl, 10mM EDTA, 1% Brij97. 40μl of PBS washed Streptavidin agarose beads were added to the samples and incubation was performed on a rotator at room temperature for 1.5h. Beads were washed 3x with PBS + 0.2% SDS and 1x with 250mM ammonium bicarbonate. After removing the supernatant, beads were incubated with 500μl of 8M urea, 50μl of 500mM TCEP and 50μl of 400mM iodoacetamide and incubated on a rotator in the dark for 40min. Finally beads were washed 2x with 250mM ammonium bicarbonate. Further sample preparation and proteomic analysis was performed in the proteomics facility of SCSIE University of Valencia, a member of Proteored. Proteins were digested on the beads with trypsin over night. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LC–MS/MS) was performed in a Tims TOF fleX mass spectrometer (Bruker). The PASER system (Bruker) was used to search the MS and MSMS data with the Sequest algorithm (ProLuCID) with the following parameters: SwissProt 23.03.10 database; Trypsin specificity; IAM cys-alkylation and taxonomy not restricted.</p>
<p>An excel document was generated with all the proteins identified with FDR ≤1%. Proteins were ranked according to their number of spectra assigned to the protein in the t-2-hex-alkyne versus mock treated samples. Differential enrichment analysis of the proteomic data was performed with the amica software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Didusch et al., 2022</xref>). Proteins were ranked according to their log<sub>2</sub> fold induction comparing lipid- and mock-treated samples with a threshold of ≥1.5, and the adjusted p-value was calculated. A total of 217 (100μM t-2-hex) and 459 (10μM t-2-hex) differentially enriched proteins were identified.</p>

<p>This study is a <bold>valuable</bold> observation that deals with the toxic effects of an intermediary in lipid degradation [trans-2-hexadecenal (t-2-hex)] in yeast through modification of mitochondrial protein import via the TOM complex. We find that the claim that the TOM complex is a main target of t-2-hex are supported by <bold>solid</bold> evidence, however the molecular mechanism remains unclear allowing multiple interpretation. Despite the shortcomings, this study is inspiring for researchers from the organellar, protein trafficking and lipid field and serves as a starting point to further precise and mechanistic analyses of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate the effect of high concentrations of the lipid aldehyde trans-2-hexadecenal (t-2-hex) in a yeast deletion strain lacking the detoxification enzyme. Transcriptomic analyses as global read out reveals that a large range of cellular functions across all compartments are affected (transcriptomic changes affect 1/3 of all genes). The authors provide additional analyses, which indicate that mitochondrial protein import is affected.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Global analyses (transcriptomic and functional genomics approach) to obtain an overview of changes upon yeast treatment with high doses of t-2-hex.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The use of high concentrations of t-2-hex in combination with a deletion of the detoxifying enzyme Hfd1 limits the possibility to identify physiological relevant changes. For the follow-up analysis, the authors focus on mitochondrial proteins and describe an impairment of mitochondrial protein biogenesis, but the underlying molecular modification resulting in the observed impairment is not yet known.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This study elucidates the toxic effects of the lipid aldehyde trans-2-hexadecenal (t-2-hex). The authors show convincingly that t-2-hex induces a strong transcriptional response, leads to proteotoxic stress and causes the accumulation of mitochondrial precursor proteins in the cytosol.</p>
<p>The data shown are of high quality and well-controlled. The genetic screen for mutants that are hyper-and hypo-sensitive to t-2-hex is elegant and interesting, even if the mechanistic insights from the screen are rather limited. Moreover, the authors show evidence that t-2-hex affects subunits of the TOM complex. However, they do not formally demonstrate that the lipidation of a TOM subunit is responsible for the toxic effect of t-2-hex. A t-2-hex-resistant TOM mutant was not identified. Nevertheless, this is an interesting and inspiring study of high quality. The connection of proteostasis, mitochondrial biogenesis and sphingolipid metabolism is exciting and will certainly lead to many follow-up studies.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate the effect of high concentrations of the lipid aldehyde trans-2-hexadecenal (t-2-hex) in a yeast deletion strain lacking the detoxification enzyme. Transcriptomic analyses as global read out reveal that a large range of cellular functions across all compartments are affected (transcriptomic changes affect 1/3 of all genes). The authors provide additional analyses, from which they built a model that mitochondrial protein import caused by modification of Tom40 is blocked.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our initial transcriptomic study with high doses of t-2-hex in a detoxifying mutant as an experimental approach is only a starting experiment and was aimed to identify as many determinants of t-2-hex toxicity as possible as stated in the manuscript. From this, we developed multiple independent approaches in wild-type (and mutant) cells at low t-2-hex concentrations, demonstrating that proteostasis and mitochondrial protein trafficking are physiologically important targets of the pro-apoptotic lipid. Specifically, proteostasis-specific PACE reporters are robustly induced in a detoxification mutant by 5mM t-2-hex (Figure 3D,E) and significantly induced by 10 mM t-2-hex in detoxification competent wild type cells (new Figure 3F).</p>
<p>We do not propose Tom40 as the lipid's primary target, while we show that several subunits of the TOM (and TIM) complex are directly targeted by low t-2-hex concentrations in vitro (Figure 8B), and Tom20 and Tom70 are important for lipid toxicity (Figure 8D) and mitochondrial protein trafficking in vivo (Suppl. Figure 2).</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Global analyses (transcriptomic and functional genomics approach) to obtain an overview of changes upon yeast treatment with high doses of t-2-hex.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The use of high concentrations of t-2-hex in combination with a deletion of the detoxifying enzyme Hfd1 limits the possibility to identify physiological relevant changes. From the hundreds of identified targets the authors focus on mitochondrial proteins, which are not clearly comprehensible from the data.</p>

<p>The initial transcriptomic study with high doses of t-2-hex in a detoxifying mutant is a starting experiment and was aimed to identify as many determinants of t-2-hex toxicity as possible as stated in the manuscript. As stated (page 4), genes up-regulated (&gt;2 log2FC) by t-2-hex were selected and subjected to GO category enrichment analysis (Supplemental Table 1). We found that “Mitochondrial organization” was the most numerous GO group activated by t-2-hex.  Among the strongly t-2-hex induced genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, CIS1 represented the most inducible gene with a known mitochondrial function. Cis1 is the central protein of the MitoCPR pathway, which is specifically induced upon and protects from mitochondrial protein import stress. We further show that proteostasis and mitochondrial protein trafficking are physiologically important targets at low t-2-hex doses in several independent experimental approaches: proteostasis-specific PACE reporters are robustly induced in a detoxification mutant by 5mM t-2-hex (Figure 3D,E) and significantly induced by 10mM t-2-hex in detoxification competent wild type cells (new Figure 3F); mitochondrial pre-protein accumulation is induced by 10mM t-2-hex in wild type cells (Figure 5G); several subunits of the TOM and TIM complexes are lipidated by low (10mM) t-2-hex doses in wild type cell extracts (Figure 8B), mitochondrial import assays with mt-GFP in intact yeast wild type cells reveal that t-2-hex significantly inhibits import at low (5mM) t-2-hex concentrations (new Suppl. Figure 1). 5-10mM t-2-hex applied here is considerably lower than the published data in human cells with ³ 25mM on intact cells or cell extracts (Jarugumilli et al. 2018).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The main claim of the manuscript that t-2-hex targets the TOM complex and inhibits mitochondrial protein import is not supported by experimental data as import was not experimentally investigated. The observed accumulation of precursor proteins could have many other reasons (e.g. dissipation of membrane potential, defects in mitochondrial presequence proteases, defects in cytosolic chaperones, modification of mitochondrial precursors by t-2-hex rendering them aggregation prone and thus non-import competent). However, none of these alternative explanations have been experimentally addressed or discussed in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now performed additional experiments, alternative to the pre-protein quantifications, showing that t-2-hex specifically inhibits mitochondrial protein import. We investigated the effect of t-2-hex on mitochondrial protein import using flow cytometric GFP assays in live yeast cells. Specifically, we compared the expression and maturation of GFP targeted either to the cytosol or the mitochondrial matrix and show that low doses of t-2-hex (≥5 μM) significantly inhibited mt-GFP activity compared to cytosolic GFP in wild-type cells (new Supplemental Figure 1B). In contrast, this inhibition was not observed with the saturated derivative, t-2-hex-H2. Flow cytometric rhodamine123 assays revealed that t-2-hex did not alter ΔΨm within the concentration range that efficiently inhibits mt-GFP activity (new Supplemental Figure 1C). Alternative t-2-hex effects such as the direct modification of mitochondrial pre-proteins or cytosolic chaperones, potentially making the precursors prone to aggregation, are less likely, as the mitochondrial and cytosolic GFP used in these import studies differ only by the small, cysteine-free PreSu9 pre-peptide. This information is now included in the Results and Discussion sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, many of the results have been reported before (interaction of Tom22 and Tom70 with Hfd1) or observed before (TOM40 as target of t-2-hex in human cells).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The interaction of Tom22 or Tom70 with Hfd1 has been only reported in high throughput pull-down studies in yeast (Opalinski et al., 2018 and Burri et al., 2006), and no functional connection between Hfd1 lipid detoxification and TOM has been investigated. Here we corroborate these high throughput results by targeted pull-down experiments, which strengthens the new finding that Hfd1 functionally interacts with the TOM complex. Tom40 has been found to be lipidated by high t-2-hex concentrations in human cell extracts in high throughput in vitro proteomic studies (Jarugumilli et al., 2018), but no functional connection between human TOM and t-2-hex has been investigated so far. Here we corroborate these high throughput results by targeted experiments, which strengthens the new findings that t-2-hex and TOM interact functionally.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Congratulations on this exciting study. Even if some of the mechanistic details will have to be addressed in further studies (which of the modified sites are physiologically relevant; which sites are modified in vivo without external addition of t-2-hex) this study is inspiring and opens a new direction of mitochondrial research. I therefore fully support publication of this nice study in its current form.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Two of the reviewers pointed out that the observation of precursors in whole cell extract is not sufficient to draw conclusions on mitochondrial protein import rates. The authors did not provide any new experiments but argued that a recent publication (Weidberg and Amon, 2018) had used the same readout for this conclusion. Why this manuscript was accepted with this statement is not known to this reviewer, but it does not change the fact, that the conclusion is not valid. Many alternative explanations are possible (see public review) and the claim that the import competence of the TOM complex is affected upon t-2-hex treatment is not appropriate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now performed new experiments addressing the inhibition of mitochondrial protein import by t-2-hex as an alternative to our precursor accumulation assays. We compared the induced expression of cytosolic and mitochondrial GFP by flow cytometry as a quantitative mitochondrial import assay (Sirk et al., Cytometry A. 2003 Nov; 56(1) 15-22). Low doses of t-2-hex (≥5 μM) significantly inhibited mt-GFP activity as compared to cytosolic GFP in wild-type cells (new Supplemental Figure 1B). This inhibition of mitochondrial GFP is independent of mitochondrial membrane potential perturbation (new Supplemental Figure 1C) and alternative t-2-hex effects, such as the direct modification of the mtGFP precursor or cytosolic chaperones are less likely, as the mitochondrial and cytosolic GFP used in these import studies differ only by the small, cysteine-free PreSu9 pre-peptide.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The first sentence of the abstract states that t-2-hex „induces mitochondrial dysfunction in a conserved manner from yeast to human&quot;. I find two issues with this statement: 1) if the mechanism is known what is the question addressed in the present manuscript and 2) the second sentence of the results fully contradicts the above sentence „In human cells, t-2-hex causes mitochondrial dysfunction by directly stimulating Bax-oligomerisation at the outer mitochondrial membrane. In yeast, however, t-2-hex efficiently interferes with mitochondrial function and cell growth in a Bax independent manner.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the first sentence was misleading, this has been fixed now in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The first reviewer requested a repetition of key experiments with lower concentrations and the authors provided additional in vitro data, however, for this, 10 uM is still very high. To gain valuable and physiological relevant data the initial transcriptomic analysis should be repeated with a low amount and in a wild-type yeast background.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Published t-2-hex chemoproteomic experiments on human cell extracts were performed at higher concentrations (&gt;25mM) and human Bax is hardly lipidated by 10mM t-2-hex (Jarugumilli et al., 2018), therefore the in vitro lipidation data provided in our study should be considered a low t-2-hex dose. The initial transcriptomic study with high doses of t-2-hex in a detoxifying mutant is a starting experiment and was aimed at identifying as many determinants of t-2-hex toxicity as possible. Building on this, we further show that proteostasis and mitochondrial protein trafficking, the relevant cellular functions for our study, are physiologically important targets at low t-2-hex doses in several independent experimental approaches: proteostasis-specific gene expression is robustly induced in a detoxification mutant by 5mM t-2-hex (Figure 3D,E) and significantly induced by 10mM t-2-hex in detoxification competent wild type cells (new Figure 3F); mitochondrial pre-protein accumulation is induced by 10mM t-2-hex in wild type cells (Figure 5G); several subunits of the TOM and TIM complexes are lipidated by low (10mM) t-2-hex doses in vitro in wild type extracts (Figure 8B), mitochondrial import assays with mt-GFP in intact yeast wild type cells reveal that t-2-hex significantly inhibits import at low (5mM) t-2-hex concentrations (new Suppl. Figure 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As already stated above there are many alternative explanations for the observed accumulation of precursor proteins, e.g. the decreased proteasome activity could be cause and not consequence. Also, the modification of precursors directly upon translation in the cytosol could likely impact on their further transport and result in direct aggregation in the cytosol.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, we have now corroborated the t-2-hex specific mitochondrial protein import defect by alternative in vivo experiments, which are not dependent on the accumulation of mitochondrial precursors. We have tested now the possibility that decreased proteasome activity could indirectly inhibit mitochondrial import. This is not the case because a rpn4 mutant with impaired proteasomal activity induces normal mtGFP levels (new Suppl. Figure 1D). We cannot exclude that the modification of precursors by t-2-hex upon translation might additionally impact on the transport of some mitochondrial pre-proteins. However, mitochondrial and cytosolic GFP used in the import studies only differ in the small cysteine-free PreSu9 pre-peptide making it very unlikely that precursor lipidation is secondarily responsible for the observed import defect.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Many of the comments after first reviewing the manuscript were not addressed experimentally although many of the suggested experiments are easy to perform. I can only encourage the authors to provide more experimental support and controls, as the claims are currently not sufficiently supported.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the two revisions of our manuscript, we have included several control experiments to better link the pro-apoptotic lipid t-2-hex with mitochondrial import stress. These include: in vitro lipidation of TOM/TIM subunits by low t-2-hex concentrations, t-2-hex tolerance and recovery of mitochondrial protein import in specific tom mutants, inhibition of mitochondrial protein import (pre-protein and mtGFP assays) by low t-2-hex doses independently on mitochondrial membrane potential and proteasome activity, and induction of proteostasis specific gene expression by low t-2-hex doses.</p>
