<title>Abstract</title><p>Upon threatening situations, animals exhibit a broad range of behavioral and autonomic responses. As such, a crucial adaptive response is the inhibition of pain to facilitate relevant defensive behaviors that promote survival. Whereas the structures and mechanisms involved in fear and pain behavior are well documented, little is known about the precise neuronal mechanisms mediating the emotional regulation of endogenous pain-suppression. Here we used a combination of behavioral, anatomical, optogenetic, and electrophysiological approaches to investigate the role of that somatostatin-expressing cells in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter (SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells) in the control of analgesia induced during defensive states. Our data indicate that the optogenetic inhibition of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells promotes analgesia irrespective of animal’s defensive state. In contrast, the optogenetic activation of long-range SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells that project to the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) abolishes the analgesia mediated by fear behavior. Together these results identify a novel circuit mechanism composed of long-range SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells projecting to the RVM that regulate analgesia elicited during defensive states.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During threatening situations, the inhibition of pain is an essential adaptive response that can be crucial to promote self-preservation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The inhibition of pain responses to a stimulus that would typically elicit pain is defined as analgesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, previous studies have described that a fearful event can reduce pain sensitivity, a phenomenon referred to as fear-conditioned analgesia (FCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In particular, the pharmacological inactivation of the basolateral amygdala abolishes such fear-modulated analgesia, and is associated with an increase in the immediate-early gene c-Fos expression in the central amygdala and periaqueductal gray matter (PAG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The PAG is a midbrain structure receiving many cortical and subcortical inputs from brain structures involved in fear processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, projecting to the spinal cord primarily through a brainstem relay in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, a key structure involved in nociceptive transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Indeed, the ventrolateral part of the PAG (vlPAG) is crucial for the descending control of pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (DH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and several reports indicate that electrical stimulation of the vlPAG selectively inhibits responses to noxious stimuli in a variety of pain test conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, analgesia induced upon vlPAG stimulation is opioid-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and involves direct descending projections to the RVM and the DH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Furthermore, previous research indicate that vlPAG activation induces analgesia through the recruitment of local GABAergic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, which is consistent with our knowledge of the role of the GABAergic system in the descending control of pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Thus, the vlPAG is ideally located to allow the emotional regulation of pain behavior, yet the underlying neuronal circuits and mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we investigated the precise neural circuits within the vlPAG that mediates the suppression of pain behavior during threatening situations. We developed a unique behavioral paradigm where a cued-elicited defensive state promotes changes in pain sensitivity. Combining behavioral, anatomical, optogenetic, and electrophysiological approaches, we identified a novel midbrain to brainstem circuit mechanism composed of somatostatin positive (SST<sup>+</sup>) vlPAG cells projecting to the RVM that is critically involved in the suppression of pain behavior during conditioned fear states.</p>

<title>Cued-fear conditioning elicits analgesia</title>
<p>To evaluate the contribution of specific vlPAG cells populations in the fear modulation of pain behavior, we developed a novel cued fear-conditioned analgesia (CFCA) paradigm, consisting of a pain sensitivity assay during the presentation of threat-predicting cues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). In this paradigm, an initially neutral stimulus (the conditioned stimulus, CS<sup>+</sup>) becomes associated with a footshock (the unconditioned stimulus, US), whereas another neutral stimulus serves as a control (CS<sup>-</sup>). After conditioning, re-exposure to the CS<sup>+</sup> elicited freezing behavior, a behavioral readout of associative learned fear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref> and Supplementary Figure 1a). Following the fear retrieval session, mice were submitted to the pain sensitivity assay. Mice were placed on a Hot-Plate (HP) apparatus in which the floor plate temperature progressively increases while either CS<sup>-</sup> or CS<sup>+</sup> were concomitantly presented. Plate temperature increased, and CSs were continuously played until mice displayed a nociceptive (NC) response reflecting pain behavior (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>), defined by either jumping or hindpaw licking (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). The detection of a NC response terminated the test session (<bold>see Methods</bold>).</p>

<p>We observed a significant delay in the NC response performance for CS<sup>+</sup> compared to CS<sup>-</sup> presentations, reflecting that pain-suppression was selectively promoted by the threat-predicting CS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref> and Supplementary Figure 1b). This increased NC latency during CS<sup>+</sup> presentation could alternatively be explained by a competition between freezing and pain-related responses. However, freezing probability at the time of the NC response for CS<sup>+</sup> was remarkably low and comparable to CS<sup>-</sup> levels, suggesting that CS<sup>+</sup> increased NC response latency was not due to competing freezing responses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>, <bold>see Methods</bold>). Instead, these results suggest that fear induced by CS<sup>+</sup> presentations drives the increase in NC latency. Importantly, such states induced by our CFCA paradigm reflected fear associative processes (Supplementary Figure 2). To demonstrate a causal link between cued-fear and analgesia, mice were submitted to an extinction procedure to devaluate the CS<sup>+</sup>-US contingency and abolish the negative emotional state during CS<sup>+</sup> presentations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>). In these conditions, CS<sup>+</sup> presentation after extinction had no effects on NC response latency (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h</xref>). Furthermore, the absence of auditory cues or the presence of auditory cues not associated with a threat had comparable NC response latencies as those observed during CS<sup>-</sup> presentations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1i</xref>). Finally, previous studies indicate that fear can lead to vasoconstriction, which could result in a redirection of the blood flow to the skeletal musculature, decreasing the temperature in the extremities of the body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. However, monitoring the back and tail temperature of mice submitted to the HP test did not reveal any difference between the CSs presentations, suggesting that increased latency was not due to fear-induced vasoconstriction (Supplementary Figure 1c-e). Overall, our results indicate that the presence of a conditioned threat-predicting cue can selectively promote analgesia.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Photostimulation of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells alters pain and fear behavior</title>
<p>To identify the cell types in the vlPAG mediating the analgesic effect in the CFCA task, we focused on GABAergic interneurons, which activity is suggested to be inhibited during analgesia through µ-opioid receptor-dependent mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Using single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH, <bold>see Methods</bold>), we confirmed that the majority of vlPAG SST mRNAs were expressed in inhibitory neurons (Supplementary Figure 3). As such, since somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST) are the most abundant interneurons class in the vlPAG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, we focused on this cell population. Thus, to evaluate the contribution of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells in CFCA, SST-Cre mice were injected in the vlPAG with a Cre-dependent AAV expressing the Channelrhodopsin (ChR2), Archaerhodopsin (ArchT), or GFP while optic fibers were bilaterally implanted targeting this area (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Next, mice were submitted to the CFCA task while photostimulating SST<sup>+</sup> cells in the vlPAG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>; <bold>see Methods</bold>). After fear retrieval (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c, e</xref>; Supplementary Figure 4a-d), the optogenetic activation of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells during the HP test had no effect on CS<sup>-</sup> presentation, whereas the same manipulation performed during CS<sup>+</sup> blocked the increase in NC response latency compared to GFP controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref> and Supplementary Figure 5a). In contrast, optogenetic inhibition of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells increased NC response latency for both CS<sup>-</sup> and CS<sup>+</sup> conditions compared to GFP controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref> and Supplementary Figure 5b). Importantly, these changes in NC response latencies were not due to motor or aversive effects of the optogenetic manipulations, since photoactivation of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells did not induce changes in distance travelled in an open field nor place aversion in a real-time place preference test (Supplementary Figure 5c-f). In addition, we did not observe changes in fear learning or expression when the footshock was replaced or paired with the SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells photoactivation during the fear conditioning procedure (Supplementary Figure 6).</p>

The opsin and respective control groups were pooled together because no difference was found in the conditioning level (see Supplementary Figure 4). Average freezing values during CS<sup>+</sup> was higher than CS<sup>-</sup> or baseline (BL) periods (****, P &lt; 0.001, one-way RM ANOVA, (<bold>c</bold>) n = 16 mice and (<bold>e</bold>) n = 23 mice). <bold>d.</bold> Photoactivation of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells abolished the analgesic effect induced by fear (*, P = 0.0112, opsin x CS - two-way RM ANOVA, n = 7 GFP, n = 9 ChR2). The NC response latency for the CS<sup>+</sup> was significantly different between the ChR2 and GFP groups (*, P = 0.0344, Bonferroni post-hoc test). For the ChR2 group, the NC response latency during CS<sup>+</sup> was equivalent to the CS<sup>-</sup> (ns, P = 0.3876, Bonferroni post-hoc test). On the contrary, the NC response latency between the CSs differed for the GFP group (***, P = 0.0003, Bonferroni post-hoc test). <bold>f.</bold> Photoinhibition of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells increased the analgesic effect for the ArchT group when compared to the GFP (*, P = 0.0037, opsin x CS - two-way RM ANOVA, n = 12 GFP, n = 11 ArchT). The NC response latency for the CS<sup>-</sup> and CS<sup>+</sup> was significantly different between the ArchT and GFP group (CS<sup>-</sup>: ****, P &lt; 0.0001, Bonferroni post-hoc test; CS<sup>+</sup>: *, P = 0.0265, Bonferroni post-hoc test). For the GFP group, the latency of NC response was higher for the CS<sup>+</sup> trials when compared to the CS<sup>-</sup> trials (***, P = 0.0003, Bonferroni post-hoc test), yet this was not the case for the ArchT group (ns, P &gt; 0.999, Bonferroni post-hoc test).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Altogether, these experiments confirmed that SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG activation did not promote pain responses and instead suggested that the SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells are key elements of an endogenous pain-suppression circuit. Additionally, the optogenetic effect observed during CFCA was not due to alteration of somatostatin levels in our homozygous SST-Cre mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, as we observed the same effect in heterozygous SST-Cre mice (Supplementary Figure 7a-d). Finally, in contrast with STT<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells, the optogenetic inhibition of another important class of vlPAG inhibitory cells expressing the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP<sup>+</sup>) did not change the NC response latencies during CS<sup>-</sup> or CS<sup>+</sup> presentations (Supplementary Figure 7e-h).</p>
<p>Because our CFCA paradigm is dependent on fear associative processes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Figure 1-2), it is possible that the optogenetic manipulation of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells may have altered the expression of fear behavior. To control for this possibility, we optogenetically activated or inhibited SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells during a fear retrieval session following auditory fear conditioning (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a, b</xref>). Our data indicate that whereas the optogenetic inhibition of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells had no effect on freezing behavior relative to GFP controls, their optogenetic activation reduced freezing levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c, d</xref>). Altogether, our data show that the local SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG network can modulate both fear expression and the analgesia promoted during defensive states.</p>

<title>Photostimulation of SST<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> vlPAG cells regulates spinal cord nociceptive transmission</title>
<p>Consistent with our observations, previous studies found that the vlPAG is involved in fear-conditioned analgesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. It is conceivable that the SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells are indeed part of a circuit involved in the fear regulation of endogenous pain-suppression. To evaluate the effect of the manipulation of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells on analgesia independently of the expression of fear behavior, we evaluated the impact of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells manipulation on the control of nociceptive transmission directly at the level of the spinal cord DH. Therefore, we performed extracellular local field potential and single-unit recordings in the spinal cord DH during optogenetic stimulation of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells in anesthetized mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, nociceptive stimulation induces early and late neuronal responses at the level of the spinal cord DH (A-comprising non-nociceptive Aβ and nociceptive Aο and C-fiber mediated, respectively; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). While optogenetic activation of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells during paw suprathreshold electrical stimulation increased the magnitude of late nociceptive field potentials, the optogenetic inhibition reduced it (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b, c</xref>). To determine if this effect was specific to the nociceptive network, we recorded wide dynamic range (WDR) cells in the DH, which receive both tactile (Aβ) and nociceptive information (Aο and C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. We observed that SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells photoactivation increases both fast nociceptive (Aο-fiber) and slow nociceptive (C-fiber) responses without affecting Aβ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). Moreover, the optogenetic inhibition of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells specifically inhibited nociceptive responses while Aβ responses remained unaffected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>). In addition, we performed subliminal electrical stimulations that did not elicit nociceptive neuronal responses. In this condition, we observed that the removal of analgesia by the activation of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells leads to WDR responses at latencies corresponding to nociceptive Aο and C-fibers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref>). Finally, the optogenetic activation of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells had no effect on purely tactile fast latency spinal neurons (Supplementary Figure 8). Consistent with our optogenetic manipulations during the CFCA task (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), these data suggest that under analgesia promoted by isoflurane, activation and inhibition of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells increased or decreased nociceptive transmission by specifically promoting pronociceptive and antinociceptive responses in the spinal cord DH, respectively.</p>

<p>We next addressed if the SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG-RVM-DH pathway was specific in the mediation of endogenous pain-suppression induced by defensive states. Thus, SST-Cre mice were injected in the vlPAG with a Cre-dependent AAV expressing the ChR2 or GFP, and a single optic fiber was implanted above the RVM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we established that SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells control the analgesia during defensive states. Endogenous pain-suppression was mediated by long-range SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells projecting to the RVM, which in turn transmitted the pain signal to the DH of the spinal cord (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Finally, our data indicated that SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells can regulate both fear expression and the analgesia promoted during defensive states, and that the expression of these two behaviors can be segregated by precisely targeting the SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG-RVM pathway (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Together these results identify a novel midbrain to brainstem circuit mechanism composed of long-range SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells projecting to the RVM that regulate analgesia elicited during defensive states.</p>
<p>Our observations of the involvement of vlPAG in our cued-based fear conditioned analgesia paradigm are consistent with previous studies in contextual-based FCA involving this region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In such FCA studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, animals undergo contextual fear conditioning followed by pain behavior testing in the same conditioning context, limiting a temporally precise elicitation of aversive states. Instead, our behavioral paradigm goes beyond these limitations by promoting defensive states through a cued conditioned stimulus, advancing toward temporal-specific manipulations such as optogenetics, and allowing us to study the phenomena with a within-subject experimental design by subsequent CS<sup>+/-</sup> presentations. Nevertheless, since the circuits involved in contextual and cued fear may differ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, this might also imply different circuits involved in the emotional modulation of pain-suppression behavior. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a cued fear-conditioned analgesia model in rodents. Addressing possible differences in the circuitry involved in contextual and cued fear-induced analgesia will require further investigation.</p>
<p>Our observation that the photoactivation of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells not only abolished the analgesia during defensive states but also decreased freezing expression has far-reaching functional consequences. Two independent previous studies found that long-range inhibitory inputs from the central medial amygdala contact inhibitory cells within the vlPAG, implicated in different roles: the modulation of fear behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and nociceptive transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Notably, both studies describe the involvement of vlPAG inhibitory cells in a disinhibitory circuit mechanism of long-range projecting excitatory cells as the underlying neural substrates responsible for such modulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We observed that SST<sup>+</sup> is the most abundant type of inhibitory cells in the vlPAG (Supplementary Figure 3). Thus, it is conceivable that the SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells are indeed part of a circuit involved in the emotional regulation of endogenous pain-suppression. Notably, global manipulation of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells cannot disentangle their role in analgesia and fear behavior at the local level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Because the studies mentioned above exclusively addressed the contribution of vlPAG circuits in either pain behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> or fear behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, these studies could have been oblivious to alternative behavioral readout interpretations. Here we demonstrated that SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells projecting to the RVM are involved in the modulation of analgesia induced during defensive states without impacting the behavioral expression of fear (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that fear and analgesia signals rely on overlapping neuronal circuits and that the discrimination between these two states could be mediated within the vlPAG network. Altogether, our data is consistent with the existence of different populations of SST<sup>+</sup> cells within the vlPAG responsible for the mediation of fear behavior and analgesia information, defined by their output connectivity.</p>
<p>The lateral inhibition model of analgesia within the PAG relies on the activation of PAG excitatory cells projecting to the RVM. More precisely, in this model, analgesia is thought to occur through an opioid-dependent inhibition of GABAergic cells, ultimately disinhibiting excitatory cells projecting to the RVM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Our data indicate that in addition to this disinhibitory mechanism, analgesia is also mediated by the inhibition of a direct long-range SST<sup>+</sup> neurons projection onto RVM cells projecting to the DH (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Our results align with the parallel inhibition-excitation model, where inhibitory and excitatory cells form two distinct, parallel descending pathways for pain modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Indeed, previous research demonstrated the presence of an inhibitory pathway projecting throughout the PAG–RVM-spinal cord dorsal horn neuraxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Our results complement this study by suggesting that this previously proposed inhibitory pathway is mediated by GABAergic SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells and has a functional role in mediating analgesia.</p>
<p>We identified a novel midbrain to brainstem circuit mechanism composed of SST<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells that project to the RVM, which regulates analgesia during defensive states. Substantial progress has been made that outlined the midbrain circuitry in endogenous pain-suppression pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. However, only more recently, high cortical areas have also been shown to be involved in analgesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Previous reports describe connections between CeL and vlPAG inhibitory neurons in the modulation of pain behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Future work is required to elucidate as to whether the exact circuit that regulates analgesia are mediated by different negative emotional states such as fear, depression or stress.</p>
<p>Recent human reports reveal strong comorbidity between mood and anxiety disorders with and pain-related disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, suggesting that the deregulation of the circuits mediating the interplay between emotional and pain behavior could be at the core of such psychiatric conditions. Comprehensive knowledge about the circuits mediating the emotional regulation of pain behavior is urgently needed. We identified an SST<sup>+</sup> cell type- and pathway-specific involvement in the mechanisms that mediate the emotion-dependent regulation of pain behavior. Thus, these findings may empower the development of more effective analgesic therapies by the improvement of further refined pharmacological targets.</p>

<title>Cued fear-conditioned analgesia (CFCA)</title>
<p>C57BL6/J mice (n = 12) were habituated to the context and tones (day 1). Four white-noise (CS<sup>-</sup>) and four 7.5 kHz (CS<sup>+</sup>) tones were presented sequentially and without US reinforcement. In Fear conditioning (day 2), five CS<sup>-</sup> and five CS<sup>+</sup> were presented in an intermingled fashion. The CS<sup>+</sup> presentations were paired with a mild footshock (US) at tone offset, whereas the CS<sup>-</sup> was never reinforced. The Fear retrieval session (Day 3) was done 24h after conditioning and in the same context as the habituation session. As in habituation, four CS<sup>-</sup> and four CS<sup>+</sup> were presented sequentially and without US reinforcement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the focus of this study was the emotional modulation of pain sensitivity, it was compulsory to evaluate the associative fear levels before measuring its impact on pain sensitivity. Two indices were computed: the discrimination index (DI), to assess the discrimination between CS<sup>-</sup> and CS<sup>+</sup>, and the conditioning index (CI), which indicated the level of freezing to the tone predicting the US.</p>
<p>These indexes were calculated as follows: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="476899v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and CI = DI × (Freezing to CS<sup>+</sup>). Based on preliminary data, mice were only submitted to the FC HP test if DI ≥ 0.4 &amp; CI ≥ 0.3. Mice that did not fit the criteria were conditioned a second time. There was a minimum interval of 2 h between the retrieval and the FC HP test.</p>
<p>The FC HP test consisted of two trials, one where the CS<sup>+</sup> was presented and another where the CS<sup>-</sup> was presented. The two trials were counterbalanced within the group. The testing surface was set at 30 °C. After a 60 s acclimatization period, its temperature gradually increased at 6 °C per minute (HP start). Tone presentation (CS<sup>+</sup> or CS<sup>-</sup>) started 130 s after the HP start. Temperature increase and tone presentation terminated concomitantly with the display of a nociception response. Valid nociception readout responses included jumping or licking the hindpaw. The effect of the negative emotional modulation on pain sensitivity was assessed by comparing the latency (or temperature) of the NC response between the two HP trials. There was a minimum of 30 min interval between the two trials for each mouse, during which mice returned to their home cage.</p>
<p>Freezing during the HP test was assessed by automatically analyzing thermographic camera videos using custom scripts (available at: github.com/djercog/TestoFreez). Briefly, individual video frames were binarized to define a mask for the mouse within each frame. Consecutive binarized frames were then subtracted, and the number of non-zero pixels on the resultant image determined if the mouse was considered immobile when below a certain threshold (defined to approximate manual freezing estimation on random videos). Immobilization episodes of at least 0.5 s were considered as freezing periods. In contrast, non-immobilization episodes shorter than 0.1 s were merged together with the neighbouring detected freezing episodes.</p>

Briefly, there were 4 CS<sup>-</sup> and 12 CS<sup>+</sup>, presented in a non-reinforced manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>). Mice were considered as having successfully extinguished the fear expression if the level of freezing in the last 4 CS<sup>+</sup> was not statistically different from the CS<sup>-</sup>. After fear extinction, mice were submitted to the FC HP test, using the same parameters as in the CFCA paradigm.</p>

<title>Stability training</title>
<p>The first three days consisted of the classical CFCA paradigm. On day 4, mice (n = 10) repeated the protocol applied on day 3 (Supplementary Figure 2e-i). All mice that passed the fear conditioning criteria (DI ≥ 0.4 &amp; CI ≥ 0.3) on day 3 were kept for the following day, independent of their level of Conditioning on day 4.</p>

<title>Vasoconstriction assay</title>
<p>To determine if vasoconstriction was a confounding factor in the FC HP test outcomes, we used a modified version of the CFCA paradigm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>). During the HP test (n = 13), the temperature was not gradually increased but maintained at 30 °C while CSs were presented. The tones (CS<sup>+</sup> or CS<sup>-</sup>) were presented for 120 s, and mice were kept for an additional 50 s before the HP trial terminated. Offline, with the infrared videos, mice’s back and tail were measured at 30 s intervals. For each measuring point, the temperature of three spots of the two body part was averaged to create the body temperature for the back and tail for a given time point and mouse.</p>

<title>Basal nociception assay (No tone)</title>
<p>Naïve mice (n = 10) were submitted to the HP test (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1i</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2a-d). Each mouse underwent two identical trials. The HP test was similar to the one described in the CFCA paradigm, except no tones were presented. There was a minimum of 30 min interval between the two trials, during which mice returned to a restful state in their home cage. Since the two trials were not significantly different, for simplification, in panel i from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, the two trials were pooled together.</p>

<p>Naïve mice (n = 12) were submitted to the HP test without auditory fear conditioning (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1i</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2a-d). Each animal underwent two trials, one trial with a 7.5 kHz tone presentation and another with a WN tone presentation. The tone presentation was counterbalanced. The HP test parameters were similar to the one described for the CFCA, except that both tones were unconditioned. Since the two trials were not significantly different, for simplification, in panel i from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, the two trials were pooled together.</p>

<title>Open Field assay</title>
<p>This test was used to determine the effect of optogenetic stimulation on locomotion. Therefore, only mice from optogenetic experiments were submitted to this assay. Mice could freely move during the entire test. The locomotion assay had a total duration of 9 min and was divided into 3 min epochs. The first and third epochs were OFF periods in which no optical stimulation occurred. During the second epoch, mice received photostimulation (ON period). The optogenetic stimulation effect was analyzed by comparing the overall distance travelled between the OFF and ON epochs (Supplementary Figure 5c, d). Mice injected with GFP were used to test the effect of heat and light on the stimulation itself. Mouse tracking data was extracted from video recordings using idTracker<sup>41</sup> and imported to Matlab for further analysis using custom scripts to calculate the total distance travelled during stimulation.</p>

<title>Real-time Place Preference assay</title>
<p>Only mice from optogenetic experiments were submitted to this assay. During the entire duration of the assay, mice could freely shuttle between the two compartments. Under a closed-loop stimulation, mice received photo-stimulation upon entry into one of the two compartments. The stimulated compartment was counterbalanced within the group. The optical stimulation effect was assessed by comparing the time spent in the stimulated compartment between the ChR2 and GFP groups (Supplementary Figure 5e, f). Permanence time in the stimulated compartment was automatically assessed by apparatus software (Imetronic).</p>

<title>Virus injections and optogenetics</title>
<p>For optogenetic manipulation of SST<sup>+</sup> cells in the vlPAG, 0.15-0.2 μL of either ChR2 (AAV5-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP, titer: 3.2×10<sup>12</sup> - Vector Core, University of North Carolina), ArchT (AAV9-CAG-FLEX-ArchT-GFP, titer: 4.7×10<sup>12</sup> - Vector Core, University of North Carolina) or GFP (AAV5-FLEX-GFP, titer: 4.5×10<sup>12</sup> - Vector Core, University of North Carolina) were bilaterally injected into the vlPAG of 8/9 weeks old Sst-IRES-Cre mice from glass pipettes (tip diameter 20-30 μm) at the following coordinates relative to bregma: − 4.4 mm AP; ± 1.5 mm ML; −2.45 mm DV from dura, with a 20 degrees angle. Injection coordinates for manipulating VIP<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells were the following: −4.4 mm AP; ± 1.35 mm ML; −2.5 mm DV from dura, with a 20 degrees angle.</p>
<p>At two weeks after the injections, mice were bilaterally implanted with custom-built optic fibers (diameter: 200 µm; numerical aperture: 0.39; Thorlabs) above the vlPAG at the following coordinates relative to bregma: i) Sst-IRES-Cre mice: − 4.4 mm AP; ± 1.0 mm ML; −1.8 mm DV from dura, with a 10 degrees angle; ii) VIP-IRES-Cre mice: − 4.4 mm AP; ± 0.8 mm ML; −2.0 mm DV from dura, with a 10 degrees angle. For RVM manipulations, mice were implanted at the following coordinates relative to bregma: −5.8 mm AP; 0.0 mm ML; −5.2 DV from the dura. All implants were secured using three stainless steel screws and Super-Bond cement (Sun Medical). During surgery, long- and short-lasting analgesic agents were injected (Metacam, Boehringer; Lurocaïne, Vetoquinol). After surgery, mice were allowed to recover for at least five days. Afterward, mice were handled daily to familiarize themselves with being restrained for the optic fibers connection. Behavioral experiments were performed at least four weeks after viral injections. Only mice with correct placement of optic fibers and virus expression were included in the analyses.</p>
<p>For optogenetic excitation, light stimulation consisted of blue light (473 nm, ∼8-10 mW at fiber tip) delivered with 2 Hz frequency and 5 ms pulse duration. In contrast, light stimulation consisted of green light (532 nm, ∼8-10 mW at fiber tip) delivered continuously for optogenetic inhibition. For optogenetic manipulations during the CFCA paradigm of either SST<sup>+</sup> or VIP<sup>+</sup> vlPAG cells, the light was delivered during the FC HP test and paired with the tone presentation.</p>
<p>Two sets of experiments were performed sequentially for stimulation during the fear conditioning. First, the footshock US was replaced by optical stimulation. Then, the US became the optical stimulation combined with the footshock (Supplementary Figure 6). For both conditions, the optogenetic stimulation started 5 s before and lasted until 5 s after CS<sup>+</sup> offset. The same mice were used for both experiments. For the manipulations during the fear retrieval, there were 12 CS<sup>+</sup> presentations divided into blocks of 4 CS<sup>+</sup>. The optogenetic stimulation was paired with the second block of CS<sup>+</sup>.</p>

<title>Fluorogold injection</title>
<p>An incision between one to two cm was made slightly caudal to the peak of the dorsal hump to expose the lumbar spinal region. The vertebra of interest was identified. Then, a small incision was made between the tendons and the vertebral column on either side. The vertebra was then secured using spinal adaptor clamps, and all tissue was removed from the surface of the bone. Pulled borosilicate glass capillaries (Ringcaps, disposable capillary pipettes with ring mark, DURAN, Hirschmann Laborgeräte, Germany) were inserted between 2 vertebrae and allowed to microinject 0.5 μL of fluorogold 2% in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord on both sides.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> electrophysiology</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane 4% for induction, then 1.5% maintenance. The experiment was started as soon as there was no longer any reflex. The colorectal temperature was kept at 37 °C with a heating blanket. Two metal clamps were used to set the animal spine in a stereotactic frame (M2E, France) for stability during electrophysiological recordings. Then, a laminectomy was performed at T13-L1 to expose the lumbar part of the spinal cord. The dura mater was carefully removed. Custom-made optical fibers were placed 1mm above the dorsal spinal cord for optogenetic manipulations. C-fiber-evoked field potentials were recorded in the deep lamina of the DH (at a depth range of 250 and 500 µm) with borosilicate glass capillaries (2 MΩ, filled with NaCl 684 mM; Harvard Apparatus, Cambridge, MA, USA). Field potentials were recorded with an ISODAM-amplifier (low filter: 0.1Hz to high filter: 0.1 kHz; World Precision Instruments, USA) in response to electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral paw. Single unit recordings of WDR DH cells were made with the same borosilicate glass capillaries mentioned above and placed in the dorsal part of the spinal cord. The criterion for selecting a cell was the presence of an A-fiber-evoked response (0-80 ms) followed by a C-fiber-evoked response (80-150 ms) to electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral sciatic nerve.</p>
<p>The paw of the mice was stimulated by trains (every 30 s) of electrical stimulation at two times the threshold for C-fibers were performed before, during, and after optogenetic stimulations with an optic fiber placed above the recording site. Subthreshold stimulations were performed below the threshold for C-fiber and A-fiber, respectively.</p>

<title>Histology analyses</title>
<p>Mice were administered a lethal dose of Exagon and underwent transcardial perfusions via the left ventricle with 4% w/v paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M PB. Following dissection, brains were post-fixed for 24 h at 4°C in 4% PFA. Brain sections of 80 μm-thick were cut on a vibratome, mounted on gelatin-coated microscope slides, and dried. To verify correct viral injections and optic fiber location, serial 80 μm-thick slices containing the regions of interest were mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories) and imaged using an epifluorescence system (Leica DM 5000) fitted with a 10-x dry objective. The location and the extent of the injections/infections were visually controlled. Only infections targeting the vlPAG and optic fibers terminating, depending on the experiment, above the vlPAG or RVM were included in the analyses.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All statistics details are contained in Supplementary Table 1. Box-whisker plots indicate median, interquartile range, and 5th - 95th percentiles of the distribution. All statistics are indicated where used. Statistical analyses were performed with Prism software (GraphPad). We tested the normality of all data with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality test in Prism software (GraphPad), and used nonparametric statistical tests for nonnormally distributed datasets, as indicated where used. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but sample sizes were based on previous studies in our laboratory. Blinding for the opsin was done for optogenetics experiments. Animals used for the CFCA paradigm that did not satisfy the DI and CI criteria after two conditioning sessions were discarded from the study. Mice with an incorrect injection of the opsins or misplaced location of the optic fibers were discarded. For <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiology, field potentials were measured as the area above the curve in the C-fiber range (80-300 ms). Absolute values were used to compare values in each condition (OFF vs. ON optogenetic manipulation). In single-unit recordings, the number of A- and C-fiber induced spikes of WDR cells were measured after each electrical stimulation, during, and after optogenetic manipulation. An average of the four stimuli for each WDR recorded was used for statistical analysis. Outliers were removed using the Tukey method. No other mice were excluded. Significance levels are indicated as follows: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, **** p&lt;0.0001.</p>

<p>The study is a timely and <bold>important</bold> contribution to our knowledge of the circuit mechanisms of fear analgesia. The novel cue-induced analgesia paradigm allowed a <bold>compelling</bold> identification of a brainstem circuit element, i.e., somatostatin-expressing neurons within the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey that project to the rostroventral medulla, in mediating fear analgesia. The vlPAG is a known region of pain modulation, and this study adds key insight to the circuit involved in fear-associated analgesia. This work will be of interest to systems and behavioral neuroscientists, especially those interested in emotional behavior, pain, and/or brainstem function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript by Winke et al, the authors present evidence that fear-induced analgesia is mediated by somatostatin projection cells from the vlPAG to the RVM. This study uses a mouse model of fear-induced analgesia, and incorporates optogenetic circuit manipulation with behaviour and electrophysiology to gain a meaningful insight into a novel circuit involved in fear-induced analgesia.</p>

<p>(1) This is a well-constructed study with appropriate controls and analyses.</p>
<p>(2) Alternative interpretations of the data are systematically considered and eliminated via rational experiments. The authors are commended for a nice piece of experimental work.</p>
<p>(3) The vlPAG is a known region of pain modulation, and this study adds valuable insight to the circuit involved in fear-associated analgesia.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Only male mice are included in this study.</p>
<p>(2) Animals are excluded from analyses based on clearly defined criteria, but it is not clear how many mice were excluded from each group.</p>
<p>(3) The authors implement a pain sensitivity assay that involves a hot plate with progressively increasing temperature. The time to nociceptive responses is reported. Without reporting the actual temperature at which the mice respond, it makes it difficult to compare nociceptive responses to previously published work (which typically use a defined and static hotplate temperature).</p>
<p>(4) The authors present evidence that inhibition of SST vlPAG cells enhances spinal nociceptive electrophysiological responses, but the corresponding pain sensitivity is not altered (Figure 2, CS- condition). The reason for the discrepancy between electrophysiological and behavioural responses is not clear.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wenke et al. investigated the role of vlPAG somatostatin-expressing neurons in the mediation of analgesia during defensive states. A newly developed paradigm of cued fear-conditioned analgesia, which consists of a combination of an auditory fear retrieval session and a pain test, was used to evaluate this cell population's contribution to fear-mediated analgesia. Optogenetic manipulation of vlPAG SST+ neurons modulated the responses to a nociceptive cue (Hot Plate) presented concomitantly with an aversively conditioned tone. At the same time, alterations in the freezing levels could be observed during optogenetic activation of vlPAG SST+ neurons. In order to disentangle the impact of these cells on analgesia from their impact on the expression of defensive behaviors, the authors performed electrophysiological recordings from the dorsal horn in the spinal cord of anesthetized mice. A vlPAG-RVM-DH pathway was identified to trigger nociceptive C-fibers upon optic activation of the RVM. Finally, pathway-specific activation of SST+ vlPAG-RVM neurons could abolish CS-induced analgesia.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study addresses a relevant topic, that is, brainstem circuits for pain-modulatory mechanisms as part of defensive states evoked by threat. This is important because the circuit mechanisms underlying pain are still not fully understood, and defining molecular markers of cellular circuit substrates may support the identification of potential pharmaceutical targets in treating pain. The authors confirm a previous study in that a somatostatin-positive cellular population presents a crucial vlPAG circuit element mediating anti-nociceptive effects. Key novelty aspects of the present study are the demonstration that these neurons seem to play a role specifically in threat-induced analgesia. This was possible by the elegant design and application of a novel fear analgesia paradigm, combined with cell- and pathway-specific optogenetics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite the convincing and rigorous experimental approach, the study leaves some interpretational room when it comes to the proposed circuit mechanism. This could either be addressed by additional experiments or by more discussion of alternative circuit layouts.</p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>(1) The paper by Zhang et al. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36641028/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36641028/</ext-link>), which identified a role for vlPAG SOM+ neurons in mediating anti-nociception in neuropathic pain, needs to be referenced and its results discussed, if not reconciled. While functionally, both studies find an analgetic role of vlPAG SOM+ neurons projecting to the RVM, Zhang et al., using slice physiology, characterize those neurons as glutamatergic. In Figure 4E of Zhang et al. they find general (fear-independent) analgetic effects with PAG-RVM specificity by performing chemogenetic experiments.</p>
<p>It can be argued that in addition to the two functionally distinct inhibitory SOM subtypes hypothesized by Winke et al., there is another, excitatory subpopulation. Also, the different experimental conditions (chronic vs. acute pain, non-threat vs. fearful cues/contexts may recruit different vlPAG SOM+ populations. All of this is conceivable, yet I wonder whether the contrasting findings could more parsimoniously be reconciled. The author's own results presented here in Supplementary Figure 3 suggests that SOM+ vlPAG cells are co-localizing with glutamate and thus could also be excitatory. In addition to this rather complementary piece of evidence, a more extensive characterization of vlPAG neurons using IHC and slice physiology would be needed to justify the unambiguous identification of their inhibitory nature.</p>
<p>In the absence of a direct identification of these cells exclusively releasing GABA, an alternative explanation should be considered. What about looking at vlPAG SOM+ neurons as a putatively mixed bag of local, inhibitory interneurons and long-range, RVM-projecting excitatory cells? This model would then open up interesting questions as to the actual function of somatostatin as a modulator of vlPAG circuit activity and associated function, and from my perspective, would nicely fit into the view of PAG circuits as integrators of complex survival responses.</p>
<p>(2) &quot;Our data indicate that the optogenetic inhibition of SST+ vlPAG cells promotes analgesia irrespective of the animal's defensive state. In contrast, the optogenetic activation of long-range SST+ vlPAG cells that project to the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) abolishes the analgesia mediated by fear behavior.&quot; (lines 32-35). Consider toning down these conclusions, as contrasting activation with inhibition of two different (though overlapping) populations cannot be fully conclusive. Alternatively, a pathway-specific (vlPAG-RVM) inhibitory experiment could help to fully understand the circuit mechanism and verify the necessity of these neurons.</p>
<p>(3) Despite an overall very thorough reporting style, some information is missing from the manuscript:</p>
<p>a) In Figures 2d and f, what are the freezing levels during optogenetic manipulation? From Figure 3d, one can expect that freezing is inhibited during the hot plate test, which could bias the NC response towards shorter latencies.
b) In Figure 5, the histological experiment showing the vlPAG-to-RVM pathway is presented by a qualitative image only. Here, some quantification would strengthen the finding.
c) In Figures 6 c and d &quot;Consistently, activation of the SST+ vlPAG-RVM pathway during CFCA had no impact on CS-presentation, whereas the same manipulation performed during CS+ blocked the increase in NC response latency compared to GFP controls.&quot; (line 194-196). Is it possible that the NC response cannot be any lower than the one during CS-, thus constituting a floor effect?
d) Connected to major point 1- this experiment is important for defining the circuit mode and therefore should be as convincing as possible. However, for the colocalization experiment in Supplementary Figure 3, the methodological description is missing and thus makes it hard to comprehend how this data set was generated (how many data points, etc.). The visual depiction of the results is non-standard and not easily graspable. Consider e.g., a Venn diagram.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Conditioned analgesia refers to the ability of a learned fear cue to suppress pain-related behavior and neural activity. Understudied, the authors developed a novel conditioned analgesia procedure in which a cue that had been paired or unpaired with shock was played while a hot plate increased temperature. Compared to several control conditions, the authors found increased latency to a nociceptive response (paw licking). The authors identified somatostatin neurons in the periaqueductal gray as a likely mediator of the behavior. They then showed that: (1) stimulating vlPAG-SST neurons blocked nociceptive response latency increases to the CS+, (2) stimulating vlPAG-SST neurons suppressed fear retrieval freezing, (3) stimulating vs. inhibiting vlPAG-SST neurons drove opposing modulation of c-fibers and Aδ-fibers, (4) direct-projecting vlPAG SST neurons modulate freezing while RVM-projecting vlPAG SST neurons modulate conditioned analgesia.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>These experiments have many strengths. The behavioral assay is chief among them. The assay is robust and controls for confounding factors to reveal a repeatable effect of a shock-paired cue to delay nociceptive responding. The optogenetic experiments provide the correct level of temporal precision, given the authors' time-specific interest in cued responding. Combining neuronal manipulations with spinal recordings is particularly innovative, especially in the context of more behavioral neuroscience-based assays. All-in-all, I found this to be an exceptionally strong set of experiments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No obvious weaknesses were identified by this Reviewer.</p>
