<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons are critical to computations in cortical circuits but their organization is difficult to assess with standard electrophysiological approaches. Within the medial entorhinal cortex, representation of location by grid and other spatial cells involves circuits in layer 2 in which excitatory stellate cells interact with each other via inhibitory parvalbumin expressing interneurons. Whether this connectivity is structured to support local circuit computations is unclear. Here, we introduce strategies to address the functional organization of excitatory-inhibitory interactions using crossed Cre- and Flp-driver lines to direct targeted presynaptic optogenetic activation and postsynaptic cell identification. We then use simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from postsynaptic neurons to assess their shared input from optically activated presynaptic populations. We find that extensive axonal projections support dense but incomplete connectivity between stellate cells and parvalbumin interneurons. Analysis of the spatial organization of synaptic interactions is consistent with local modules defined by excitatory-inhibitory connectivity. We suggest that dense, but specific, direct excitatory-inhibitory synaptic interactions may operate at the scale of grid cell clusters, while indirect interactions may coordinate activity at the scale of grid cell modules.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Computation in cortical circuits is shaped by synaptic interactions between excitatory principal cells and local interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Miller, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sadeh and Clopath, 2020</xref>). Critical determinants of these interactions include the spatial extent over which given presynaptic neurons influence their targets, and whether connectivity is specific to subsets of neurons within the potential target population. These circuit properties can be challenging to assess experimentally. For example, while simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from pairs of neurons provide a gold standard for assessment of functional properties of synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sjöström et al., 1994</xref>), even with impressive advances in maximizing the numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Peng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), their low throughput makes them less well suited to investigation of the spatial extent and organization of connectivity.</p>
<p>The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is a promising higher order cortical area for elucidation of principles for circuit level computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moser and Moser, 2013</xref>). The striking spatially periodic firing properties of grid cells found within the MEC has an anatomical organization that shares features with the columnar organization of sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burgalossi and Brecht, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Naumann et al., 2018</xref>). Nearby grid cells have a similar spatial scale and orientation, which is maintained across superficial and deep cell layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>). For grid cells at different dorsoventral locations the scale and orientation of their firing fields varies, with larger scales found in more ventral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>). This variability arises from discrete groups of grid cells that have firing fields with similar scale and orientation and form functional modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>). Individual modules can be partitioned into cell clusters, with each cluster containing topographically ordered grid cells encoding the full range of possible spatial phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gu et al., 2018</xref>). A critical goal in determining the mechanisms that subserve grid firing is therefore to establish principles for organization of synaptic interactions at these anatomical scales.</p>
<p>Within later 2 of the MEC, synaptic interactions between excitatory stellate cells (SCs) and inhibitory parvalbumin positive interneurons (PV+INs) have received attention as a possible substrate for emergence of grid firing fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buetfering et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Miao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shipston-Sharman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Widloski and Fiete, 2014</xref>). Layer 2 of the MEC contains a high density of grid cells, with both stellate and pyramidal cells (PCs) in this layer having grid firing fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Domnisoru et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rowland et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schmidt-Hieber and Häusser, 2013</xref>). Interactions between SCs appear to be primarily via PV+INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fuchs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Winterer et al., 2017</xref>), and models based on this connectivity are able to account for grid firing and local theta-nested gamma frequency network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shipston-Sharman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Solanka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Widloski and Fiete, 2014</xref>), while silencing PV+INs reduces the spatial periodicity of grid firing in layer 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Miao et al., 2017</xref>). However, previous investigation of interactions between SCs and PV+INs have focused on nearby pairs of cells, typically separated by &lt; 150 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dhillon and Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fernandez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fuchs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grosser et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Winterer et al., 2017</xref>). We know much less about their functional synaptic interactions at distances at the scale of grid cell clusters or modules. Anatomical approaches, for example single neuron axo-dendritic reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burgalossi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fuchs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Martínez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Quilichini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tamamaki and Nojyo, 1993</xref>), labeling of axon terminals of molecularly targeted SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sürmeli et al., 2015</xref>), or high-density electron microscopy reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>), can constrain potential connectivity, but are limited here because they do not reveal functional interactions.</p>
<p>We set out to evaluate the extent and organization of functional synaptic connectivity between SCs and PV+INs within layer 2 of the MEC across the scale of grid clusters and modules. To do so we developed strategies to assess the common synaptic input to identified postsynaptic neurons from genetically defined populations of presynaptic neurons. Our results indicate dense but specific local connectivity between SCs and PV+INs at the scale of grid cell clusters. We also find evidence that indirect coordination can operate at longer distances, that networks of interacting SCs and PV+INs have a modular organization, and that distinct PV+INs coordinate SCs and nearby pyramidal cells. Our results suggest highly structured and localized synaptic interactions within layer 2 of the MEC as candidates for the organization of spatial representations.</p>

<p>Consistent with observations from labeling of presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sürmeli et al., 2015</xref>), we found axon collaterals of SCs in deep L1, L2, L3 close to the border with L4, and in L5b (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-E</xref>). The dendrites of SCs were exclusively in L1-2 and the superficial part of L3. Individual SCs varied in whether they had axon collaterals in a particular layer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). While the total length of axon collaterals in superficial layers (L1-3) was greater than in deep layers (L5-6), there was no apparent relationship between the total length of superficial and deep axon collaterals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). For SCs with axon collaterals in L1-3, the average extent of their collaterals was &gt; 500 µm along the dorsoventral axis in sagittal slices, and &gt; 400 µm along the mediolateral axis in horizontal slices (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>These results suggest extensive axonal substrates for SCs to coordinate other neurons located along both mediolateral and dorsoventral axes in L1-2 of MEC. We next sought to establish whether this extensive axonal arborization leads to functional coordination of targets of SCs separated by similar distances within L2.</p>

<title>Asynchronous widefield activation of SCs reveals coordinated input to pairs of PV+INs</title>
<p>To investigate functional coordination of PV+INs by SCs, we developed strategies for selective optogenetic activation of SCs and targeted patch-clamp recording from multiple PV+INs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). As a first approach, we used ramp-like increases in the intensity of wide field illumination to drive asynchronous action potential firing by SCs expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). As the timing of action potentials fired by SCs activated in this way differs across trials and between activated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, Figure Supplement 1A</xref>), we reasoned that temporally correlated synaptic inputs to postsynaptic PV+INs would indicate coordination by the activated SCs.</p>

</fig>
<p>To validate this approach we simulated responses of pairs of cells to spike trains generated by action potentials recorded during ramp-like optogenetic activation of SCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 Figure, Supplement 1A</xref>)(see Methods). We compared models in which each postsynaptic neuron summed inputs from multiple presynaptic neurons but in which the number of common inputs varied (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>). For pairs of simulated PV+INs receiving a greater fraction of common inputs, the average peak of the cross-correlation of their responses (CC_peak_mean) was higher and the variance in the lag of the cross-correlation (CC_lag_var) was lower (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, Figure Supplement 1B-F</xref>). Thus, cross-correlation of postsynaptic currents can index common synaptic inputs from upstream neurons activated by ramp-like stimuli.</p>
<p>We next recorded from pairs of PV+INs, with cell bodies separated by distances between 63 µm and 1013 µm. Activation of SCs with light ramps induced excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in all PV+INs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>). We observed substantial summation of light evoked EPSCs and individual events usually overlapped, suggesting inputs from many SCs converge onto each PV+IN. Consistent with our model predictions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, Figure Supplement 1G</xref>), relatively high peak values of CC_peak_mean were associated with low values of CC_lag_var, indicating pairs that receive a common input (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A,C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, Figure Supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, lower values of CC_peak_mean were associated with higher values of CC_lag_var, indicating pairs that do not share a substantial common input (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, Figure Supplement 1</xref>). To establish whether the observed values of CC_peak_mean and CC_lag_var could have occurred by chance, we used distributions of values generated from shuffled datasets of 1000 pairs of cells that were recorded at different times. We classified pairs of PV+INs as receiving coordinated synaptic input from SCs if their CC_peak_mean and CC_lag_var were above the 95th percentile of the shuffled data set (corresponding to CC_peak_mean &gt; 0.27 and CC_lag_var &lt; 0.22, see <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, Figure Supplement 1C</xref>). In this way, we identified 35/71 recorded pairs as receiving coordinated synaptic input from SCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, Figure Supplement 1D</xref>), but 0/1000 shuffled pairs (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, Figure Supplement 1C</xref>). This classification was consistent with grouping the cell pairs using a k-means classifier, which identified 29/29 coordinated pairs in one group and 36/42 uncoordinated pairs in a second group (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, Figure Supplement 1E</xref>). Together, these analyses show how asynchronous wide-field activation of SCs can be used to identify pairs of PV+INs that receive coordinated synaptic input.</p>

<p>We found that coordination by SCs depends on the extent and direction of the separation between PV+INs.

Along both axes, CC_peak_mean was reduced and CC_lag_var increased with cell separation; both measures indicated that coordination of nearby PV+INs was greater and that coordination dropped more steeply with increasing separation. Pairs of PV+INs for which we could not detect coordinated input were found along both axes across the full range of separations tested.</p>
<p>Because direct chemical and electrical synaptic connections between PV+INs could also coordinate their activity, we compared the extent of electrical interactions with coordination from SCs. We found that 3 of 49 pairs of tested PV+INs were electrically coupled to one another (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure S3, Figure Supplement 2</xref>). All three electrically coupled pairs were separated by distances &lt; 100 µm and received coordinated synaptic input during optogenetic activation of SCs. We did not find any evidence for inhibitory connectivity between 49 tested pairs of PV+INs.</p>
<p>To test if coordination of PV+INs by SCs involves recruitment of intermediary interneurons that coordinate spike timing by SCs (cf. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>)), we evaluated the effect of blocking fast inhibitory responses mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. We found that for pairs of PV+INs that received coordinated input in control conditions and were separated by &lt; 150 µm, when GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors were blocked their responses to ramp activation of SCs were similar (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B, D-E</xref>). By contrast, for PV+INs separated by &gt; 150 µm, CC_peak_mean was typically reduced and CC_lag_var increased, and in many cases responses to ramp activation of SCs were no longer consistent with the PV+INs receiving coordinated inputs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref>), suggesting that their coordination in control conditions involved inhibitory interactions between stellate cells.</p>

<p>Together, these data suggest that coordination of PV+INs involves multiple mechanisms with distinct anatomical organization. Direct electrical synaptic interactions are restricted to PV+INs separated by &lt; 100 µm. In contrast, coordination of PV+INs by SCs is more extensive and is both direct and via additional inhibitory pathways, which appear to increase the extent of coordination.</p>

<title>Focal activation of SCs generates common input to nearby PV+INs</title>
<p>To corroborate our conclusions from responses to asynchronous widefield activation of SCs, we adopted a complementary approach in which we investigated responses of PV+INs to activation of SCs using focal laser stimulation. We applied stimuli across a 7 x 10 array of locations in the superficial MEC, with each location separated by 20 µm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We reasoned that if focal light pulses asynchronously activate restricted populations of ChR2 expressing SCs, then simultaneous postsynaptic responses in pairs of PV+INs will identify inputs from the same SC.</p>

<p>We validated this approach by recording from SCs expressing ChR2 (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, Figure Supplement 1A</xref>). At threshold stimulation intensities the timing of action potentials was variable between trials (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, Figure Supplement 1A-C</xref>) and action potentials were typically triggered from a single location (1.63 ± 0.74 locations, proportion of responses 0.53 ± 0.36; n = 8 cells, N = 4 mice, <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, Figure Supplement 1D</xref>). With increasing stimulation intensity, the latency to spike became shorter and the trial-to-trial variability in spike timing was reduced but not abolished (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, Figure Supplement 1A-D</xref>). The number of locations from which action potentials were initiated increased with increasing stimulation intensity, although at the maximal stimulation intensity used action potentials were still typically triggered at relatively few locations close to the soma (4.5 ± 2.78 locations). Therefore, because focal stimulation activates SCs with latencies that vary from trial to trial, and individual SCs vary in their light intensity thresholds, postsynaptic events occurring simultaneously in pairs of PV+INs are likely to originate from the same presynaptic SC.</p>
<p>To use this approach to assess the extent to which pairs of PV+INs received common input, we focused on response to stimulus intensities that evoked 335 - 908 EPSCs across all trials, which corresponds to approximately 7 x the threshold for a detectable response in either of the pair of PV+INs. We calculated a correlation probability (Pc)(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-E</xref>, see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>)), which we determined by finding the peak of the summed cross correlations for all events across all stimulus locations, subtracting the corresponding peak from a shifted dataset, and normalizing by the estimated number of evoked events (see Methods). To identify pairs with Pc unlikely to be generated by chance, we generated a shuffled distribution by calculating Pc for synthetic pairs of PV+INs recorded at different times. We identified pairs with Pc &gt; the 95th percentile of the shuffled distribution as receiving a common input (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, Figure Supplement 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>When we investigated the variation in the correlation probability as a function of separation between PV+INs, we found high correlation probabilities indicative of common synaptic input only for PV+INs within 200 µm in sagittal slices and within 400 µm in horizontal slices (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). In this experiment low values of P<sub>C</sub> could reflect local network structure, such that some nearby PV+INs rarely receive common input from the same SCs, or it may reflect undersampling of the possible SC inputs to each pair of PV+INs. To distinguish these possibilities, we compared correlation probabilities between stimulus intensities over which the number of postsynaptic events in PV+INs differs across an approximately two-fold range. We found that the correlation probability was independent of the number of activated SCs (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, Figure Supplement 1H</xref>), suggesting that differential sampling of SC axons does not account for the variation in correlation probability between nearby pairs of PV+INs.</p>
<p>These data show that focal laser stimulation of ChR2 expressing presynaptic neurons in combination with simultaneous recordings from postsynaptic neurons can assess the extent to which pairs of neurons receive common inputs. They support the conclusion from the previous widefield activation experiments that connections from SCs to PV+INs are locally structured and specific.</p>

<title>Organization of SCs projecting to PV+INs is non-uniform and suggest discrete clustering</title>
<p>If grid cell clusters result from locally organized connectivity of neural circuits in the MEC, then we would expect to find a corresponding organization of functional SC to PV+IN connections. In this case, stimulus locations that activate pairs of SCs should either be similar, if they are both part of the same functional zone, or distinct if they are each members of different zones. Alternatively, if there is no clear spatial organization of SC to PV+INs connections, then similarity between stimulus locations for pairs of SCs should have a random distribution.</p>
<p>To distinguish these possibilities, we built maps for responses of individual PV+INs across all stimulation sites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-E</xref>). We then calculated scores for cross correlations (Pearson’s coefficient (R)) between stimulus maps of simultaneously recorded PV+INs and compared them to scores generated by shuffled maps for each pair (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). We found that most cross-correlation scores differed significantly from chance, and maps could be positively or negatively correlated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). Examination of maps indicated that strong correlations (or anti-correlations) were associated with clear borders (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-D</xref>). The correlation score was independent of the stimulus intensity, indicating that rather than reflecting a particular subset of neurons it was a consistent property of the network (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, Figure Supplement 1I</xref>). When we compared the spatial correlation scores with input correlation probabilities for the same pairs of PV+INs, we found that pairs with strong spatial correlations typically had higher temporal input correlations, whereas pairs with low temporal input correlations also had low spatial input correlations (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, Figure Supplement 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these data suggest a structured functional organization of input from SCs to PV+INs, provide evidence for anatomical boundaries between populations of SCs, and suggest that for pairs of PV+INs that receive common input from SCs, common connectivity is not all to all, but arises from distinct subsets of SCs.</p>

<title>PV+INs have extensive axonal arborizations restricted to layer 2</title>
<p>How is inhibitory feedback in the reverse direction, from PV+INs to SCs, organized?

<p>We have introduced new approaches for assessing the functional organization of genetically identified neuronal populations. Using these approaches we find that direct functional interactions between SCs and PV+INs in L2 of the MEC appear localized largely to within ∼ 250 µm. The probability of shared connectivity in each direction is variable, with functional connections from SCs to PV+INs appearing to be demarcated by distinct boundaries.

In contrast, our primary goal was to address common coordination of downstream neurons by genetically defined upstream neurons. To do so, we introduced new strategies that are potentially applicable to many brain areas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). By recording from pairs of PV+INs (or SCs), and optogenetically activating SCs (or PV+INs) we were able to assess the extent and organization of projections from one population to the other. We find that with either wide-field or focussed optical activation of upstream neurons defined by genetically targeted expression of ChR2, it is possible to identify pairs of downstream neurons that receive common input. While with wide-field or focal activation strategies it is possible that weak connections are not detected, results from the two approaches corroborate one another showing similar location-dependence of functional synaptic connectivity.</p>
<p>Our approach to identifying common inputs to pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons is conceptually similar to classic investigations of circuits in visual cortex, which used focal glutamate uncaging to activate upstream neurons, while recording from pairs of postsynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005</xref>). An advantage of optogenetic activation is that we were able to address connectivity between genetically defined populations of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Our widefield and focal activation approaches both rely on the fact that neurons expressing ChR2 have different thresholds for initiation of spikes, and that their spike latency is variable from trial to trial. Therefore, responses in downstream cells that are highly correlated are likely to have a common origin. A possible concern with focal single photon optogenetic activation is that activation of axons or dendrites, rather than cell bodies, has limited spatial specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anastasiades et al., 2018</xref>). This means we are not able to identify the individual activated presynaptic neurons, but strict somatic localisation is not necessary for our conclusions based on asynchronous activation of presynaptic neurons. Nevertheless, adoption of soma-targeted opsins would be a useful extension to our approach by facilitating mapping of the activated presynaptic neurons.</p>

<title>Spatial extent and functional organization of L2 circuits</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate that activation of SCs leads to common excitatory synaptic input to pairs of PV+INs, and activation of PV+INs leads to common synaptic input leads to common synaptic input to pairs of SCs. Several features of this shared input may be relevant to network computations in L2 of the MEC. 1) Correlation coefficients indicative of common input in each direction were always less than 1 and usually in the region of 0.4 - 0.6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Thus connectivity in each direction may be incomplete rather than all to all, and the input to any pair of neurons is likely only to be partially overlapping (cf. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). The fact that axons were well preserved and typically extended beyond the range of functional correlations, while many cell pairs that did not receive correlated input were relatively close to one another, argues against incompleteness resulting from tissue slicing. 2) Local interactions through direct electrical synapses appear only able to coordinate PV+INs with short separations (&lt; 100 µm) relative to the extent of functional coordination, while synaptic interactions between PV+INs were not detected (Figure S4). 3) Many nearby cells don’t appear to share common input (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>, 5, 7), suggesting they are part of distinct networks, or are separated within the connectivity space of the same network. 4) Indirect inhibitory interactions can boost coordination for inputs in the DV plane, increasing the spatial extent of relatively strong correlations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). 5) The organization of slice locations that activate inputs from SCs to PV+INs is relatively similar for neurons that receive common input, can be anticorrelated for neurons that do not, and can often show discrete borders (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This is consistent with a modular organization within layer 2. 6) Pairs of SCs and pyramidal cells in L2 do not generate correlated responses when PV+INs are activated. This is consistent with SCs and pyramidal cells receiving inhibitory input from distinct interneuron populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fuchs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Varga et al., 2010</xref>)(but see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Armstrong et al., 2015</xref>)).</p>

<title>Ideas and speculation</title>
<p>Based on our results here, together with previous investigations of MEC connectivity using dual patch-clamp and optogenetic approaches, we suggest a tentative circuit model for L2 of the MEC in which interactions between SCs and PV+INs arise at several spatial scales (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). First, PV+INs separated by &lt; 100 µm interact through gap junction connections. Second, populations of interacting PV+INs and SCs separated by up to ∼250 µm form local modules defined by the common inputs between each cell population. Third, longer range output from SCs to non-PV INs may support coordination between modules. Candidates for this coordination could include interneurons on L1 of the MEC, which can have extensive intra-laminar axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shi et al., 2023</xref>), or PV negative interneurons in layer 2. We suggest this model as a starting point for further investigation of MEC connectivity.</p>

<p>What functional predictions follow from this model? It is of interest to compare the spatial scales for functional connectivity identified here with the organization of grid cell networks into modules composed of local clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gu et al., 2018</xref>). In principle, local shared inputs from SCs to PV+INs, and vice versa, could form a substrate for computation within grid cell clusters. Given the continuous attractor dynamics of grid cell populations observed experimentally, such connectivity could support emergence of activity bumps through excitatory-inhibitory interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guanella et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shipston-Sharman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Widloski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Widloski and Fiete, 2014</xref>). The incomplete connectivity between local SCs and PV+INs is consistent with structured connections expected within continuous attractor dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shipston-Sharman et al., 2016</xref>). In this framework, intra-modular coordination could result from interactions between clusters mediated by non-PV interneurons. Discrete and incomplete local connectivity could also be consistent with models for grid firing that do not require synaptic interactions between SCs or that focus on pyramidal neurons have also been proposed (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grossberg and Pilly, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kropff and Treves, 2008</xref>)). However, these models do not offer any explanation for the structured local circuitry and also do not account for the experimental evidence for continuous attractor dynamics of grid cell populations. Addressing these speculations will require strategies for improving throughput for circuit interrogation, for example through application of all optical approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hochbaum et al., 2014</xref>), and for mapping of connectivity onto the in vivo firing properties of identified neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ko et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Experiments were carried out under a project license granted by the UK Home Office and according to the guidelines laid down by the University of Edinburgh’s Animal Welfare Committee, the policies of the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and European Directive 2010/62/EU on the protection of animals used for experimental purposes. Male (43, 50%) and female (43, 50%) mice were both used. Mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups, and up to 6 mice were kept in a single cage. The following transgenic mouse lines were obtained from Jackson labs: PVFlp mice (B6.Cg-Pvalb-tm4.1(FlPo)Hze/J), which express Flp-recombinase downstream from the PV promoter; PVCre mice (B6;129P2-Pvalbtm1(cre)Arbr/J), which express Cre-recombinase downstream from the PV promoter; Sim1Cre mice (strain name: Tg(Sim1cre)KJ21Gsat/ Mmucd), which express Cre-recombinase downstream from the Sim1 promoter.</p>

<title>Injection of viruses</title>
<p>The following AAV vectors were used for channelrhodopsin-2 expression: pAAV-EF1a-double floxed-hChR2 (H134R)-EYFP-WPRE-HGHpA (Addgene plasmid #20298), pAAV-EF1a-double floxed-hChR2 (H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-HGHpA (Addgene plasmid #20297). Flp recombinase dependent AAV vectors were constructed in house. The viral construct pAM-FLEX-GFP (a gift from Peer Wulff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Murray et al., 2011</xref>)) was used as the viral backbone. The eGFP, loxP and lox2272 sites were removed and replaced with a synthesised cassette (GenScript) containing a multiple cloning site flanked by two sets of heterotypic (FRT and F3), antiparallel FRT sites to produce pAM FLPX. For pAM FLPX eGFP and pAM FLPX mCherry, the fluorescent proteins were amplified from pAM FLEX eGFP and pmCherry-C1 (Clontech) respectively, with EcoRI and SacI overhangs and cloned into pAM FLPX. All AAV preps were generated in house as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Murray et al., 2011</xref>) and were titered by qPCR following expression in HEK cells (&gt;10<sup>12</sup> GC/ml).</p>
<p>For experiments using multiple viruses they were mixed in equal volumes and injected simultaneously. Viruses were injected into either PvFlp x Sim1Cre mice, PVFlp or PVCre mice. Mice were 5-8 weeks old at the time of injection. Injections targeted the medial entorhinal cortex following procedures described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sürmeli et al., 2015</xref>). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane throughout the surgical procedures. After mounting to a stereotaxic frame, a craniotomy was made at 3.4 mm lateral and 0.6 mm posterior to bregma. in the right hemisphere. Viruses were injected using a calibrated micropipette (Drummond Scientific) pulled to a tip diameter of approximately 7-10 µm. For experiments using sagittal brain slices, three injections were made from the same surface coordinates with angles relative to the vertical axis of 8°, 10° and 12°. For experiments using horizontal brain slices additional injections were carried out at 3.3 mm and 3.5 mm lateral and 0.6 mm posterior to bregma, with an angle of 10° relative to vertical. The depth for each injection was determined by advancing the pipette until a slight bending was observed and then withdrawing the pipette 0.2 mm before injecting. 400 nl of viral mixture was injected at each position at a rate of approximately 20 nl / s.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p>Sagittal or horizontal brain slices of thickness 300 or 400 µm were prepared from the right hemisphere 5-7 weeks after viral injections as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Garden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pastoll et al., 2012b</xref>). Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and their brains carefully removed. Slices were prepared in cutting solution at 4 °C with composition (mM): NaCl 86, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4 1.2, KCl 2.5, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, Glucose 20, Sucrose 75, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 7. For recordings slices were placed in a chamber constantly perfused with oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) artificial cerebrospinal fluid maintained at 33-34 °C containing composition (mM): NaCl 124, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, KCl 2.5, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, Glucose 20, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1. Slices were visually inspected with epifluorescence to confirm specific expression of ChR2 in superficial layers of the MEC. Animals in which ChR2-expressing cell bodies were not restricted to layer 2 of the MEC were discarded from analysis.</p>
<p>Whole-cell recordings were performed using glass micropipettes pulled on a Sutter P-97 Micropipette Puller. For standard whole-cell recordings the intracellular solution had composition (mM): K-Gluconate 130; KCl 10, HEPES 10, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, EGTA 0.1, Na<sub>2</sub>ATP 2, Na<sub>2</sub>GTP 0.3, Na-Phosphocreatine 10 and biocytin 0.5%. The pipette resistance measured in the recording bath was 4-6 MΩ.</p>
<p>Series resistance was measured either by balancing the bridge in the current-clamp recording configuration or through compensation of capacitance transients in the voltage-clamp configuration, and was ≤ 25 MΩ (range 6.9 - 25 MΩ) for voltage-clamp experiments and &lt; 30 MΩ (range 13.3 - 27.7 MΩ) for current-clamp experiments. Series resistance in voltage-clamp recordings was compensated up to 70 %. Voltage-clamp recordings were performed with a holding potential of −70 mV unless otherwise indicated. Data were acquired and filtered at 6 kHz using a Multiclamp 700B Amplifier (Axon Instruments) and digitized at 20 kHz. All data were acquired using Axograph software.</p>
<p>To block GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission 20 µM GABAzine (Hello Bio) was added to the standard ACSF perfusing the slice. Experiments recording isolated inhibitory postsynaptic currents used ACSF including 5 µM NBQX (Hello Bio) and 50 µM D-AP5 (Hello Bio) and a modified intracellular solution with composition (mM): KCl 140, HEPES 10, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, EGTA 0.1, Na<sub>2</sub>ATP 2, Na<sub>2</sub>GTP 0.3, Na-Phosphocreatine 10 and biocytin 0.5%. Stellate cells were identified by their characteristic sag potentials in response to negative and positive current steps and by their prominent afterhyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pastoll et al., 2012a</xref>). To facilitate recovery of the axonal morphology of recorded neurons we did the following (see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>)).</p>

<title>Neuronal reconstruction</title>
<p>The recorded principal cells were filled with intracellular solutions containing biocytin for at least 1 hour. Identification of stellate cells and pyramidal cells was further confirmed post-hoc by the multiple dendritic processes in the former and the prominent apical dendrites in the latter. Cell data with incomplete biocytin-filled morphology were discarded from analysis. Stellate cells were excluded if the axon was cut prior to leaving the entorhinal cortex.</p>
<p>Biocytin-filled cells were manually reconstructed using Neurolucida 360 software (MBF Bioscience) and analyzed using Neurolucida Explorer (MBF Bioscience). To correct X and Y shrinkage, a 4x magnification image from the electrophysiology rig was compared to a 4x confocal image using a 250 μm grid scaled for the electrophysiology rig. Distances of interest (e.g. distance from the cell to the dorsal border of the MEC) were scaled from the 4x image to the 4x confocal image (Pastoll et al, 2012). To correct Z shrinkage the depth of the imaged fixed slice was rescaled to the depth of the slice during recording.</p>

<title>Photo-stimulation</title>
<p>For widefield activation of ChR2 we used a 470-nm LED (Thorlabs) attached to the epifluorescence port of the experimental microscope (Olympus BX-51), and focused onto the slice chamber using a 40x objective (Olympus). The irradiance of the LED was controlled by custom analogue voltage commands. The maximal intensity used in this study was ∼22 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. The region of neurons activated by the LED had a radius of approximately 100 µm and depth greater than 100 µm. Before evaluating responses to asynchronous activation of presynaptic neurons, we tested each cell pair for functional ChR2 driven postsynaptic responses using a 3 ms duration square pulse of intensity ∼22 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> delivered 3 times. We included cell pairs for analysis when both cells demonstrated suprathreshold membrane potential responses in current-clamp mode or amplitude of EPSCs/IPSCs &gt; 100 pA in voltage-clamp mode. To asynchronously activate ChR2 expressing neurons, we used an 8 s duration ramp-modulated light stimulus (∼10 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> final intensity) repeated 5 times and with the field of view centered approximately at the equal point between two simultaneously recorded cells.</p>
<p>For focal activation of ChR2, laser light was generated using a 100 mW 473-nm diode laser (RappOpto; Hamburg, Germany), integrated into the light path of the microscope and focused onto the slice using a 40x objective. A neutral density filter with 1 % transmission rate was used to attenuate the laser beam. In the focal plane of the slice the diameter of the stimulation site was ∼1 µm. Stimulation sites were organized in a 7 x 10 grid with adjacent sites spaced 20 µm apartalong each rows and columns, giving an overall scanning area of 120 µm x 180 µm. The longer scanning axis was parallel to the dorsal-ventral axis in sagittal slices and the medial-lateral axis in horizontal slices. The center of the laser scanning area was focused on the region where ChR2-expressing cell bodies were most abundant. In cases where the viral expression between the pair of recorded cells was homogenous, the objective was focused approximately at the equal point between the two recorded cells. In the laser scanning protocol, a 1-ms light pulse was applied to one location at a time. Five locations were stimulated per second in a serial, pseudorandom order, with 5 s breaks after every 15 s of laser scanning. The laser scanning was repeated 10 times for each laser power. Data were sampled at a range of laser powers, from the intensity that gives minimum light-evoked responses to the minimum laser intensity that renders light-evoked responses from all the 70 scanning sites. The step size of linear increment of laser power was 10 or 100 µW, according to the range of light responsiveness of recorded cells. The trials in which the baseline was fluctuating were excluded from analysis.</p>

<title>Data analysis and statistics</title>
<p>All data were analyzed using built in and custom written routines in IGOR pro (Wavemetrics), Axograph and MATLAB (Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox; Mathworks).</p>
<p>The spike trains of ChR2-expressing SCs in response to ramp-modulated light stimulus were convolved into simulated postsynaptic EPSC waveforms using the following functions:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="558206v2_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>g</italic> is the conductance, <italic>gmax</italic> is the maximum conductance (set to 1 µS), <italic>tau</italic> is the time to peak of the conductance change (1 ms), <italic>i</italic> is the synaptic current, <italic>v</italic> is the resting membrane potential (−70 mV) and <italic>e</italic> is the equilibrium potential for the transmitter-gated event (0 mV).</p>
<p>In the model, the SC inputs assigned to two PV cell were randomized in each simulation and EPSC waveforms to a given PV cell were linearly summated. The number of presynaptic SCs to any postsynaptic PV cell remained constant, which is 8 presynaptic cells in all simulations, and the 8 SC inputs were also randomly assigned to two PV cells in each simulation.</p>
<p>Electrophysiological data were filtered with bandpass between 10 and 120 Hz. The cross-correlation coefficients were calculated every 10 ms with a shifting 250-ms time window. The maximum cross-correlation coefficient was calculated by averaging and smoothing cross-correlation coefficients over 5 trials, and extracting the maximal value during photo-stimulation. The minimum variance of time lags was calculated by averaging and smoothing the standard deviation of time lags over 5 trials, extracting and squaring the minimal value during the time series of photo-stimulation.</p>
<p>For data obtained from laser-scanning experiments, EPSCs were detected using built-in function in Axograph. The onsets of EPSCs were binned into histograms using 4-ms bins. Cross-correlation analysis was performed individually for each scanning location. To calculate the correlation probability, cross-correlograms from all scanning locations across all trials were summed up. The value in the central bin of the shifted cross-correlogram was subtracted from that of the unshifted cross-correlogram and then this value was divided by the average estimated total number of evoked EPSCs (see detailed methods in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>For event detection in the Axograph software, we first defined a template EPSC function from experimental data, and we set the algorithm to detect the shape of EPSC events that matches the template function including the events that overlap partially in time. The signal-to-noise ratio for detecting events is 2.5.</p>
<p>The densities of reconstructed axons and dendrites were calculated using the TREES toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cuntz et al., 2011</xref>). The size of voxels was 5 µm in the calculation of densities of cellular processes. We varied the distance between two postsynaptic cells and their locations relative to the presynaptic cell along either dorsoventral or mediolateral axes in each simulation. An estimate of axodendritic overlapping was measured by multiplying voxel by voxel densities of presynaptic and postsynaptic neuronal processes and summing across all voxels. We normalized this value with the value obtained by setting the soma of three neurons to the same coordinates, which gives a ratio of overlapping. To specifically evaluate the axodendritic overlapping from one presynaptic neurons onto two postsynaptic neurons, we only consider the cases where the axodendritic densities of both pre- and postsynaptic pairs are positive values, otherwise we set the ratio of overlapping to be zero.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The circuit mechanism underlying the formation of grid cell activity and the organization of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is still unclear. To understand the mechanism, the current study investigated synaptic interactions between stellate cells (SC) and PV+ interneurons (IN) in layer 2 of the MEC by combing optogenetic activations and paired patch-clamp recordings. The results convincingly demonstrated highly structured interactions between these neurons: specific and direct excitatory-inhibitory interactions existed at the scale of grid cell phase clusters, and indirect interactions occurred at the scale of grid modules.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Overall, the manuscript is very well written, the approaches used are clever, and the data were thoroughly analyzed. The study conveyed important information for understanding the circuit mechanism that shapes grid cell activity. It is important not only for the field of MEC and grid cells, but also for broader fields of continuous attractor networks and neural circuits.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
(1) The study largely relies on the fact that ramp-like wide-field optogenetic stimulation and focal optogenetic activation both drove asynchronous action potentials in SCs, and therefore, if a pair of PV+ INs exhibited correlated activity, they should receive common inputs. However, it is unclear what criteria/thresholds were used to determine the level of activity asynchronization, and under these criteria, what percentage of cells actually showed synchronized or less asynchronized activity. A notable percentage of synchronized or less asynchronized SCs could complicate the results, i.e., PV+ INs with correlated activity could receive inputs from different SCs (different inputs), which had synchronized activity. More detailed information/statistics about the asynchronization of SC activity is necessary for interpreting the results.</p>
<p>(2) The hypothesis about the &quot;direct excitatory-inhibitory&quot; synaptic interactions is made based on the GABAzine experiments in Figure 4. In the Figure 8 diagram, the direct interaction is illustrated between PV+ INs and SCs. However, the evidence supporting this &quot;direct interaction&quot; between these two cell types is missing. Is it possible that pyramidal cells are also involved in this interaction? Some pieces of evidence or discussions are necessary to further support the &quot;direction interaction&quot;.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, Huang et al. employed optogenetic stimulation alongside paired whole-cell recordings in genetically defined neuron populations of the medial entorhinal cortex to examine the spatial distribution of synaptic inputs and the functional-anatomical structure of the MEC. They specifically studied the spatial distribution of synaptic inputs from parvalbumin-expressing interneurons to pairs of excitatory stellate cells. Additionally, they explored the spatial distribution of synaptic inputs to pairs of PV INs. Their results indicate that both pairs of SCs and PV INs generally receive common input when their relative somata are within 200-300 ums of each other. The research is intriguing, with controlled and systematic methodologies. There are interesting takeaways based on the implications of this work to grid cell network organization in MEC.</p>
<p>Major concerns</p>
<p>1. Results indicate that in brain slices, nearby cells typically share a higher degree of common input. However, some proximate cells lack this shared input. The authors interpret these findings as: &quot;Many cells in close proximity don't seem to share common input, as illustrated in Figures 3, 5, and 7. This implies that these cells might belong to separate networks or exist in distinct regions of the connectivity space within the same network.&quot;.</p>
<p>Every slice orientation could have potentially shared inputs from an orthogonal direction that are unavoidably eliminated. For instance, in a horizontal section, shared inputs to two SCs might be situated either dorsally or ventrally from the horizontal cut, and thus removed during slicing. Given the synaptic connection distributions observed within each intact orientation, and considering these distributions appear symmetrically in both horizontal and sagittal sections, the authors should be equipped to estimate the potential number of inputs absent due to sectioning in the orthogonal direction. How might this estimate influence the findings, especially those indicating that many close neurons don't have shared inputs?</p>
<p>1. The study examines correlations during various light-intensity phases of the ramp stimuli. One wonders if the spatial distribution of shared (or correlated) versus independent inputs differs when juxtaposing the initial light stimulation phase, which begins to trigger spiking, against subsequent phases. This differentiation might be particularly pertinent to the PV to SC measurements. Here, the initial phase of stimulation, as depicted in Figure 7, reveals a relatively sparse temporal frequency of IPSCs. This might not represent the physiological conditions under which high-firing INs function.</p>
<p>While the authors seem to have addressed parts of this concern in their focal stim experiments by examining correlations during both high and low light intensities, they could potentially extract this metric from data acquired in their ramp conditions. This would be especially valuable for PV to SC measurements, given the absence of corresponding focal stimulation experiments.</p>
<p>1. Re results from Figure 2: Please fully describe the model in the methods section. Generally, I like using a modeling approach to explore the impact of convergent synaptic input to PVs from SCs that could effectively validate the experimental approach and enhance the interpretability of the experimental stim/recording outcomes. However, as currently detailed in the manuscript, the model description is inadequate for assessing the robustness of the simulation outcomes. If the IN model is simply integrate-and-fire with minimal biophysical attributes, then the findings in Fig 2F results shown in Fig 2F might be trivial. Conversely, if the model offers a more biophysically accurate representation (e.g., with conductance-based synaptic inputs, synapses appropriately dispersed across the model IN dendritic tree, and standard PV IN voltage-gated membrane conductances), then the model's results could serve as a meaningful method to both validate and interpret the experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This paper presents convincing data from technically demanding dual whole-cell patch recordings of stellate cells in medial entorhinal cortex slice preparations during optogenetic stimulation of PV+ interneurons. The authors show that the patterns of postsynaptic activation are consistent with dual recorded cells close to each other receiving shared inhibitory input and sending excitatory connections back to the same PV neurons, supporting a circuitry in which clusters of stellate cells and PV+IN interact with each other with much weaker interactions between clusters. These data are important to our understanding of the dynamics of functional cell responses in the entorhinal cortex. The experiments and analysis are quite complex and would benefit from some revisions to enhance clarity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
These are technically demanding experiments, but the authors show quite convincing differences in the correlated response of cell pairs that are close to each other in contrast to an absence of correlation in other cell pairs at a range of relative distances. This supports their main point of demonstrating anatomical clusters of cells receiving shared inhibitory input.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The overall technique is complex and the presentation could be more clear about the techniques and analysis. In addition, due to this being a slice preparation they cannot directly relate the inhibitory interactions to the functional properties of grid cells which was possible in the 2-photon in vivo imaging experiment by Heys and Dombeck, 2014.</p>
