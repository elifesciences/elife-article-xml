Initial growth periods showed phylogenetic signal, and their length (0.75-4.3 Myr) parallels the expansion and adaptation phases of taxon cycles, a framework of lineage expansion and eventual contraction over time encompassing biogeography and evolutionary ecology.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Modern genomic methods enable estimation of a lineage’s long-term effective population sizes back to its origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li &amp; Durbin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mazet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nadachowska-Brzyska et al., 2015</xref>). This ability allows unprecedented opportunities to study the populational effects of past evolutionary and climatic phenomena on organismal lineages, and this new area of paleodemographics is likely to grow rapidly (Nadachowska-Brzyska et al. 2021, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Germain et al. 2023a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">b</xref>). We use this approach in a novel way to test hypotheses about how adoption of a major life-history trait affected lineages’ populations relative to those without the trait.</p>
<p>Seasonal migration is a common life-history strategy among the world’s birds, but its effects on long-term population sizes relative to lineages that don’t have this trait are largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Newton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rappole, 2013</xref>). Demographic differences between seasonally migratory and resident lineages have been studied for decades, but, thus far, ecological, behavioral, and genetic approaches have necessarily been focused on recent and microevolutionary phenomena (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Greenberg, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pérez-Tris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sandercock &amp; Jaramillo, 2002</xref>). Here we look much deeper, contrasting changes in effective population sizes through millions of years between closely related migratory and resident lineages.</p>
<p>Thrushes in the genus <italic>Catharus</italic> and this group’s sister <italic>Hylocichla mustelina</italic> (Aves: Turdidae) are a model songbird system for studying the evolutionary effects of seasonal migration. This group has both migratory and resident lineages, and it has been important in the study of seasonal migration, divergence, and speciation (e.g., Delmore et al,. 2015, 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Outlaw et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Ruegg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Termignoni-Garcia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Voelker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Winker, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Winker and Pruett, 2006</xref>). These animals are relatively small, omnivorous or insectivorous, forest-related birds with lineages that are long-distance seasonal migrants in North America and others that are resident in tropical North and South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Collar, 2005</xref>). The breeding grounds of the migratory lineages span Siberia, Alaska, northern Canada, and the United States, and their wintering ranges include Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and tropical South America. In contrast, the resident lineages occupy Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America (Collar, 2005; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p>We made three predictions about effective population sizes (<italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>) in seasonally migratory versus resident lineages of these thrushes: 1) <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>would on average be higher among seasonal migrants; 2) variation in population size would also be higher; and 3) early population growth would be higher as seasonal migration opens novel ecological and geographic space, achieving the first prediction.</p>
<p>These predictions stem from the following reasoning. We can think of North America roughly as an inverted triangle, with substantially more geographic space in the north than in the south. Among these thrushes, the migratory lineages breed in that northern, on average, larger space. The resident lineages instead currently occupy, on average, smaller geographic ranges, even in South America, where they are largely montane (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). Thus, larger breeding ranges among migrants, on average, should yield higher population sizes. But climatic variability is also higher with increased latitude, often temporarily rendering vast swaths of northern North America unoccupiable to many long-distance migrant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pielou, 1991</xref>). Thus, higher-latitude breeding occupancy should cause larger fluctuations in population size. Finally, seasonal migration is likely to cause enhanced ecological (and in this case also geographic) release (i.e., in the occupancy of new niche space) in relation to resident relatives. Thus, as migratory lineages’ mobility enabled them to take advantage of seasonal resource blooms in ecosystems at higher latitudes and expand their breeding ranges, their populations should have grown proportionally more and at a faster rate than sedentary lineages. Here we test these predictions by reconstructing effective population sizes of these thrush lineages through time using whole-genome data and the pairwise sequential Markovian coalescent (PSMC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li &amp; Durbin, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The focal variables of our hypotheses all lacked phylogenetic signal. Mean effective population sizes and their variation were both higher among migratory lineages, as predicted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <italic>U</italic> = 6 and 9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 0.05, respectively; one-tailed Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test). The degree of early population growth was also proportionally higher among migrants, as predicted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <italic>U</italic> = 9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; one-tailed Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test), but the rate of this early growth was not different between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <italic>U</italic> = 21.5, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p>

<p>To examine why the degree of initial migrant population growth was higher but the rate of growth was not, we considered that this might be because that growth extended over a longer period of time. To our surprise, we found that among migrants these growth periods were remarkably long, ranging from 1.67-4.26 My and averaging 2.97 My (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). It appeared that migratory lineages did have a longer initial period of growth (migrants mean <italic>deltaT</italic> = 2.97 My vs. resident mean <italic>deltaT</italic> = 1.49 My; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Unlike our other variables, initial growth period (<italic>deltaT</italic>) showed significant phylogenetic signal (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>), requiring PGLS analyses, which supported this post-hoc hypothesis, both with actual branch lengths and with branch lengths set to 1.0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>). We also used this approach to examine the relationship between <italic>deltaT</italic> and breeding latitude (also significant) and to confirm the relationship between migration and breeding latitude (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition to testing our hypotheses, our results reveal other important attributes of these songbirds. First, they appear to show few of the general population declines at the beginning of the last glacial period (LGP, ∼115 Kya) that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nadachowska-Brzyska et al. (2016)</xref> found among a global sampling of birds (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, S4). Secondly, and more importantly, there is a general lack of temporal synchrony in historic population size changes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, S4), despite considerable geographic proximity and overlap of ranges (especially during the nonbreeding season). Finally, a pattern widely shared in the group is that most of the recent populations are below each lineage’s historic peak, and this trend predates the arrival of humans in the New World (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, S4). A striking exception is <italic>C. ustulatus swainsoni</italic>, which has had remarkable long-term growth (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to contrast long-term effective population size changes among closely related species to test <italic>a priori</italic> hypotheses about the population effects of a major life-history trait; here we focused on seasonal migration. This perspective offers several new insights into migrant demographics and evolutionary ecology. Migratory thrush lineages showed higher effective population sizes, greater population size variation, and proportionally larger initial population growth than resident relatives. A migratory life-history strategy thus imbues these lineages with population size characteristics that are fundamentally different, on average, from those of resident relatives.</p>
<p>Although migratory thrush lineages showed higher proportional initial growth than resident relatives, this was not achieved through rapid adaptation to new environments as we predicted. Population growth in migrants and residents was positive early in the lineages’ histories (<italic>deltaT</italic>) in all cases but one (<italic>C. aurantiirostris</italic>), and it occurred over fairly long periods of time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). That this process initially (on average) involves millions of years of population growth in this group, apparently extended by a migratory life-history strategy that provided access to higher latitudes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">S2</xref>), is an insight from our study that bears examination from a broader taxonomic perspective. While actual, census population sizes would likely have shown considerable variation across this time, especially after the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene began ∼2.6 Mya, the long-term effective population sizes of migrants tended to show steady increases, achieving peaks on average almost 3 My after the lineages’ PSMC inception (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>, S4; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>With <italic>deltaT</italic> being both long and showing phylogenetic signal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>), one can envision in this group a sort of ur-thrush trajectory in which unique, lineage-specific processes occur as each evolves, influenced by ancestry, geography, ecological factors, and life-history strategy. These long periods of early growth are concordant with the initial expansion or adaptation phases of taxon cycles, a conceptual framework of lineage expansion and contraction over time through interactions between biogeography and evolutionary ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pepke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ricklefs &amp; Bermingham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ricklefs &amp; Cox, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wilson, 1961</xref>).</p>
<p>Another noteworthy pattern widely shared in this group is that most recent populations are below each lineage’s historic peak (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, S4). This, too, is reminiscent of taxon cycles (smaller populations in later stages), and this trend both predates the arrival of humans in the New World (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>) and reflects a broader pattern of historic avian declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Germain et al. 2023b</xref>). Yet another pattern is a general lack of temporal synchrony in historic population size changes, despite considerable geographic proximity and overlap of ranges (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, S4). In their review of taxon cycles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ricklefs &amp; Bermingham (2002)</xref> inferred from such a lack of similarity among lineages that each is in a unique population-environment relationship, responding idiosyncratically in a coevolutionary relationship with factors such as parasites, predators, pathogens, and competitors.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Population structure</title>
<p>PSMC estimates of population size can be affected by population structure: a change in structure can produce the signal of a change in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mazet et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wakeley, 1999</xref>). Some of the population size changes we observed might therefore reflect changes only in levels of population connectivity. There are well-understood differences between seasonal migrants and residents in population structure. Migrants generally have lower levels of geographic partitioning of both phenotypic (subspecies) and genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Belliure et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Delmore et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mayr, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Montgomery, 1896</xref>). The resident lineages we studied are more prone to this structure than the migrant lineages, with migrants having an average of 2.5 subspecies per lineage and residents having an average of 5.9 (Collar, 2005). Migratory lineages therefore come closer to meeting the assumption of PSMC analyses that populations are panmictic. Thus, in addition to our geographic scenario differing between the migrant and resident lineages we studied, we also have a pervasive effect of population structure affecting our results, likely increasingly complementing geographic expansion among seasonal migrants as lineage ages approach the recent.</p>
<p>Accounting for population structure in these models to distinguish between the two phenomena is a difficult computational problem, and the correlation is not simple, and it might not be tractable with data from a single individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mazet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nadachowska-Brzyska et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">2022</xref>). However, each individual has a genome amalgamated from the entire lineage metapopulation, including individuals and populations that have not been sampled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mazet et al., 2015</xref>). When not focusing on relatively recent or rapid changes (e.g., in human or other bottlenecked systems, where this has been most studied), these issues are probably not as important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mazet et al., 2016</xref>). For example, sister lineages usually show identical effective population size attributes at their origins, reflecting their shared histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Delmore et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li &amp; Durbin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nadachowska-Brzyska et al., 2016</xref>). Inasmuch as many of our most interesting results are in deep time, where we expect current individuals of a lineage to have the most thorough mixing or amalgamation of lineage-specific metapolulation history, the effects of population structure are likely to become less important and the results reflect (as we have necessarily interpreted) more of a lineage-wide phenomenon than a variably structured, demically biased one. However, it is clear that the latter bias becomes stronger as lineages progress toward the present, and for more recent times population structure will be an important aspect of comparing effective population size estimates and their changes between migrant and resident lineages (in this respect we were conservative in ignoring the most recent 50 Kyr).</p>
<p>At present, there is no way to fully disentangle the effects of population structure and geographic space on our results, but we make two observations leading us to infer that general differences in population structure are not the main factor driving our results. First, structure will have smaller effects on the PSMC signal in the deep past than in more recent history. Second, climatic changes are known to cause coordinated shifts among codistributed taxa, e.g., in promoting the partitioning of genetic variation among glacial refugia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hewitt, 2000</xref>). A lack of coordinated shifts in our PSMC results suggests that climate-driven shifts in population structure are not a major feature (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Geography and evolutionary ecology</title>
<p>Early population growth among migrant lineages is likely affected by some degree of ecological release as these birds engage with the novel environments their increased movements expose them to and occupy new niche space. However, in this system we cannot readily decouple the expanded geographic and ecological opportunities that seasonal migration provides. The relationship between avian range size and migration is complex, but correlation with latitude is notably strong in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pegan &amp; Winger, 2020</xref>). Two aspects of our results suggest that geography operating alone is unlikely to explain the larger migrant population sizes observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). The first is that early population growth is positive in all but one of the lineages we studied; despite a probable lack of marked geographic expansion among residents, they, too, experienced long-term growth. The second is that these initial growth periods are quite long, extending over much longer periods than we should expect populations to respond to opportunities for geographic expansion.</p>
<p>PSMC analyses excel at long time frames, but initial growth in residents and migrants suggests a strong role for ecological factors. Global climate reconstruction data do not suggest that there were similar long, steady trends during these time periods to match these thrush population size changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lisiecki &amp; Raymo, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Perhaps geographic space does make a difference, on average, between the two life-history strategies. That these growth periods are long also suggest the importance of ecological factors, though. For example, the boreal and subarctic woodland breeding habitats of most <italic>C. ustulatus swainsoni</italic> and <italic>C. minimus</italic> expanded dramatically across North America as glaciers receded since the last glacial maximum (LGM), a period of &lt; 20 Kyr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pielou, 1991</xref>). A spatial response of such rapidity, less than 1% of the time of the initial historic growth phases of these two lineages (&gt; 3 Myr; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), leads us to infer that breeding range size alone is not a satisfactory explanation for our results. This reflects census size, and not effective population size (<italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>), but it implies that a migratory <italic>Catharus</italic> lineage’s matching (or mapping) of <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> to average long-term available geographic space is not likely to take millions of years. Or, to put it another way, their comparatively recent rapid expansion into new space suggests a sort of preadaptation that is not apparent early in the lineages’ histories. Together, these aspects of our results suggest that while geographic factors are involved, ecological factors are also important. Teasing these factors apart might also explain the recent finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Germain et al. (2023a)</xref> that migrants in general have had larger populations than residents during the last 0.67 my.</p>
<p>Identifying key ecological mechanisms affecting population sizes among migrants is difficult, and they will likely vary among lineages. Biotic interactions in general show greater effects on range limits at the warmer than the cooler edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Paquette &amp; Hargreaves, 2021</xref>). Long-distance migrants especially, in their extensive latitudinal movements, would receive a range expansion advantage in this respect regardless of continental landmass shape. Many ecological factors affect the population sizes of migrants versus residents, but the relationships between seasonal migration and predators, parasites, diseases, and competitors are extremely complex and key aspects remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Altizer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Newton, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Seasonal migration can be integrally related to predator avoidance, but among birds its effects are not understood in the full, circannual context relative to resident relatives and they are not generalizable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brönmark et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">McKinnon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Newton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rappole, 2013</xref>). Exposure to parasites and pathogens varies both spatially and seasonally. Although breeding range diminishment of these exposures can be important in some migrants (probably not among all lineages), full annual exposure to both disease and parasite diversity is likely higher, resulting in at least some lineages showing larger immune defense organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bennett &amp; Fallis, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Figuerola &amp; Green, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jenkins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Møller &amp; Erritzoe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Piersma, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ricklefs et al., 2017</xref>). Exposure to higher circannual parasite and pathogen diversity might not be correlated with susceptibility, however; migration creates a geographic break that can lower transmission, causing migrants overall to be less vulnerable to population declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hall et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Presently <italic>C. minimus</italic> shows an increased breeding and migratory prevalence and diversity of avian malaria, a blood parasite, but aspects of this relationship probably changed over the time scales involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pulgarín-R et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ricklefs et al., 2014</xref>). Avian migrants are more likely to be affected by blood parasites in ecological rather than evolutionary time, although the latter are also operating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hellgren et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ricklefs et al., 2014</xref>). At the deeper times of avian families, seasonal migration is an important factor affecting blood parasite-host coevolution by breaking down the congruence of phylogenetic relationships between hosts and parasites, and there are also important differences among biting-fly vectors and their transmission of avian blood parasite hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jenkins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ricklefs et al., 2014</xref>). These issues suggest that reconstructing associations and their effects in deep time will be difficult.</p>
<p>Interspecific competition has long been studied between migrants and residents, but its potential role in affecting relative population sizes between the two groups is largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rappole, 2013</xref>). As close relatives, these thrushes are likely to be each others’ closest competitors, so it is conceivable that the increased relative abundance of migrants might depress realized population sizes among residents. In this group, geographic ranges overlap broadly during the nonbreeding season, but the tropical residents tend to occupy higher elevations than nonbreeding migrants (Collar, 2005). Both interspecific competition and inland, montane, and mature-forest retreats among older taxa are major factors in taxon cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ricklefs &amp; Bermingham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ricklefs &amp; Cox, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wilson, 1961</xref>) and might also be operating in this system.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>High-quality, genome-scale data offer important new insights into the effects of the major life-history trait of seasonal migration on long-term effective population sizes. Our results indicate larger and more variable migrant populations relative to residents, and these populations grow in a way suggesting an important role not only for seasonal migration and geography, but also for ancestry and evolutionary ecology. The differences we found are between group averages, and variation among lineages includes residents that are migrant-like (<italic>C. occidentalis</italic>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, S4) and vice-versa (e.g., <italic>C. u. ustulatus</italic>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Understanding why residents like <italic>C. occidentalis</italic> show migrant-like historic population characteristics will help us understand the mechanisms affecting these lineages. Such reasons could be as simple as realized range expansion (i.e., geographic and ecological opportunity), and this hypothesis appears to fit the deeply split eastern-western sister lineages within species in which smaller western ranges have smaller effective population sizes (<italic>C. guttatus</italic> and <italic>C. ustulatus</italic>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Or the reasons might be as complex as a lineage dropping out of migration to become sedentary (<italic>C. occidentalis</italic> is sister to the migrant <italic>C. guttatus</italic>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
<p>What other patterns will emerge across geographic, temporal, and phylogenetic space? Further sampling among other closely related groups containing mixed lineages of migrants and residents are needed, as are complementary approaches to reconstructing demographic history, using more individuals per lineage and other population genomic methods applicable to that sampling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beichman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Delmore et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Marchi et al., 2021</xref>). Such studies will also help determine the relative contributions of seasonal migration and its range and ecological expansion components in the context of what appears to be a normal and phylogenetically influenced tendency for early lineage growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>, S4, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>The thrush lineages in our study are from the genus <italic>Catharus</italic> and its sister, the single species in the genus <italic>Hylocichla</italic>. These comprise Nearctic-Neotropic seasonal migrants and Neotropical residents. Among the latter, some lineages (<italic>C. aurantiirostris</italic>, <italic>occidentalis</italic>, <italic>frantzii</italic>, and <italic>mexicanus</italic>) have some populations that exhibit some short-distance migration—likely partial migration or hard-weather movements, either in elevation or with extreme northern populations moving south (Collar, 2005). These lineages thus comprise two groups, which for simplicity we will refer to as ‘seasonal migrants’ and ‘residents’: seasonal migrants with extensive latitudinal movements, and residents that are either wholly sedentary or with some individuals moving rather limited distances within the Neotropics. The eight migrant lineages are: <italic>Hylocichla mustelina</italic>, <italic>Catharus fuscescens</italic>, <italic>C. guttatus</italic> E (eastern lineage), <italic>C. guttatus</italic> W (western lineage), <italic>C. minimus</italic>, <italic>C. ustulatus swainsoni</italic>, <italic>C. u. ustulatus</italic>, and <italic>C. bicknelli</italic>. (Note that four of these lineages represent two deeply divergent lineages each within what are currently considered two biological species, <italic>C. guttatus</italic> and <italic>C. ustulatus</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Topp et al., 2013</xref>). The six resident lineages are: <italic>Catharus aurantiirostris</italic>, <italic>C. fuscater</italic>, <italic>C. frantzii</italic>, <italic>C. gracilirostris</italic>, <italic>C. mexicanus</italic>, and <italic>C. occidentalis</italic>. Over the full evolutionary history of this <italic>Hylocichla-Catharus</italic> clade, changes among lineages occurred in the trait of long-distance migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Outlaw et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Voelker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Winker and Pruett, 2006</xref>). Our study does not assume that this trait was constant within each lineage after the speciation events when these switches occurred. Instead, we consider that for a major trait like long-distance migration, losses and gains at the full lineage level are likely to be infrequent, and that current evidence of trait distribution on a phylogeny provides a powerful comparative framework in which to elucidate the effects of that trait on other lineage attributes.</p>
<p>DNA was extracted from high-quality voucher specimens or blood samples for 14 thrush lineages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>). Whole-genome sequencing libraries were constructed using Nextera (Illumina) DNA Flex Library Prep kits, and libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq S4 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using paired-end 150 bp reads. Reads were aligned to the <italic>C. ustulatus</italic> genome (inland subspecies, Reference bCatUst1, NCBI PRJNA613294) using bwa (mem algorithm with default settings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li and Durbin 2009</xref>). Resulting .sam files were converted to .bam format with samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li et al., 2009</xref>); picardtools was used to clean, sort and add read groups to .bam files (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). Between 97 and 98% of reads mapped to the reference for an average read depth of 23 bp (range 15.9-29.8).</p>
<p>We analyzed whole-genomic data from the .bam files using the pairwise sequential Markovian coalescent (PSMC) approach in the software package psmc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li &amp; Durbin, 2011</xref>). This analysis uses pairwise (allelic) estimates of coalescent times for each locus across the genome, developing a distribution of times to most recent common ancestor (TMRCAs), and the frequency of these coalescent events is inversely proportional to effective population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li &amp; Durbin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mather et al., 2020</xref>). We used a generation time of 2.5 yr, taken as an average among many of these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dellinger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Evans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mack &amp; Yong, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Saether et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Townsend et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Whitaker et al., 2020</xref>), and a mutation rate of 2.3 × 10<sup>−9</sup> mutations per site per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Smeds et al., 2016</xref>). Single individuals represent lineage characteristics using this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li &amp; Durbin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mazet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nadachowska-Brzyska et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly for our focal questions, variations in these parameters do not affect the shape of the curve of population sizes (<italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>) through time, but rather the values of the time and <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nadachowska-Brzyska et al. 2015</xref>). Being closely related and of similar size, we expect these taxa to have very similar generation times and mutation rates (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bird et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Healy et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The PSMC method is not foolproof; for example, aspects of selection, inbreeding, and isolation can affect population size estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mather et al., 2020</xref>). No method of genomic population demographic reconstruction is known to be consistently and reliably accurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Marchi et al., 2021</xref>), but uniform application of a powerful method like PSMC to genome-scale data in a closely related group of lineages can provide new insights into the evolutionary effects of major life-history strategies.</p>
<p>For all variables, PSMC output for times more recent than 50 Kya was ignored, because recent estimates of effective population size are less reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li &amp; Durbin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nadachowska-Brzyska et al., 2016</xref>). We consider this to be a conservative cutoff date. Our two focal variables, mean effective population size (<italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>) and the coefficient of variation (SD/mean), were obtained from standard PSMC output. Our examination of early population growth involved deriving two additional variables from the PSMC output: degree of initial growth (1 - (<italic>N</italic><sub>trough</sub>/<italic>N</italic><sub>peak</sub>)), and rate of growth (degree/time period over which initial growth occurred; the latter we term <italic>deltaT</italic>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). We note that estimates of the dates of divergence events in <italic>Catharus</italic> evolution vary by study, genetic marker, methodology, and parameter estimates such as generation time and mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Outlaw et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Topp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Voelker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Winker and Pruett, 2006</xref>). Date estimates in our study that differ from previous work reflect these methodological issues, and here it is the relative values among lineages that are most important.</p>
<p>We tested the assumption of phylogenetic independence of continuous characters obtained from the PSMC analyses using a phylogeny reconstructed using maximum likelihood from 1.5 Mb of autosomal sequence from chromosome 22 in MEGA X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kumar et al. 2018</xref>), which produced the expected topology given prior work (e.g., Everson et al. 2019), and, for phylogenetic independence, the Abouheif-Moran approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abouheif, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Münkenmüller et al., 2012</xref>) as implemented in the R package adephylo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jombart et al., 2010</xref>). For those variables not showing phylogenetic signal, we tested our hypotheses using a one-tailed Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. This nonparametric test has the advantage of not requiring that particular assumptions are met (e.g., homogeneity of variance), nor precise measurements (thus accommodating uncertainty in our <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> estimates; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sokal &amp; Rohlf, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Whitlock &amp; Schluter, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) was used in a post-hoc analyses to test for differences in the single variable (<italic>deltaT</italic>) that showed phylogenetic signal and in followup analyses bringing in breeding latitude directly. PGLS can accommodate tests for relationships with discrete traits (here migratory-sedentary) and is basically a linear regression weighted in this case by <italic>detaT</italic>’s phylogenetic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Freckleton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Symonds &amp; Blomberg, 2014</xref>). Because this genus has experienced considerable interspecific gene flow (Everson et al. 2019), the accuracy of branch lengths is uncertain, so we ran analyses both using actual branch lengths and setting branch lengths to 1.0. We also extended our analysis of <italic>deltaT</italic> to examine its relationship to breeding latitude directly (using the same approach). Midpoints of breeding range latitudes were derived using ArcMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">ESRI 2021</xref>, ver.10.8.2) and range maps from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">BirdLife International and the Handbook of the Birds of the World (2021)</xref>. PGLS analyses were done using the R packages phytools (ver. 0.7-80, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Revell 2012</xref>) and nmle (ver. 3.1-152, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pinheiro et al., 2013</xref>) and using the corPagel model approach.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This interesting study applies the PSMC model to a set of new genome sequences for migratory and nonmigratory thrushes and seeks to describe differences in the population size history among these groups. The authors create a set of summary statistics describing the PSMC traces - mean and standard deviation of Ne, plus a set of metrics describing the shape of the oldest Ne peak - and use these to compare across migratory and resident species (taking single samples sequenced here as representative of the species). The analyses are framed as supporting or refuting aspects of a biogeographic model describing colonization dynamics from tropical to temperate North and South America.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
At a technical level, the sequencing and analysis up through PSMC looks good and the paper is engaging and interesting to read as an introduction to some verbal biogeographic models of avian evolution in the Pleistocene. The core findings - higher and more variable Ne in migratory species - seem robust, and the biogeographic explanation is plausible.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
I did not find the analyses particularly persuasive in linking specific aspects of clade-level PSMC patterns causally to evolutionary driving forces. To their credit, the authors have anticipated my main criticism in the discussion. This is that variation in population size inferred by methods like PSMC is in &quot;effective&quot; terms, and the link between effective and census population size is a morass of bias introduced by population structure and selection so robustly connecting specific aspects of PSMC traces to causal evolutionary forces is somewhere between extremely difficult and impossible.</p>
<p>Population structure is the most obvious force that can generate large Ne changes mimicking the census-size-focused patterns the authors discuss. The authors argue in the discussion that since they focus on relatively deep time (&gt;50kya at least, with most analyses focusing on the 5mya - 500kya range) population structure is &quot;likely to become less important&quot;, and the resident species are usually more structured today (true) which might bias the findings against the observed higher Ne in migrants.</p>
<p>But is structure really unimportant in driving PSMC results at these specific timescales? There is no numerical analysis presented to support the claim in this paper. The biogeographic model of increased temperate-latitude land area supporting higher populations could yield high Ne via high census size, but shifts in population structure (for example, from one large panmictic population to a series of isolated refugial populations as a result of glaciation-linked climate changes) could plausibly create elevated and more variable Ne. Is it more land area and ecological release leading to a bigger and faster initial Ne bump, or is it changes in population connectivity over time at expanding range edges, or is the whole single-bump PSMC trace an artifact of the dataset size, or what? The authors have convinced me that the Ne history of migratory thrushes is on average very different from nonmigrant thrushes, but beyond that it's unclear what exactly we've learned here about the underlying process.</p>
<p>I generally agree with the authors that &quot;at present there is no way to fully disentangle the effects of population structure and geographic space on our results&quot;. But given that, I think there are two options - either we can fully acknowledge that oversimplified demographic models like PSMC cannot be interpreted as supporting evidence of any particular mechanistic or biogeographic hypothesis and stop trying to use them to do that, or we have to do our best to understand specifically which models can be distinguished by the analyses we're employing.</p>
<p>Short of developing some novel theory deep in the PSMC model, I think readers would need to see simulations showing that the analyses employed in this paper are capable of supporting or refuting their biogeographic hypothesis before viewing them as strongly supporting a specific biogeographic model. Tools like msprime and stdpopsim can be used to simulate genome-scale data with fairly complex biogeographic models. Running simulations of a thrush-like population under different biogeographic scenarios and then using PSMC to differentiate those patterns would be a more convincing argument for the biogeographic aspects of this paper. The other benefit of this approach would be to nail down a specific quantitative version of the taxon cycles model referenced in the abstract, and it would allow the authors to better study and explain the motivation behind the specific summary statistics they develop for PSMC posthoc analysis.</p>

Winker and Delmore present a study on the demographic consequences of migratory versus resident behavior by contrasting the evolutionary history of lineages within the same songbird group (thrushes of the genus Catharus).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
I appreciate the test-of-hypothesis design of the study and the explicit formulation of three main expectations to test. The data analysis has been done with appropriate available tools.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The current version of the paper, with the case study chosen, the results, and the relative discussion, is not satisfying enough to support or reject the hypotheses here considered.</p>
<p>The authors hypothesized that the wider realized breeding and ecological range characterising migrants versus resident lineages could be a major drive for increased effective population size and population expansion in migrants versus residents. I understand that this pattern (wider range in migrants) is a common characteristic across bird lineages and that it is viewed as a result of adapting to migration. A problem that I see in their dataset is that the breeding grounds range of the two groups are located in very different geographic areas (mainly South versus North America). The authors could have expanded their dataset to include species whose breeding grounds are from the two areas, regardless of their migratory behaviour, as a comparison to disentangle whether ecological differences of these two areas can affect the population sizes or growth rates.</p>
<p>As I understand from previous literature, the time-scale to population growth and estimates of effective population sizes considered in the present paper for the resident versus migratory clades seem to widely predate the times to speciation for the same lineages, which were reported in previous work of the same authors (Everson et al 2019) and others (Termignoni-Garcia et al 2022). This piece of information makes the calculation of species-specific population size changes difficult to interpret in the light of lineages' comparison. It is unclear what the authors consider to be lineage-specific in these estimates, as the clades were likely undergoing substantial admixture during the time predating full isolation.</p>
<p>Regarding the methodological difficulties in interpreting the impact of population structure on the estimates of effective population sizes with the PSMC approach, I would think that performing simulations to compare different scenarios of different degrees of structured populations would have helped substantially understand some of the outcomes.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have struggled to understand if migratory behaviour in birds is considered to be acquired to relieve species competition, or as a consequence of expanded range (i.e., birds expand their range but their feeding ground is kept where speciation occurred as to exploit a ground with higher quality and abundance of seasonal local resources).</p>
<p>The points raised above could be considered to improve the current version of the paper.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This paper applies PSMC and genomic data to test interesting questions about how life history changes impact long-term population sizes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is a creative use of PSMC to test explicit a priori hypotheses about season migration and Ne. The PSMC analyses seem well done and the authors acknowledge much of the complexity of interpretation in the discussion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors use an average generation time for all taxa, but the citations imply generation time is known for at least some of them. Are there differences in generation time associated with migration? I am not a bird biologist, but quick googling suggests maybe this is the case (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13983">https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13983</ext-link>). I think it important the authors address this, as differences in generation time I believe should affect estimates of Ne and growth.</p>
<p>The writing could be improved, both in the introduction for readers not familiar with the system and in the clarity and focus of the discussion.</p>
