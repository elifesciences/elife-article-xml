<title>Abstract</title><p>Direct electrical stimulation of the human brain has been used for numerous clinical and scientific applications. At present, however, little is known about how intracranial stimulation affects activity at the microscale. In this study, we recorded intracranial EEG data from a cohort of patients with medically refractory epilepsy as they completed a visual recognition memory task. During the memory task, brief trains of intracranial theta burst stimulation (TBS) were delivered to the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Using simultaneous microelectrode recordings, we isolated neurons in the hippocampus, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex and tested whether stimulation enhanced or suppressed firing rates. Additionally, we characterized the properties of modulated neurons, clustered presumed excitatory and inhibitory neurons by waveform morphology, and examined the extent to which modulation affected memory task performance. We observed a subset of neurons (∼30%) whose firing rate was modulated by TBS, exhibiting highly heterogeneous responses with respect to onset latency, duration, and direction of effect. Notably, location and baseline activity predicted which neurons were most susceptible to modulation, although the impact of this neuronal modulation on memory remains unclear. These findings advance our limited understanding of how focal electrical fields influence neuronal firing at the single-cell level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The amygdala is a highly connected cluster of nuclei with input from multiple sensory modalities and vast projections to distributed cortical and subcortical regions involved in autonomic regulation and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McDonald and Mott, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Roy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stein et al., 2007</xref>). Numerous studies have described the amygdala’s capacity to facilitate the encoding of long-lasting emotional memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dolcos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hermans et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">LaBar and Cabeza, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Phelps, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Phelps and LeDoux, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Qasim et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Richardson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Roozendaal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schwabe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Specific oscillatory dynamics in the amygdalohippocampal circuit are increasingly understood to be essential in prioritizing the encoding of these salient memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Qasim et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, direct electrical stimulation of the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) in humans has revealed a more generalized ability to enhance declarative memory irrespective of the emotional valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Inman et al., 2018</xref>), likely by promoting synaptic plasticity-related processes underlying memory consolidation in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McGaugh, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">McGaugh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Roesler et al., 2021</xref>). These pro-memory effects were achieved with rhythmic theta-burst stimulation (TBS), which is known to induce long-term potentiation (LTP), a key mechanism in memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Larson and Munkácsy, 2015</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that intracranial TBS may also enhance memory specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Titiz et al., 2017</xref>), evoke theta-frequency oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Solomon et al., 2021</xref>), and facilitate short-term plasticity in local field potential recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Herrero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2024</xref>). However, the extent to which exogenous TBS modulates activity at the single-cell level and whether this modulation is associated with memory performance remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Here, we address this knowledge gap by conducting simultaneous microelectrode recordings from prefrontal and medial temporal structures during a memory task in which intracranial TBS was applied to the BLA. To characterize neuronal modulation, we contrasted the trial-averaged, peri-stimulation firing rates across stim and no-stim conditions; neurons were further classified based on their location, baseline activity, and direction of effect (enhancement vs. suppression). We predicted that intracranial TBS of the BLA would modulate spiking activity within highly connected regions (e.g., hippocampus) and improve memory task performance.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We report results from a cohort of 23 patients with medically refractory epilepsy who underwent stereoelectroencephalography to localize epileptogenic foci (74% female, 19– 66 years old). All patients were age 18+ and able to provide informed consent. No exclusion was made concerning a patient’s sex, gender, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Surgeries were performed at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, UT (n = 10) and Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, MO (n = 13). Patients were monitored continuously by a clinical team during their post-operative hospital course. Each patient signed a written informed consent form before participation in the research study; all study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Utah (IRB 00144045, IRB 00114691) and Washington University (IRB 202104033).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Electrode Placement and Localization</title>
<p>Numbers and trajectories of stereoelectroencephalography electrode placements were determined case-by-case and solely derived from clinical considerations during a multidisciplinary case conference without reference to this research program. Each patient was implanted with clinical macroelectrodes and 1–3 Behnke-Fried depth electrodes (Ad-Tech Medical Instrument Corporation, Oak Creek, WI), which contained both macro- and microelectrode contacts (eight 40 µm diameter microwires and one unshielded reference wire) for recording local field potentials and extracellular action potentials, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To localize electrodes, we leveraged the open-access <italic>Localize Electrodes Graphical User Interface (LeGUI)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Davis et al., 2021</xref>) software developed by our group, which performs coregistration of pre-operative MRI and post-operative CT sequences, image processing, normalization to standard anatomical templates, and automated electrode detection.</p>

<title>Intracranial Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Neurophysiological data were recorded at both hospitals using a neural signal processor (Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, UT; Nihon Koden USA, Irvine, CA) sampling at 30 kHz. Microelectrode contacts were locally referenced to a low-impedance microwire near the recording wires. Macroelectrode contacts were referenced to an intracranial contact located within the white matter with minimal activity, per recommended practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mercier et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>Patients completed a visual recognition memory task previously employed by our group to characterize the effects of basolateral amygdala stimulation upon memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Inman et al., 2018</xref>). The memory task consisted of an encoding session, during which a series of neutral valence images were presented, and a self-paced retrieval session ∼24 hours post-encoding wherein patients were asked to indicate whether each image onscreen was old (previously shown) or new (unseen) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Data were aggregated across four highly similar experimental paradigms with minor differences in the content of visual stimuli, number of trials, stimulation parameters, and testing intervals. Each encoding session consisted of 160 or 320 trials wherein an image was presented on screen for 3 s, followed by a ∼6 s interstimulus interval (fixation cross on screen).</p>

<caption><title>Example raster plots depicting heterogeneous responses to stimulation.</title><p>(A) Representative example of modulation during stimulation. The highpass-filtered, trial-averaged LFP from the corresponding microwire is shown (top) above the spike raster for an example unit located in the hippocampus (middle); the grey shaded region depicts the duration of stimulation with onset at t = 0. The average firing rate across trials was estimated by convolving the binned spike counts (100 ms bins) with a Gaussian kernel (bottom). (B) The difference in the number of spikes in the 1 s peri-stimulation epochs for each trial is shown (top). We subsequently performed a Wilcoxon signed-rank test on the during- and post-stimulation spike counts for each trial vs. the pre-trial baseline and compared the empirical test statistic against a null distribution generated by shuffling the epoch labels 1,000 times (bottom); the grey-shaded region represents the distribution containing 95% of observed values. (C) Some units (left, left-middle) exhibited increased firing rates, whereas others (right-middle, right) had their firing suppressed. The temporal dynamics of the firing rate modulation (e.g., onset, duration) were highly variable across units. The averaged waveform for each of the visualized units is shown below its corresponding peri-stimulation raster plot (WFs = waveforms); the shaded region represents standard deviation across waveforms.</p></caption>

<title>Spike Detection and Sorting</title>
<p>Microelectrode data were first filtered between 250–500 Hz with a zero-phase lag bandpass filter and re-thresholded offline at -3.5 times the root mean square of the signal to identify spike waveforms. Units were isolated during a semi-automated process within <italic>Offline Sorter</italic> (Plexon Inc, Dallas, TX) by applying the T-distribution expectation maximization method on the first three principal components of the detected waveforms (initial parameters: degrees of freedom multiplier = 4, initial number of units = 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shoham et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, the waveform shapes, interspike interval distribution, consistency of firing, and isolation from other waveform clusters were manually inspected for further curation and removal of spurious, non-physiological threshold crossings that could represent stimulation artifacts.</p>

<p>We calculated several distinct metrics to characterize detected units’ properties and assess the quality of our spike sorting (<italic>Figure S2</italic>): the number of units detected per microelectrode bundle, the mean firing rate (Hz) for each unit, the percentage of interspike intervals &lt; 3 ms, the coefficient of variation across each unit’s spike train, the average presence ratio of firing in 1s bins (proportion of bins which contain ≥ 1 spike), the ratio between the peak amplitude of the averaged waveform and its standard deviation, and the mean signal-to-noise ratio of the averaged waveform.</p>

<title>Discrimination of Excitatory vs. Inhibitory Neurons</title>
<p>We calculated two metrics from the averaged waveform from each detected unit: the valley-to-peak-width (VP) and the peak half-width (PHW) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>); previously, these two properties of waveform morphology have been used to discriminate pyramidal cells (excitatory) from interneurons (inhibitory) in human intracranial recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Peyrache et al., 2012</xref>). Next, we performed k-means clustering (n = 2 clusters) on the waveform metrics, in line with previous approaches to cell type classification.</p>

<title>Intracranial Theta Burst Stimulation</title>
<p>We delivered direct electrical stimulation to the basolateral amygdala during half of the trials in the encoding phase of each experimental session. Stimulation pulses were delivered immediately once the image was removed from the screen and in a patterned rhythm designed to entrain endogenous theta-gamma oscillatory interactions (i.e., theta-burst stimulation, TBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hanslmayr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Suppa et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, we administered current-controlled, charge-balanced, bipolar, 1 mA, biphasic rectangular pulses over a 1 s period with a 50% duty cycle. Stimulation pulses were delivered at a rate of 50 Hz and nested within eight equally-spaced bursts (∼8 Hz) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref>–<italic>C</italic>). A subset of experiments (n = 7) used a lower current (0.5 mA) with variable pulse frequencies across trials (33 Hz, 50 Hz, 80 Hz).</p>

<sec id="s2i">
<title>Peri-Stimulation Modulation Analyses</title>
<p>We first created peri-stimulation epochs (1 s pre-trial ISI, 1 s after image onset, 1 s during stimulation/after image offset, 1 s post-stimulation), with t = 0 representing stimulation onset and the moment at which the image was removed from the screen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>); identical epochs were created for the image-only (no-stimulation) trials. Each epoch was constrained to 1 s to ensure that subsequent firing rate contrasts were unbiased and to capture potential transient effects (e.g., image onset/offset). Units with a trial-averaged baseline (pre-trial ISI) firing rate of &lt; 0.1 Hz were excluded from subsequent analyses because low firing rates limited the ability to detect modulation robustly. Units were designated as “modulated” if either the during- or post-stimulation firing rate contrast was significant following permutation testing (described in <italic>Statistical Analyses</italic>). An additional contrast of pre-trial ISI vs. image onset was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of neurons to task stimuli (i.e., image presentation).</p>
<p>To investigate whether stimulation altered rhythmicity in neuronal firing, we analyzed the spike timing autocorrelograms. More specifically, we computed the pairwise differences in spike timing for each trial (bin size = 5 ms, max lag = 250 ms) and then contrasted the differences in the latencies of the peak normalized autocorrelation value between epochs (pre-, during-, post-stimulation). Only neurons with a firing rate of ≥ 1 Hz (n = 70/203, 34.5%) were included in this analysis since sparse firing resulted in noisy autocorrelation estimates.</p>
<p>Finally, we measured modulation in multiunit activity (MUA) by filtering the microleectrode signals in a 300-3,000 Hz window and counting the number of threshold crossings. Thresholds were determined on a per-channel basis and defined as -3.5 times the root mean square of the signal during the baseline period; activity during stimulation was excluded since stimulation artifact is difficult to separate from MUA in the absence of spike sorting.</p>

<title>Population Analyses</title>
<p>To analyze pseudo-population activity, we performed a linear dimensionality reduction with PCA on a matrix of the z-scored trial-averaged firing rates of all neurons recorded across patients (<italic>sklearn.decomposition.PCA</italic>). This approach enables the identification of dominant patterns of coordinated neural activity that may not be apparent when examining individual neurons in isolation. Doing so allowed us to qualitatively examine the temporal dynamics of the dominant modes of neuron coactivity in a low-dimensional subspace, separated by experimental condition (stim vs. no-stim), region, and laterality relative to stimulation. The firing rate matrices for each condition were concatenated prior to PCA to facilitate direct comparison among the principal components; for simplicity, only the first three principal components are visualized. By collapsing across subjects into a common pseudo-population, this analysis provides a mesoscale view of how stimulation modulates shared activity patterns across anatomically distributed neural populations.</p>

<sec id="s2k">
<title>Statistical Approach</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were conducted using custom Python scripts and established statistical libraries (i.e., Scikit-learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pedregosa et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Scipy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>)<italic>, Statsmodels</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Seabold and Perktold, 2010</xref>)). We performed two separate Wilcoxon signed-rank tests across trials on the during- and post-stimulation spike counts relative to their corresponding pre-trail baseline spike counts. To control for false positives, we compared the empirical test statistic against a null distribution generated from shuffling pre/during/post epoch labels (n = 1000 permutations) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). An identical analysis was also performed on the no-stimulation (image-only) trials.</p>
<p>To test for differences in the proportion of modulated units (across conditions, regions, cell type, stimulation parameters, and behavioral outcomes), we performed a series of one- and two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. Next, we used Mann-Whitney U tests to contrast baseline firing rates among modulated vs. unaffected units. Behavioral performance during the memory task was calculated using d-prime (d’), defined as the difference in an individual’s z-scored hit rate and false alarm rate. Observed changes in recognition memory were split into two categories using a d’ difference threshold of ± 0.5: responder (Δd’ &lt; -.5 or Δd’ &gt; +.5) or non-responder (-0.5 ≤ Δd’ ≤ 0.5). The threshold of ± 0.5 was chosen based on the defined range of a “medium effect” for Cohen’s <italic>d,</italic> which bears conceptual similarity to d’. To test the hypothesis that stimulation affected behavioral performance, we used a linear mixed effects model with d’ score as the dependent variable, condition and experiment as fixed effects, and session as a random effect; an additional test for differences among hit rates (percent of previously seen images correctly identified) was implemented using a paired-samples t-test.</p>

<sec id="s2l">
<title>Firing Rate Control Analyses</title>
<p>We performed a series of control analyses to test whether our approach to firing rate detection was robust. First, we performed a sensitivity analysis by systematically varying the baseline firing rate threshold used to exclude units from modulation analyses. The threshold for inclusion of units was varied from 0–3 Hz (0.1 Hz step size), and the firing rate analyses were repeated to quantify the proportion of units meeting inclusion criteria and the proportion of units designated as modulated (<italic>Figure S7A</italic>). Next, we performed a dropout analysis wherein segments of data near the onset of a stimulation burst were removed from the during-stimulation epoch (an identical segment was also removed from the pre-trial ISI and post-stimulation epochs). To this end, we removed a window of data starting at the onset of each burst spanning 0–60 ms (5 ms step size, eight bursts in train) and recomputed the proportion of units meeting inclusion criteria and the proportion of units designated as modulated (<italic>Figure S7B</italic>). Finally, to better understand the tradeoffs with our statistical approach, we generated synthetic data with different baseline firing rates (0.1-5.0 Hz) and effect sizes (± 0.1-0.7 Hz), then simulated the likelihood of detecting modulation across variable conditions (<italic>Figure S7C</italic>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We recorded single-unit activity from 23 patients (n = 30 sessions) with medically refractory epilepsy as they completed a visual recognition memory task (see <italic>Table S1</italic> for patient demographics). During the encoding session of the experiment, each patient received either 80 or 160 trials of bipolar intracranial TBS to a contiguous pair of macroelectrode contacts in the BLA (see <italic>Figure S1</italic> for anatomical localization of stimulated contacts. An equal number of “no-stimulation” trials were randomly interspersed to evaluate the effect of stimulation on memory performance and control for neuronal modulation resulting from experimental stimuli (e.g., image presentation). In total, we isolated 203 putative neurons from 68 bundles of 8 microwires each, distributed among recording sites in the hippocampus (HIP, n = 95 units), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, n = 44), amygdala (AMY, n = 39), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, n = 25) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; see also <italic>Figure S2</italic> and <italic>Figure S3</italic>); a subset of these units (n = 47, 23.2%) was excluded from subsequent analyses because low baseline firing rates (&lt; 0.1 Hz) limited the ability to robustly detect modulation.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Theta Burst Stimulation of the BLA Modulates Widely Distributed Populations of Neurons</title>
<p>We hypothesized that BLA stimulation would modulate neuronal activity in the sampled regions, given the amygdala’s well-established connectivity to the HIP, OFC, and ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Roy et al., 2009</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we quantified spike counts across trials within peri-stimulation epochs (1 s pre-trial ISI, 1 s after image onset, 1 s during stimulation/after image offset, and 1 s post-stimulation) and used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare the spike counts against a null distribution generated by shuffling epoch labels. We performed two firing rate contrasts across trials (pre-trial ISI vs. during stimulation, pre-trial ISI vs. post-stimulation) within two distinct conditions (stim, no-stim); an additional contrast of the pre-trial ISI vs. image onset epochs was included to evaluate the sensitivity of neurons to task image presentations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>BLA TBS modulated firing rates in 30.1% of all recorded units, a significantly higher proportion than the 15.4% responsive to no-stim (image only) trials (one-sided Fisher’s exact test, OR = 2.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Across all regions sampled, we observed units modulated by the stim and no-stim conditions. Units in HIP (OR = 2.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.044), OFC (OR = 5.09, <italic>p</italic> = 0.040), and AMY (OR = 3.33, <italic>p</italic> = 0.042) were most sensitive to stimulation; we did not observe a difference in the proportions of units within the ACC responsive to the stim vs. no-stim conditions (OR = 1.00, <italic>p</italic> = 0.661; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Only 9.0% of units responded to both the stim and no-stim conditions, despite approximately half of the stim-modulated units (representing 14.7% of all units) exhibiting a change in firing rate associated with image onset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This result suggests that the units modulated by stimulation are largely distinct from those responsive to image offset during trials without stimulation. Stimulation, however, did not appear to alter the rhythmicity in neuronal firing, as measured by spiking autocorrelograms (<italic>Figure S5</italic>).</p>
<p>Because neuronal firing properties vary across cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Barthó et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Keller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Peyrache et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Quyen et al., 2008</xref>), we also tested whether baseline (pre-trial ISI) firing rates predicted a unit’s response to stimulation, suggestive of selective engagement of specific neuron populations. Stimulation-modulated units exhibited significantly higher baseline firing rates compared to unaffected units (<italic>U</italic>(N<sub>Stim, Mod</sub> = 47, N<sub>Stim, NS</sub> = 109) = 3450.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). No difference in baseline firing rate was observed among units modulated in the no-stim condition, compared to those that were unaffected (<italic>U</italic>(N<sub>No-Stim, Mod</sub> = 24, N<sub>No-Stim, NS</sub> = 132) = 1964.00, <italic>p</italic> = 0.062) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The median (Q1, Q3) baseline firing rates for modulated units in the stim and no-stim conditions were 1.77 Hz (0.95 Hz, 5.39 Hz) and 1.53 Hz (0.72 Hz, 5.41 Hz), respectively.</p>
<p>In a subset of experimental sessions (n = 7), we explored the effects of different stimulation parameters on neuronal modulation within an experimental session; more specifically, we employed a lower stimulation amplitude (0.5 mA vs. 1.0 mA) and varied pulse frequency (33 Hz vs. 50 Hz and 33 Hz vs. 80 Hz). Neither the amplitude of stimulation (OR = 1.69, <italic>p</italic> = 0.302, n = 30) nor pulse frequency (33 vs. 80 Hz; OR = 0.00, <italic>p</italic> = 1.000, n = 1; 50 vs. 80 Hz; OR = 1.40, <italic>p</italic> = 0.758, n = 6) significantly altered the proportion of modulated units. (<italic>Figure S4B</italic>).</p>
<p>Our exploratory analyses of pseudo-population activity revealed interesting temporal dynamics associated with image presentation and the delivery of stimulation. More specifically, we observed variation among the first three principal components across both stim and no-stim trials associated with image presentation (t = -3 to t = 0) and robust shifts in coactivity modes associated with stimulation (t = 0 to t = 1) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Further characterization of these dynamics suggests that TBS of the BLA primarily resulted in transient changes to firing rate coactivity within hippocampal neurons and was present regardless of the neuron’s laterality to stimulation (<italic>Figure S6A–B</italic>). Taken together, these analyses reveal global structure in the state space of responses to BLA stimulation within hippocampal circuits.</p>
<p>Finally, we performed three supplementary analyses to evaluate the robustness of our approach to detecting firing rate modulation: a sensitivity analysis assessing the proportion of modulated units at different firing rate thresholds for inclusion/exclusion, a data dropout analysis designed to control for the possibility that non-physiological stimulation artifacts may preclude the detection of temporally adjacent spiking, and a synthetic detection probability analysis. These results recapitulate our observation that units with higher baseline firing are most likely to exhibit modulation (though the probability of detecting modulation is lower for sparsely active neurons) and suggest that suppression in firing rate is not solely attributable to amplifier saturation following stimulation (<italic>Figure S7</italic>).</p>

<title>Neurons Exhibit Heterogenous Responses to Theta Burst Stimulation</title>
<p>Recent studies have reported enhanced neural plasticity (via intracranial local field potential recordings and evoked responses) following repetitive direct electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Herrero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, we hypothesized that recorded units would predominantly exhibit enhanced spiking in response to intracranial TBS of the BLA. Similarly, individual units exhibited highly variable responses to stimulation with respect to onset latency (rapid vs. delayed), duration (transient vs. durable), and valence (enhancement vs. suppression) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>The most common epoch for firing rate modulation was during the 1 s epoch in which TBS was delivered (25.0% of all neurons). Smaller subsets were modulated only in the 1 s post-stimulation epoch (6.4%) or in both the during- and post-stimulation epochs (1.3%). A similar trend was observed for modulation in the no-stim condition: 10.9% during, 5.8% post, and 1.3% for both. Suppression was most common among modulated units during stimulation (56.4%), whereas enhancement was the dominant response post-stimulation (70.0%). In contrast, enhancement was most common within both epochs across no-stim trials (58.5% during, 66.7% post). The mean (± SD) absolute z-scored difference in firing rate across stimulation trials (relative to pre-trial ISI) was z = 0.60 (± 0.58) and z = 0.43 (± 0.27) for the during- and post-stimulation epochs, respectively. Across no-stim trials, we observed a mean absolute z-scored difference of z = 0.38 (± 0.24) and z = 0.30 (± 0.18) in analogous epochs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).

<title>Theta Burst Stimulation Modulates Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons Equally</title>
<p>Using k-means clustering, we grouped neurons into two distinct clusters based on waveform morphology, representing neurons that were presumed to be excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Inhibitory (fast-spiking) neurons exhibited shorter waveform VP and PHW, compared with excitatory (regular-spiking) neurons (I cluster centroid: VP = 0.50ms, PHW = 0.51ms; E cluster centroid: VP = 0.32ms, PHW = 0.31ms), and greater baseline firing rates (<italic>U</italic>(N<sub>I</sub> = 23, N<sub>E</sub> = 133) = 1074.50, <italic>p</italic> = 0.023) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Although we observed a much greater proportion of excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons (E: 85.3%, I: 14.7%), stimulation appeared to affect excitatory and inhibitory neurons equally, suggesting that one cell type is not preferentially activated over another (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>

<title>Association Between Neuronal Modulation and Memory Performance is Unclear</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the link between stimulation and performance during the visual recognition memory task. To this end, we first used a linear mixed-effects model to examine the effect of condition (stim, no-stim) on memory performance (d’) across trials in each session, with individual sessions treated as a random effect (intercept). Experiment type was also included as a fixed effect since data were aggregated across four highly similar experiments with minor differences in the content of visual stimuli, number of trials, stimulation parameters, and testing intervals. We did not observe an overall effect of memory enhancement (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) when controlling for subject-level variability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The lack of a memory enhancement effect may be associated with high hit rates limiting sensitivity (mean ± SD) (75.7% ± 13.5% for no-stim trials, 75.0% ± 14.3% for stim trials), and considerable variability among false alarm rates across participants (17.9% ± 17.4%, range 0–70%; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

<p>At the level of individual sessions, we observed enhanced memory (Δd’ &gt; +0.5) in 36.7%, impaired memory (Δd’ &lt; -0.5) in 20.0%, and negligible change (-0.5 ≤ Δd’ ≤ 0.5) in 43.3% when comparing performance between the stim and no-stim conditions; a threshold of Δd’ ± 0.5 was chosen for this classification based on the defined range of a “medium effect” for Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>. To test our hypothesis that neuronal modulation would be associated with changes in memory performance, we combined the sessions that resulted in either memory enhancement or impairment and contrasted the proportion of modulated units across regions sampled. We did not, however, observe a meaningful difference in the proportion of modulated units when grouped by behavioral outcome (all contrasts <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Proximity to white matter has been shown to influence the effects of stimulation on behavior and the strength of evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mankin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mohan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Paulk et al., 2022</xref>). Across all stimulated contacts, we observed only small differences in the proximity of stimulation contacts to white matter (median = 4.6 mm, range = 1.5-8.0 mm), likely because the chosen target (i.e., basolateral amygdala) has several nearby white matter structures (e.g., stria terminalis).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Theta-burst stimulation is an efficient and validated paradigm for inducing long-term potentiation (LTP) in neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Larson and Munkácsy, 2015</xref>). Additionally, intracranial TBS was recently shown to promote region-specific short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Herrero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2024</xref>) and entrain frequency-matched oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Solomon et al., 2021</xref>). At present, however, there is an incomplete understanding of how these population-level responses to stimulation relate to a modulation in the activity of individual neurons, which are thought to be the substrate of memory encoding and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hebb, 1949</xref>). Here, we address this knowledge gap by characterizing neuronal firing recorded from microelectrodes in humans undergoing intracranial TBS of the BLA. Our experimental design focused explicitly on stimulation of the BLA, given our prior work that seeks to understand amygdala-mediated memory enhancement in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Inman et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">2018</xref>).</p>
    <p>We observed neurons distributed throughout the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala responsive to direct electrical TBS. The effect of TBS on firing rate was heterogeneous with respect to onset, duration, and valence. Previous work characterizing local-field potential responses to intracranial TBS observed similarly bidirectional effects throughout the brain suggestive of short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2024</xref>). Few studies, however, have characterized the impact of exogenous stimulation on the spiking activity of individual neurons, none of which involve intracranial theta burst stimulation. One study reported a long-lasting reduction in neural excitability among parietal neurons, with variable onset time and recovery following continuous transcranial TBS in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Romero et al., 2022</xref>). In a similar vein, it was recently shown that human neurons are largely suppressed by single-pulse electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cowan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Van der Plas et al., 2024</xref>). Other emerging evidence suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation may entrain the rhythm rather than rate of neuronal spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Krause et al., 2019</xref>) and that stimulation-evoked modulation of spiking may meaningfully impact behavioral performance on cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fehring et al., 2024</xref>). An alternative approach has focused on the delivery of spatially selective microstimulation resembling the extracellular currents that normally modulate neuronal activity—this methodology has been used to bi-directionally drive neuronal firing in human temporal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Youssef et al., 2023</xref>) and enhance memory specificity for images following stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Titiz et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Although subsets of neurons from each region we sampled were responsive to stimulation, we observed the greatest difference in the proportion of modulated units across conditions in the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala. This regional selectivity is to be expected, given that numerous studies have characterized how structural, functional, and effective connectivity among brain regions predicts the effects of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fox et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Solomon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Stiso et al., 2019</xref>). We also observed that units with greater baseline activity were most likely to exhibit modulated firing rates following stimulation. Other studies have identified firing patterns and waveform properties that differ between inhibitory and excitatory neurons in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Barthó et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Keller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Peyrache et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Quyen et al., 2008</xref>). For example, baseline firing rate disambiguates “regular-spiking” and “fast-spiking” neurons, which are presumed to represent pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively. To test these hypotheses directly, we clustered neurons into presumed excitatory and inhibitory neurons based on waveform morphology. In doing so, we observed ∼85% excitatory and ∼15% inhibitory neurons, which is very similar to what has been reported previously in human intracranial recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cowan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Peyrache et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, stimulation appeared to modulate approximately the same proportion of neurons for each cell type (∼30%), despite the differently-sized groups. Recent reports, however, have suggested that the extent to which electrical fields entrain neuronal spiking, particularly with respect to phase-locking, may be specific to distinct classes of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Modulation in neuronal activity was defined by contrasting firing rates before, during, and after TBS across trials. In doing so, we were able to characterize coarse differences in activity indicative of enhancement or suppression. This approach, however, did not allow for analysis of more subtle, nuanced effects such as entrainment of spiking to individual bursts or pulses of TBS. Characterizations of rhythmicity in firing were challenging, given that most of the neurons we identified exhibit sparse activity with low baseline firing rates, and stimulation often resulted in further suppression of spiking.</p>
<p>Although stimulation artifacts resulted in amplitude threshold crossings that may be spuriously interpreted as a neuronal spike, we implemented several methods to mitigate the influence of non-physiological activity. First, the characteristics of each unit (e.g., waveform shape) were manually inspected during spike sorting and further quantified using several quality control metrics (e.g., interspike intervals); stimulation resulted in a stereotyped response that was easily detectable and removed from subsequent analyses. Additionally, we tested for modulation both during stimulation and in the post-stimulation epochs—a period in which no artifact was present. Contrary to what would be expected if stimulation artifacts were falsely elevating firing rates, we observed predominantly suppression during stimulation and enhancement post-stimulation.</p>
<p>Since we collected our microelectrode recordings in the context of a visual recognition memory task, we tested whether stimulation resulted in a change in memory performance. Although we hypothesized that stimulation would improve memory performance, we did not identify an apparent stimulation-related memory enhancement when controlling for individual differences, in contrast to our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Inman et al., 2018</xref>). The absence of such an effect may be, at least in part, attributable to the considerable variability that we observed in this cohort; indeed, baseline memory performance and individual differences have been shown to account for a substantial portion of the variability in this amygdala-mediated memory enhancement effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hollearn et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies on rats have demonstrated that brief electrical stimulation of the BLA can prioritize the consolidation of specific memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bass et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bass and Manns, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Manns and Bass, 2016</xref>). These pro-memory effects emerged ∼24 hours post-encoding and appear to be hippocampal-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bass et al., 2014</xref>), despite not resulting in a net change in the firing rates of hippocampal pyramidal neurons; instead, BLA stimulation resulted in brief periods of spike-field and field-field synchrony within CA3–CA1 in the low-gamma frequency range (30–55 Hz), which may facilitate spike-timing-dependent plasticity in recently active neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bass and Manns, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study did not investigate interactions between spiking activity and local field potentials because neuronal spiking was sparse at baseline and often further suppressed by stimulation; only a very small proportion of the total number of trials across all neurons exhibited ≥ 10 spikes in both the 1 s pre- and post-stimulation epochs (∼2.5%). Although certain metrics are not biased by sample size (e.g., pairwise phase consistency), low spike counts can dramatically affect variance and, therefore, result in unstable estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Vinck et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
    <p>How exactly the activity of single neurons is aggregated to produce local field potentials, which in turn interact with neuronal ensembles distributed throughout the brain, remains an active area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Herreras, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Manning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Teleńczuk et al., 2020</xref>). One recent study that leveraged closed-loop stimulation targeting memory consolidation during sleep observed neuronal spiking with greater phase-locking to medial temporal lobe slow-wave activity following stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Geva-Sagiv et al., 2023</xref>); neuronal phase-locking, particularly to hippocampal theta oscillations, has long been associated with robust memory encoding and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jacobs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rutishauser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schonhaut et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yoo et al., 2021</xref>). Further characterization of these spike-field interactions and refinement of closed-loop stimulation methods may provide a means for precisely modulating neuronal dynamics, for example, by entraining neuronal spiking that is phase-aligned to endogenous hippocampal theta oscillations to selectively enhance the encoding or retrieval of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hasselmo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hasselmo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hasselmo and Stern, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we performed an exploratory analysis of neuronal pseudo-population activity, which suggests that hippocampal neurons exhibit robust changes in firing rate coactivity in response to BLA stimulation. Related research has similarly described how BLA stimulation can induce synchronous firing of hippocampal neurons, which has memory-enhancing effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bass and Manns, 2015</xref>). Other studies have leveraged similar, low-dimensional representations of population dynamics to describe how coordinated neural activity facilitates inferential reasoning and memory retrieval within the medial frontal cortex and hippocampus, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Courellis et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Minxha et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, a greater understanding of how neuronal coactivity may be precisely modulated by stimulation may help to refine therapeutic interventions targeting complex cognition and computation.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>By characterizing patterns of neuronal modulation evoked by intracranial TBS, we provide new insights that link micro- and macroscale responses to stimulation of the human brain. These insights advance our limited understanding of how focal electrical fields influence neuronal firing at the single-cell level and motivate future neuromodulatory therapies that aim to recapitulate specific patterns of activity implicated in cognition and memory.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Campbell et al. assess how intracranial theta-burst stimulation (TBS) applied to the basolateral amygdala in 23 epilepsy patients affects neuronal spiking in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex during a visual recognition memory task. This is an incredibly rare dataset; collecting single-unit spiking data from behaving humans during active intracranial stimulation is a Herculean task, with immense potential for translational studies of how stimulation may be applied to modulate biological mechanisms of memory. The authors utilize careful, high quality methodology throughout (e.g. task design, spike recording and sorting, statistical analysis), providing high confidence in the validity of their findings.</p>
<p>In providing such a detailed and deep investigation into the single-unit responses to intracranial stimulation the authors provide a very useful resources to any researchers in the fields of brain stimulation and human neurophysiology. This work could be instrumental in guiding diverse research studies, from basic science investigating the role of theta oscillations in human cognition to translational work investigating deep-brain stimulation for memory.</p>
<p>The authors have adequately addressed all prior concerns.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents a valuable characterization of the effects of intracranial theta-burst stimulation of the basolateral amygdala on single units spiking activity in several areas in the human brain, associated with memory processing. It is written clearly and concisely, allowing readers to fully understand the analysis used.</p>
<p>The authors used a visual recognition memory task previously employed by their group to characterize the effects of basolateral amygdala stimulation upon memory consolidation (Inman et al, 2018). This current report presents an interesting analysis that complements the results reported in the 2018 paper.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Rare combination of human neurophysiology and behavior -</p>
<p>
The type of experiment performed in the manuscript, which contains both neurophysiological data, behavior, and a deep brain stimulation intervention (DBS), is incredibly rare, takes many years to accomplish with tight collaboration between clinical and research teams. Our understanding of spiking dynamics of human neurons is very limited, and this report is an important piece in the puzzle that allows DBS to be used in future interventions that will benefit patients' health.</p>
<p>Multiple brain areas included -</p>
<p>
It's important to note that the report analyzes brain areas with which the Amygdala has extensive connections (Fig. 1A) - Hippocampus, OFC, Amygdala, ACC. It seems that neurons in all these areas were modulated by the stimulation, except the ACC, in which firing rates were so low that only a handful of neurons were included in the analysis. This is an important demonstration that low-amplitude stimulation (even when reduced to 0.5mA) can travel far and wide across the human brain.</p>
<p>The experiment is cleverly designed to tease apart responses due to visual stimuli (image presentation) and electrical stimulation. Authors suggest that the units modulated by stimulation are largely distinct from those responsive to image offset during trials without stimulation. The subpopulation that responds strongly also tends to have a higher baseline firing rate. It's important to add that the chosen modulation index is more likely to be significant in neurons with higher firing rates (Figure S8). The authors discuss the tradeoff of using a nonparametric modulation index for vs. other methods (for example, percent change in trial-averaged firing rate from baseline).</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p><bold>“</bold>This is an exploratory study that doesn't explore quite enough. Critically, the authors make a point of mentioning that neuronal firing properties vary across cell types, but only use baseline firing rate as a proxy metric for cell type. This leaves several important explorations on the table, not limited to the following:”</p>
<p>1a: “Do waveform shape features, which can also be informative of cell type, predict the effect of stimulation?”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this question, we modeled our approach to cell type classification after Peyrache et al. 2012. More specifically, we extracted two features from the mean unit waveforms—the valley-to-peak time (VP) and the peak half-width (PHW). These features were then used to classify units into two distinct clusters (k-means, clusters = 2, based on a strong prior from existing literature), representing putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Our approach recapitulated many of the same observations in Peyrache et al. 2012, namely (1) identification of two clusters (low PHW/VP: inhibitory, high PHW/VP: excitatory), (2) an ~80/20 ratio of excitatory/inhibitory neurons, and (3) greater baseline firing rates in the inhibitory vs. excitatory neurons. However, we did not observe a preferential modulation of one cell type compared to another (see newly created Figure 4). A description of this analysis and its takeaways has been incorporated into the manuscript.</p>
<p>Change to Text:</p>
<p>Created Figure 4 (Separation of presumed excitatory and inhibitory neurons by waveform morphology).</p>
<p>Caption: (A) Two metrics were calculated using the averaged waveforms for each detected unit: the valley-to-peak width (VP) and peak half-width (PHW). (B) Scatterplot of the relationship between VP and PHW; note that units with identical metrics are overlaid. Using k-means clustering, we identified two distinct response clusters, representing presumed excitatory (E, blue) and inhibitory (I, red) neurons. The units from which the example waveforms were taken are outlined in black. Probability distributions for each metric are shown along the axes. (C) Total number of units within each cluster, separated by region. (D) Comparison of baseline firing rates, separated by cluster. (E) Percent of modulated units in each cluster. * p &lt; 0.05, NS = not significant.</p>
<p>Added a description of clustering methodology to lines 132-137: “We calculated two metrics from the averaged waveform from each detected unit: the valley-to-peak-width (VP) and the peak half-width (PHW) (Figure 4A); previously, these two properties of waveform morphology have been used to discriminate pyramidal cells (excitatory) from interneurons (inhibitory) in human intracranial recordings (Peyrache et al., 2012). Next, we performed k-means clustering (n = 2 clusters) on the waveform metrics, in line with previous approaches to cell type classification.</p>
<p>Added a section in the Results titled “Theta Burst Stimulation Modulates Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons Equally”. Lines 370-378: “Using k-means clustering, we grouped neurons into two distinct clusters based on waveform morphology, representing neurons that were presumed to be excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) (Figure 4B). Inhibitory (fast-spiking) neurons exhibited shorter waveform VP and PHW, compared with excitatory (regular-spiking) neurons (I cluster centroid: VP = 0.50ms, PHW = 0.51ms; E cluster centroid: VP = 0.32ms, PHW = 0.31ms), and greater baseline firing rates (U(N<sub>I</sub> = 23, N&lt;<sub>E</sub> = 133) = 1074.50, p = 0.023) (Figure 4D). Although we observed a much greater proportion of excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons (E: 85.3%, I: 14.7%), stimulation appeared to affect excitatory and inhibitory neurons equally, suggesting that one cell type is not preferentially activated over another (Figure 4E).</p>
<p>Modified discussion of the effects of stimulation on different cell types. Lines 475-483: “…To test these hypotheses directly, we clustered neurons into presumed excitatory and inhibitory neurons based on waveform morphology. In doing so, we observed ~85% excitatory and ~15% inhibitory neurons, which is very similar what has been reported previously in human intracranial recordings (Cowan et al. 2024, Peyrache et al., 2012). Interestingly, stimulation appeared to modulate approximately the same proportion of neurons for each cell type (~30%), despite the differently-sized groups. Recent reports, however, have suggested that the extent to which electrical fields entrain neuronal spiking, particularly with respect to phase-locking, may be specific to distinct classes of cells (Lee et al., 2024).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1b:  “Is the autocorrelation of spike timing, which can be informative about temporal dynamics, altered by stimulation? This is especially interesting if theta-burst stimulation either entrains theta-rhythmic spiking or is more modulatory of endogenously theta-modulated units.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct in suggesting that rate-modulation represents only one of many possible ways by which exogenous theta burst stimulation may influence neuronal activity. Indeed, intracranial theta burst stimulation has previously been shown to evoke theta-frequency oscillatory responses in local field potentials (Solomon et al. 2021), and other forms of stimulation (i.e., transcranial alternating current stimulation) may modulate the rhythm, rather than the rate, of neuronal spiking (Krause et al. 2019).</p>
<p>To investigate whether stimulation altered rhythmicity in neuronal firing, we contrasted the spike timing autocorrelograms, as suggested. More specifically, we computed the pairwise differences in spike timing for each trial, separating spikes into the same pre-, during-, and post-stimulation epochs described in the manuscript (bin size = 5 ms, max lag = 250 ms), grouped neurons by whether they were modulated, and then contrasted the differences in the latencies of the peak normalized autocorrelation value between epochs. Only neurons with a firing rate of ≥ 1 Hz (n = 70/203, 34.5%) were included in this analysis since sparse firing resulted in noisy autocorrelation estimates. Subsequent statistical testing of the peak latency differences between pre-/during- and pre-/post-stimulation did not reveal any group-level differences (Mann-Whitney U tests, p &gt; 0.05). Thus, we were not able to identify neuronal responses suggestive of altered rhythmicity (see Figure S5). A description of this analysis and its takeaways has been incorporated into the manuscript.</p>
<p>Of note, there are two elements of the data that constrain our ability to detect modulation in the rhythm of firing. First, the baseline activity recorded across neurons modulated by stimulation was relatively low (i.e., median firing rate = 1.77 Hz). Second, stimulation often resulted in a suppression, rather than an enhancement, of firing rate. Taken together, the sparse firing afforded limited opportunity to characterize changes to subtle patterns of spiking.</p>

<p>Details about the autocorrelation methodology have been incorporated. Lines 166-172: “To investigate whether stimulation altered rhythmicity in neuronal firing, we analyzed the spike timing autocorrelograms. More specifically, we computed the pairwise differences in spike timing for each trial (bin size = 5 ms, max lag = 250 ms) and then contrasted the differences in the latencies of the peak normalized autocorrelation value between epochs (pre-, during-, post-stimulation). Only neurons with a firing rate of ≥ 1 Hz (n = 70/203, 34.5%) were included in this analysis since sparse firing resulted in noisy autocorrelation estimates.</p>
<p>The results from contrasting the autocorrelograms are now mentioned briefly. Lines 297-298: “Stimulation, however, did not appear to alter the rhythmicity in neuronal firing, as measured by spiking autocorrelograms (Figure S5).”</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a further characterization of spike-field and spike-phase relationships may provide rich insights into more complex regional and interregional dynamics that may be altered by stimulation. Given that many metrics are biased by sample size (e.g., number of spikes), which can vary considerably, computing the pairwise phase consistency (PPC) between spikes and LFP is a preferred metric (Vinck et al. 2010). Although PPC is unbiased, its variance nonetheless increases considerably with low spike counts; pooling spike counts across trials, however, decouples the temporal relationship between spiking and the LFP phase for each trial, confounding results and yielding an unstable estimate.</p>
<p>To determine whether such an analysis is indeed possible, we calculated the percentage of stimulation trials with ≥ 10 spikes in both the 1s pre- and post-stimulation epochs (a relatively low threshold for inclusion). Only a very small proportion of the total number of trials across all neurons met this criterion (2.5%). Thus, because of the sparse spiking in our data, we are unable to reliably characterize spike-field or spike-phase modulation in detected neurons.</p>

Although certain metrics are not biased by sample size (e.g., pairwise phase consistency), low spike counts can dramatically affect variance and, therefore, result in unstable estimates (Vinck et al., 2011).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the interesting question. Subsequent characterization revealed only small differences in the proximity of stimulation contacts to white matter (range 1.5-8.0 mm), likely because the chosen target (i.e., basolateral amygdala) has several nearby white matter structures (e.g., stria terminalis). Nonetheless, we performed a linear regression between the proximity to white matter and the stimulation-induced effect on behavior (stimulation vs. no-stimulation d’ difference), the results of which indicate no clear association (p &gt; 0.05; see Figure S9). Critically, this is not to suggest that white matter proximity has no interaction with the reported behavioral effects, but rather, that we could not identify such an association within our data.</p>

<p>Comment 2: “It is a little confusing to interpret stimulation-induced modulation of neuronal spiking in the absence of stimulation-induced change in behavior. How do the authors findings tell us anything about the neural mechanisms of stimulation-modulated memory if memory isn't altered? In line with point #1, I would suggest a deeper dive into behavior (e.g. reaction time? Or focus on individual sessions that do change in Figure 4A?) to make a stronger statement connecting the neural results to behavioral relevance.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the connection between the observed stimulation-induced neuronal modulation and effects on behavior is unclear and has proven challenging to elucidate. Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we further focused our analyses on the neuronal modulation effects in the individual sessions that resulted in a robust change in memory performance (stimulation vs. no-stimulation d’ difference threshold of ± 0.5, based on a moderate effect size for Cohen’s d); both a positive and negative threshold were used to capture robust changes in memory performance associated with firing rate modulation, whether enhancement or suppression. To this end, we contrasted the proportion of modulated neurons in the sessions where stimulation resulted in a robust behavioral change (Δd’) with those that did not (~d’). We did not observe a difference in the proportions between groups when collapsed across all sampled regions, or when separately evaluated (Fisher’s exact tests, p &gt; 0.05; see Figure 5C).</p>
<p>Given that this approach did not further clarify the connection between our neural and behavioral results, we believe it is most appropriate to deemphasize claims in the manuscript regarding the potential insights for behavioral modulation (e.g., memory enhancement), and have done so.</p>
<p>Change to Text:</p>
<p>Toned down reference to the memory-related effects of stimulation in the abstract by removing the following lines from the abstract: “Previously, we demonstrated that intracranial theta burst stimulation (TBS) of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) can enhance declarative memory, likely by modulating hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation…” and “…and motivate future neuromodulatory therapies that aim to recapitulate specific patterns of activity implicated in cognition and memory.”</p>
<p>Changed Figure 4 to Figure 5</p>
<p>Created Figure 5C (Interaction between behavioral effects and neuronal modulation)(C)  Change in recognition memory performance was split into two categories using a d’ difference threshold of ± 0.5: responder (positive or negative; Δd’, pink) and non-responder (~d’, grey).

To test our hypothesis that neuronal modulation would be associated with changes in memory performance, we combined the sessions that resulted in either memory enhancement or impairment and contrasted the proportion of modulated units across regions sampled. We did not, however, observe a meaningful difference in the proportion of modulated units when grouped by behavioral outcome (all contrasts p &gt; 0.05) (Figure 5C).</p>

<p>Comment 3: “It is not clear to me why the assessment of firing rates after image onset and after stim offset is limited to one second - this choice should be more theoretically justified, particularly for regions that spike as sparsely as these.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this question and acknowledge that no clear justification was provided for this decision in the manuscript. Our decision to limit each of the analysis epochs to 1s was chosen for two reasons. First, the maximum possible length of the during-stimulation epoch was 1 s (stim on for 1 s). Although the pre- and post-stimulation epochs could be extended without issue, we were concerned that variable time windows could introduce a bias, for instance, resulting in different variances between epochs. Second, we anticipated, both from empirical observations and prior literature, that the neural response following stimulation or task features (e.g., image onset/offset) was likely to be transient, rather than sustained for a period of many seconds. By keeping the windows short, we ensured that our approach to detecting modulation (i.e., contrasting trial-wise spike counts between each pair of epochs) captured the intended effect rather than random noise. We have incorporated a discussion of this rationale in the Peri-Stimulation Modulation Analyses section.</p>

One study reported a long-lasting reduction in neural excitability among parietal neurons, with variable onset time and recovery following continuous transcranial TBS in non-human primates (Romero et al., 2022). In a similar vein, it was recently shown that human neurons are largely suppressed by single-pulse electrical stimulation (Cowan et al., 2024; Plas et al., 2024). Other emerging evidence suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation may entrain the rhythm rather than rate of neuronal spiking (Krause et al., 2019) and that stimulation-evoked modulation of spiking may meaningfully impact behavioral performance on cognitive tasks (Fehring et al., 2024).”</p>

<p>Comment 1 “Authors suggest that the units modulated by stimulation are largely distinct from those responsive to image offset during trials without stimulation. The subpopulation that responds strongly also tends to have a higher baseline of firing rate. It's important to add that the chosen modulation index is more likely to be significant in neurons with higher firing rates.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important point that was not previously addressed in our manuscript. We suspect there are likely two factors at play worth considering with respect to our chosen nonparametric modulation index: neurons with lower activity require smaller changes in spike counts to be significantly modulated (easier to flip ranks), and neurons with higher activity empirically exhibit greater absolute shifts in the number of spikes. Our further use of permutation testing, while mitigating false positives, may also somewhat constrain the ability to detect modulation in sparsely active neurons. Nonetheless, given that many trials entailed few or no spikes, we believe this approach is preferable to alternatives that may be more susceptible to noise (e.g., percent change in trial-averaged firing rate from baseline).</p>
<p>To better understand the tradeoffs with detection probability, we performed a sensitivity analysis. We generated synthetic data with different baseline firing rates (0.1-5.0 Hz) and effect sizes (± 0.1-0.7 Hz) and simulated the likelihood of detection with our given modulation index across neurons. The results of the simulation support the notion that the probability of detecting modulation is lower for sparsely active neurons (Figure S8C). Further discussion of this consideration for the chosen modulation index, as well as details regarding the sensitivity analysis, have been incorporated into the manuscript.</p>

These results recapitulate our observation that units with higher baseline firing are most likely to exhibit modulation (though the probability of detecting modulation is lower for sparsely active neurons) and suggest that suppression in firing rate is not solely attributable to amplifier saturation following stimulation (Figure S7).</p>
