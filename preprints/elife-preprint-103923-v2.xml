<title>Abstract</title><p>RNA-targeting compounds or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) offer a potent means for controlling viral infections. An essential prerequisite to their design depends on identifying conserved and functional viral RNA structures in cells. Techniques that probe RNA structures <italic>in situ</italic> have been developed recently including SHAPE-MaP, which has been helpful in analyzing the secondary structures of RNA. In this study, we report on the application of SHAPE-MaP to the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus (PEDV) RNA genome to categorize different functional regions including potential quadruplex forming sequence and target sites of siRNA. Our results show that these structures can be exploited to inhibit viral proliferation and that SHAPE-MaP is an effective method to the identification of secondary structures in RNA genomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>RNA-targeting drugs are expected to address the challenges posed by &quot;undruggable&quot; protein targets and significantly expand the landscape of targetable macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Disney, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kovachka et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li and Wang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Ursu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Warner et al., 2018</xref>). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved six siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tang and Khvorova, 2024</xref>), nine antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bennett, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Crooke et al., 2021</xref>), and the RNA-targeting compound Risdiplam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ratni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sheridan, 2021</xref>) for treating complicated diseases such as spinal muscular atrophies. The selection of RNAs that are functional, conserved and accessible to be targeted <italic>in vivo</italic> is fundamental to RNA-targeting drug development. Unlike RNAs <italic>in vitro</italic>, the folding of RNAs in cells is affected by the intricate intracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Manfredonia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, <italic>in situ</italic> probing for the accessibility of viral RNAs by antivirals is essential for the identification of targetable RNAs.</p>
<p>In recent years, the integration of chemical probing methods and high-throughput sequencing technologies has been employed to analyse the structure of the viral RNA genome in infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boerneke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Flynn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huston et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Manfredonia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mauger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pollom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Siegfried et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Smola et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Ziv et al., 2020</xref>). These methods have confirmed the widespread presence of structurally organized RNA elements within the viral genome, which are composed of various types of RNA structures such as stem-loop structures (with double-helical stems), RNA single-strand, RNA pseudoknot and RNA G-quadruplex (G4), collectively forming a complex and dynamic global genome architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boerneke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kwok et al., 2016</xref>). Of these, RNA G4 has shown considerable promise because of its high stability and ability for modulation by small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fleming et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kwok et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ruggiero and Richter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) has been demonstrated to inhibit expression of genes and viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bennett, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bowden-Reid et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Piasecka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Qureshi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sagan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tang and Khvorova, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Westerhout and Berkhout, 2007</xref>). In spite of the advances, identifying RNA elements or regions that serve as targets within complex genomic structural contexts remains challenging.</p>
<p>Selective 2’-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension mutational profile (SHAPE-MaP) stands out in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> RNA structure probing technologies for its ability to quantify nucleotide flexibility and solvent accessibility at single-nucleotide resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lorenz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Siegfried et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Smola et al., 2016</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lucks et al., 2011</xref>). In short, SHAPE reagents like NAI selectively modify flexible, unpaired 2’-OH groups in RNA, and these modifications are detected as mutations during reverse transcription, enabling precise mapping of RNA secondary structures through sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Siegfried et al., 2014</xref>). In the viral long-stranded RNA genome, SHAPE reactivities are used as constraints in the prediction of RNA structures based on nearest-neighbour rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Deigan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mathews et al., 2004</xref>), which may result in thousands of possible conformations. The pairing probability of each nucleotide derived from SHAPE reactivities was subsequently used to calculate Shannon entropy. Regions with high Shannon entropy may adopt alternative conformations, while those with low Shannon entropy correspond to either well-defined RNA structures or persistently single-stranded regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">MATHEWS, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Siegfried et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, SHAPE reactivity provides information about the pairing probability and accessibility of nucleotides, while Shannon entropy reflects the likelihood of alternative conformations in a given region. RNA motifs with low SHAPE reactivity and low Shannon entropy are assumed to be well fold structures and potential targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boerneke et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we categorized RNAs with distinct features in the viral genome according to the SHAPE reactivity and Shannon entropy, and investigate their potential as targets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is an α-coronavirus with a positive single-stranded RNA genome of 28 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee, 2015</xref>). It results in severe diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to the death of ∼90 percent of infected piglets. The spread of PEDV is world-wide and its infection is of primary concern in pig husbandry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee, 2015</xref>). The epizootic re-emergence of PEDV has also been reported to infect human intestinal cells and displays potential susceptibility to cross-species infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Niu et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we adapted the SHAPE-MaP method to detect the <italic>in situ</italic> structure of the PEDV RNA genome in infected cells. More specifically, the combination of SHAPE reactivity and Shannon entropy categorized the PEDV RNA genome into different functional types (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), based on the distinctive profiles, including the 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR), frameshift stimulatory element (FSE), and 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR). We particularly focused on guanine-rich regions, which could potentially fold into a stable G4 structure and sites suitable for binding small interfering RNA (siRNA). Our results show that the folding of G4 in a dynamic single-stranded region with high SHAPE reactivity and high Shannon entropy inhibited viral proliferation, while siRNA targeting persistent single-stranded regions with high SHAPE reactivity and low Shannon entropy exhibited greater success rates in inhibiting viral replication. Finally, this work proposes a strategy for selecting targetable RNAs based on the <italic>in situ</italic> folding characteristics of the viral genome.</p>

<title>Mapping RNA structures in the PEDV genome</title>
<p>SHAPE-MaP was used to characterize the structural features of the PEDV RNA genome in infected cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The high correlations of mutational signatures for biological replicates (<italic>ex vivo</italic> SHAPE R<sup>2</sup>=0.955; <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and the high mutation rate with NAI treatment (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) indicate the high quality of the sequencing data and the experimental workflow.

<p>As the 5’UTR with conserved functions across coronaviruses has been extensively reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Madhugiri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang and Leibowitz, 2015</xref>), we first examined the structure of this region in the PEDV genome for its stability <italic>ex vivo</italic>. The PEDV 5’ UTR structure modelled with SHAPE reactivity constraints contains four stem loops (SL1, SL2, SL4, and SL5; <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) similar to other alpha-coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Madhugiri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang and Leibowitz, 2015</xref>). Our SHAPE dataset showed that ∼95.6% of highly reactive bases (SHAPE reactivity ≥ 0.7) are not involved in canonical base pairing or are located adjacent to helical termini or bulges/loops (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This result suggested that our dataset is reliable as a constraint for predicting the intracellular genomic structure of PEDV.</p>
<p>To characterize the intracellular folding features of the PEDV genome, median SHAPE reactivities and Shannon entropies were calculated in sliding, centered windows (window = 50 nt, step = 1 nt), and a full-genome SHAPE structural map was constructed accordingly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The global median SHAPE reactivity of the genome is 0.233. Specifically, within the 1- 8000 nt region at the 5’ end, the median reactivity is 0.173; it increases to 0.268 in the middle segment of the genome (8000-24000 nt) and then decreases to 0.194 at the 3’ end (24000-28000 nt). These results indicate that the folding of PEDV genomic RNA within infected cells is nonuniform, with the 5’ and 3’ ends being more compactly structured, while the central region is more flexible (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Within the coding regions of the ORF1a, ORF3, M, and N genes, both SHAPE reactivity and Shannon entropy are below the global median, suggesting that these regions are stably folded in the genome (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, the coding regions of the S and E genes exhibit more relaxed and variable conformations, with both SHAPE reactivity and Shannon entropy exceeding the global median (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among the known functional regions, the 5’ UTR (position: 1-310 nt), which is involved in translation initiation and genome packaging, exhibited lower SHAPE reactivity and lower Shannon entropy compared to the global median, indicating a well-folded overall structure. The frameshifting stimulatory element (FSE) (position 12605-12690), which is involved in mediating ribosomal frame shifting, exhibited high SHAPE reactivity and low Shannon entropy values. The 3’ UTR (position 27702-28044 nt), which is responsible for genome cyclization, mRNA stability, and initiation of negative-strand synthesis, showed low SHAPE reactivity and high Shannon entropy values. These functional regions in the PEDV genome exhibiting distinct SHAPE reactivity and Shannon entropy profiles suggest that these regions may adopt different structural folding patterns to perform specific functions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Functional categorization of PEDV genome reveals potentially targetable RNA</title>
<p>To further analyse other functional regions through SHAPE reactivity and Shannon entropy, we combined these two parameters for the classification of structural features (see Methods). Low SHAPE regions were defined as windows in which &gt;75% of the bases exhibited SHAPE reactivities below the global median (calculated on the full PEDV genome), and low Shannon entropy regions were defined according to the same rule, following Manfredonia’s method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Manfredonia et al., 2020</xref>). Windows in which &gt;75% of their bases exhibiting values above the global median were picked as high SHAPE or high Shannon regions.

<p>Regions with high base-pairing rates (low SHAPE) accounted for 38.10% of the PEDV genome, including the 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>). Of these the low SHAPE-low Shannon regions (26.40%) maintain stable conformations throughout the viral life cycle and are assumed to represent the well-folded skeleton and the potentially functional regions of the viral genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). 60 well-folded structures were further identified in these regions, which exhibited consistent conformations in two replicates (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig2s11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). The low SHAPE-high Shannon regions (11.70%), which exhibit variable conformations, might perform different functions through conformational transitions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Designing drugs targeting these regions would require identifying the specific conformations that are responsible for the functions.</p>
<p>Regions with low base-pairing rates (high SHAPE) accounted for 36.57% of the PEDV genome, including the TRS-Ls of the 5’ UTRs (positions 57-72 nt) and FSE regions (positions 12605- 12690 nt)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>). RNAs in the high SHAPE-high Shannon regions (26.90%) are prone to conformational shifts, and their high accessibility suggests that they are more susceptible to interact with small molecule drugs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, RNAs in the high SHAPE-low Shannon regions (9.67% of the PEDV genome) maintain a stable single-stranded state within the cell, facilitating pairing with exogenous complementary sequences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).

<p>Dynamic RNAs in the high SHAPE-high Shannon regions can be induced by compounds to form stable structures that perform specific biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ratni et al., 2021</xref>).

Given the abundance of PEDV mutant strains in nature, further conservation analyses identified seven PQSs that are highly conserved (&gt; 90%) among 761 PEDV strains as potential functional G4 candidates (PQS1-PQS7, Table S5). PQS2, PQS3, PQS4, and PQS6 form stable double-stranded structures with low SHAPE reactivity and low Shannon entropy, making them less likely to fold into stable G4 structures (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig3s5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

<p>To validate whether SHAPE analysis could reflect the competitive conformational folding of PQSs in the PEDV genome, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription to obtain local intact structures containing PQSs within dynamic single-stranded regions and stable double-stranded regions (Table S6). Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence turn-on assays were conducted under physiological K⁺ conditions (100 mM), with the G4 sequence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) serving as a positive control (Control-G4)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fang et al., 2023</xref>). The results demonstrated that for short PQSs sequences containing only G4-forming motifs (Table S7), PQS1, PQS3, PQS4, and PQS6 all induced significant ThT fluorescence enhancement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>), confirming their ability to form G4 structures. However, in long RNA fragments encompassing PQSs and their flanking sequences, only PQS1 and PQS4 exhibited pronounced ThT fluorescence responses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref>), whereas PQS2, PQS3, and PQS6 showed negligible signals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 3— figure supplement 6</xref>). Notably, the PQS1-long chain displayed the strongest fluorescence signal, while its mutant counterpart (PQS1mut-long chain) exhibited the lowest background fluorescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). These findings indicate that although most PQSs can form G4 structures <italic>in vitro</italic>, PQS1—located in the high SHAPE-high Shannon entropy region— demonstrates the most robust G4-forming capability when competing with local secondary structures in the genomic context. Therefore, PQS1 was selected for further structural and functional validation.</p>
<p>PQS1 is located in the nsp3 gene of the PEDV genome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>) and is highly conserved in all 761 PEDV strains (98.37%, <xref rid="fig3s7" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A</xref>). Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and circular dichroism (CD) measurements were conducted to further verify the formation of the PQS1 G4 structure. The migration rate of PQS1 noticeably accelerated with increasing K<sup>+</sup> concentration (<xref rid="fig3s7" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 7B</xref>), whereas the migration rate of the mutant sequences (PQS1m) that did not form G4 remained relatively constant.

Consistent with the RT-qPCR results, compared with the siRNA-NC, we observed that these four siRNAs had minimal cytopathic effects (CPEs) in Vero cells (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Further TCID<sub>50</sub> analysis demonstrated that, three out of the four tested siRNAs targeting single-stranded regions reduced the TCID<sub>50</sub> by approximately 1.5log10 titer compared to the siRNA-NC (ss-1, ss-2, and ss-3; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>).

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>Several RNA-targeting antiviral strategies have highlighted the potential of therapeutic application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dai et al., 2024</xref>). However, it is challenging to identify these RNAs from the viral genome <italic>in situ</italic>. In SHAPE-MaP analysis, regions with low reactivity and low entropy values are more likely to form a single stable structure in cells, and are therefore considered candidates for potential functional RNAs and targets for antiviral therapy. Novel well-defined RNA structures that are critical for viral fitness in HIV, HCV, DENV and SINV have been identified by the analysis of low SHAPE and low entropy regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dethoff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kutchko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mauger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Siegfried et al., 2014</xref>). However, there are still no clinically approved small molecule drugs or oligonucleotides targeting stable folded RNA structures. Our data shows that two compounds that interacted with the well-folded 5’UTR-SL5 of PEDV <italic>in vitro</italic> at µM-level <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>, but did not show antiviral activity at 50 µM in cells (<xref rid="fig2s13" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplements 13</xref>-<xref rid="fig2s14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>). This result suggests that, on the one hand, the low accessibility of the regions with low SHAPE reactivity makes them difficult to access by compounds in cells, and may require compounds to have better <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> to RNA. On the other hand, the binding of compounds to the well-folded structure does not necessarily alter its function. In contrast, the FDA-approved compound Risdiplam exerts its biological activity by stabilizing transient RNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Campagne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ratni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sheridan, 2021</xref>), suggesting that it may be possible to inhibit viral proliferation by stabilizing variable conformations. We therefore focused our attention on highly accessible regions with high SHAPE reactivity in cells.</p>
<p>We identified 42 low SHAPE and high Shannon regions and 49 high SHAPE and high Shannon regions in the PEDV genome by SHAPE-MaP, representing conformationally variable RNAs in the viral genome. As the low SHAPE regions are highly structured, it is difficult for the G4 in these regions to outcompete the folding of long base paired structures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We therefore selected a potential G4 sequence (PQS1) located in the high SHAPE-high Shannon region of nsp3 (PLpro), where a G4-disrupting mutation promotes viral proliferation. We found that the compound Braco-19 significantly stabilised the G4 structure of PQS1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and inhibited PEDV proliferation in cells. Crucially, Braco-19 showed no inhibitory activity against the PQS1-mutant strain while maintaining potent activity against the PQS3-mutant strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This suggests that the compound can selectively target the PQS1 of the high SHAPE-high Shannon region in cells. This approach can be extended to other RNA viruses and potentially to DNA viruses where RNA intermediates play critical roles in the viral life cycle.</p>

<p>Recently, the FDA has approved several siRNAs for therapeutic purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ali Zaidi et al., 2023</xref>). siRNA-mediated RNAi is particularly suited to inhibit viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes due to its potential to specifically silence virtually any therapeutic target. When screening siRNA target sequences, sequence conservation and the functional importance of the target region are usually given priority. However, the RNA structure of the target region also has a significant impact on the efficiency of RNAi (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Manfredonia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Patzel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Piasecka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sagan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Szabat et al., 2020</xref>).

This represents a significant departure from traditional siRNA design methods that rely primarily on sequence conservation, thermodynamic rules (e.g., Tuschl rules), or <italic>in vitro</italic> structural predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ali Zaidi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Qureshi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tang and Khvorova, 2024</xref>),which may not accurately reflect intracellular RNA accessibility. Bowden-Reid et al. designed 39 antiviral siRNAs against various SARS-CoV-2 variants based on sequence conservation, ultimately identifying 8 highly effective sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bowden-Reid et al., 2023</xref>). Notably, five of these effective sequences targeted regions that were located in high SHAPE-high Shannon regions according to SARS-CoV-2 SHAPE datasets (Table S8)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Manfredonia et al., 2020</xref>). This independent finding aligns perfectly with our conclusions and demonstrates that SHAPE-based siRNA design outperforms sequence/structure-agnostic approaches, at least in terms of significantly improving antiviral siRNA screening efficiency. Given the growing availability of SHAPE datasets for numerous viruses, we are confident that our methodology will facilitate more precise design of antiviral siRNAs.</p>

<p>The rf-fold module, employing a previously established windowed approach<sup>13,</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Siegfried et al., 2014</xref>), predicts the RNA secondary structure of the entire PEDV genome using the normalization step’s XML file, with a default pseudo-free energy intercept and slope values of -0.6 (kcal/mol) and 1.8 (kcal/mol), respectively, with the following parameters: -fw 3000 -fo 300 -wt 200 -pw 1000 -po 250 -dp -sh -nlp -md 600. This means that RNAstructure will generate a 3000 nt window and slide in 300 nt increments over the genome in 1000 nt partition windows, predicting the most reasonable secondary structure of the genome under the condition that the maximum base pairing distance does not exceed 600 nt. SHAPE reactivities were incorporated in the form of soft constraints using the Vienna RNA package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lorenz et al., 2016</xref>). For each window, the first and last 100 nt were ignored to avoid terminal biases.

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic diagram of the RNA stop assay. The PQS1 sequence (orange part) was integrated into the 5’ end of the RNA template, and a 5’ FAM-tagged RNA primer P15 (green and blue parts of the RNA primer) was designed to target the 3’ end of the template (blue part of the RNA blue part of the template) to initiate RNA synthesis. When G4 blocks RNA synthesis, there are fewer full-length elongated bands and truncated bands at the site of G4 formation. <bold>(B)</bold> Denaturing-PAGE analysis. Black arrows indicate the positions of the full-length product, G4 paused product, and free primer. The fully extended product and the template RNA and the polymerase form a stable complex that moves much more slowly than the ssRNA. Partial full-length extended products and stopped products (due to G-quadruplex fold) were observed along template PQS1 (lane 2), but only fully extended products were observed along G4-mutated template PQS1mut (lane 5). When increasing amounts of compound Braco-19 were incubated with template PQS1, a gradual decrease in fully extended products was observed (lanes 2-4). On the contrary, the fully extended products of template PQS1mut were not affected by the addition of Braco-19, and the G4-specific termination event was not characterized (lanes 5-7). Lane 1, RNA ladder (p15, m17, m20 and m42 in Table S1); lanes 2, no Braco19 control; lanes 3 and 4, 0.5 and 1 µM compounds inhibit RNA extension; lanes 5, no Braco19 control; lanes 6 and 7, compounds do not inhibit RNA extension.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Luo et al. applied SHAPE-Map to analyze the secondary structure of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus (PEDV) RNA genome in infected cells. By combining SHAPE reactivity and Shannon entropy, the study indicated that the folding of the PEDV genomic RNA was nonuniform, with the 5' and 3' untranslated regions being more compactly structured, which revealed potentially antiviral targetable RNA regions. Interestingly, the study also suggested that compounds bound to well-folded RNA structures in vitro did not necessarily exhibit antiviral activity in cells, because the binding of these compounds did not necessarily alter the functions of the well-folded RNA regions. Later in the manuscript, the authors focus on guanine-rich regions, which may form G-quadruplexes and be potential targets for small interfering RNA (siRNA). The manuscript shows the binding effect of Braco-19 (a G-quadruplex-binding ligand) to a predicted G4 region in vitro, along with the inhibition of PEDV proliferation in cells. This suggests that targeting high SHAPE-high Shannon G4 regions could be a promising approach against RNA viruses. Lastly, the manuscript identifies 73 single-stranded regions with high SHAPE and low Shannon entropy, which demonstrated high success in antiviral siRNA targeting.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper presents valuable data for the community. Additionally, the experimental design and data analysis are well documented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I have no further comments after the authors validated their concept by adding the ThT fluorescence assay in the revised version.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the potential of targeting specific regions within the RNA genome of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) for antiviral drug development. The authors used SHAPE-MaP to analyze the structure of the PEDV RNA genome in infected cells. They categorized different regions of the genome based on their structural characteristics, focusing on those that might be good targets for drugs or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).</p>
<p>They found that dynamic single-stranded regions can be stabilized by compounds (e.g., to form G-quadruplexes), which inhibit viral proliferation. They demonstrated this by targeting a specific G4-forming sequence with a compound called Braco-19. The authors also describe stable (structured) single-stranded regions that they used to design siRNAs showing that they effectively inhibited viral replication.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>There are a number of strengths to highlight in this manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) The study uses a sophisticated technique (SHAPE-MaP) to analyze the PEDV RNA genome in situ, providing valuable insights into its structural features.</p>
<p>(2) The authors provide a strong rationale for targeting specific RNA structures for antiviral development.</p>
<p>(3) The study includes a range of experiments, including structural analysis, compound screening, siRNA design, and viral proliferation assays, to support their conclusions.</p>
<p>(4) Finally, the findings have potential implications for the development of new antiviral therapies against PEDV and other RNA viruses.</p>
<p>Overall, this interesting study highlights the importance of considering RNA structure when designing antiviral therapies and provides a compelling strategy for identifying promising RNA targets in viral genomes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I have some concerns about the utility of the 3D analyses, the effects of their synonymous mutants on expression/proliferation, a potentially missed control for studies of mutants, and the therapeutic utility of the compound they tested vs. Gquadruplexes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment and insightful comments. Below, we address each point of concern:</p>
<p>(1) The utility of the 3D analyses:</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have toned down this discussion and moved Figure 3A to the supplementary materials to reduce any sense of fragmentation in the overall story. While SHAPE-MaP technology is mature and convenient to use and can indeed capture some RNA structural elements with special functions in certain case; we acknowledge that its application for 3D analyses requires further validation. We believe this approach will become more prevalent in future research.</p>
<p>(2) The effects of synonymous mutants on expression/proliferation:</p>
<p>In the PEDV genome, the PQS1 mutation site encodes lysine (AAG). Given that lysine has only two codons (AAG and AAA), the G3109A synonymous mutation represented our sole viable option. Published studies (Ding et al., 2024) confirm that neither AAG nor AAA are classified as rare or dominant codons in mammalian cells. Therefore, the observed changes in viral proliferation levels are likely to stem from alterations in RNA secondary structure rather than codon usage effects.</p>

<p>Ding W, Yu W, Chen Y, et al. Rare codon recoding for efficient noncanonical amino acid incorporation in mammalian cells. Science. 2024;384(6700):1134-1142.</p>
<p>(3) Potentially missed control for studies of mutants:</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have incorporated additional control experiments evaluating Braco-19's therapeutic effects on the PQS3 mutant strain (Figure 4 – figure supplement 3)：</p>
<p>(4) The therapeutic utility of Braco-19 vs. G-quadruplexes:</p>
<p>While Braco-19 is indeed a broad-spectrum G4 ligand, our data clearly show that not all PQSs in the viral genome can form G4 structures. Our findings primarily provide proof-of-concept that sequences with high G4-forming potential in viral genomes represent viable targets for antiviral therapy. Future studies could leverage SHAPEguided structural insights to design ligands with enhanced specificity for viral G4s, potentially improving therapeutic utility while minimizing off-target effects.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comments and recognition of our study's value. The most commonly employed cell models for in vitro PEDV studies are monkey-derived Vero E6 cells and porcine PK1 cells. However, PEDV (particularly our strain) exhibits significantly lower replication efficiency in PK1 cells compared to Vero cells, and no cytopathic effects were observed in PK1 cells. In our preliminary attempts to perform SHAPE-MaP experiments using infected PK1 cells, the sequencing data showed less than 0.03% alignment to the PEDV genome, rendering subsequent analysis and downstream experiments unfeasible.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Luo et al. applied SHAPE-Map to analyze the secondary structure of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus (PEDV) RNA genome in infected cells. By combining SHAPE reactivity and Shannon entropy, the study indicated that the folding of the PEDV genomic RNA was nonuniform, with the 5' and 3' untranslated regions being more compactly structured, which revealed potentially antiviral targetable RNA regions. Interestingly, the study also suggested that compounds bound to well-folded RNA structures in vitro did not necessarily exhibit antiviral activity in cells, because the binding of these compounds did not necessarily alter the functions of the well-folded RNA regions. Later in the manuscript, the authors focus on guanine-rich regions, which may form G-quadruplexes and be potential targets for small interfering RNA (siRNA). The manuscript shows the binding effect of Braco-19 (a G-quadruplex-binding ligand) to a predicted G4 region in vitro, along with the inhibition of PEDV proliferation in cells. This suggests that targeting high SHAPE-high Shannon G4 regions could be a promising approach against RNA viruses. Lastly, the manuscript identifies 73 singlestranded regions with high SHAPE and low Shannon entropy, which demonstrated high success in antiviral siRNA targeting.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper presents valuable data for the community. Additionally, the experimental design and data analysis are well documented.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>The manuscript presents the effect of Braco-19 on PQS1, a single G4 region with high SHAPE and high Shannon entropy, to suggest that &quot;the compound can selectively target the PQS1 of the high SHAPE-high Shannon region in cells&quot; (lines 625-626). While the effect of Braco-19 on PQS1 is supported by strong evidence in the manuscript, the conclusion regarding the G4 region with high SHAPE and high Shannon entropy is based on a single target, PQS1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of our methodology and dataset. We propose that dynamic RNA structures in high SHAPE-high Shannon regions, when stabilized by small molecules, can serve as viable targets for antiviral therapy. Gquadruplexes represent a characteristic type of such dynamic structures that compete with local stem-loop formations in the genome. While we identified seven highly conserved PQSs in the PEDV genome, only PQS1 was located within a high SHAPEhigh Shannon region. To further validate this concept, we have supplemented the revised manuscript with Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence turn-on assays (Figures 3D, 3E, and Figure 3 – figure supplement 6), which provide additional evidence for the differential G4-forming capabilities of PQSs across regions with distinct structural features.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>(1) It could be valuable for the authors to spend some more effort comparing their approach to siRNA target discovery and design to current methods for siRNA design. It would be good to highlight which components are novel, and which might offer superior performance with respect to other existing methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important point. In response, we have rewritten the relevant section in the discussion:</p>
<p>“Our approach uniquely integrates in situ RNA structural data (SHAPE reactivity and Shannon entropy) to prioritize siRNA targets within stable single-stranded regions (high SHAPE reactivity, low Shannon entropy), which are experimentally validated as accessible in infected cells. This represents a significant departure from traditional siRNA design methods that rely primarily on sequence conservation, thermodynamic rules (e.g., Tuschl rules), or <italic>in vitro</italic> structural predictions (Ali Zaidi et al., 2023; Qureshi et al., 2018; Tang and Khvorova, 2024),which may not accurately reflect intracellular RNA accessibility. Bowden-Reid et al. designed 39 antiviral siRNAs against various SARS-CoV-2 variants based on sequence conservation, ultimately identifying 8 highly effective sequences (Bowden-Reid et al., 2023). Notably, five of these effective sequences targeted regions that were located in high SHAPE-high Shannon regions according to SARS-CoV-2 SHAPE datasets (Supplementary Table 8) (Manfredonia et al., 2020). This independent finding aligns perfectly with our conclusions and demonstrates that SHAPE-based siRNA design outperforms sequence/structureagnostic approaches, at least in terms of significantly improving antiviral siRNA screening efficiency. Given the growing availability of SHAPE datasets for numerous viruses, we are confident that our methodology will facilitate more precise design of antiviral siRNAs.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The section targeting their discovered G4 structure with Braco-19 is interesting, particularly showing effects on viral proliferation; however, it's not clear to me how this compound could be used therapeutically against PEDV, as it is a non-selective binder of G4 structures. Their results are good support for the presence and functionality of a G4 structure in PEDV, but I don't see any strategy outlined in the manuscript on how this could be specifically targeted with Braco-19.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While Braco-19 is indeed a broad-spectrum G4 ligand, our data demonstrate that not all PQSs in the viral genome can form G4 structures under physiological conditions. Our results specifically show that Braco-19 exerts its anti-PEDV activity by targeting PQS1, which is located in a high SHAPE-high Shannon entropy region. This target specificity was further confirmed by the complete resistance of the PQS1mut strain (lacking G4-forming ability) to Braco-19 treatment in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays.</p>
<p>Additionally, previous studies have reported that during rapid viral replication, viral RNA accumulates to levels that significantly exceed host RNA concentrations. This &quot;concentration advantage&quot; suggests that G4 ligands like Braco-19 would preferentially bind viral G4 structures over host targets, thereby enhancing their antiviral specificity <italic>in vivo</italic>. In summary, our data provide proof-of-concept that viral genomic regions with high G4-forming potential - particularly those in high SHAPE-high Shannon entropy regions - represent promising targets for antiviral therapy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The section where they proposed 3D RNA structures based on sequence similarity feels &quot;tacked on&quot; and I don't see how it adds to the overall story. The authors identify a short RNA hairpin in the PEDV genome with some sequence similarity to the CPEB3 nuclease P4 hairpin. However, they don't provide any evidence that this motif functions in a similar way or that it's important for the virus's life cycle. They also don't explain how this similarity could be exploited for antiviral drug development. It's not clear whether targeting this motif would have any effect on the virus. It's interesting that these two sequences share nucleotides, but it's unlikely that they share any homology...perhaps they convergently evolved (or were captured), but the similarity could also be coincidental.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's insightful observation regarding this section. While our intention was to demonstrate that flexible conformations in high SHAPE-high Shannon regions could potentially be targeted, we acknowledge that extensive discussion of these motifs' functions would exceed the scope of this study, resulting in some disconnection from the main narrative. In response to this valuable feedback, we have consequentially removed it from the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors should consider the optimality of the synonymous mutation (G3109A) that they introduced, as G3109A could swap a rare codon for a more optimal one. Even though the protein sequence is unaffected, the translation rate (and ability to proliferate) could be very different due to altered codon optimality. Additionally, to show the inactivity of the PQS3 mutant, the Braco-19 treatment studies performed on the PQS1 mutants could be repeated with PQS3 - using this as a control for these experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's insightful comment regarding codon optimization. In the PEDV genome, the PQS1 mutation site encodes lysine (AAG). Since lysine has only two codons (AAG and AAA), the G3109A synonymous mutation was our only viable option. Published literature (Ding et al. 2024) confirms that neither AAG nor AAA are classified as either preferred or rare codons in mammalian cells. Therefore, this substitution should have minimal direct impact on translation efficiency. Compared to nonsynonymous mutations that would alter amino acid sequences, we believe this synonymous mutation represents the optimal approach for maintaining native protein function while introducing the desired structural modification.</p>

<p>In the revised version, we have added control experiments showing the inhibitory activity of Braco-19 against the PQS3 mutant strain (Figure 4—figure supplement 3C) and discussed it in the results section.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, as a control, we observed nearly identical inhibitory activity of Braco19 against both the PQS3 mutant strain (AJ1102-PQS3mut) and wild-type virus (Figure 4—figure supplement 3C), demonstrating the specificity of Braco-19's action on PQS1.”</p>

<p>Minor Comments:</p>
<p>(5) The authors' description of the Shannon Entropy could be improved. The current description makes it seem like the Shannon Entropy only provides information on base pairing, however, the Shannon entropy quantifies the uncertainty of structural states at each position and is calculated based on the probabilities of the different states (paired or unpaired) that a nucleotide can adopt.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the description of Shannon entropy in the manuscript：</p>
<p>&quot;The pairing probability of each nucleotide derived from SHAPE reactivities was subsequently used to calculate Shannon entropy. Regions with high Shannon entropy may adopt alternative conformations, while those with low Shannon entropy correspond to either well-defined RNA structures or persistently single-stranded regions (MATHEWS, 2004; Siegfried et al., 2014).&quot;</p>

<p>We have revised the captions for Figure 1 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;(A) Well-folded regions (low SHAPE reactivity and low Shannon entropy; 26.40% of genome). These regions represent stably folded RNA structures with minimal conformational flexibility, likely serving as structural scaffolds or functional elements in viral replication. (B) Dynamic structured regions (low SHAPE reactivity and high Shannon entropy; 11.70% of genome). These conformationally plastic domains likely mediate regulatory switches between alternative secondary structures during infection. (C) Dynamic unpaired regions (high SHAPE reactivity and high Shannon entropy; 26.90% of genome). These regions are prone to form non-canonical nucleic acid structures (e.g., G-quadruplexes), which can be stabilized by small-molecule ligands to inhibit viral replication. (D) Persistent unpaired regions (high SHAPE reactivity and low Shannon entropy; 9.67% of genome). These regions are more accessible for siRNA binding, facilitating recruitment of Argonaute proteins and Dicer to form the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC) for targeted cleavage.&quot;</p>

<p>(12) Line 107: I would argue that the &quot;stabilization of a G4&quot; inhibited viral proliferation. And that supports the point of the paper, that a small molecule that stabilizes the G4 can be used to reduce viral replication. I suggest emphasizing this thorough the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully concur with the reviewer's insightful perspective. In the revised manuscript, we have comprehensively strengthened the point of 'G4 stabilization' as an antiviral mechanism through the following enhancements:</p>
<p>(1) In the Results section: We present Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assays demonstrating the G4-forming capability of PQSs in the full-length PEDV genomic RNA context:</p>
<p>“These findings indicate that although most PQSs can form G4 structures in vitro, PQS1—located in the high SHAPE-high Shannon entropy region—demonstrates the most robust G4-forming capability when competing with local secondary structures in the genomic context.”</p>
<p>(2) In the Results section: The inclusion of Braco-19 inhibition assays using PQS3 mutant virus as control provides robust evidence that Braco-19 exerts its antiviral effects specifically through PQS1 stabilization:</p>
<p>“Furthermore, as a control, we observed nearly identical inhibitory activity of Braco-19 against both the PQS3 mutant strain (AJ1102-PQS3mut) and wild-type virus, demonstrating the specificity of Braco-19's action on PQS1.”</p>
<p>(3) In the Discussion section: We have rewritten the mechanistic interpretation to emphasize:</p>
<p>&quot;Crucially, Braco-19 showed no inhibitory activity against the PQS1-mutant strain while maintaining potent activity against the PQS3-mutant strain (Figure 4E, Figure 4—figure supplement 3C). This suggests that the compound can selectively target the PQS1 of the high SHAPE-high Shannon region in cells.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) For PQS1, it's suggested that it is indeed a competing and transient conformation that forms the G4. I wonder if using an extended PQS1 (perhaps what is shown in Figure 3E) and using fluorescence, and/or K+ vs Li+, and/or in-vitro SHAPE could tell us more about this dynamic structure. Thioflavin T or any other fluorescent molecule that binds to G4s could be easily used to show how the formation of G4 may happen or not. In addition, how Braco-19 could really lock the dynamic structure in-vitro as well. I think the field would benefit from a deeper investigation of it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address the dynamic competition between G4 and alternative RNA conformations, we performed Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence turn-on assay (now in Figure 3D-E and Figure 3—figure supplement 6) under physiological K<sup>+</sup> conditions (100 mM), with PRRSV-G4 RNA as a positive control. This reads as:</p>
<p>“To validate whether SHAPE analysis could reflect the competitive conformational folding of PQSs in the PEDV genome, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription to obtain local intact structures containing PQSs within dynamic single-stranded regions and stable double-stranded regions (Table S6). Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence turn-on assays were conducted under physiological K<sup>+</sup> conditions (100 mM), with the G4 sequence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) serving as a positive control (Control-G4)(Fang et al., 2023). The results demonstrated that for short PQSs sequences containing only G4-forming motifs (Table S7), PQS1, PQS3, PQS4, and PQS6 all induced significant ThT fluorescence enhancement (Figure 3D-E, Figure 3—figure supplement 6), confirming their ability to form G4 structures. However, in long RNA fragments encompassing PQSs and their flanking sequences, only PQS1 and PQS4 exhibited pronounced ThT fluorescence responses (Figure 3DE), whereas PQS2, PQS3, and PQS6 showed negligible signals (Figure 3E, Figure 3— figure supplement 6). Notably, the PQS1-long chain displayed the strongest fluorescence signal, while its mutant counterpart (PQS1mut-long chain) exhibited the lowest background fluorescence (Figure 3D). These findings indicate that although most PQSs can form G4 structures <italic>in vitro</italic>, PQS1—located in the high SHAPE-high Shannon entropy region—demonstrates the most robust G4-forming capability when competing with local secondary structures in the genomic context. Therefore, PQS1 was selected for further structural and functional validation.”</p>
