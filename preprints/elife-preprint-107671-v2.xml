<abstract><p>Interleukin-7 (IL-7) plays a central role in maintaining T cell development and immune homeostasis, and enhancing the cytokine’s immune-stimulatory functionality has broad therapeutic implications against various oncological malignancies. Herein, we show a computationally designed IL7 superkine, Neo-7, which exhibits enhanced folding efficiency and superior binding affinity to its cognate receptors. To streamline the protein candidate prediction and validation process, the loop region of IL7 was strategically targeted for redesign while most of the receptor-interacting regions were preserved. Leveraging advanced computational tools such as AlphaFold2, we show loop remodeling to rectify structural irregularities that allows for iterative stabilization of protein backbone and leads to identification of beneficial mutations conducive to receptor engagement. Neo-7 superkine shows improved thermostability and production yield, and it exhibits heightened immune-stimulatory and anticancer effect in C57BL/6J mice. These findings underscore the utility of a targeted computational approach for de novo cytokine development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Clinical success with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers has invigorated developmental efforts on immunotherapeutic strategies that strengthen the body’s immune system against oncological malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. The promise of durable tumor suppression by immunotherapeutic approaches has rekindled enthusiasm towards cytokine therapies, which can enhance immune responses and promote a more effective attack on cancer cells by directly stimulating the proliferation and activation of various immune cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Cytokine-mediated immune cells activation can override the negative feedback mechanisms and bolster immune cell stimulation, allowing for broad-spectrum tumor suppression and synergistic actions with ICIs and ICD inducers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. However, traditional cytokine therapies have been hampered by challenges such as short half-lives, poor pharmacokinetics, and significant toxicity at therapeutic doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. These issues have hindered the broader application of cytokines in cancer treatment despite their potential benefits. For instance, IL-2, one of the first cytokines identified with potent anti-cancer properties, is limited by severe adverse effects, restricting its maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to 37 µg/kg, which in turn limits its efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Similar toxicity concerns exist for other interleukins, such as IL-12, IL-15, and IL-21, with clinical MTDs of 1.0, 20, and 100 µg/kg, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], thus prompting emerging protein design strategies for cytokine variant development with elevated efficacy profiles.</p>
<p>Advances in computational protein design have opened up new opportunities for cytokine engineering, which enables de novo design of cytokine variants with improved stability, reduced toxicity, and enhanced efficacy. These engineered cytokines can be structurally modified for enhanced engagement with their putative cognate receptors, leading to enhanced elevated therapeutic and safety profiles for treatment development. A notable example is the work by Silva et al. (2019), which demonstrated a significant breakthrough in computational protein design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Using the Rosetta protein design suite, they restructured and redesigned 4-helix bundle mimetics of IL-2 and IL-15 (neo-2/15), resulting in proteins that are more potent and stable both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, with specifically programmed receptor specificity. Although the seminal study showcased the possibility for researcher to design novel protein with computationally idealized structure in its entirety, such approach demands substantial computing resources and can generate many non-analogous candidates for validation. We envision that a targeted redesign strategy that focuses on protein domains with manifest folding inefficiency can minimize the resources required for computational protein engineering. In the present work, the targeted computational design strategy is demonstrated through the development of an IL-7 variant.</p>
<p>Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a member of the common gamma chain (γc) receptor family, which includes cytokines such as IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. IL-7 plays a crucial role in the survival, differentiation, and proliferation of immune cells, including T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that IL-7 promotes the survival and homeostatic proliferation of splenocytes by upregulating survival factors like Bcl-2. Preclinical animal studies and clinical trials have demonstrated broader functions, including the induction and maintenance of memory T cells, promotion of T cell homing to lymphoid organs, increased T cell receptor diversity, and enhanced T cell cytotoxicity by the cytokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The first-generation IL-7, known as CYT-107, demonstrated potent immune cell reconstitution in phase 2 clinical trials for HIV patients (for CD4+ T cell restoration) and patients with sepsis-induced lymphopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. However, its anti-cancer efficacy was limited, as it increased immune cell count but did not induce a significant anti-tumor response, likely due to its short half-life (8.7-34.6 hours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. The second-generation IL-7 drug, NT-I7 (efineptakin alfa), uses a hybrid human IgG/IgD Fc domain for half-life extension (T1/2 = 60.8-139.7 hours), which significantly improves its anti-tumor activities. Efineptakin alfa supports the proliferation and survival CD4+ and CD8+ cells in both human and mice showing promising responses in early-phase clinical trials for advanced solid tumors, particularly in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Although much efforts have been devoted to enhance IL-7 pharmacokinetics through protein fusion, no variant or computationally designed mimic has been reported on the cytokine to our knowledge.</p>
<p>From a development perspective, IL-7 is prone to aggregation and requires additional engineering to enhance its solubility and stability. To address these challenges, we herein engineer a novel variant of IL-7, known as Neo-7, with enhanced folding efficiency through targeted computational protein design. By removing redundant loops and redesigning the protein backbone using Rosetta loop remodeling, we reconnected the functional domains in a more efficient and economical structural (In this context, the term efficiency refers to the shortest number of amino acids that is required to connect two receptor-binding or functional helices). Advanced computational tools were employed to ensure that the Neo-7 variant would fold according to the predicted structural models, resulting in a protein with superior folding efficiency and receptor binding affinity. In further experimental studies, Neo-7 demonstrates improved <italic>in vitro</italic> production yield and <italic>in vivo</italic> biological activity, positioning it as a promising candidate for cancer immunotherapy. These advancements underscore the potential of IL-7 and its engineered variants as effective cancer immunotherapies, highlighting the importance of optimizing cytokine properties for clinical application.</p>

<title>Development of a computational pipeline for rational protein design</title>
<p>In redesigning IL-7, we aimed to minimize sequence alterations relative to the wild-type protein. This strategy is based on the understanding that a protein’s sequence is closely tied to its structure and function. By preserving the native sequence elements involved in IL-7’s biological activity, we sought to maximize the likelihood of producing a successful variant without compromising its original function. We began by examining the crystal structure of IL-7 bound to its receptor, IL7R<sub>α</sub> (nterleukin-7 receptor alpha; PDB ID: 3DI2), which recruits IL-2R<sub>γ</sub> to form a heterodimeric receptor complex essential for downstream signaling. Loop remodeling was performed using Rosetta’s loop remodeling modules, followed by validation with AlphaFold, employing both single-sequence monomer and multimer models. During the computational design and validation process, each model predicted by either Rosetta or AlphaFold was meticulously inspected using PyMOL and Discovery Studio 4.5. Residues that were found to clash with neighboring amino acids were further refined through mutations using Rosetta’s fix backbone modules. The gene sequences of the final designs that successfully passed this computational pre-filtering were then synthesized and cloned into a yeast display vector for subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> validation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Schematic illustrating the computational pipelines for Neo-7 engineering from wild type IL7 sequence.</title> <p>In general, non-receptor interacting loops were deleted from the WT-IL7 sequence and loops connecting the adjacent helixes were modeled using Rosetta Loop Remodeler and Rosetta fix backbone design function. The sequence of the designed model were extracted and submitted to alphafold (monomer and multimer mode for structure and protein-receptor binding prediction respectively) as an preliminary validation of the Rosetta-remodeled protein. Iterations of the bad models (models that do not fold into the expected structure or models that did not predicted to bind to the receptors) back to the design stage were performed. Models that passed the Alphafold validation proceeded to subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> assay using yeast display system and flow cytometry to determine their relative binding affinity to IL-7 receptors in comparison to WT-IL7.</p></caption>

<p>The wild-type IL-7 protein forms a 4-helix bundle structure with three inter-helical loops. Upon visually examining its crystal structure in complex with IL-7 receptor alpha (IL7R<sub>α</sub>), we noted that the connectivity between each helix is intricate and inefficient (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). In the crystal structure of WT-IL7 complexed with IL-7 receptor alpha, IL-7 is composed of four helices. Helices 1 and 3 are found to interact with IL-7 receptor alpha (IL7R<sub>α</sub>), while helices 1 and 4 are predicted to interact with the IL-2 receptor common gamma chain (IL2R<sub>γ</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Helix 2 was observed to serve as a structural support for the helix bundle. However, the connectivity of these helices exhibited complexity and inefficiency. Notably, the loop between helix 1 and 2 spans 29 amino acids (AA), the loop connecting helix 2 and 3 is 6 AA long, and the loop connecting helix 3 and 4 is 35 AA long. We extracted the helices from the PDB structure file and reconnected the helices using Loop Remodel function from the Rosetta suite. The protein was remodeled clockwise in the order of H1&gt;H3&gt;H2&gt;H4. The new loops connecting H1-H3, H3-H2 and H2-H4 are 7, 8 and 5 AA in length respectively. The amino acid sequences of the designed loops were subsequently optimized using Rosetta Fix Backbone design function and validated using Alphafold monomer.</p>

The connectivity of the functioning helixes were connected in a manner that requires extremely long protein loops by design (i.e. helices were not connected to the closest adjacent helixes but to the opposite helix). Loops that were not interacted with the IL-7 receptors were deleted and the helixes were reconnected in a clockwise manner via new protein linkers connecting to the adjacent helixes. The blueprint of the redesigned protein was shown at the right side of the figure.

<title>Structural Modeling of Neo-7 in Alphafold single sequence mode</title>
<p>The synthesized Neo-7 sequence was cloned into a yeast-display vector to assess its expression and binding capability to IL7R<sub>α</sub>. Despite the concordance between Rosetta and AlphaFold monomer predictions, no binding was observed between displayed Neo-7 and IL7R<sub>α</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). A degree of binding to IL2R<sub>γ</sub> was detected, possibly reflecting partial folding of the displayed protein in the yeast display platform. We also postulated that the high similarity between the helices of Neo-7 and WT-IL7 amino acid sequences might lead to sampling bias, leading Alphafold to predict a similar folding of Neo-7 to WT-IL7. To investigate this, we utilized AlphaFold Single Sequence (AlphaFold SS), an online platform capable of performing AlphaFold without relying on a PDB template and multiple sequence alignment (MSA) database. The resulting structure model from AlphaFold SS indicated misfolding of helix 2 (providing structural support) and helix 3 (binding to IL7R<sub>α</sub>) when superimposed onto WT-IL7 helices (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). However, the helices responsible for binding to the gamma receptor aligned well with the WT template. Subsequently, we addressed the misfolded helices by redesigning their connecting loops (loop 1 and 2) using Rosetta fix backbone design and validated the structures with AlphaFold SS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

The signal intensity of the X-axis (confers by the binding of anti-HA mab) correlates with the expression level of the displayed protein while the signal intensity of the Y-axis (confers by the binding of the anti-HIS/anti-FC mab to the recombinant receptors bound to the displayed proteins) correlates with the binding affinity of the displayed proteins towards the IL-7 receptors.</p></caption>

<title>Disulfide stapling on Helix 1 and stabilizing mutations are essential for binding of IL-7 and Neo-7 to IL-7 receptor-<bold><sub>α</sub></bold></title>
<p>Since the helices were adapted from the WT-IL7, we hypothesized that those beneficial mutations to stabilize IL-7 or enhance its binding to the cognate receptors should be applicable to our designed constructs. Prior to the transfer of the beneficial mutations discovered from our previous study (Figure 3-figure supplement 1), we first constructed a multimer-model consisting of Neo-7, murine IL7R<sub>α</sub> and the common IL2R<sub>γ</sub> receptors using Alphafold Multimer. The resulting model was used as a structure template for Rosetta fix backbone design, which the amino acid variants of the mutants and their wild type counterpart (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were keyed into the Rosetta fix backbone residue files for calculation. Only those mutations that were favored by Rosetta are selected to maximize the stability of the protein and to preserve their theoretical folding in the subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> yeast display assay.</p>

<p>The Neo-7 design, incorporating Rosetta-favored mutations, demonstrated enhanced protein-display level and binding to IL2R<sub>γ</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). However, despite the alignment between computational protein design and prediction programs, weak or insignificant binding of the designed Neo-7 to murine IL7R<sub>α</sub> was observed in the yeast display system. A closer examination of the crystal structure of WT-IL7 with IL7R<sub>α</sub> revealed a kink on helix 1 is crucial for proper IL7-IL7R<sub>α</sub> binding, stabilized by a disulfide bridge on the N-terminus and loop 3 of WT-IL7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The structure of Neo-7 generated from AlphaFold lacked this kink, possibly due to the absence of the disulfide bridge. To address this, we hypothesized that regenerating the kink through mutations of core amino acids between helix 1 and 4 into cysteine might recapitulate the native kink conformations observed in WT-IL7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Introducing G4C and L96C mutations into Neo-7 validated this hypothesis, as the resulting disulfide-stapled Neo-7 model predicted by AlphaFold SS exhibited the reappeared kink on helix 1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Encouraged by this result, we proceeded to the next stage of <italic>in vitro</italic> evaluation via yeast display using the designed Neo-7.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to assess the importance of the kink for IL7Rα binding affinity in WT-IL7, we deleted the first 7 amino acids at the N-terminus of WT-IL7 and investigated its binding to murine IL7Rα in the yeast display system. Interestingly, the results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) demonstrated that N-terminal truncation fully diminished the binding of IL-7 to IL7Rα. Conversely, for the Neo-7 design, both the disulfide stapling, and Rosetta-favored mutations were found essential for binding to IL7Rα. This indicates that both the helix kink from the disulfide design and core stability conferred by the transferred mutations are required for the generation of a stable and functional Neo-7. Importantly, the enhanced binding affinity towards IL7Rα also led to improved binding towards the common IL2Rγ, relative to other variants in the Neo-7 series.</p>

<title>Transfer of beneficial mutations on the cytokine-receptor binding interface further enhanced the binding of Neo-7 to IL7-Receptor <bold><sub>α</sub></bold></title>
<p>Encouraged by the successful expression of a functional Neo-7 (Neo-7 Loop design 2 with R5K-T44I-I45T mutations, herein referred as Neo-7) design in the yeast display platform, we modeled the structure of Neo-7 in the presence of murine IL7R<sub>α</sub> and IL2R<sub>γ</sub>. After careful examination of all the mutation points (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), we hypothesized that two mutations points might further improve the binding affinity of Neo-7 towards IL7R<sub>α</sub> due to the following reasons: (1) Both residues were located closely to a hydrophobic patch of IL7R<sub>α</sub> and replacing the polar glutamine and threonine into a more hydrophobic proline or isoleucine are favorable for binding through hydrophobic interactions (2) Proline was disfavored by Rosetta probably due to its specific characteristics as a helix breaker (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, after careful inspection of the structure, we observed that proline was located at the starting point of helix 1 that were further stabilized by disulfide stapling and therefore void the concerns on the helix breaking properties of proline under this design. (3) At position 45, threonine is favored by Rosetta in comparison to the wild type isoleucine residue. Such decision might arise from the additional consideration of the stability of Neo-7 monomer in aqueous solution as an exposed hydrophobic residue in the aqueous environment is energetically unfavorable. However, after comparing the binding conformations of threonine and isoleucine with IL7Rα, we decided that isoleucine was observed to have better shap complementarity that could occupy the hydrophobic pocket at the Neo-7-IL7Rα interface. Subsequently, we constructed the relevant mutants for Neo-7, sampling the effects of mutations located at the Neo-7-IL7Rα interface towards their binding to IL7Rα. Interestingly, the Q6P mutations showed the most prominent enhancements in the yeast display system while T45I mutation showed moderate improvement for IL7Rα. Double mutations of Q6P and T45I further improved the binding affinities of Neo-7 to both IL7Rα and IL2Rγ, suggesting an additive effects of the binding improvement (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Two best variants, Neo-7 with Q6P mutation and Neo-7 with dual mutations (Q6P + T45I) were selected for subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> bioactivity assay.</p>

<title>Recombinant Neo-7 shows higher expression and thermostability than WT IL7</title>
<p>After validating Neo-7’s ability to bind both IL-7R<sub>α</sub> and IL-2R<sub>γ</sub> receptors, we aimed to express recombinant Neo-7 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Wild-type cytokines from the IL-2 family (IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, and IL-21) are often challenging targets for <italic>E. coli</italic> expression due to their complex folding requirements, which necessitate multiple disulfide bonds to stabilize their structures. For instance, WT-IL-7 contains three disulfide bridges, and its soluble expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> yields no detectable properly folded IL-7, as analyzed by FPLC after pre-purification using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref>). In contrast, Neo-7 was engineered with only one disulfide bridge and designed for more efficient folding and packing compared to WT-IL-7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-D</xref>). Indeed, Neo-7 demonstrated superior performance in terms of yield and purity. The Q6P variant of Neo-7 exhibited the highest purity (78.51%) and yield (1.56 mg/200 mL culture), while the double mutation variant (Q6P + T45I) showed lower purity (58.24%) and yield (0.36 mg/200 mL). In comparison, WT-IL-7 was expressed as inclusion bodies, solubilized using 6M guanidine HCl, and refolded via dialysis, resulting in a final yield of 0.23 mg/200 mL culture with a purity of 34.66% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). We also assessed the thermostability of the purified recombinant proteins using the SYPRO assay. As expected, both Neo-7 variants exhibited improved thermostability (71.12°C and 70.39°C for the single and double mutation variants, respectively) compared to WT-IL-7 (56.35°C; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Recombinant Neo-7 shows enhanced binding affinity to murine IL-7 receptor alpha than WT IL7</title>
<p>We then characterized the binding affinities of Neo-7 variants to mouse IL-7 receptor alpha (mIL-7R<sub>α</sub>) in a quantitative manner using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The dual mutant variant of Neo-7 exhibited the most potent binding to mIL-7R<sub>α</sub>, with a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.12 nM, followed by the Q6P variant (KD = 5.22 nM) and WT-IL-7 (KD = 13.4 nM; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-G</xref>). Interestingly, through the SPR curve, we observed different binding kinetics between WT-IL-7 and the Neo-7 variants. WT-IL-7 binds to IL-7R<sub>α</sub> through a fast-on-fast-off kinetic model. In contrast, Neo-7 variants displayed a slower on and off rate, with an approximately five times lower on-rates (ka) compared to WT-IL-7 (1.03 x 10<sup>6</sup> and 1.38 x 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> for Neo-7-Q6P and Neo-7-Q6PT45I, respectively, versus 5.86 x 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> for WT-IL-7). However, Neo-7 variants also demonstrated significantly slower off-rates (kd) (6.313 x 10<sup>-3</sup> and 4.296 x 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for Neo-7-Q6P and Neo-7-Q6PT45I, respectively, compared to 7.844 x 10<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for WT-IL-7). The details of the on and off-rates of the binding kinetics are shown in Supplementary Table 1. This slower dissociation rate compensates for the slower association rate, resulting in more potent overall binding affinities. To assess the biological functions of Neo-7 variants, we then used the IL-7-dependent cell line 2E8 for a cell-based proliferation assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). The ability of the Neo-7 variants in stimulating 2E8 proliferation is correlated with their binding kinetics determined by the SPR assay. At high concentrations (10 ng/mL), the differences in proliferative abilities were insignificant, likely due to saturation of the cytokine. However, at lower concentrations (1 ng/mL), the differences became more pronounced, with Neo-7 variants demonstrating stronger pro-survival signals compared to WT-IL-7. Encouraged by the promising binding affinity data from SPR and 2E8 bioassay, we then submitted the sequence of WT-IL7 and Neo-7s into Immunomedicine group server for protein immunogenicity prediction. The predicted output showed that WT-IL7 is the most immunogenic with 6 potential antigenic fragments while the designed Neo-7s had 3 segments which all overlapping with the WT-IL7 antigenic fragments, indicating no additional immunogenic peptide fragments were introduced throughout the engineering processes of Neo-7 (Figure 5-supplementary figure 1(A-D)).</p>

<p>Subsequently, we designed a Fc-fused neo-7/WT-IL7 for <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-tumor assay and express the recombinant protein in a CHO-cell based system. Immunomodulatory cytokines are attractive anti-tumor agents due to their immuno-stimulating potential, but the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacies are largely limited by their poor pharmacokinetic properties that resulted in rapid clearance from the circulatory system. We therefore fused WT-IL7 and the selected neo-7 variants with the Fc-fragments of human IgG1 as a half-life prolonging strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>].

A structural illustration generated by alphafold simulation is shown in Figure 5-supplement figure 1(E). During recombinant protein expression, Fc-fused WT-IL7 exhibited a poorer purity profile (31.84%) compared to the Neo-7 Q6P variant (80.88%) and the double mutation variant (55.15%), indicating that the superior production yield and purity of Neo-7 extend beyond prokaryotic systems to mammalian CHO-S cell lines (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-C</xref>). Following FPLC purification, we assessed the bioactivities of the Fc control, Fc-fused IL-7, and Neo-7 variants using a murine spleenocyte proliferation assay, with flow cytometry evaluating viability and cell count at Day 3 and Day 7 post-treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-E</xref>). All treatments maintained spleenocyte viability and numbers relative to the Fc control, with a slight but not statistically significant increase in CD45+ cells in the Fc-Neo-7-Q6PT45I group.

<title>Fc-fused Neo-7s shows stronger anti-tumor activity in comparison to the WT counterpart</title>
<p>Given the superior immune stimulatory effects of Fc-fused Neo-7s compared to Fc-WT-IL7, we hypothesized that these effects could translate into enhanced anti-tumor activity. To test this, we treated mice bearing subcutaneous MC38 tumors (a syngeneic model for colorectal cancer) with a single dose of 10 mg/kg Fc-fused IL-7 or Neo-7s and monitored tumor growth. All Fc-fused IL-7 treatments showed significant tumor suppression compared to the Fc control (human IgG-1 Fc with LALAPG mutation), with Fc-fused Neo-7 (Q6PT45I) being the most potent, followed by Fc-fused Neo-7 (Q6P) and Fc-fused WT-IL-7 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, Figure 7-figure supplement 2).</p>

<p>To explore the possible anti-tumor mechanisms, we conducted a replicate anti-tumor assay and analyzed leukocyte counts and populations in the peripheral blood and tumor of treated mice. We found that the count and proportion of total immune cells and CD3+ CD8+ T-cells within the tumor correlated directly with the anti-tumor potency of the treatment groups (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). In the peripheral blood of tumor-harboring mice, all Fc-cytokine fusions increased the total immune cell count compared to the Fc control, in the order of Fc-Neo-7-Q6P-T45I, Fc-Neo-7-Q6P, and Fc-WT-IL-7 (Figure 7-figure supplement 1). This trend was also observed for CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, CD19+ B-cells, CD11c+ dendritic cells, and F4/80+ macrophages. Among the immune cells analyzed, CD8+ T-cells showed the most significant increase, indicating they might be the primary targets for the immune stimulatory effects of IL-7/Neo-7s (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). No significant differences were observed in the count of Ly6C+ Ly6g-CD11b+ monocytes in the peripheral blood (Figure 7-figure supplement 1(A)). However, differences were observed between the single (Q6P) and double (Q6P-T45I) mutation variants of Fc-fused Neo-7 in the numbers of CD4+ FoxP3+ Treg and CD3-NK1.1+ NK cells within the peripheral blood. The Q6P variant showed the highest number of Tregs and NK cells among all treatment groups, followed by WT-IL7 and the Q6P-T45I variant. Additionally, only mice treated with Fc-WT-IL7 had significantly higher numbers of Ly6g+ CD11b+ neutrophils compared to other treatments (Figure 7-figure supplement 1(A)). These differences in immune cell regulation might be attributed to variations in binding affinity or kinetics of WT-IL-7 and Neo-7s towards IL-7 receptors on immune cells. Further studies are required to unravel the specific mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.</p>
<p>In the analysis of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, we found that only CD8+ T cells were significantly enriched in the tumor compared to the Fc control (except for CD19+ B-cells in the Fc-Neo-7-Q6P group), despite a substantial increase of other immune cell types (CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and NK cells) in the peripheral blood (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B-C</xref>). This indicates that CD8+ T cells are the primary immune effectors that infiltrate and contribute to the anti-tumor properties of the Fc-Neo-7 fusions. The CD8+ TILs were also differed in their effector status, where the perforin positive CD8+ populations were the highest in the Fc-Neo-7-Q6PT45I group, followed by Fc-Neo-7-Q6P, Fc-WT-IL7 and Fc control. Furthermore, only the Fc-Neo-7 fusions showed a significant reduction of the proportion of the monocytes and neutrophils within the tumor compared to the Fc control, a phenomenon not observed in mice treated with Fc-WT-IL7. The reduction of intra-tumoral monocytes and neutrophils-to-CD8 T cell ratio is a favorable outcome for immunotherapy, as both of these immune cell types have been reported to act as immunosuppressors, inhibiting the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Since IL-7 is also known to promote the generation and maintenance of memory T cells, we also investigated the naive and memory populations of T cells using CD44 and CD62L markers (Figure 7-figure supplement 1(B-C)). Most of the CD4+ T cells circulating in the peripheral blood of the Fc control group were naive T cells (CD62L+ CD44-). However, treatment with Fc-IL-7/Neo-7s increased the number of effector memory (EM) populations (CD62L-CD44+). For CD8+ T cells, treatment with the Fc-cytokine fusion greatly enriched the CD8+ T cell population with a central memory (CM) phenotype (CD62L+ CD44+), followed by naive and effector memory T cells. In the MC38 tumor, most infiltrating T cells were identified as effector memory T cells. The majority of CD4+ tumor-infiltrating T cells exhibited an EM phenotype, with one exception showing a higher number of naive CD4+ T cells in mice treated with Fc-WT-IL7. For tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, nearly all were positive for the memory marker CD44, with the main populations being EM CD8+ T cells (CD62L-CD44+), followed by CM CD8+ T cells (CD62L+ CD44+).</p>

CD8+ T cells were chosen due to their significant responsiveness to the treatments and their abundance in the spleen, ensuring sufficient RNA for sequencing.

<p>Further examination of the gene expression heatmap (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>) showed strong differentiation in the gene expression profile among the two Fc-Neo-7 variants with Fc-WT-IL7. Gene clusters associated with T cell proliferation, fitness, and functionality revealed that Fc-Neo-7 treatment upregulated cell cycle-related genes (Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6, Mki67) and pro-survival signals (Bcl-2, Brca1, survivin/BirC5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. In addition, a general increase in the expression of genes related to T-cell metabolism were also observed, including those regulating oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid oxidation, amino acid (glycine, serine threonine pathway) and nucleotide metabolism, indicating an active proliferation and metabolism stage of the CD8 T-cells post-FC-Neo-7 treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. The serine to glycine one-carbon metabolism pathway was essential to support T cell proliferation by fueling purine biosynthesis and improving mitochondrial respiration efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Fc-Neo-7 also primed T cells for enhanced functionality, as evidenced by the upregulation of genes responsible for cytotoxicity (granzymes A, B, and C) and surface receptors for IL-2 (IL2Ra, IL2Rb) and IL-12 (IL12rb), which prepared T cell differentiation into effector types. Notably, while IL-2-induced T cell proliferation often leads to exhaustion and activation-induced cell death (ACID), Fc-Neo-7 treatment resulted in reduced expression of inhibitory molecules (Tgfbr2, Lag3, CD83, PD-1) except TIGIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. This suggests a potential combination therapy of Fc-Neo-7 with anti-TIGIT to further enhance CD8+ T cell effector activity by blocking the immunosuppressive TIGIT pathway. In terms of exhaustion markers, Fc-Neo-7-treated CD8+ T cells exhibited marked reductions in the expression of genes such as Tim-3 (Havcr2), Tox, and CTLA4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. These findings were also confirmed by GSEA analysis, which showed significant enrichment of gene sets related to cell cycle and DNA replication (T cell proliferation), oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid metabolism (naïve T cell metabolism). In addition, a lower expression of the genes related to the PD1-PDL1 inhibitory axis was also observed (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cytokines are potent immunomodulatory proteins that serve as attractive therapeutic agents in numerous disease applications. However, clinically their application is limited due to the need to balance the clinical potency to toxicity and poor pharmacokinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. In this study we addressed these issues through (1) proper selection of a relatively safe cytokine, IL-7 and (2) redesign the scaffold of IL-7 via computational protein design to improve the stability and developability of the final molecule, Neo-7. Throughout the design process, we observed that the original structure of scaffold of WT IL-7 is complex and very inefficient, involving long inter-helices loops that required additional disulfide stapling to ensure proper folding. Since only the helices of IL-7 are required for receptor binding, we chose to truncate all the interconnecting loops and remodel the helices connectivity via Rosetta loop remodeling program. The difference between the design of IL2/15 mimics (Neo 2/15) and this study lies on the design approaches, Neo2/15 was a completely <italic>de novo</italic> designed protein which requires to redesign the mimetics from scratch while the Neo-7 designed in this study still retains the sequence on the functional-related moiety (receptor binding helices) and thus minimizing the design steps and computational power required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. However, it should be noted that our study has a somewhat different objective in that the Neo2/15 is a product from the breakthrough invention of the <italic>de novo</italic> protein design algorithm from the Baker lab while the aim of this study is to search for a viable design idea that utilize the availability of computational protein design (CPD) toolkits such as alphafold and Rosetta protein design suite for the redesign of a therapeutic-relevant cytokine.</p>
<p>In our approach, we avoided the need for extensive rounds of directed evolution and affinity maturation process. During the design process, we utilize Alphafold2 to serve as a validation point for our designed sequence. We observed that single sequence mode of Alphafold2 provided a better discriminative power on the designed sequence as the default mode of Alphafold2 (with reference to the MSA library) provide higher false positive results (bad sequence generating very similar structure to the WT-IL7 helices), possibly due to the highly similar sequences between the WT-IL7 and Neo-7. In addition, we also discovered the presence of a kink on helix 1 is crucial for the interaction between the IL-7Rα and IL-7/Neo-7, the re-addition of the kink in helix1 via disulfide stapling and mutation transfer guided by structural visual inspection generated two Neo-7 variants that are more potent in IL-7R binding affinity in comparison to the WT-IL7. Encouragingly, both the Neo-7 variants are also more thermostable compared to the WT-IL-7 and showed a much higher yield and purity when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (as single entity) and in CHO cells (as Fc-Fusion) indicating that the simpler protein scaffold of Neo-7s are much better handled by the cellular machineries during overexpression. Interestingly, the redesigned scaffold of Neo-7s lead to a different binding kinetics towards, IL-7Rα in comparison to the WT-IL7. The Neo-7s adopted a slow-on-slow-off model, which we ascribed to the more stable fold as a more flexible (less stable) fold in the WT-IL7 could probably increase the chances to bind to the IL7Rα via an induced-fit mechanism but the overall flexibilities of the protein will also lead to stronger destabilization of the protein-receptor complex and therefore lead to a faster off-rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. In contrast, a more stable fold adopted by the Neo-7s would require longer time for the protein-receptor association but also a slower dissociation rate once the complex have been formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].</p>
<p>Moreover, the comparison of the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacies of the Fc-Neo-7s and Fc-IL-7 also highlighted the importance of <italic>in vivo</italic> stabilities during animal studies. <italic>In vitro</italic> murine spleenocytes proliferation assays showed no significant differences between the samples treated with Fc-Neo-7s and Fc-IL-7 but the <italic>in vivo</italic> PBMC analysis showed a significant increase in the count of CD8+ T-cells (peaked at day 7), possibly due to the better stability of Fc-Neo-7s in the mice circulatory system. Encouragingly, the <italic>in vivo</italic> immune stimulation activities of the Fc-IL-7/Neo-7s also translated into anti-tumor activities where the efficacy of tumor growth delay was correlated with the binding affinities to IL-7Rα determined in the yeast display and SPR assays. Further analysis of the TILs also revealed a significantly higher infiltrations of the CD8+ T-cells in the tumor and the higher proportion of Perforin + CD8+ T-cells also suggest that the T-cells induced by Fc-Neo-7s treatment are functional in terms of cancer cells cytotoxicity. Moreover, gene expression profile of the murine CD3+ CD8+ spleenocytes also revealed that Fc-Neo-7 (Q6PT45I) significantly upregulates genes related to CD8+ T-cells proliferation and metabolism without affecting their fitness and functionality, suggesting that Neo-7 (Q6PT45I) as a suitable addition to the current therapeutic space for cancer treatment. To further assess the role of Fc-Neo-7 (Q6PT45I) as an additional arm in anti-cancer therapy, we combined one dose of the Fc-Neo-7 (Q6PT45I) with oxaliplatin, a first-line immunogenic chemotherapy for colon cancer. Indeed, the combination therapy showed a significantly stronger tumor suppressing result in comparison to the untreated control and the monotherapy arms (Figure 7-figure supplement 3).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have successfully redesigned IL-7 with a novel folding scaffold termed Neo-7 in this study. Through Rosetta fix backbone modeling and visual inspection, we further identified that the disulfide-induced kink on helix 1 is essential for the binding towards IL-7Rα and point mutations R5K, Q6P and T44I could enhance the binding of Neo-7 towards IL-7Rα. The point mutation I54T, improved the stability, yield and purity of Neo-7 but with a slight penalty on the binding strength with the IL7Rα. The designed Neo-7s were also proven to be more potent, stable and easier to be expressed in both the <italic>E. coli</italic> and CHO systems, highlighting the importance of inherent protein stability in recombinant protein expression. Since the four helical bundle is a common type of protein fold in the interleukin family (i.e. IL-6, IL-9, IL-21, GMCSF and etc.) the concept of the current designs could be further applied into the designs of other types of neo-interleukins to deepen the involvement of computational protein design in the protein therapeutics area and broaden the horizon of interleukin-based therapies in the future.</p>

<p>Alphafold 2 was used for the validation of our protein designs. For monomer prediction, Alphafold were ran using google collab with the following settings. First, a non-template and single sequence mode was applied to predict the structure of Neo-7. We hypothesized that since the sequence of Neo-7 is highly similar to the wild type IL-7, the information from PDB structural template and multiple sequence alignment (MSA) might highly favors the generation of the predicted structures that are highly similar to the wild type structure and thus lead to a reduced ability to discriminate the bad structures from the good.

<title>Expression and purification of recombinant Neo-7 in <italic>E. coli</italic> (BL21)</title>
<p>The desired neo-7 gene designs were PCR amplified to generate amplicons with at least 20 bp overlapping with the linearized bacteria expression vector. The incorporated transgenes were flanked by a ST-II signal tag and a hexa-histidine tag at their 5’ and 3’ end to target the recombinant protein into the periplasmic region for proper disulfide formation and to aid purification respectively. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 competent cells and grew in LB-kanamycin (50 ug/mL) medium for selection of transformant. On the day of protein expression, overnight culture of the bacteria were diluted (1:200) in fresh 2X-YT medium supplemented with 25 ug/mL kanamycin and grown into log phase (OD600 = 0.4-0.6) at 37 °C. The cultures were then transferred into a chilled incubator (18 °C) and incubated for an additional 48 h for protein expression (no IPTG is required for expression). After incubation, the cultures were pelleted at 8000 xg for 20 min, supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were stored in −80 °C for overnight. The recombinant protein was purified using nickel NTA affinity chromatography. The frozen pellets were thawed on ice for an hour followed by cell lysis using B-PER<sup>TM</sup> Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent according to manufacturer protocol. The supernatant was collected and incubate with the Ni-NTA resins (125 uL of resin for 100 mL of bacteria culture) at 4 °C for an hour. The Ni-NTA column was washed with wash buffer until no A280 signal was observed from the eluate, The recombinant proteins were then eluted with 5 mL of elution buffer. The eluate was then spun in Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter (3 kDa) to exchange the elution buffer with 1X PBS (pH 7.4) and to concentrate the protein into a suitable volume size (600 uL) for FPLC purification using Superdex® 200 Increase 10/300 GL size exclusion chromatography column.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes the use of computational tools to design a mimetic of the interleukin-7 (IL-7) cytokine with superior stability and receptor binding activity compared to the naturally occurring molecule. The authors focused their engineering efforts on the loop regions to preserve receptor interfaces while remediating structural irregularities that destabilize the protein. They demonstrated the enhanced thermostability, production yield, and bioactivity of the resulting molecule through biophysical and functional studies. Overall, the manuscript is well written, novel, and of high interest to the fields of molecular engineering, immunology, biophysics, and protein therapeutic design. The experimental methodologies used are convincing; however, the article would benefit from more quantitative comparisons of bioactivity through titrations.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>All comments have been sufficiently addressed, with the exception of comment 24 from Reviewer 1. The authors need to modify the manuscript abstract, introduction, and/or discussion to clarify which limitations of IL-7 were addressed by their molecule and to note the limitations of their approach in terms of mitigating toxicity or enhancing half-life.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes the use of computational tools to design a mimetic of the interleukin-7 (IL-7) cytokine with superior stability and receptor binding activity compared to the naturally occurring molecule. The authors focused their engineering efforts on the loop regions to preserve receptor interfaces while remediating structural irregularities that destabilize the protein. They demonstrated the enhanced thermostability, production yield, and bioactivity of the resulting molecule through biophysical and functional studies. Overall, the manuscript is well written, novel, and of high interest to the fields of molecular engineering, immunology, biophysics, and protein therapeutic design. The experimental methodologies used are convincing; however, the article would benefit from more quantitative comparisons of bioactivity through titrations.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents the computational design and experimental validation of Neo-7, an engineered variant of interleukin-7 (IL-7) with improved folding efficiency, expression yield, and therapeutic activity. The authors employed a rational protein design approach using Rosetta loop remodeling to reconnect IL-7's functional helices through shorter, more efficient loops, resulting in a protein with superior stability and binding affinity compared to wild-type IL-7. The work demonstrates promising translational potential for cancer immunotherapy applications.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The integration of Rosetta loop remodeling with AlphaFold validation represents an established computational pipeline for rational protein design. The iterative refinement process, using both single-sequence and multimer AlphaFold predictions, is methodologically sound.</p>
<p>(2) The authors provide thorough characterization across multiple platforms (yeast display, bacterial expression, mammalian cell expression) and assays (binding kinetics, thermostability, bioactivity), strengthening the robustness of their findings.</p>
<p>(3) The identification of the critical helix 1 kink stabilized by disulfide bonding and its recreation through G4C/L96C mutations demonstrates deep structural understanding and successful problem-solving.</p>
<p>(4) The MC38 tumor model results show clear therapeutic advantages of Neo-7 variants, with compelling immune profiling data supporting CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor mechanisms.</p>
<p>(5) The transcriptomic profiling provides valuable mechanistic insights into T cell activation states and suggests reduced exhaustion markers, which are clinically relevant.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While computational predictions are extensive, the manuscript lacks experimental structural validation of the designed Neo-7 variants. The term &quot;Structural Validation&quot; should not be used in the header.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive comment. To better reflect the work conducted, we have revised the section title from “Structural Validation of Neo-7 in AlphaFold single sequence mode” to “Structural Modeling of Neo-7 in AlphaFold single sequence mode.” This change clarifies that our study employed in silico modeling approaches rather than experimental structural validation.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We speculate that the slower off-rate observed for Neo-7 variants is primarily attributable to their enhanced structural stability, which promotes the formation of a more stable cytokine–receptor complex. This is consistent with prior observations in other engineered cytokines, such as IL-2 mimetics (Neo-2/15).</p>
<p>In terms of biological consequences, we believe the slower off-rate is unlikely to result in signaling bias or qualitatively distinct pathways for several reasons:</p>
<p>IL-7’s mechanism of action is inherently regulated to prevent over-signaling. T cells downregulate IL7R-α expression upon IL-7 stimulation, ensuring a built-in negative feedback mechanism.</p>
<p>IL-7 signaling is dominated by STAT5 activation, without the signaling plasticity observed in cytokines like IL-21 or IL-22, which can bias toward STAT1/3 and drive divergent functional outcomes.</p>
<p>Our RNA-seq data support this interpretation, as Neo-7–treated CD8⁺ T cells exhibited transcriptional profiles highly similar to those induced by WT-IL-7, with the difference being an enhanced magnitude of response rather than novel pathway engagement.</p>
<p>Taken together, we infer that the slower off-rate of Neo-7 enhances the potency and durability of IL-7 signaling without altering its downstream specificity, thereby strengthening the magnitude of immune responses while maintaining the canonical STAT5-driven biology of IL-7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) While computational immunogenicity prediction is provided, these methods are very limited.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with the reviewer that current in silico immunogenicity prediction tools are limited and cannot be considered definitive. Indeed, to date, none of these algorithms has demonstrated a strong correlation with clinical immunogenicity outcomes of biologics. For example, the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in murine or non-human primate models often does not translate into ADA induction in human clinical trials. This disconnect underscores the inherent challenges of predicting immunogenicity based solely on computational or preclinical models.</p>
<p>Our strategy to mitigate potential immunogenicity was therefore not to rely exclusively on prediction software, but instead to apply a conservative design principle: preserving the vast majority of the parental IL-7 sequence while introducing only the minimal number of amino acid substitutions required to achieve our engineering objectives. By maintaining sequence continuity with the native cytokine, we aim to minimize the risk of introducing novel epitopes while improving stability and developability. We acknowledge that definitive immunogenicity assessment can only be addressed in future clinical studies.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Specific Points:</p>
<p>(1) The authors should describe the molecular composition of CYT-107.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have added clarification regarding the molecular composition of CYT-107. CYT-107 is a recombinant form of wild-type human interleukin-7 (IL-7) expressed in eukaryotic cells, which introduces N-linked glycosylation modifications to the protein. As a glycosylated recombinant IL-7, CYT-107 more closely mimics the natural human cytokine compared to bacterial expression systems that produce non-glycosylated IL-7. This feature contributes to its stability and bioavailability in clinical applications.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors should indicate the receptor layout for IL-7 in the introduction and indicate available structural data. Also, in line 93, the authors should indicate that IL-7Ra is one subunit of the heterodimeric receptor complex.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. However, due to page limitations, we have chosen to orient the introduction around the design rationale, computational workflow, and biological functionality of IL-7. To address the reviewer’s point while maintaining brevity, we have now included a concise description of the IL-7 receptor layout and its available structural data in the main text. Specifically, in line 93 we revised the sentence to read:“We began by examining the crystal structure of IL-7 bound to its receptor, IL7R-α (interleukin-7 receptor alpha; PDB ID: 3DI2), which recruits IL-2Rγ to form a heterodimeric receptor complex essential for downstream signaling.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The abbreviation IL-7Ra should be defined at first use.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The abbreviation has now been defined at its first appearance in the manuscript. Specifically, at Line 93 we revised the sentence as follows:</p>
<p>“We began by examining the crystal structure of IL-7 bound to its receptor, IL7R-α (interleukin-7 receptor alpha; PDB ID: 3DI2), which recruits IL-2Rγ to form a heterodimeric receptor complex essential for downstream signaling..”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors need to clarify whether the human or murine IL-7Ra is being used in each experiment mentioned in the results text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important point. We have now specified in the main text and corresponding subsection titles whether human or murine IL-7Rα was used in each experiment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors sometimes use a dash in IL7Ra and IL2Rg and sometimes do not. This should be standardized.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s observation. We have standardized the terminology throughout the manuscript to “IL7Rα” and “IL2Rγ” to maintain consistency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure 3E, the authors left out the v in &quot;Neo7-LDv1&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected the omission of “v” and updated the label to read Neo7-LDv1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Figure 3E, the authors must indicate in the bottom row that they are visualizing sequential binding to IL-2Rg following incubation with IL-7Ra. This should be stated in the results text and the figure caption as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the results text and figure caption to clearly state that the bottom row illustrates sequential binding to IL-2Rγ following incubation with IL-7Rα.</p>
<p>“for detection of IL-2Rγ binding, yeast cells were first incubated with recombinant IL-7Rα, washed, and subsequently incubated with IL-2Rγ”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In Figure 3E, &quot;IL-7Rg&quot; should be corrected to &quot;IL-2Rg&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected “IL-7Rγ” to “IL-2Rγ” in Figure 3E for accuracy and consistency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) In line 140, the authors claim that Neo7-LDv1 is partially folded based on the binding to the heterodimeric receptor complex. However, the data are insufficient to support this conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the concern of the reviewer and we decided to rephrase the sentence for better understanding: “A degree of binding to IL2Rγ was detected, possibly reflecting partial folding of the displayed protein in the yeast display platform.” While we do not claim the protein to be fully or uniformly folded, this deduction is supported by the yeast display data and further corroborated by AlphaFold structural predictions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) In lines 185-186, the authors claim that the binding affinity for IL-2Rg is improved, but this is not shown in Figure 3, which looks only at a single concentration and shows comparable binding between WT-IL7 and Neo7-LDv2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable observation. Our original wording was ambiguous and may have implied a direct comparison with WT-IL7, which was not intended. The sentence was meant to highlight that within the Neo-7 variant series, Neo7-LDv2 displayed stronger binding to both IL-7Rα and IL-2Rγ compared to other Neo-7 variants. To avoid misinterpretation, we have revised the text as follows:</p>
<p>“Importantly, the enhanced binding affinity towards IL7Rα also led to improved binding towards the common IL2Rγ., relative to other variants in the Neo-7 series.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Lines 202-203 appear to be an error.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The lines in question were indeed an error and have now been removed from the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) In yeast display validation, negative controls showing binding to the fluorescent antibody only and an irrelevant control protein should be shown for all constructs in order to evaluate nonspecific interactions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that appropriate negative controls are important to validate specificity. To address this, we will include yeast display data with negative controls—native yeast (EBY100) stained with the corresponding fluorescent antibody in the Supplementary Information. This addition will provide clearer validation of binding specificity and reduce concerns regarding nonspecific interactions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) For yeast display studies, titrations rather than single concentrations should be used to compare constructs (Figures 3 and 4). The claim that any of the constructs has a higher affinity than any other construct must be supported by performing titrations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We respectfully note that yeast display titrations provide relative rather than absolute estimates of binding affinity. In our study, constructs were compared under identical antigen concentrations, where the observed fluorescence intensity reflected their relative binding strength. These yeast display results served as an initial screening strategy, which we subsequently validated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR provided quantitative binding parameters and confirmed the binding differences observed in yeast display. Thus, while yeast titrations were not performed, the combination of side-by-side yeast display comparisons and orthogonal validation by SPR supports our affinity claims with both qualitative and quantitative evidence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(14) The acronym SPR needs to be defined, and the authors should mention that this technique was used for quantitative binding studies in line 259.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The acronym has now been defined in the main text at its first use, and we have clarified its role in the study. The revised text reads:</p>
<p>“We then characterized the binding affinities of Neo-7 variants to mouse IL-7 receptor alpha (mIL-7Rα) in a quantitative manner using surface plasmon resonance (SPR).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(15) A titration of 2E8 cell proliferation versus concentration should be presented for IL-7 versus Neo-7 variants to directly compare EC50 values and make claims regarding potency in Figure 5H. Also, the authors should clarify whether a proliferation or viability assay was performed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful comment regarding the use of EC₅₀ values when discussing potency. In response, we have revised the manuscript to avoid overinterpreting the data. Specifically, we replaced the term potency with ability to stimulate, as the 2E8 cell assay was designed to validate whether receptor binding by IL-7 and Neo-7 variants translates into biological function—namely, supporting immune cell viability and proliferation under limiting cytokine conditions. The assay was not optimized to determine formal EC₅₀ values, but rather to demonstrate functional activity consistent with IL-7 receptor engagement.</p>
<p>We have also clarified in the text that the experiment was a proliferation assay, with cell viability assessed as part of the readout. This revision better reflects the scope of the assay while aligning our claims with the data presented.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(16) Isotype control is not an appropriate name for the Fc-Only construct. This should be denoted as Fc Only.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have revised the terminology throughout the manuscript, changing isotype control to Fc control.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(17) A titration of mouse splenocyte proliferation versus concentration should be presented for IL-7 versus Neo-7 variants to directly compare EC50 values and make claims regarding potency in Figure 6.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion regarding EC₅₀ analysis. In this study, the splenocyte proliferation assay was designed as a preliminary in vitro screen to confirm the biological activity of Neo-7 variants relative to wild-type IL-7 prior to in vivo testing. The assay was not optimized for quantitative potency determination, but rather to provide an initial functional validation of the constructs. We have therefore revised the manuscript wording to avoid overinterpreting the data and refrained from making claims regarding EC₅₀-based potency. Instead, we emphasize that the in vivo tumor model provides a more physiologically relevant and rigorous platform for assessing cytokine functionality, including proliferation and immunomodulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(18) The legends in Figure 6 should indicate the colors used for each construct.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised the legend for Figure 6 to include the color codes corresponding to each construct.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(19) Metabolism should be singular in lines 433 and 435.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected the wording so that “metabolism” is consistently used in the singular form.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(20) In Figure 8D, &quot;cycling&quot; should be changed to &quot;cycle&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The word “cycling” has been corrected to “cycle” in Figure 8D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(21) The treatments need to be indicated in Figure 8D. Also, a color scale is needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer, and a color scale description has now been included in the Figure legend to aid interpretation. “The gene expression heatmap is derived from Z-scores calculated from the RNA sequencing data, with expression levels color-coded from high (red) to low (blue). ”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(22) More comparisons between RNASeq data for Fc-WTIL7 versus Fc-Neo7 (Figure 8) should be presented in the results section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Due to space limitations in the main manuscript, we are unable to include an expanded description of all RNA-Seq comparisons. However, we will provide a more detailed analysis of Fc-WT-IL7 versus Fc-Neo7 in the supplementary section, including expanded differential gene expression comparisons and pathway enrichment analyses. This will allow readers to fully appreciate the differences while maintaining focus in the main text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(23) The strikethrough in line 464 needs to be corrected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected the strikethrough error in line 464.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(24) It is unclear how stabilizing IL-7 improves its toxicity or half-life. The authors should indicate more clearly which limitations of IL-7 were addressed by their molecule in the abstract, introduction, and discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Native IL-7 demonstrates an excellent safety profile but faces two major challenges in clinical application: (1) short plasma half-life and (2) suboptimal developability due to poor stability. The short half-life is typically addressed through Fc-fusion strategies, which extend systemic exposure via FcRn recycling. However, wild-type IL-7 exhibits a strong aggregation tendency when fused to Fc, rendering the fusion protein poorly developable. By redesigning IL-7 into the more stable Neo-7 format, we substantially improved the folding efficiency and purity of the Fc-fusion protein after affinity purification, thereby enabling its advancement as a recombinant biologic candidate.</p>
<p>We do not intend to claim that increased stability directly reduces in vivo toxicity. The favorable safety profile of IL-7 arises primarily from its intrinsic biology (mechanism of action and downstream signaling), rather than from its structural stability. That said, improved stability and reduced aggregation propensity could potentially lower the immunogenicity risk of protein biologics. Nevertheless, there are currently no validated in vitro or in vivo assays that reliably correlate protein stability or aggregation with clinical immunogenicity outcomes.</p>

<p>Any experimental structural data would be good to have.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We plan to pursue X-ray crystallography of Neo-7 in future studies to obtain high-resolution structural confirmation. However, we emphasize that such experiments require significant time and resources, and the results would not alter the biological claims made in this study. Our focus here is to demonstrate that with recent advances in in silico protein structure prediction algorithms, such as AlphaFold2, it is now feasible to redesign therapeutic proteins with sufficient accuracy to achieve improved developability and biological performance. This study highlights how computational approaches can streamline protein drug engineering, reducing reliance on labor-intensive structural studies during the early stages of therapeutic development.</p>

<p>Please add details of how the changed kinetics might affect downstream pathways.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to elaborate on the biological implications of the altered binding kinetics.</p>
<p>Our data show that Neo-7 variants display a slower off-rate relative to WT-IL-7, which likely reflects enhanced stabilization of the cytokine–receptor complex. In principle, this could prolong receptor occupancy and modestly extend downstream signaling duration. However, several biological features of IL-7 constrain the risk of excessive or aberrant signaling:</p>
<p>Receptor Regulation: IL-7 signaling induces rapid downregulation of IL7Rα on T cells, serving as a feedback mechanism to prevent sustained or uncontrolled activation. This &quot;hardwired&quot; receptor regulation reduces the likelihood that a slower off-rate translates into pathological over-signaling.</p>
<p>Pathway Specificity: IL-7 primarily signals through the JAK/STAT5 axis, with little evidence of signaling bias. Unlike other cytokines (e.g., IL-21, IL-22) that can activate STAT1 or STAT3 and drive distinct functional outcomes, IL-7’s pathway specificity minimizes concerns about altered signaling directionality.</p>
<p>Transcriptional Evidence: Our RNA-seq analysis further supports this, showing that Neo-7 and WT-IL-7 activate similar transcriptional programs. The differences we observed were in the magnitude of response, not in the qualitative nature of the pathways engaged. This suggests that Neo-7 variants enhance the intensity of canonical IL-7 signaling rather than redirecting it toward alternative or unintended pathways.</p>
<p>Together, these findings support the interpretation that the slower off-rate of Neo-7 variants likely contributes to stronger or more sustained activation of IL-7’s canonical STAT5 pathway, while intrinsic regulatory mechanisms and pathway fidelity safeguard against inappropriate signaling outcomes.</p>

<p>Minor:</p>
<p>(1) The Figure 3 text is hard to read.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s concern regarding the readability of Figure 3. In the revised manuscript, we will provide a higher-resolution version of the figure to ensure that all labels and text are clearly visible upon magnification.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The manuscript switches between &quot;Neo-7&quot; and &quot;Neo7&quot; .</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s observation. To maintain consistency throughout the manuscript, all references have been standardized to Neo-7.</p>
