<title>Abstract</title><p>mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were rapidly developed and effective during the pandemic. However, some limitations remain to be resolved, such as the short-lived induced immune response and certain adverse effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new vaccines that address these issues. While live-attenuated vaccines are a highly effective modality, they pose a risk of adverse effects, including virulence reversion. In the current study, we constructed a live-attenuated vaccine candidate, BK2102, combining naturally occurring virulence-attenuating mutations in the <italic>NSP14</italic>, <italic>NSP1</italic>, spike and <italic>ORF7-8</italic> coding regions. Intranasal inoculation with BK2102 induced humoral and cellular immune responses in Syrian hamsters without apparent tissue damage in the lungs, leading to protection against a SARS-CoV-2 D614G and an Omicron BA.5 strains. The neutralizing antibodies induced by BK2102 persisted for up to 364 days, which indicated that they confer long-term protection against infection. Furthermore, we confirmed the safety of BK2102 using transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human ACE2 (hACE2), that are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. BK2102 did not kill the Tg mice, even when virus was administered at a dose of 10<sup>6</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU), while 10<sup>2</sup> PFU of the D614G strain or an attenuated strain lacking the furin cleavage site (FCS) of the spike was sufficient to kill mice. These results suggest that BK2102 is a promising live-vaccine candidate strain that confers long-term protection without significant virulence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>mRNA- and adenovirus vector-based vaccines have been successfully developed and used in clinical practice against SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that caused the COVID-19 pandemic. These vaccines were highly effective, inducing robust humoral and cellular immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Polack et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, certain drawbacks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines remain to be addressed, including adverse effects, such as thrombosis, fever, and fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yasmin et al., 2023</xref>). Further, several boosters of the mRNA vaccines have been required to reactivate the immune response and increase efficacy against variants. New and improved vaccine modalities are therefore required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p>Live-attenuated vaccines are among the most effective vaccine modalities, as they induce humoral and cellular immunity, both systemically and locally (e.g., within mucosal surfaces), conferring protection against various infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hoft et al., 2017</xref>). For example, the live-attenuated poliovirus vaccine developed in 1962 was highly effective in reducing the spread of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sabin, 1985</xref>). Nevertheless, this modality has certain disadvantages, the most concerning being the risk of reversion to a virulent state as a result of mutations generated during viral replication <italic>in vivo</italic>. In fact, vaccine-derived paralytic polio was reported 38 years after the vaccine had been introduced, representing a threat to uninfected populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Macklin et al., 2020</xref>). Advances in our basic knowledge of viruses have enabled the design of attenuated strains, such as that in the new type 2 oral polio vaccine (nOPV2), which is associated with a reduced risk of reversion due to genome modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yeh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yeh et al., 2023</xref>). nOPV2 was recently approved by the World Health Organization, indicating that live-attenuated vaccines that overcome the risk of reversion are still in demand.</p>
<p>Various mechanisms leading to reduced pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported. A cold-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain was isolated through passaging at low temperatures, eventually showing an attenuated phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Seo and Jang, 2020</xref>). We also reported a temperature sensitive (TS) strain with low pathogenicity and sufficient immunogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic>, achieved through the introduction of multiple TS-related mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yoshida et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to temperature sensitivity, several naturally occurring mutants exhibit attenuated phenotypes. Passaging SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells facilitates isolation of strains with deletions in the FCS (PRRAR) at the S1/S2 junction within the spike protein, resulting in low proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic> ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Peacock et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, a mutant that lacks four amino acids (PRRA) within the FCS did not induce weight loss in hamsters during challenge experiments(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hoffmann et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hoffmann et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lau et al., 2020</xref>). Reportedly, S1/S2 cleavage is essential for TMPRSS2-mediated entry into host cells, and the deletion in the FCS is thought to reduce viral growth in lung cells, which express more TMPRSS2 than cells of the upper respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Johnson <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lau <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, partial loss of <italic>NSP1</italic>, which correlates with a lower viral load and less severe symptoms of infection in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, or of <italic>ORF8</italic>, which has been reported as associated with milder infection in humans, were also associated with attenuated phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Young et al., 2020</xref>). Recovery of lost segments of viral genomes carrying deletions is more difficult than the reversion of amino acid substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bull, 2015</xref>). In this study, we designed and constructed live-attenuated vaccine candidates through a combination of substitutions and deletions involved in attenuation and reduced risk of virulent reversion. We then evaluated candidate immunogenicity and safety in animal models providing evidence that BK2102 is a promising vaccine candidate that confers prolonged protection.</p>

<title>Construction of the live-attenuated vaccine candidate strains</title>
<p>Several genomic alterations are involved in the attenuation of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we focused on deletions at three different sites within the viral genome: FCS within the spike protein, NSP1, and ORF7-8 (Supplementary Fig. 1A). While loss of the FCS inhibits virus-cell fusion mediated by TMPRSS2 in lung cells, partial deletion of NSP1 has been shown to impair viral proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the lack of ORF8 has been associated with milder symptoms and disease outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Young et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zinzula, 2021</xref>). We previously obtained SARS-CoV-2 TS strains showing diverse attenuated phenotypes, and revealed that NSP3 L445F, NSP14 G248V, G416S, and A504V as well as NSP16 V67I were substitutions responsible for such phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yoshida et al., 2022</xref>). Each substitution conferred some advantage for the development of an attenuated vaccine candidate with restricted proliferative capacity in deep regions of the body, such as lungs and brain. In addition, the presence of deletions is generally considered to confer a lower risk of reversion to a wild-type genotype when compared to amino acid substitutions. To this end, we designed three candidates by combining several of the above-described mutations to design a safe live-attenuated vaccine strain (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The three candidates were inoculated locally into hamsters via the nasal route to mimic a natural infection. The immunogenicity of candidates 1 and 3 was much greater than that of candidate 2 (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Candidate 2 has TS-related substitutions in both NSP3 and NSP14 as well as three deletions in the viral genome. Thus, we hypothesized that this candidate would be excessively attenuated. Candidate 1, which had three deletions and three TS-responsible substitutions in NSP14, induced neutralizing antibodies when inoculated at a dose of 10<sup>3</sup> PFU. Candidate 3 was observed to induce neutralizing antibodies at a dose of only 10<sup>2</sup> PFU, but the attenuated phenotypes of this candidate were conferred by only two deletions. Therefore, we speculated that there might be a higher risk of virulent reversion. Taking these observations into consideration, we selected Candidate 1 for the vaccine, hereafter referred to as BK2102. The growth dynamics of BK2102 were evaluated at 32 °C and 37 °C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). It proliferated similarly to the wild-type B-1 strain at 32 °C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), but the infectious virus titer was significantly lower compared to that of the wild type B-1 strain one day post-infection at 37 °C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Therefore, BK2102 showed a severe TS phenotype but could be amplified by incubating infected cells at 32 °C, which would also facilitate the manufacturing process.</p>

<p>To evaluate immunogenicity, BK2102 was intranasally inoculated into Syrian hamsters (10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup> PFU/dose). Four weeks post-inoculation, serum spike-specific IgG levels were measured using ELISA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Neutralizing antibodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) against the D614G strain were detected in 9 of the 10 hamsters in each dose group, with titers ranging between 2<sup>5</sup> and 2<sup>9</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, left). Cross-reactivity of the neutralizing antibodies against the delta variant was also detected in 9 of 10 hamsters (titer range: 2<sup>5</sup>–2<sup>8</sup>), but that against the BA.5 variant was below the limit of detection in all hamsters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, middle and right, respectively). Furthermore, we performed BK2102 immunization of cynomolgus monkeys at a dose of 10<sup>7</sup> PFU, and the serum-neutralizing titer against the D614G strain was detected in two of the four monkeys (titer range: 2<sup>4</sup>–2<sup>8</sup>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>A short-lived immune response has been reported for current mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. For example, a reduction in neutralizing antibodies was observed in humans after six months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). In hamsters, these were undetectable after 250 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Machado et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, we evaluated the persistence of the immune response induced by BK2102 using a hamster model. We measured neutralizing antibody titers for up to 364 days after inoculation with BK2102. The titer peaks were observed 28 days after the first inoculation and slightly decreased, but were maintained until 364 days post-inoculation with a dose of 10<sup>3</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> PFU. For example, the neutralizing antibody titer in the sera of hamsters inoculated with 10<sup>3</sup> PFU was 2<sup>8</sup> at 28 days and 2<sup>5</sup> at 364 days post-inoculation. Two of the ten hamsters inoculated at a dose of 10<sup>3</sup> PFU showed neutralizing antibody titers below the detection limit from the beginning, and those of another hamster in the same dose group began to decrease gradually from day 224 and fell below the detection limit on day 364 (Supplementary Fig. 2). However, the neutralizing antibody titers in hamsters inoculated with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU did not exhibit such a decrease during the evaluation period. Remarkably, a single dose of BK2102 was sufficient to induce long-lasting immunity, and there was no need for booster immunization 28 days after the first inoculation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we evaluated cellular immune responses following inoculation with BK2102. Antigen-specific IFN-γ and IL-4 production in spleen cells from inoculated hamsters was measured via ELISA after <italic>in vitr</italic>o re-stimulation with spike or nucleocapsid peptides. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, spike peptide-specific IFN-γ production significantly increased in the splenocytes of BK2102-inoculated hamsters, as did the nucleocapsid peptide-specific IFN-γ production, although in this case it did not reach statistical significance. IL-4 production was significantly increased by spike-peptide stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). We also analyzed the spike-specific IgG subclass levels (IgG1 and IgG2/3) in hamsters to evaluate the nature of the immune response induced by BK2102 (Supplementary Fig. 3). As other studies have demonstrated that aluminum adjuvant preferentially induces a Th2 response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Marrack et al., 2009</xref>), we also administered recombinant spike protein with alum adjuvant as a control. Total IgG levels were elevated in both groups. BK2102-inoculated hamsters showed high levels of IgG2/3, but we could not detect IgG1. IL-4 production and the presence of IgG1 reflects a Th2 response, while IFN-γ production and IgG2/3 are indicative of a Th1 response in hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kushawaha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ploquin et al., 2013</xref>). Our results therefore suggest that BK2102 mainly induced a Th1 immune response in hamsters.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>BK2102 induced protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
<p>Next, we performed challenge experiments with the SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain or BA.5 variant in order to evaluate whether the immune responses induced by BK2102 would protect against infection. All hamsters inoculated with BK2102 did not lose weight, whereas the naïve hamsters lost approximately 10% of their total body weight on day four post-challenge with the D614G strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). When challenged with the BA.5 variant, all hamsters pre-inoculated with a dose of 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of BK2102 and three of five hamsters pre-inoculated with a dose of 10<sup>3</sup> PFU did not lose weight. However, the rest of the animals in the 10<sup>3</sup> PFU dose group lost 5% of their total body weight, similarly to the naïve group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition to body weight change, we determined infectious virus titers in lung homogenates and nasal wash specimens four days-post infection. The number of infectious viruses was significantly lower in hamsters inoculated with BK2102 than in naïve hamsters after challenge with the D614G strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Although the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies against the BA.5 variant was below the limit of detection in all hamsters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, right), no infectious virus was detected following challenge with the BA.5 variant in most of the vaccinated animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">G</xref>, except for one animal in the 10<sup>4</sup> PFU dose group). In addition, one hamster in the 10<sup>3</sup> PFU dose group showed detectable levels of infectious virus following D614G challenge (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This result was consistent with the undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies in this animal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Lung tissue damage after the viral challenge was also evaluated in the hamsters. The inflammation score of hamsters inoculated with BK2102 was lower than that of naïve hamsters, regardless of the strain/variant used for the challenge (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">H</xref>, respectively). These results suggest that the immune response induced by BK2102 confers protection against infection that is not limited to the SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain, but also includes the BA.5 variant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to evaluate whether the protection conferred after a full vaccination protocol would persist over time, hamsters with confirmed persistent immunity at day 364 post-inoculation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) were challenged at day 420 post-inoculation. In elderly naïve hamsters, a body weight loss of approximately 15% was observed seven days after infection with the D614G strain, whereas the BK2102-inoculated hamsters showed a lower weight decrease, with significant differences noted at this time point (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). Therefore, BK2102 induced a prolonged humoral immune response, which contributed to the protection against viral infection in hamsters.</p>
<p>We then evaluated whether BK2102 could inhibit onward transmission, as a previous report of a live-attenuated vaccine generated through codon-pair deoptimization (sCPD9) had suggested that an effective immune response within the nasal cavity would likely prevent it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Nouailles et al., 2023</xref>). The naïve group, the spike protein-inoculated (intra-muscularly) group, and the BK2102 intranasal inoculation groups were challenged with the SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain and co-housed with another group of naïve hamsters one day later (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Naïve animals co-housed with hamsters in the naïve or intramuscular vaccine groups showed slight weight loss. However, no weight loss was observed in hamsters co-housed with the hamsters that had been intranasally inoculated with BK2102 (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Therefore, intranasal inoculation of the BK2102 live-attenuated vaccine effectively prevented onward transmission, in line with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Nouailles <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p>

<p>The replication of BK2102 at the tip of the nasal cavity may facilitate transmission because infectious viruses are shed into the nasal fluid. In addition, virulent reversion may occur during replication <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, we evaluated the risk of transmission and reversion to virulence by passaging <italic>in vivo</italic> using hamsters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 A50-18 is a previously isolated TS strain, in which substitutions within the NSP14 protein alone account for the TS phenotype, without the need for deletions, such as those in NSP1, spike, or other accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yoshida et al., 2022</xref>). The viral genome was detected in all nasal wash specimens from A50-18 strain-infected hamsters during primary infection, and an increase in this amount was observed in subsequently passaged samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>), which correlated with progressive weight loss (Supplementary Fig. 6). When we confirmed the sequence of the viruses detected in samples, we observed that the TS-responsible substitutions in NSP14 had reverted to the wild-type sequence (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The viral genome was detected in the nasal wash specimens from BK2102 infected hamsters during primary infection, but we could not detect it in the samples from subsequent hamsters, except for in one case (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). In this individual animal, the viral genome was not detected in the samples from later passages. No weight loss was observed in any of the primary or subsequently infected hamsters, and we did not detect changes to the wild-type sequence (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 6). Overall, our results suggest that BK2102 is a safe live-attenuated vaccine candidate with a low risk of virulent reversion.</p>

<title>BK2102 showed a favorable safety profile in Tg mice</title>
<p>hACE2 Tg mice are also used as animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Asaka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bao et al., 2020</xref>). We established a mouse line expressing hACE2 driven by the CAG promoter, and these mice were used to evaluate the safety of BK2102 live-attenuated vaccine candidate. hACE2 expression was detected not only in the respiratory tract, but also in various tissues such as the central nervous system, heart, skeletal muscle, digestive system (except the small intestine), spleen, and testis (Supplementary Fig. 7). We evaluated the survival rates of Tg mice infected with various SARS-CoV-2 strains. All of the mice died by infection with the D614G strain and even with the FCS deleted B-1 (B-1 ΔFCS) strain, previously established attenuated phenotype, within six days after receiving a dose of 10<sup>2</sup> PFU (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Meanwhile, a higher survival rate was observed in mice infected with the L50-33 and A50-18 strains, which were previously isolated TS and live-attenuated strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), even at a dose of 10<sup>5</sup> PFU. However, one mouse in each group infected with 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of the L50-33 strain died 10 days post-infection that is four days later than those in the D614G strain-infected group. This time lag before death was expected as the virus could have reverted during replication <italic>in vivo</italic>, being able to grow in deeper regions of the body. Thus, we evaluated the presence of infectious virus in the lungs and brains of mice that died following infection with the D614G, B-1 ΔFCS, and L50-33 strains. Infectious virus titers in the lungs were approximately 2.40 to 5.64 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/g, while those in the brains were higher, at approximately 5.75 to 8.69 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/g (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). We noticed that mice exhibiting head nodding, intense running, jumping and repeated falling, died despite a generally mild inflammation in the lungs at necropsy (data not shown). These results suggest that Tg mice were killed due to replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain rather than in the lungs. Sanger sequencing analysis of viruses in the lungs and brains of mice that died following infection with the L50-33 strain revealed that the 445F substitution in NSP3, responsible for the TS phenotype of this strain, had reverted to the wild-type amino acid leucine (TTT → TTG), which is the same in the D614G and B-1 ΔFCS strains (CTT, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). These results suggest that the mice died due to viral proliferation in the brain, where a small virus population lost its temperature sensitivity, becoming virulent. This mouse is a highly susceptible model of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection able to detect a few temperature-sensitive revertant viruses. In contrast to L50-33 with the NSP3-based TS phenotype, A50-18, harboring three TS-responsible substitutions in NSP14, did not kill any mice. Moreover, in the case of BK2102, no mice died following infection, even at a dose of 10<sup>6</sup> PFU (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Therefore, BK2102 is considered to have a low risk of virulent reversion, thus representing a suitable candidate for a safe live-attenuated vaccine.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we evaluated candidates for a new live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The candidate harboring more mutations showed lower immunogenicity than those harboring less mutations (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Presumably, too many mutations would lead to little viral replication in the body, resulting in weaker immunogenicity. Deletions within viral genes are less prone to mutate back to the wild-type genotype, and TS-associated substitutions control the transfer of virus to deep or warmer regions of the body, including the brain, which makes them an attractive backbone for the development of safe live-attenuated vaccines. We designed our BK2102 vaccine candidate to harbor three deletions in addition to the TS-associated substitutions.</p>
<p>We previously reported that TS strains replicate only in the anterior regions of the nasal cavity and cannot proliferate in the posterior areas or lungs of hamsters. However, these isolated TS strains entailed a risk of reversion to virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yoshida et al., 2022</xref>). K18-hACE2 Tg mice were reported to die after infection with several SARS-CoV-2 strains due to viral proliferation in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Natekar et al., 2022</xref>). So, to better assess the safety of BK2102, we generated and used CAG-hACE2 Tg mice in addition to hamsters. This mouse model proved to be highly susceptible because the B-1 ΔFCS strain killed the mice, despite other S1/S2 cleavage-deficient strains showing only an attenuated phenotype in wild-type hamsters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). However, the TS strains (L50-33 and A50-18) showed an attenuated phenotype even in this mouse model, highlighting the superior characteristics of TS in limiting viral replication and the replication-permissive regions by temperature. The TS-responsible substitutions in NSP14 were more stable than those in NSP3, as L50-33 killed one mouse in each of the dose groups tested, whereas A50-18 did not. Further, infectious viruses without TS mutations were detected in the central nervous system and respiratory tracts of dead mice following infection with the L50-33 strain (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). These results suggest that the mouse model we employed is particularly suitable for the assessment of safety and the evaluation of TS strains’ entry into the nervous system, because it enables the detection of even a small population of revertant viruses. In addition, there is concern regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection via the intranasal route causing damage to the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>). The use of this animal model could address this concern.</p>
<p>BK2102, which did not proliferate in the brains of Tg mice even at a dose of 10<sup>6</sup> PFU, which was 10,000 times higher than that killed mice in the case of the D614G or B-1 ΔFCS strains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), was not detected during passaging <italic>in vivo</italic> using naïve hamsters. The A50-18 strain shares almost the same genetic background to that of BK2102 but without three deletion mutations. This TS strain showed an attenuated phenotype during primary infection, but facilitated its reversion to virulence during viral replication in hamsters, leading to the transmission of the virulent strain to naive animals, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>. In contrast, BK2102, which combines multiple defective mutations, controls replication in host animals. Even when infected with a dose of 5×10<sup>5</sup> PFU, BK2102 viruses did not proliferate enough to be transmitted among hamsters. We hypothesized that even if TS-related substitutions are lost at the time of primary infection, the remaining deletion mutations ensure low replication efficiency, preventing transmission. Indeed, mutation in the FCS coding region was reported to lead to lower proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lau <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sasaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2021a</xref>) and transmission <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Peacock <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Our vaccine candidate BK2102 induced humoral and cellular immune responses in hamsters, and those inoculated with a high dose were protected from challenge with the heterologous BA.5 variant, even though the neutralizing titer in serum was below the limit of detection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, right). The nucleocapsid proteins of many coronaviruses are highly immunogenic and expressed abundantly in infected cells, making them easy targets for antigen-specific T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dutta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Hasanpourghadi et al., 2023</xref>). Other studies have reported the benefit of vaccination with the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, showing protective immunity in animal models receiving the nucleocapsid protein alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Primard et al., 2023</xref>) or in combination with the spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chiuppesi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Hasanpourghadi et al., 2023</xref>). In our hamster study, we detected cellular immune responses against the spike protein, but not against the nucleocapsid protein. BK2102 may induce a cellular immune response against various structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, thereby conferring protection against several variants. The potential induction of mucosal immunity was also considered. Live-attenuated influenza vaccines have been reported as effective against a broad range of variants owing to the efficient humoral and cellular immune responses they induce, even in mucosal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Thwaites et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 live-attenuated vaccine candidate sCPD9, constructed through codon-pair deoptimization, induced neutralizing antibodies in the nasal fluid of hamsters as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Nouailles et al., 2023</xref>). BK2102 was also inoculated via the intranasal route, and inhibition of onward transmission was observed, as reported for the sCPD9 candidate (Supplementary Fig. 4). Therefore, we assumed that BK2102 also induced a mucosal immune response in addition to systemic humoral and cellular immunity, contributing to protection against infection with the BA.5 variant.</p>
<p>The key to developing live-attenuated vaccines is a balance between immunogenicity and safety. Most live-attenuated vaccine candidates, including the sCPD9 mentioned above and CoviLiv<sup>TM</sup>, which has entered a phase III clinical trial, are evaluated with an emphasis on immunogenicity in basic research using animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang et al., 2021b</xref>). In this study, we carefully evaluated not only immunogenicity, but also safety. Whether our candidate will be the best for human use remains to be confirmed in human trials. In fact, we inoculated this candidate into monkeys, but these were not as susceptible as the hamsters and required a very high titer of the virus for inducing immunity. Therefore, considering the possible differences in susceptibility, we may need to optimize dose. Notably, our vaccine candidate, BK2102, was difficult to passage <italic>in vivo</italic> due to its TS substitutions that enabled to control or limit proliferation and thus was not transferred to the central nervous system. We found that, while attenuated strains with amino acid substitutions carry a risk of reversion to virulence, it is still possible to construct safer live-attenuated vaccine candidate strains by combining multiple modifications related to diverse attenuated phenotypes. Among these modifications, deletions are especially useful for their effect on reducing the risk of reversion to virulence, and TS-responsible substitutions significantly decrease viral replication in deep regions of the body. Numerous viruses, such as the Japanese encephalitis and influenza viruses, have been reported to replicate in the brain and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Desai et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Weinheimer et al., 2012</xref>). The strategy utilizing multiple modifications may thus be effective for the development of live-attenuated vaccines against these viruses.</p>

<title>Enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA)</title>
<p>Half-well protein high-binding 96-well plates (Greiner) were coated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) spike or nucleocapsid proteins (SinoBiologicals) dissolved in PBS (50 ng/100 μL/well) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. 1% BSA PBS was used as blocking solution, and 1% BSA PBS-T was used to dilute the sera, antibodies, and streptavidin. Antigen-specific IgG antibodies in hamster sera were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-Syrian hamster IgG H+L Ab (Abcam, 1/30000 dilution). IgG1 and IgG2/3 subclass Abs were analyzed using biotinylated subclass-specific antibodies (Southern Biotech, 1/100 and 1/200000 dilutions, respectively) and detected with HRP-labeled streptavidin (Abcam, 1/1000 dilution). Mouse IgG was detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG H&amp;L (Abcam, 1/100000 dilution). TMB one-component substrate and stopping solutions (Thermodics) were used for the chromogenic reaction, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a 450 nm microplate reader.</p>

<title>Evaluation of immunogenicity in hamsters</title>
<p>Four-week-old male Syrian hamsters were purchased from Japan SLC Inc. After a one-week housing period, they were first anesthetized via inhalation with 3% isoflurane, followed by intraperitoneal anesthesia with a combination of medetomidine, midazolam, and butorphanol (0.3, 4, and 5 mg/kg, respectively). One thousand or 1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU of BK2102 were administered intra-nasally in a volume of 20 μL to confine administration to the upper respiratory tract. To evaluate the humoral immune response, blood samples were collected from the facial vein using a lancet (MEDIpoint), and neutralizing antibody titers in the sera were measured as described above. To evaluate the cellular immune response, BK2102-inoculated hamsters were euthanized one week post-inoculation, and spleens were collected. The spleens were mechanically crushed with the piston of a syringe and passed through a cell strainer (100 μm). Cell suspensions were treated with RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend) to remove red blood cells, as per manufacturer instructions. The spleen cells were then suspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics at a concentration of 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL and stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleocapsid peptide pools, consisting mainly of 15-mer sequences with 11-amino-acid (aa) overlap (Miltenyi Biotec). Negative controls for non-stimulated cells were included in the test. Stimulated cells were incubated at 37 °C for three days, and supernatants were collected and stored at -80 °C until use. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) were quantified with commercially-available kits (MABTECH AB and FineTest, respectively) following the manufacturer’s protocol. We also performed a challenge assay to investigate whether these immune responses were effective in protecting against other variants. Four weeks post-inoculation, 3×10<sup>5</sup> PFU of SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain or TY41-702 strain (Omicron variant BA.5) were used to challenge the hamsters through the intra-nasal route to target the lower respiratory tract. The weights of the hamsters were monitored daily, and they were euthanized four days after the challenge. Lungs were divided, cut into small pieces, and homogenized with a biomasher II device in 500 μL of D-MEM. Supernatants were collected as lung homogenates after centrifugation at 300 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nasal wash specimens were obtained by flushing one mL of D-PBS into the nasal cavity from the trachea in the direction of the nose where it was collected. Infectious virus titers in these samples were evaluated using a plaque formation assay, as described above. To evaluate immune response persistence, hamsters inoculated with the BK2102 vaccine candidate were maintained for 364 days post-infection. Blood samples were collected from the facial vein using a lancet (MEDIpoint), and neutralizing antibody titers were measured. At 420 days after inoculation, a viral challenge assay was performed to evaluate whether the immunity contributing to infection protection was maintained. Hamsters were infected with 3×10<sup>5</sup> PFU of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain, and weight changes were monitored daily for 10 days post-infection.</p>

<p>Four-week-old male Syrian hamsters were obtained from Japan SLC Co. Ltd. After a one-week acclimatization period, 1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU of BK2102 or A50-18 strain (a TS mutant isolated in a previous report) in a volume of 20 μL were used to infect the hamsters intranasally. The hamsters were observed daily, and their body weights were measured at 0 and 3 days post-infection. At this point, hamsters were euthanized, and nasal wash specimens were collected with 500 μL D-PBS. After filtration through 0.45-μm and 0.22-μm filters, 100 μL were used to infect a new group of naive hamsters. The passage of inoculum was repeated three times, and nasal wash samples were collected at every passage. The viral genome in these nasal wash samples was quantified via qPCR, as described above. Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze the mutations introduced to generate an attenuated phenotype.</p>

<title>Generation of human ACE2-transgenic mice</title>
<p>The transgene was prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ikawa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Okabe et al., 1997</xref>). Briefly, the hACE2-coding sequence was amplified via PCR with the following primers: 5′-aatctagagccgccgccgccatgtcaagctcttcctggctccttc-3′ and 5′-aaactcgagctaaaaggaggtctgaacatcatca-3′, using human testis cDNA as the template. The <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I sites included in the PCR primers were used to introduce the amplified hACE2 cDNA into a pCAG1.1 expression vector (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org/173685/">https://www.addgene.org/173685/</ext-link>) containing the chicken <italic>beta-actin</italic> promoter and cytomegalovirus enhancer, the <italic>beta-actin</italic> intron, and the rabbit <italic>globin</italic> poly-adenylation signal. The transgene fragment was excised using <italic>Sac</italic>I and <italic>Pac</italic>I and gel-purified. Transgenic mouse lines were generated by injecting purified transgene fragments into C57BL/6N×C57BL/6N fertilized eggs. A total of 350 DNA-injected eggs were transplanted into pseudopregnant mice, resulting in 32 newborn pups. Three of these were transgenic, and the first line was established as Tg (CAG-hACE2)01Osb. The Tg mice were kept of a B6D2F1 background. Expression of hACE2 in each organ was confirmed via western blotting. Briefly, organ homogenates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing a proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific) using a bead mill homogenizer (Fischer Scientific). Protein concentrations were measured via BCA assay (Pierce), and 10 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent western blotting. hACE2 and beta-actin were detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against hACE2 (Abcam: ab15348) and a mouse monoclonal antibody to beta-actin (Abcam: ab8226) with Can Get Signal solutions (TOYOBO).</p>

<p>This is a <bold>valuable</bold> study on the efficacy of a live attenuated vaccine that was tested in different animal models. The evidence is <bold>convincing</bold>, but it could be further strengthened by comparing the efficacy of their platform with an mRNA vaccine and further investigating mucosal protection.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors constructed a live-attenuated vaccine candidate, BK2102, combining naturally occurring virulence-attenuating mutations in the key coding regions. They showed that intranasal inoculation with the candidate vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses in Syrian hamsters without apparent tissue damage in the lungs and protected against a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain with D614G mutation and the latest Omicron subvariant (BA.5) strain. The neutralizing antibodies induced by BK2102 persisted for the long term (up to 364 days). Furthermore, they confirmed the safety of the proposed vaccine using transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human ACE2 (hACE2).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors followed a robust methodology to establish the proposed vaccine's protective effect and safety profile in the hamsters and transgenic mice expressing human ACE2.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A comparative safety assessment of the available m-RNA and live attenuated vaccines will be necessary. The comparison should include details of the doses, neutralizing antibody titers with duration of protection, tissue damage in the various organs, and other risks, including virulence reversal.</p>
<p>(2) The vaccine's effect on primates is doubtful. The study fails to explain why only two of four monkeys developed neutralizing antibodies. Information about the vaccine's testing in monkeys is also missing: What was the level of protection and duration of the persistence of neutralizing antibodies in monkeys? Were the tissue damages and other risks assessed?</p>
<p>(3) The vaccine's safety in immunosuppressed individuals or individuals with chronic diseases should be assessed. Authors should make specific comments on this aspect.</p>
<p>(4) The candidate vaccine has been tested with a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 strains. Of note, the latest Omicron variants have lesser virulence than many early variants, such as the alfa, beta, and delta strains.</p>
<p>(5) Limitations of the study have not been discussed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript &quot;Immunogenicity and safety of a live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate based on multiple attenuation mechanisms&quot; by Suzuki-Okutani et al., the authors evaluate the attenuation, immunogenicity, and protection efficacy of a live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (BK2102) against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that intranasal inoculation of BK2102 is safe and able to induce humoral and cellular immune responses in hamsters, without apparent signs of damage in the lungs, that protects against homologous SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron BA.5 challenge. Safety of BK2102 was further confirmed in a new hACE2 transgenic mouse model generated by the authors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses were identified, however, this reviewer notes the following:</p>
<p>The authors missed the opportunity to include a mRNA vaccine to demonstrate that the immunity and protection efficacy of their live attenuated vaccine BK2102 is better than a mRNA vaccine.</p>
<p>One of the potential advantages of live-attenuated vaccines is their ability to induce mucosal immunity. It would be great if the authors included experiments to assess the mucosal immunity of their live-attenuated vaccine BK2102.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Suzuki-Okutani and collogues reported a new live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BK2102) containing multiple deletion/substitution mutations. They show that the vaccine candidate is highly attenuated and demonstrates a great safety profile in multiple animal models (hamsters and Tg-Mice). Importantly, their data show that single intranasal immunization with BK2102 leads to strong protection of hamsters against D614G and BA.5 challenge in both lungs and URT (nasal wash). Both humoral and cellular responses were induced, and neutralization activity remained for &gt;360 after a single inoculation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript describes a comprehensive study that evaluates the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a new live-attenuated vaccine. Strengths of the study include (1) strong protection against immune evasive variant BA.5 in both lungs and NW; (2) durability of immunity for &gt;360 days; (3) confirmation of URT protection through a transmission experiment.</p>
<p>While first-generation COVID-19 vaccines have achieved much success, new vaccines that provide mucosal and durable protection remain needed. Thus, the study is significant.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Lack of a more detailed discussion of this new vaccine approach in the context of reported live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in terms of its advantages and/or weaknesses.</p>
<p>Antibody endpoint titers could be presented.</p>
<p>Lack of elaboration on immune mechanisms of protection at the upper respiratory tract (URT) against an immune evasive variant in the absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies.</p>

<p>We extend our sincere gratitude to the editor and three reviewers for their invaluable feedback, which not only included positive comments but also provided constructive suggestions for enhancing the quality of our manuscript.</p>
<p>Of potential interest to you is our forthcoming investigation into vaccine efficacy, where we will compare the effectiveness of our live-attenuated vaccine with an mRNA-based alternative.</p>
<p>Moreover, we acknowledge and fully endorse the recommendation to elucidate why immunization with our live-attenuated vaccine confers protection against viral challenge, even in the absence of sufficient neutralizing antibodies. As pointed out by the reviewers, this phenomenon may be attributed to mucosal immunity. Consequently, we have outlined plans to investigate whether the attenuated live vaccine elicits mucosal immunity as part of our ongoing research.</p>
<p>We are currently working to gather the necessary data to address these inquiries comprehensively, and are aiming to resubmit our manuscript at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: We sincerely appreciate the insightful comments provided by Reviewer #1. In response to this feedback, we will conduct a comparative analysis of efficacy between our live-attenuated vaccine and an mRNA-based alternative. Furthermore, we will thoroughly examine and delineate the advantages and limitations of this/our live-attenuated vaccine in our discussion.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: We express our sincere appreciation to Reviewer #2 for invaluable suggestions. In light of the insightful observation concerning the weakness of our study, related to the poor assessment/evaluation of the induction of mucosal immunity by our vaccine candidate, we have resolved to undertake a comprehensive analysis in this regard.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we will take into account this reviewer's recommendation to compare BK2102 results with those of an mRNA vaccine. We are currently in the process of planning additional experiments to thoroughly address this aspect.</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: We are very grateful to Reviewer #3 for the positive feedback and invaluable suggestions. In order to further explore the immune mechanisms underlying the protection against the Omicron variant in the absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies, we are currently devising plans for experiments focused on evaluating mucosal immunity.</p>
<p>Moreover, in accordance with Reviewer #3's suggestion, we are considering the incorporation of an ELISPOT assay experiment. However, we acknowledge uncertainties regarding the feasibility of establishing an experimental system for this purpose.</p>
