<title>Abstract</title><p>Air pollution significantly impact lung cancer progression, but there is a lack of a comprehensive molecular characterization of clinical samples associated with air pollution. Here, we performed a proteogenomic analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in 169 female never-smokers from the Xuanwei area (XWLC cohort), where coal smoke is the primary contributor to the high lung cancer incidence. Genomic mutation analysis revealed XWLC as a distinct subtype of LUAD separate from cases associated with smoking or endogenous factors. Mutational signature analysis suggested that Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is the major risk factor in XWLC. The BaP-induced mutation hotspot, EGFR-G719X, was present in 20% of XWLC which endowed XWLC with elevated MAPK pathway activations and worse outcomes compared to common <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations. Multi-omics clustering of XWLC identified four clinically relevant subtypes. These subgroups exhibited distinct features in biological processes, genetic alterations, metabolism demands, immune landscape, and radiomic features. Finally, <italic>MAD1 and TPRN</italic> were identified as novel potential therapeutic targets in XWLC. Our study provides a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians to explore prevention and treatment strategies for air-pollution-associated lung cancers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Though the most common cause of lung cancer is tobacco smoking, studies estimate that approximately 25% of lung cancers worldwide occur in individuals who have never smoked[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Recently, lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) were molecular profiled and new genomic features were revealed[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. For now, further stratification of LCINS based on different risk factors would be helpful to reveal the oncogenic mechanisms and develop more targeted therapies. Air pollutants, which can directly affect the pulmonary airway, play crucial roles in promoting lung adenocarcinoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. More than 20 environmental and occupational agents are lung carcinogens[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and amount of studies have been made to investigate molecular mechanisms in tumor progression of air pollution chemicals or components using cell lines or mouse/rat models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. However, a comprehensive molecular characterization of clinical lung cancer samples associated with air pollution is still lacking.</p>
<p>The Xuanwei area has the highest rate of lung cancer in China, and extensive research has established a strong link between lung cancer and exposure to domestic coal smoke[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Specifically, etiologic link between smoky coal burning and cancer was epidemiologically established[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] and association between household stove improvement and lower risk of lung cancer was observed[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Moreover, genomic evidence of lung carcinogenesis associated with coal smoke in Xuanwei area, China was provided in our previous study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Thus, lung cancer in Xuanwei areas exemplifies the ideal disease to study characteristics of lung cancers associated with air pollution. In recent years, the molecular features of Xuanwei lung cancer have been gradually revealed[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. A large sample size with multi-comic molecular profiling is urgent needed to explicit the air pollution chemicals and furthermore propose more targeted therapies.</p>
<p>To better understand the molecular mechanisms and heterogeneity of XWLC and to advance precision medicine, we expanded the sample size of our next-generation sequencing dataset to 169 sample size and performed proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling to 112 samples. Furthermore, we integrated 107 radiomic features derived from X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans to 115 samples to non-invasively distinguish molecular subtypes. This allowed us to identify potential major risk factor, distinguish the genomic features and establish clinically relevant molecular subtypes. Our study provides an exceptional resource for future biological, diagnostic, and drug discovery efforts in the study of lung cancer related to air pollution.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To investigate unique biological features of LUAD associated with air pollution, three previous LUAD datasets related to different carcinogens were used for comparison (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). CNLC is the subset of lung adenocarcinoma from non-smoking patients in Chinese Human Proteome Project (CNHPP project) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] (n=77). TSLC is the subset of lung adenocarcinoma from smoking female in TCGA-LUAD project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] (n=168). TNLC is the subset of lung adenocarcinoma from non-smoking female in TCGA-LUAD project[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] (n=102). The clinicopathological characteristics of patients from CNLC, TSLC and TNLC cohorts were supplied in Supplementary Table 1a and 1b.</p>

<title>Proteogenomic landscape in Xuanwei lung cancer (XWLC)</title>
<p>The present study prospectively collected primary samples of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) from 169 never-smoking women from the Xuanwei area in China (Supplementary Table 1c). The XWLC cohort had a median age of 56 years (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), and the majority of tissue samples were in the early stages of the disease (145 were stage I/II, and 24 were stage III/IV, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). A total of 135, 136, 102 and 102 tumor samples were profiled with whole-exome sequencing (WES), RNA-seq, label-free protein quantification, and label-free phosphorylation quantification, respectively (Fig.1d-e and Extended Fig.1a and 1b). Analysis of the WES data from the paired tumor and normal tissue samples revealed 37,149 somatic mutations, including 1,797 InDels, 32,972 missense mutations, 2,345 nonsense mutations, and 35 nonstop mutations (Supplementary Table 2). Copy number analysis showed 140,396 gene-level amplifications and 67,605 deletions across 40 cytobands (Supplementary Table 3). The mRNA-seq data characterized the transcription profiles of 19,182 genes (Supplementary Table 4). The label-free global proteomics identified 9,152 proteins (encoded by 6,864 genes) with an average of 6,457 proteins per sample (Supplementary Table 5). The label-free phosphoproteomics identified 24,990 highly reliable phosphosites from 5,832 genes with an average of 10,478 phosphosites per sample (Supplementary Table 6). The quality and reproducibility of the mass spectrometry data were maintained throughout the study (Extended Data Fig. 1c-e).</p>

<title>The air pollutant Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) primarily contributes to the mutation landscape of XWLC</title>
<p>To infer the primary risk factor responsible for the progression of XWLC, we used SomaticSignatures[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] to identify mutational signatures from single nucleotide variants. Mutational signatures were identified in each cohort and a cosine similarity analysis was performed against mutational signatures in COSMIC mutational signatures[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] and environmental agents mutational sigantures[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] allowing for inference of the underlying causes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f-i</xref> and Extended <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Generally, exposure to tobacco smoking carcinogens (COSMIC signature 4) and chemicals such as BaP (Kucab signatures 49 and 20) were identified as the most significant contributing factors in both the XWLC and TSLC cohorts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). In contrast, defective DNA mismatch repair (COSMIC signature ID: SBS6) was identified as the major contributor in both the TNLC and CNLC cohorts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>), with no potential chemicals identified based on signature similarities. Therefore, the XWLC and TSLC cohorts appear to be more explicitly associated with environmental carcinogens, while the TNLC and CNLC cohorts may be more associated with defective DNA mismatch repair processes. BaP, a representative compound of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is found in both cigarette smoke and coal smoke and is recognized as a major environmental risk factor for lung cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Upon metabolism, BaP forms the carcinogenic metabolite 7β,8α-dihydroxy-9α,10α-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BPDE), which creates DNA adducts leading to mutations and malignant transformations. This process involves two key regulators: <italic>CYP1A1</italic> and <italic>AhR</italic>. CYP1A1 plays a crucial role in BaP epoxidation at the 7,8 positions, which is the most critical step in BPDE formation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. AhR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that responds to various chemicals, including chemical carcinogens, and is activated by BaP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Accordingly, our results demonstrated significantly higher protein expression of CYP1A1 in tumor samples compared to normal samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>). AhR showed higher mRNA expression in tumor samples, with no difference in protein level expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k</xref>). All these results suggested the involvement of BaP and its metabolite in the development of lung cancer.</p>

<p>Though coal-smoke related lung cancer (XWLC cohort) and cigarette-smoke related lung cancer (TSLC cohort) showed similar environmental carcinogens, we found that downstream pathway activation and therapeutic targeted potential showed distinctive features. Firstly, the correlation of genomic mutations between XWLC and TSLC was found to be low (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Secondly, there was a remarkable difference in the fraction of samples affected by pathway mutations between two cohorts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Notably, the TSLC cohort exhibited a higher fraction of samples affected by oncogenic pathways comparing to XWLC cohort. Thirdly, mutation frequencies of top mutated genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], such as <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>RBM10</italic>, and <italic>KRAS</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), as well as the distribution of amino acid changes in <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic>, showed noticeable differences between the XWLC and other cohorts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Specifically, the XWLC cohort exhibited a higher mutation rate in G719C/A/D/S within the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene compared to the other three cohorts. For the <italic>TP53</italic> gene, frame shift mutations including D9Gfs*3 (n=1), S15Ifs*28 (n=1), D22Efs*61 (n=1), and V34Wfs*49 (n=2) were exclusively detected in the XWLC cohort, whereas tetramer domain mutations were only found in the other three cohorts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Finally, there was a noticeable disparity in the percentage of samples with actionable targets among the cohorts. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Actionable targets in XWLC cohort were mainly focus on <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations including pG719S, pG719C, pG719A, pL858R, whereas TSLC cohort had more actionable targets in CHEK2 p.K373E, KRAS p.G12V/D/C/A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, we found that the XWLC and TSLC cohorts, which are smoke-related lung adenoma groups, demonstrated distinct etiology compared to the TNLC and CNLC cohorts which may be influenced by endogenous risk factors to a greater extent. Additionally, significant disparities were observed between XWLC and TSLC in terms of downstream pathway activations and specific oncogene loci. Consequently, we conclude that air pollution-associated lung cancer represents a distinct subtype within LUAD.</p>

<title>The EGFR-G719X mutation, which is a hotspot associated with BaP exposure, possesses distinctive biological features</title>
<p>Notably, the XWLC cohort displayed a distinguishable mutation pattern in specific <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation sites compared to the other cohorts (Fig.3a and Fig.2d). In particular, the G719C/A/D/S (G719X) mutation was the most prevalent <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation in the XWLC cohort (20%), while it was rarely found in the other three cohorts (CNLC: 1.9%; TSLC: 1.9%; TNLC: 0) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Notably, we found it was a hot spot associated with BaP exposure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Specifically, <bold>GG</bold>C is the 719 codon, the first G can be converted to T (pG719C, n=13) or A (pG719S, n=5), the second G can be converted to A (pG719D, n=1) or C (pG719C, n=8). Thus, pG719C was the most detected mutation type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). G&gt;T/C&gt;A transversion can be induced by several compounds such as BaP or dibenz(a,h)anthracene (DBA), unlike other compounds, the tallest peak induced by BaP occurs at GpGpG, reflecting how their DNA adducts are formed principally at N<sup>2</sup>-guanine[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Our result showed that the most frequently detected pG719C AAchange was correspond to G<bold>G</bold>GC&gt;G<bold>T</bold>GC transversion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Thus, pG719C is a hot spot associated with BaP exposure.</p>

<p>We conducted further investigations into the biological characteristics of samples carrying the G719X mutations. Notably, we observed a moderate to high expression of MAPK signaling components, MAP2K2 (MEK), and MAPK3 (ERK1), in tumors harboring the EGFR-G719X mutation compared to other EGFR statuses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>). Utilizing hallmark capability analysis and RNA-seq-based estimation of immune cell infiltration, we found that tumors with G719X mutations exhibited similarities to those with L858R mutations (Extended Data Fig. 3a-b). However, patients with G719X mutations were notably younger than those with L858R mutations, indicating a higher occurrence rate of G719X in younger female patients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>). Analysis of overall survival and progression-free interval (PFI) revealed that patients with the G719X mutation had worse outcomes compared to other EGFR mutation subtypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3k</xref>) which was consistent with a previous study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in mutation burden or the number of neoantigens between tumors with G719X mutations and tumors with other <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation statuses (Extended Data Fig. 3c).</p>
<p>To explore the heterogeneity of signaling pathways activated by different <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation statuses, we conducted Kinase-Substrate Enrichment Analysis (KSEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] based on the XWLC phosphoproteomics dataset. Our analysis of the phosphoproteome across various <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation types revealed distinct activation patterns of kinases. Specifically, the G719X mutation was associated with the activation of PRKCZ, CDK2, AURKB, CSNK1A1, CDK4, and HIPK2. The L858R mutation showed activation of PRKCZ, MAPK7, MAPK12, HIPK2, and CSNK2A1. The Exon19del mutation exhibited activation of CHUK, TTK, PRKCZ, PLK1, NEK2, MAP2K2, CDK2, PRKDC, and MAP2K6. Other EGFR mutations were associated with the activation of AURKB, NEK2, TTK, PLK1, PRKACB, and PRKACG. EGFR-WT mutations showed activation of CSNK1E, PRKCZ, AURKB, CDK2, AURKC, CDK1, CSNK1A1, PRKDC, and CSNK2A1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3l</xref>). In Extended Data Fig. 3d, we provide a list of FDA-approved drugs that target the activated kinases in tumors harboring the G719X mutation.</p>
<p>Currently, afatinib is widely regarded as a first-line therapy for patients with the G719X mutation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. However, reports indicate that 80% of patients with this mutation may develop resistance to afatinib, even in the absence of T790M[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of the downstream pathways associated with the G719X mutation. Therefore, a promising approach to overcome resistance in tumors with this mutation could involve combining afatinib, which targets activated EGFR, with FDA-approved drugs that specifically target the activated kinases associated with G719X. Therefore, we propose a potential approach to overcoming resistance in tumors with this mutation, which could involve combining afatinib, targeting activated EGFR, with FDA-approved drugs that specifically target the activated kinases associated with G719X.</p>

<title>Clinically relevant Subtyping in XWLC</title>
<p>To uncover the inherent subgroups within air-pollution-associated tumors, we employed unsupervised Consensus Clustering[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] on integrated RNA, protein, and phosphoprotein profiles of XWLC tumor samples. This analysis led to the identification of four distinct intrinsic clusters, denoted as MC-I, II, III, and IV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 4a and Methods). Further survival analysis demonstrated that patients belonging to the MC-IV group exhibited the poorest overall survival compared to the other three subgroups, thus indicating the prognostic potential of multi-omic clustering (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Notably, there were no significant differences in clinical features such as age and stage observed among the four subgroups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). As CYP1A1 is a key regulator involved in BaP metabolism and has been proven to be highly expressed in tumor samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>), we next examined the expression of CYP1A1 among the four subgroups to evaluate their associations with air pollution. Our findings revealed that the MC-II subtype exhibited higher expression of CYP1A1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Moreover, the MC-II possessed more G719X mutations (MC-1:0.39, MC-II:0.42, MC-III: 0.20, MC-IV: 0.08). Notably, there was a significant correlation between CYP1A1 and EGFR expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>), with EGFR being more highly expressed in the MC-II subtype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Collectively, these results indicated that MC-II was more associated with air-pollution.</p>

<p>Through Kinase Substrate Enrichment Analysis (KSEA) of the phosphoproteome in tumor samples compared to normal adjacent tissues (NATs), we identified specific kinase activations within the four subgroups. In MC-I samples, kinase activations included PRKDC, PRKCZ, CSNK1A1, NEK2, GSK3A, and ROCK1. MC-II samples showed activations of CDK2, CDK1, AURKA, TTK, CDK6, and CHUK. MC-III samples exhibited activations of AKT1, AKT3, RPS6KB1, CSNK2A1, and PAK2. Finally, CDK2 and ROCK1 were activated in MC-IV samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Particularly noteworthy is the enrichment of CDK1/2/6 kinases, which regulate cell cycle checkpoints, in the MC-II subtype, indicating its high proliferation capabilities. These findings imply that distinct kinase pathways are activated within each subgroup, suggesting the presence of specific therapeutic targets for each subgroup. Consequently, we proceeded to explore therapeutic strategies for each subgroup as outlined below:</p>
<p>The <bold>MC-IV</bold> subtype exhibited the poorest overall survival compared to the other three subtypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Given the crucial role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in malignant progression, our first evaluation focused on the EMT process across the four subtypes. We observed higher expression levels of mesenchymal markers such as <italic>VIM</italic>, <italic>FN1</italic>, <italic>TWIST2</italic>, <italic>SNAI2</italic>, <italic>ZEB1</italic>, <italic>ZEB2</italic>, and others in the MC-IV subtype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). To comprehensively assess the EMT capability of the MC-IV subtype, we calculated EMT scores using the ssGSEA enrichment method based on protein levels and GSEA hallmark gene set (M5930)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. The results confirmed the elevated EMT capability of the MC-IV subtype at the protein level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Furthermore, Fibronectin (FN1), an EMT marker that promotes the dissociation, migration, and invasion of epithelial cells, was found to be highly expressed in the MC-IV subtype at the protein level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Additionally, β-Catenin, a key regulator in initiating EMT, was highly expressed in the MC-IV subtype at the protein level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the MC-IV subtype is associated with enhanced EMT capability, which may contribute to the high malignancy observed in this subtype.</p>

<p>The <bold>MC-II</bold> subtype demonstrated the second-worst outcome and was found to be more strongly associated with air pollution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This subtype exhibited dysregulation of cell cycle processes, including cell division, glycolysis, and cell cycle biological processes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). The KSEA analysis revealed that the CDK1 and CDK2 pathways, which are closely linked to cell cycle regulation, were predominantly activated in the MC-II subtype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). Consistently, we observed higher expression levels of CDK1 and CDK2 at both the protein and phosphoprotein levels in the MC-II subtype, indicating specific elevation of the G2M phase in the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). The cell cycle and glycolysis processes are tightly coordinated, allowing cells to synchronize their metabolic state and energy requirements with cell cycle progression to ensure proper cell growth and division[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. In line with this, we found that key enzymes involved in glycolysis regulation, such as Hexokinase 1 (HK1), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-like protein (GPL), were highly expressed in the MC-II subtype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). Additionally, the MC-II subtype was enriched with EGFR mutations (MC-II vs. others: 18/24 vs. 51/110; Fisher’s exact p = 0.013) and TP53 mutations (MC-II vs. others: 14/24 vs. 35/110; Fisher’s exact p = 0.019), consistent with the characteristic loss of control over cell proliferation. In summary, the MC-II subtype exhibited dysregulated cell cycle processes accompanied by an elevated glycolysis capability, indicating a distinct metabolic and proliferative phenotype.</p>
<p>The <bold>MC-I</bold> subtype exhibited enrichment in various biological processes including angiogenesis, the cAMP signaling pathway, complement and coagulation cascades, PDL1 expression, the PD-1 checkpoint pathway, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and actin cytoskeleton processes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). In-depth exploration of key components involved in angiogenesis revealed that vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), a growth factor crucial for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis, was highly expressed in the MC-I subtype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>). Additionally, phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), a receptor tyrosine kinase essential for angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, was also highly expressed in the MC-I subtype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>). The angiogenesis scores, calculated using the ssGSEA method based on protein levels and the hallmark gene set (M5944), were relatively high in the MC-I and MC-IV subtypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref>). Furthermore, the relationship between the Notch signaling pathway and angiogenesis is well-established[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Notch signaling plays a role in multiple aspects of angiogenesis, including endothelial cell sprouting, vessel branching, and vessel maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. In the MC-I subtype, the expression of Notch receptors (Notch1-4) and ligands (DLL1, DLL4, JAG1, and JAG2) was highly elevated, indicating increased activation of Notch signaling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5j</xref>). KEGG pathview analysis demonstrated that key regulators of the VEGF signaling pathway were highly expressed in the MC-I subtype (Extended Fig.5a). Therefore, manipulating Notch signaling could potentially serve as a strategy to regulate angiogenesis and control pathological angiogenesis in the MC-I subtype.</p>
<p>The <bold>MC-III</bold> subtype is characterized by the upregulation of various metabolic processes, including oxidative phosphorylation, peroxisome function, adipogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, and xenobiotic metabolism-related processes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5k</xref>). Additionally, we conducted further investigations into the immune features across the subtypes. Interestingly, we observed higher expression of genes associated with PD-1 signaling (GSEA, SYSTEMATIC_NAME M18810) in the MC-III subtype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5l</xref>). Since PD-1 is primarily expressed on the surface of certain immune cells, particularly activated T cells, we inferred the immune cell infiltration using the ssGSEA method based on immune cell-specific gene sets. We found that activated CD8+ T cells exhibited higher infiltration levels in the MC-III subtype compared to the other three subtypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5m</xref> and Supplementary Table 7), which may explain the elevated PD-1 signaling in the MC-III subtype. Furthermore, we examined the expression of receptor-ligand pairs involved in both anti-tumor and pro-tumor lymphocyte recruitment. Remarkably, the MC-III subtype exhibited specific high expression of anti-tumor lymphocyte receptors and ligands, while the expression of pro-tumor lymphocyte receptors and ligands was relatively lower (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5n</xref>). In general, the MC-I subtype showed the reverse expression trend in terms of anti-tumor and pro-tumor receptor-ligand pairs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5n</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our classification of lung adenocarcinoma associated with air pollution resulted in the identification of four subtypes, each exhibiting distinct biological pathway activation and immune features. The MC-I subtype demonstrated elevated angiogenesis processes, while the MC-II subtype showed a high capacity for cell division and glycolysis. The MC-III subtype exhibited a notable infiltration of CD8+ cells, and the MC-IV subtype was characterized by high EMT capability, which may contribute to its poor outcome. These findings have significant implications for the development of precision treatments for XWLC (Extended Fig.5b).</p>

<title>Radiomic features across subtypes</title>
<p>Furthermore, we built a noninvasive method to distinguish MC subtypes with radiomics which entails the extensive quantification of tumor phenotypes by utilizing numerous quantitative image features. In the initial step, we defined 107 quantitative image features that describe various characteristics of tumor phenotypes, including tumor image intensity, size, shape, and texture. These features were derived from X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans of 155 patients with XWLC (Methods). The baseline characteristics of this cohort can be found in Supplementary Table 8. Firstly, all features were compared among the four subtypes, and notably, eight features showed significant differences between the MC-II subtype and the other three subtypes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Features such as median and mean reflect average gray level intensity and Idmn and Gray Level Non-Uniformity measure the variability of gray-level intensity values in the image, with a higher value indicating greater heterogeneity in intensity values. These results suggest a denser and more heterogeneous image in the MC-II subtype. We further established a signature using a multivariate linear regression model with five image features to distinguish MC-II from the other three subgroups (Extended <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6</xref>). The performance of the five-feature radiomic signature was validated using the AUC value, which is a generation of the area under the ROC curve. The radiomic signature had an AUC value of 0.94 in the training set and 0.83 in the validation set (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). The confusion matrix revealed an overall accuracy of 0.875 for sample classification using the signature, indicating proficient performance. However, it exhibited suboptimal performance in terms of false-negative classification (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Taken together, we found that MC-II showed a dense image phenotype, which can be noninvasively distinguished using radiomic features.</p>

<title>Identification of novel targets based on mutation-informed protein-protein interface (PPI) analysis</title>
<p>The integration of genomics and interactomics has enabled the discovery of functional and biological consequences of disease mutations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. To explore novel targets with the concept, we created PPI networks with structural resolution using missense mutations from the XWLC, CNLC, TSLC, and TNLC cohorts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref> and Methods). OncoPPIs, defined as a significant enrichment of interface mutations in either of the two protein-binding partners across individuals, were identified in each cohort and were provided in Supplementary Tables 9.

<p>To refine the novel targets from XWLC_oncoPPs, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to predict the binding affinity change by the interface-located mutations (Methods). Mitotic Arrest Deficient 1 Like 1 (MAD1), a crucial component of the mitotic spindle-assembly checkpoint[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], forms a tight core complex with MAD2, facilitating the binding of MAD2 to CDC20[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>], which plays a critical role in sister chromatid separation during the metaphase-anaphase transition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. Specifically, MAD1 Arg558His has been identified as a susceptibility factor for lung cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] and colorectal cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Here, we found that MAD1 allele carrying a p.Arg558His substitution may disrupt the interaction between MAD1 and MAD2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). To assess this, we performed molecular dynamics simulations and found that the binding affinity between Arg558His MAD1 and MAD2 was –195.091 kJ/mol and that of wild type was –442.712 kJ/mol (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). Furthermore, on a per-residue basis, the predicted binding affinity (ΔΔG) of Arg558His (Extended <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>) was projected to increase by 118.319 kJ/mol relative to the wild type (Extended <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>), indicating that the substitution of Arg558His in MAD1 perturbs the binding affinity. Thus, our findings suggest that the MAD1 Arg558His attributed to lung cancer progression by disrupting of the interaction between MAD1 and MAD2, which showed potential to be explored as a target.</p>
<p>Notably, we identified TPRN as a novel significantly mutated gene in the XWLC cohort (Extended <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7h</xref>) whose status was also associated with patients’ outcomes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>). Previous studies have reported that TPRN interacts with PPP1CA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Thus, we assessed the binding affinity of the TPRN-PPP1CA complex affected by the mutant variant His550Gln. Our result showed that the binding affinities of the complex were –694.372 kJ/mol and –877.570 kJ/mol in mutant and WT cases, respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). On a per-residue basis, the predicted ΔΔG of His550Gln compared to the wild type exhibited an increase of 96.774 kJ/mol (Extended <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7i-j</xref>). All these results indicated that TPRN His550Gln increase the binding affinity of the TPRN-PPP1CA complex. To investigate the effect of TPRN His550Gln mutation on tumor progression, we examined proliferation and migration capabilities in both A549 and H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. CCK-8 assay showed significantly enhanced cell growth after transfection of TPRN mutant allele in both A549 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>) and H1299 cells (Extended Fig. 8a). Moreover, wound-healing assay showed that TPRN mutant cell had achieved enhanced migration capacity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g-h</xref> and Extended Fig. 8b-c). Finally, more cell clones in TPRN His550Gln mutation cells were observed in both TPRN-mutant A549 and H1299 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7i</xref>). All these results supported that TPRN His550Gln could be explored as a target in XWLC.</p>
<p>Taken together, our integrated analysis of oncoPPIs and molecular dynamics simulations showed potential to explore novel therapeutic vulnerabilities.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we conducted proteogenomic and characterized air-pollution-related lung cancers. We found that Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) influenced the mutation landscape, particularly the EGFR-G719X hotspot found in 20% of cases. This mutation correlated with elevated MAPK pathway activation, worse clinical outcomes, and younger patients. Multi-omics clustering identified four subtypes with unique biological pathways and immune cell patterns. Moreover, our analysis of protein-protein interfaces unveiled novel therapeutic targets. These findings have significant implications for preventing and developing precise treatments for air-pollution-associated lung cancers.</p>
<p>Previously considered uncommon, the EGFR-G719X mutation was detected in only 1-2% of CNLC or TCGA-LUAD cohort samples. Limited knowledge exists from G719X, mostly based on isolated case reports or small series studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. In vitro experiments using G719X mutant cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) demonstrated that osimertinib effectively inhibits signaling pathways and cellular growth, leading to sustained tumor growth inhibition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. However, in silico protein structure analysis suggests that G719 alterations may confer osimertinib resistance due to reduced EGFR binding[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Presently, afatinib is proposed as the first-line therapy for G719X mutation patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Unfortunately, 80% of G719X patients develop acquired resistance to afatinib without detecting the T790M mutation40. Hence, further mechanistic studies are warranted for G719X. Our study reveals that the G719X mutation is prevalent in the XWLC cohort, significantly impacting treatment selection. Additionally, the large number of G719X samples allowed us to uncover variations in biology and pathway activation, which may facilitate the development of more precise targeted therapies for these patients.</p>
<p>There is substantial evidence linking lung cancer in the Xuanwei area to coal smoke[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. In addition, we conducted a rat model study that demonstrated the induction of lung cancer by local coal smoke exposure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. However, the specific chemical compound in coal smoke responsible for causing lung cancer remains largely unknown. Previous research has mainly focused on studying indoor concentrations of airborne particles and BaP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. For instance, studies have shown an association between the concentration of BaP and lung cancer rates across counties[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Moreover, improvements in household stoves have led to reduced exposure to benzopyrene and particulate matter, benefiting people’s health[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. However, these studies primarily relied on epidemiological data, which may be influenced by confounding factors. Mechanistically, Qing Wang showed that BaP induces lung carcinogenesis, characterized by increased inflammatory cytokines, and cell proliferative markers, while decreasing antioxidant levels, and apoptotic protein expression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. In our study, we used clinical samples and linked the mutational signatures of XWLC to the chemical compound BaP, which advanced the etiology and mechanism of air-pollution-induced lung cancer. In our study, several limitations must be acknowledged. Firstly, although our multi-omics approach provided a comprehensive analysis of the subtypes and their unique biological pathways, the sample size for each subtype was relatively small. This limitation may affect the robustness of the clustering results and the identified subtype-specific pathways. Larger cohort studies are necessary to confirm these findings and refine the subtype classifications. Secondly, although our study advanced the understanding of air-pollution-induced lung cancer by using clinical samples, the reliance on epidemiological data in previous studies introduces potential confounding factors. Our findings should be interpreted with caution, and further mechanistic studies are warranted to establish causal relationships more definitively. Thirdly, our in silico analysis suggested potential approach to drug resistance in G719X mutations. However, these predictions need to be validated through extensive in vitro and in vivo experiments. The reliance on computational models without experimental confirmation may limit the clinical applicability of these findings.</p>
<p>In summary, our proteogenomic analysis of clinical tumor samples provides insights into air-pollution-associated lung cancers, especially those induced by coal smoke and offers an opportunity to expedite the translation of basic research to more precise diagnosis and treatment in the clinic.</p>

<p>New comments are added after authors responses to my initial comments.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhang et al. performed a proteogenomic analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in 169 female never-smokers from the Xuanwei area (XWLC) in China. These analyses reveal that XWLC is a distinct subtype of LUAD and that BaP is a major risk factor associated with EGFR G719X mutations found in the XWLC cohort. Four subtypes of XWLC were classified with unique features based on multi-omics data clustering.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors made great efforts in performing several large-scale proteogenomic analyses and characterizing molecular features of XWLCs. Datasets from this study will be a valuable resource to further explore the etiology and therapeutic strategies of air-pollution-associated lung cancers, particularly for XWLC.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>(2) Importantly, while providing the large datasets, validating key findings is minimally performed, and surprisingly there is no interrogation of XWLC drug response/efficacy based on their findings, which makes this manuscript descriptive and incomplete rather than conclusive. For example, testing the efficacy of XWLC response to afatinib combined with other drugs targeting activated kinases in EGFR G719X mutated XWLC tumors would be one way to validate their datasets and new therapeutic options.</p>
<p>Response: We appreciate your suggestion. In reference to testing the efficacy of XWLC response to afatinib combined with drugs targeting kinases, we have planned to establish PDX and organoid models to validate the effectiveness of our therapeutic approach. Due to the extended timeframe required, we intend to present these results in a subsequent study.</p>
<p>Comments: All conclusions in the manuscript made by authors are based on interpretations of large-scale multi-omics data, which should be properly validated by other approaches and methods. Without validation, these are all speculations and any conclusions without supporting evidence are not acceptable. This reviewer suggested an example of validation experiment, and Reviewer #3 also pointed out several data that need to be validated. However, authors do not agree to perform any of these validation experiments without reasonable justification.</p>
<p>(3) The authors found MAD1 and TPRN are novel therapeutic targets in XWLC. Are these two genes more frequently mutated in one subtype than the other 3 XWLC subtypes? How these mutations could be targeted in patients?</p>
<p>Response: Thank you for your question. We have investigated the TPRN and MAD1 mutations in our dataset, identifying five TPRN mutations and eight MAD1 mutations. Among the TPRN mutations, XWLC_0046 and XWLC_0017 belong to the MCII subtype, XWLC_0012 belongs to the MCI subtype, and the subtype of the other three samples is undetermined, resulting in mutation frequencies of 1/16, 2/24, 0/15, and 0/13, respectively. Similarly, for the MAD1 mutations, XWLC_0115, XWLC_0021, and XWLC_0047 belong to the MCII subtype, XWLC_0055 containing two mutations belongs to the MCI subtype, and the subtype of the other three samples is undetermined, resulting in mutation frequencies of 1/16, 3/24, 0/15, and 0/13 across subtypes, respectively. Fisher's test did not reveal significant differences between the subtypes. For targeting novel therapeutic targets such as MAD1 and TPRN, we propose a multi-step approach. Firstly, we advocate for conducting functional in vivo and in vitro experiments to verify their roles during cancer progression. Secondly, we suggest conducting small molecule drug screening based on the pharmacophore of these proteins, which may lead to the identification of potential therapeutic drugs. Lastly, we recommend testing the efficacy of these drugs to further validate their potential as effective treatments.</p>
<p>Comments: Please properly incorporate the above explanation into the main text.</p>
<p>(4) In Figures 2a and b: while Figure 2a shows distinct genomic mutations among each LC cohort, Figure 2b shows similarity in affected oncogenic pathways (cell cycle, Hippo, NOTCH, PI3K, RTK-RAS, and WNT) between XWLC and TNLC/CNLC. Considering that different genomic mutations could converge into common pathways and biological processes, wouldn't these results indicate commonalities among XWLC, TNLC, and CNLC? How about other oncogenic pathways not shown in Figure 2b?</p>
<p>Response: Thank you for your question. Based on the data presented in Fig. 2a, which encompasses all genomic mutations, it appears that the mutation landscape of XWLC bears the closest resemblance to TSLC (Fig. 2a). However, when considering oncogenic pathways (Fig. 2b) and genes (Fig. 2c), there is a notable disparity between the two cohorts. These findings suggest that while XWLC and TSLC exhibit similarities in terms of genomic mutations, they possess distinct characteristics in terms of oncogenic pathways and genes.</p>
<p>
Regarding the oncogenic signaling pathways, we referred to ten well-established pathways identified from TCGA cohorts. These members of oncogenic pathways are likely to serve as cancer drivers (functional contributors) or therapeutic targets, as highlighted by Sanchez-Vega et al. in 2018(Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Comments: It is unclear to this reviewer how authors defined &quot;distinct characteristics&quot; in terms of oncogenic pathways and genes. Would 10-20% differences in &quot;Fraction of samples affected&quot; in Fig2b be sufficient to claim significance? How could authors be sure whether mutations in genes involved in each oncogenic pathway are activating or inactivating mutations (rather than benign, thus non-affecting mutations)?</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>(6) Supplementary Table 11 shows a number of mutations at the interface and length of interface between a given protein-protein interaction pair. Such that, it does not provide what mutation(s) in a given PPI interface is found in each LC cohort. For example, it fails to provide whether MAD1 R558H and TPRN H550Q mutations are found significantly in each LC cohort.</p>
<p>Response: We appreciate your careful review. In Supplementary Table 11, we have provided significant onco_PPI data for each LC cohort, focusing on enriched mutations at the interface of two proteins. Our emphasis lies on onco_PPI rather than individual mutations, as any mutation occurring at the interface could potentially influence the function of the protein complex. Thus, our Supplementary Table 11 exclusively displays the onco_PPI rather than mutations. MAD1 R558H and TPRN H550Q were identified through onco_PPI analysis, and subsequent extensive literature research led us to focus specifically on these mutations.</p>
<p>Comments: Are authors referring to Table S9 (Onco_PPIs identified in four cohorts) instead of Supplementary Table 11? There is no Table 11 among submitted files. In Table S9, the Column N (length of protein product of gene1) does not make sense: MYO1C (8152), TP53 (3924), EGFR (12961). These should not be the number of amino acids residues of each protein. Then, what do these numbers mean?</p>
<p>(7) Figure 7c and d are simulation data not from an actual binding assay. The authors should perform a biochemical binding assay with proteins or show that the mutation significantly alters the interaction to support the conclusion.</p>
<p>Response: We appreciate your suggestion. The relevant experiments are currently in progress, and we anticipate presenting the corresponding data in a subsequent study.</p>
<p>Comments: The suggested experiment is to support the simulated data. Again, without supporting experimental results, authors could not make a conclusion simply based on simulated data. Where else could the supporting experimental results be presented?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhang et al. performed a proteogenomic analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in 169 female never-smokers from the Xuanwei area (XWLC) in China. These analyses reveal that XWLC is a distinct subtype of LUAD and that BaP is a major risk factor associated with EGFR G719X mutations found in the XWLC cohort. Four subtypes of XWLC were classified with unique features based on multi-omics data clustering.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors made great efforts in performing several large-scale proteogenomic analyses and characterizing molecular features of XWLCs. Datasets from this study will be a valuable resource to further explore the etiology and therapeutic strategies of air-pollution-associated lung cancers, particularly for XWLC.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While analyzing and interpreting the datasets, however, this reviewer thinks that authors should provide more detailed procedures of (i) data processing, (ii) justification for choosing methods of various analyses, and (iii) justification of focusing on a few target gene/proteins in the datasets for further validation in the main text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your valuable feedback. In response to the suggestions for enhancing the manuscript's clarity, we have provided more detailed procedures in the main text and methods sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Importantly, while providing the large datasets, validating key findings is minimally performed, and surprisingly there is no interrogation of XWLC drug response/efficacy based on their findings, which makes this manuscript descriptive and incomplete rather than conclusive. For example, testing the efficacy of XWLC response to afatinib combined with other drugs targeting activated kinases in EGFR G719X mutated XWLC tumors would be one way to validate their datasets and new therapeutic options.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your suggestion. In reference to testing the efficacy of XWLC response to afatinib combined with drugs targeting kinases, we have planned to establish PDX and organoid models to validate the effectiveness of our therapeutic approach. Due to the extended timeframe required, we intend to present these results in a subsequent study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors found MAD1 and TPRN are novel therapeutic targets in XWLC. Are these two genes more frequently mutated in one subtype than the other 3 XWLC subtypes? How these mutations could be targeted in patients?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question. We have investigated the TPRN and MAD1 mutations in our dataset, identifying five TPRN mutations and eight MAD1 mutations. Among the TPRN mutations, XWLC_0046 and XWLC_0017 belong to the MCII subtype, XWLC_0012 belongs to the MCI subtype, and the subtype of the other three samples is undetermined, resulting in mutation frequencies of 1/16, 2/24, 0/15, and 0/13, respectively. Similarly, for the MAD1 mutations, XWLC_0115, XWLC_0021, and XWLC_0047 belong to the MCII subtype, XWLC_0055 containing two mutations belongs to the MCI subtype, and the subtype of the other three samples is undetermined, resulting in mutation frequencies of 1/16, 3/24, 0/15, and 0/13 across subtypes, respectively. Fisher’s test did not reveal significant differences between the subtypes.</p>
<p>For targeting novel therapeutic targets such as MAD1 and TPRN, we propose a multi-step approach. Firstly, we advocate for conducting functional in <italic>vivo</italic> and in <italic>vitro</italic> experiments to verify their roles during cancer progression. Secondly, we suggest conducting small molecule drug screening based on the pharmacophore of these proteins, which may lead to the identification of potential therapeutic drugs. Lastly, we recommend testing the efficacy of these drugs to further validate their potential as effective treatments.</p>

<p>(4) In Figures 2a and b: while Figure 2a shows distinct genomic mutations among each LC cohort, Figure 2b shows similarity in affected oncogenic pathways (cell cycle, Hippo, NOTCH, PI3K, RTK-RAS, and WNT) between XWLC and TNLC/CNLC. Considering that different genomic mutations could converge into common pathways and biological processes, wouldn't these results indicate commonalities among XWLC, TNLC, and CNLC? How about other oncogenic pathways not shown in Figure 2b?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question. Based on the data presented in Fig. 2a, which encompasses all genomic mutations, it appears that the mutation landscape of XWLC bears the closest resemblance to TSLC (Fig. 2a). However, when considering oncogenic pathways (Fig. 2b) and genes (Fig. 2c), there is a notable disparity between the two cohorts. These findings suggest that while XWLC and TSLC exhibit similarities in terms of genomic mutations, they possess distinct characteristics in terms of oncogenic pathways and genes.</p>
<p>Regarding the oncogenic signaling pathways, we referred to ten well-established pathways identified from TCGA cohorts. These members of oncogenic pathways are likely to serve as cancer drivers (functional contributors) or therapeutic targets, as highlighted by Sanchez-Vega et al. in 2018(Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Figure 2c, how and why were the four genes (EGFR, TP53, RBM10, KRAS) selected? What about other genes? In this regard, given tumor genome sequencing was done, it would be more informative to provide the oncoprints of XWLC, TSLC, TNLC, and CNLC for complete genomic alteration comparison.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question and good suggestion. Building upon our previous study (Zhang et al., 2021), we found that EGFR, TP53, RBM10, and KRAS were the top mutated genes in Xuanwei lung cancer cohorts. Furthermore, we have included the mutation frequency of cancer driver genes (Bailey et al., 2018) across XWLC, TSLC, TNLC, and CNLC in Supplementary Table 2b.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Supplementary Table 11 shows a number of mutations at the interface and length of interface between a given protein-protein interaction pair. Such that, it does not provide what mutation(s) in a given PPI interface is found in each LC cohort. For example, it fails to provide whether MAD1 R558H and TPRN H550Q mutations are found significantly in each LC cohort.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your careful review. In Supplementary Table 11, we have provided significant onco_PPI data for each LC cohort, focusing on enriched mutations at the interface of two proteins. Our emphasis lies on onco_PPI rather than individual mutations, as any mutation occurring at the interface could potentially influence the function of the protein complex. Thus, our Supplementary Table 11 exclusively displays the onco_PPI rather than mutations. MAD1 R558H and TPRN H550Q were identified through onco_PPI analysis, and subsequent extensive literature research led us to focus specifically on these mutations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript from Zhang et al. utilizes a multi-omics approach to analyze lung adenocarcinoma cases in female never smokers from the Xuanwei area (XWLC cohort) compared with cases associated with smoking or other endogenous factors to identify mutational signatures and proteome changes in lung cancers associated with air pollution. Mutational signature analysis revealed a mutation hotspot, EGFR-G719X, potentially associated with BaP exposure, in 20% of the XWLC cohort. This correlated with predicted MAPK pathway activations and worse outcomes relative to other EGFR mutations. Multi-omics clustering, including RNA-seq, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics identified 4 clusters with the XWLC cohort, with additional feature analysis pathway activation, genetic differences, and radiomic features to investigate clinical diagnostic and therapeutic strategy potential for each subgroup. The study, which nicely combines multi-modal omics, presents potentially important findings, that could inform clinicians with enhanced diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for more personalized or targeted treatments in lung adenocarcinoma associated with air pollution. The authors successfully identify four distinct clusters with the XWLC cohort, with distinct diagnostic characteristics and potential targets. However, many validating experiments must be performed, and data supporting BaP exposure linkage to XWLC subtypes is suggestive but incomplete to conclusively support this claim. Thus, while the manuscript presents important findings with the potential for significant clinical impact, the data presented are incomplete in supporting some of the claims and would benefit from validation experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Integration of omics data from multimodalities is a tremendous strength of the manuscript, allowing for cross-modal comparison/validation of results, functional pathway analysis, and a wealth of data to identify clinically relevant case clusters at the transcriptomic, translational, and post-translational levels. The inclusion of phosphoproteomics is an additional strength, as many pathways are functional and therefore biologically relevant actions center around activation of proteins and effectors via kinase and phosphatase activity without necessarily altering the expression of the genes or proteins.</p>
<p>Clustering analysis provides clinically relevant information with strong therapeutic potential both from a diagnostic and treatment perspective. This is bolstered by the individual microbiota, radiographic, wound healing, outcomes, and other functional analyses to further characterize these distinct subtypes.</p>
<p>Visually the figures are well-designed and presented and for the most part easy to follow. Summary figures/histograms of proteogenomic data, and specifically highlighted genes/proteins are well presented.</p>
<p>Molecular dynamics simulations and 3D binding analysis are nice additions.</p>
<p>While I don't necessarily agree with the authors' interpretation of the microbiota data, the experiment and results are very interesting, and clustering information can be gleaned from this data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Please provide a justification for why only females were included in the study. I am concerned that the results obtained in this study can not be generalized as only females were included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your suggestion. Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) accounts for approximately 25% of lung cancer cases (15% of lung cancer in men and 53% in women) (Parkin et al., 2005). Currently, the etiology and mechanisms of LCINS are not clear. Globally, LCINS shows remarkable gender and geographic variations, occurring more frequently among Asian women (Bray et al., 2018). Indoor coal burning for heating and cooking has been implicated as a risk factor for Chinese women, as they spend more time indoors (Mumford et al., 1987). Among men, the proportion of never smokers is lower, with less regional variation, and lung cancer in males is frequently caused by smoking. Thus, to better reveal the etiology and molecular mechanisms of LCINS, we collected data exclusively from female LCINS patients in the Xuanwei area, excluding potential confounding factors such as hormonal or smoking status. Our study specifically aims to uncover the etiology and mechanisms of LCINS in female patients, with future research planned to verify whether our conclusions can be generalized to LCINS in male patients.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) &quot;Therefore, the XWLC and TSLC cohorts are more explicitly influenced by environmental carcinogens, while the TNLC and CNLC cohorts may be more affected by age or endogenous risk factors.&quot; This statement in the results (starting line 142) does not have adequate support from the results. First, the average age in the 4 cohorts does not seem to be very different to me based on Figure 1b. if they are different, please provide statistical test results. Please make sure this statement is supported by other results, otherwise, I would recommend excluding it from the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your suggestion. To gain biological insights, we frequently associate mutational signatures with factors such as age, defective DNA mismatch repair, or environmental exposures. These remain associations rather than causation. Thus, we agree with the suggestion to weaken the conclusion as follows:</p>
<p>“Generally, exposure to tobacco smoking carcinogens (COSMIC signature 4) and chemicals such as BaP (Kucab signatures 49 and 20) were identified as the most significant contributing factors in both the XWLC and TSLC cohorts (Fig. 1f and 1g). In contrast, defective DNA mismatch repair (COSMIC signature ID: SBS6) was identified as the major contributor in both the TNLC and CNLC cohorts (Fig. 1h and 1i), with no potential chemicals identified based on signature similarities. Therefore, the XWLC and TSLC cohorts appear to be more explicitly associated with environmental carcinogens, while the TNLC and CNLC cohorts may be more associated with defective DNA mismatch repair processes.”</p>

<p>(6) It is not clear to me how PPIs were integrated with missense. Please clarify the method.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your suggestion. To identify interactions enriched with missense mutations, we constructed mutation-associated protein–protein interactomes (PPIs). Initially, we downloaded protein-protein interactomes from Interactome INSIDER (v.2018.2) (Meyer et al., 2018). Subsequently, we identified interfaces carrying missense mutations by mapping mutation sites to PPI interface genomic coordinates using bedtools (v2.25.0)(Quinlan and Hall, 2010). Finally, we defined oncoPPI as those PPIs significantly enriched in interface mutations in either of the two protein-binding partners across individuals. For more details, please refer to the methods sections “Building mutation-associated protein–protein interactomes” and “Significance test of PPI interface mutations.”</p>

<p>Line 157-158/Figure 1J for CYP1A1 displays protein concentrations while Figure 1K for AhR shows mRNA. Why this discrepancy? It would be preferable to show both mRNA and protein levels for both CYP1A1 and AhR. Also, there is a large discrepancy in the &quot;n&quot; between the normal and tumor groups, which makes the statistical comparison challenging. The AhR data is therefore unconvincing, and additional protein data is suggested. Thus the claim of significantly elevated AhR and CYP1A1 levels in tumors is not sufficiently supported and requires further investigation, both mRNA and protein, and with similarly sized sample groups.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your suggestion. We have thoroughly edited the revised manuscript, with all changes marked accordingly. Compared to mRNA level assessment, protein abundance is a better indicator of gene expression. Therefore, we reanalyzed the protein level of AhR for comparison and found no significant differences (Figure 1k). Additionally, the samples sequenced by mRNA-seq were not entirely consistent with those sequenced by label-free proteomics. The samples analyzed by different methods are shown in Figure 1d.</p>

<p>We appreciate your suggestion. CYP1A1 and AhR are two key regulators involved in BaP metabolism and signaling transduction, respectively. However, after examining the protein expression of AhR between tumor and normal tissues, we found no significant differences (Fig. 1k) and CYP1A1 has been proven to be highly expressed in tumor samples (Fig. 1j). Thus, we mainly examined the expression of CYP1A1 among the four subgroups. We changed our description as follows:</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. Figure 5 integrates transcriptomics (19182 genes), proteomics (9152 genes), and phosphoproteomics (5733 genes) data. In general, we utilized transcriptomics data to identify unique or distinct pathways among subgroups. Furthermore, proteomics and phosphoproteomics data were employed to validate key gene expressions, as they encompass fewer genes compared to transcriptomics data.</p>
<p>For instance, in Fig. 5a-d, we observed higher expression levels of mesenchymal markers such as VIM, FN1, TWIST2, SNAI2, ZEB1, ZEB2, and others in the MC-IV subtype using transcriptomics data (Fig. 5a). Additionally, we calculated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) scores using the ssGSEA enrichment method based on protein levels and conducted GSEA analysis using transcriptomics data (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, using proteomics data, we evaluated Fibronectin (FN1), an EMT marker that promotes the dissociation, migration, and invasion of epithelial cells, at the protein level (Fig. 5c), and β-Catenin, a key regulator in initiating EMT, also at the protein level (Fig. 5d). Overall, our findings indicate that the MC-IV subtype exhibits an enhanced EMT capability, which may contribute to the high malignancy observed in this subtype.</p>

You may wonder why these results are inconsistent. Discrepancies between mRNA and protein expression levels are common, and previous study showed that about 20% genes had a statistically significant correlation between protein and mRNA expression in lung adenocarcinomas (Chen et al., 2002). Post-transcriptional mechanisms, including protein translation, post-translational modification, and degradation, may influence the level of a protein present in a given cell or tissue. In this situation, we focused on identifying distinct biological pathways in each subgroup, supported by multi-omics data.</p>

<p>Line 321: MC-IV *potentially* possesses an enhanced EMT capability. This statement cannot be conclusively made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your suggestion. We changed our description as: “Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the MC-IV subtype is associated with enhanced EMT capability, which may contribute to the high malignancy observed in this subtype.”</p>

<p>Lines 325 and 327 indicated dysregulation of cell cycle processes and activation of CDK1 and CDK2 pathways based on KSEA analysis which is closely linked to cell cycle regulation as two separate pieces of evidence. However, these are both drawn from the phosphoproteomics, and likely indicate conclusions drawn from the same phosphosite data. Said another way, if phosphosite data indicates differences in kinases linked to cell cycle regulation then you would also expect phosphosite data to indicate dysregulation of cell cycle.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your suggestion. You mentioned that Fig. 4f and Fig. 5e redundantly prove that the CDK1 and CDK2 pathways are dysregulated. However, KSEA analysis in Fig. 4f estimates changes in kinase activity based on the collective phosphorylation changes of its identified substrates (Wiredja et al., 2017). In contrast, Fig. 5e directly evaluates the abundance of protein and phosphosite levels of CDK1 and CDK2 across subtypes. These analyses mutually confirm each other rather than being redundant.</p>

<p>Line 413/Figure 6b: While there may be a trend displayed by the figure, it is not convincing enough to state that MC-IV shows a conclusively distinguishable bacterial composition. Too much variability exists within groups MC-II and MC-III. However, it does show that MC-IV and MC-II have consistent composition within their groups, and that is interesting.</p>

<p>The Discussion is very brief. While it includes a discussion of the potential impact of the study, it does not include an analysis of the caveats/drawbacks of the study. A more thorough discussion of other studies focusing on the impacts of BaP exposure is also suggested as this was a highlighted point by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your suggestion. we have added discussion about the associations between BaP exposure and lung cancer and also talked about the shortcomings of our study as followings:</p>
<p>“Mechanistically, Qing Wang showed that BaP induces lung carcinogenesis, characterized by increased inflammatory cytokines, and cell proliferative markers, while decreasing antioxidant levels, and apoptotic protein expression(Wang et al., 2020). In our study, we used clinical samples and linked the mutational signatures of XWLC to the chemical compound BaP, which advanced the etiology and mechanism of air-pollution-induced lung cancer. In our study, several limitations must be acknowledged. Firstly, although our multi-omics approach provided a comprehensive analysis of the subtypes and their unique biological pathways, the sample size for each subtype was relatively small. This limitation may affect the robustness of the clustering results and the identified subtype-specific pathways. Larger cohort studies are necessary to confirm these findings and refine the subtype classifications. Secondly, although our study advanced the understanding of air-pollution-induced lung cancer by using clinical samples, the reliance on epidemiological data in previous studies introduces potential confounding factors. Our findings should be interpreted with caution, and further mechanistic studies are warranted to establish causal relationships more definitively. Thirdly, our in silico analysis suggested potential approach to drug resistence in G719X mutations. However, these predictions need to be validated through extensive in vitro and in vivo experiments. The reliance on computational models without experimental confirmation may limit the clinical applicability of these findings.”</p>
