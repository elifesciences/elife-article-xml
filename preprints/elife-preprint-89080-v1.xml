<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Biomineralization had apparently evolved independently in different phyla, using distinct minerals, organic scaffolds and gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, diverse eukaryotes from unicellular organisms, through echinoderms to vertebrates, use the actomyosin network during biomineralization. Specifically, the actomyosin remodeling protein, Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) regulates cell differentiation and gene expression in vertebrates’ biomineralizing cells, yet, little is known on ROCK’s role in invertebrates’ biomineralization. Here we reveal that ROCK controls the formation, growth and morphology of the calcite spicules in the sea urchin larva. ROCK expression is elevated in the sea urchin skeletogenic cells downstream of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signling. ROCK inhibition impairs the organization of F-actin around the spicules, disrupts skeletogenic gene expression and leads to skeletal loss. ROCK inhibition after spicule formation reduces spicule elongation rate and induces ectopic spicule branching. Reduced skeletal growth and enhanced branching are also observed under direct perturbations of the actomyosin network. Similar skeletogenic phenotypes are observed when ROCK is inhibited in a skeletogenic cell culture, indicating that these phenotypes are due to ROCK activity specifically in the skeletogenic cells. We propose that the actomyosin network was employed independently, downstream of distinct GRNs, to regulate biomineral growth and morphology across Eukaryotes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biomineralization is the process in which organisms from the five kingdoms of life, use minerals to produce shells, skeletons and teeth that protect and support them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Recent studies suggest that biomineralization evolved by the phylum specific co-option of ancestral gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that drove the construction of distinct organic scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) and by the evolution of specialized sets of biomineralization proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). This explanation is in line with the dissimilar GRNs and biomineralization proteins that drive biomineralization in different phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Yet, there are common cellular processes required for mineralization in highly diverse phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), suggesting that distinct upstream GRNs might have recruited common cellular and molecular mechanisms to drive biomineralization.</p>
<p>The actomyosin network was shown to play a role in biomineralization in various Eukaryote models, from unicellular organisms to vertebrates’ bones and teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). There is a tight association between actin filaments and the biomineralization compartment in diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and a highly dynamic actin organization that forms the biomineralization compartment in foraminifera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Perturbations of actin polymerization result with severely deformed shells and inhibition of shell shedding in coccolithophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). In vertebrates, Rho GTPases and Rho56 associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK), regulate chondrocytes, osteoblasts and odontoblasts differentiation and affect genes expression in these biomineralizing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). However, the roles of actomyosin remodeling in controlling mineral deposition and shaping biomineral morphology, are still unclear.</p>
<p>Sea urchin larval skeletogenesis provides an attractive model to study the role of the actomyosin network in biomineralization. Sea urchin larval skeletons are made of two frameworks of interconnected calcite rods, termed “spicules” that are generated by the skeletogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). To make the spicules, the skeletogenic cells form a ring with two lateral skeletogenic clusters and fuse through their filopodia forming a pseudopodia cable that links them into a syncytium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The mineral is concentrated in the form of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) inside intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). The vesicles are secreted into the biomineralization compartment generated in the skeletogenic cell clusters forming two triradiate spicules 68 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>)). The tubular biomineralization compartment, also called the spicule cavity, elongates within the pseudopodia cable by localized mineral deposition at the tip of each rod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>).</p>
<p>The GRN that controls sea urchin skeletogenesis is known in great detail and is highly similar to the GRN that controls vertebrates’ vascularization, suggesting a common evolutionary origin of these two tubulogenesis programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). As the spicules elongate, the expression of key regulatory and biomineralization related genes becomes restricted to the skeletogenic cells proximal to the growing tips, possibly to promote mineral deposition at these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Localized gene expression is regulated by signaling cues such as the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). However, how the skeletogenic GRN drives spicule formation and localized mineral deposition at the tips of the rods is poorly understood.</p>
<p>Previous works suggest that the actomyosin network is essential for sea urchin skeletal growth. Calcium bearing vesicles perform an active diffusion motion in the skeletogenic cells with a diffusion length that inversely correlates with the strength and activity of the actomyosin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Actin filaments are formed around the spicule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) and F84 actin signal is enriched at the tips of the growing skeletal rods in skeletogenic cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Genetic and pharmacological perturbations of the GTPase, CDC42, prevent the formation of filopodia in the skeletogenic cells and inhibit spicule formation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Pharmacological perturbations of ROCK prevent spicule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) and genetic perturbations of Rhogap24l/2 result with ectopic spicule splitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Despite these phenotypic characterizations, little is known on the regulation and role of the actomyosin network and remodeling proteins in localized mineral deposition.</p>
<p>Here we study the role of ROCK and the actomyosin network in the sea urchin <italic>Paracentraorus lividus (P. lividus)</italic>. Our findings reveal the critical role of ROCK and the actomyosin network in multiple aspects of sea urchin biomineralization, suggesting a common use of these factors in Eukaryote biomineralization, downstream of distinct GRNs.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>ROCK is enriched in the skeletogenic cells depending on VEGF signaling</title>
<p>We sought to study the spatial expression 98 of the ROCK protein and its regulation by VEGF signaling, a prominent regulator of sea urchin skeletogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). The sequence of ROCK and especially, its functional domains are highly conserved between human and sea urchin (Fig. S1, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>)). We therefore used a commercial antibody that recognizes human ROCK protein to test ROCK expression in <italic>P. lividus</italic> embryos (Fig. S2). We first used western blot to detect ROCK expression in control and under VEGFR inhibition at the time of spicule formation and during skeletal elongation (∼22 hours post fertilization [hpf], 27hpf and 33hpf, Fig. S2). The antibody detected a ∼150kDa protein (Fig. S2A) that is the predicted size for <italic>P. lividus</italic> ROCK protein (153kDa). VEGFR inhibition marginally increased the overall level of ROCK at 22hpf, but did not affect it at 27hpf and 33hpf (Fig. S2B). Yet, this measurement was done on proteins extracted from whole embryos, and we wanted to study the spatial expression of ROCK and specifically, its regulation in the skeletogenic cells.</p>
<p>We studied the spatial distribution of ROCK protein using ROCK antibody and the skeletal cell marker, 6a9, that marks the skeletogenic syncytium membrane ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We quantified ROCK signal in the skeletogenic cells compared to the neighboring ectodermal cells in control embryos and under VEGFR inhibition, at the three time points mentioned above. At 22hpf, ROCK expression in the skeletogenic cells is mildly enriched compared to the neighboring ectodermal cells and this enrichment is not observed under VEGFR inhibition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-F</xref>). At 27hpf, ROCK enrichment in the skeletogenic cells increases, but similar enrichment is observed under VEGFR inhibition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-L</xref>). At 33hpf, ROCK enrichment in the skeletogenic cells is most apparent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1M-O</xref>) and depends on VEGF signaling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1P-S</xref>). At both 27hpf and 33hpf in control embryos, ROCK seems localized near the skeletogenic cell membranes, which further supports its activation in these cells, since ROCK activation leads to its localization to the cell membranes in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Overall, this data demonstrate that ROCK expression is elevated in the skeletogenic cells and this enrichment strengthens with skeletal elongation and depends on VEGF signaling.</p>

<title>ROCK activity in the skeletogenic cells controls spicule initiation, growth and morphology</title>
<p>Next, we studied the role of ROCK in sea 128 urchin skeletogenesis using genetic perturbations. We downregulated the expression of ROCK by the injection of two different translation morpholino anti-sense oligonucleotides (MASOs). ROCK MASO-1 matches the start of translation region, ROCK MASO-2 matches the 5’ region upstream the start of translation, and random MASO was used as a control. Embryos injected with either ROCK MASO-1 or MASO-2 show strongly reduced skeletons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>) and embryos injected with ROCK MASO-2 show an additional phenotype of severely branched skeleton (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The additional branching phenotype and the larger percentage of affected embryos in ROCK MASO-2 are probably due to its higher efficiency resulting from its more 5’ location relative to translation start codon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Thus, the genetic perturbations of ROCK expression indicate that sea urchin ROCK is important for skeletal elongation and normal branching.</p>
<p>To elucidate the dependence of ROCK phenotypes on ROCK activity level and identify its effect on different stages of skeletogenesis, we tested the skeletogenic phenotypes of different concentrations of ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, applied before or after spicule initiation (Fig. S3A). Y27632 binds to the ATP site of ROCK’s kinase domain and prevents its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). The amino-acids to which Y27632 binds, are conserved in the sea urchin ROCK protein, supporting its specific inhibition of this protein (Fig. S1C). Continuous ROCK inhibition, beginning at egg fertilization, using 80μM Y27632, did not affect skeletogenic cell migration but eliminated skeletal formation at 27hpf (Fig. SB, C). At two days post fertilization (dpf) the majority of the embryos completely lack skeleton and the rest show only spicule initiations, yet their overall embryonic development seems normal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, S3I, in agreement with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>)). Similar results are observed when adding the inhibitor in this concentration at 20hpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>, S3I). Yet, the addition of 80μM of the inhibitor at 25hpf, after spicule initiation, results in a majority of embryos with severe ectopic spicule branching, which resembles the branching phenotype observed in ROCK MASO-2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>, I). Reducing the concentration of the added inhibitor leads to milder branching and elongation phenotypes (Fig. S3F, H, K). However, even at the lowest inhibitor concentration, we detect a reduction of skeletal growth rate and ectopic branching a few hours after the addition of ROCK inhibitor (Fig. S4, 30μM). Washing the inhibitor after 25hpf results in partial recovery of skeletogenesis, with normal or mildly delayed skeletons (Fig. S3E, K). Overall, our genetic and pharmacological perturbations indicate that ROCK activity is necessary for spicule formation, skeletal elongation and normal branching pattern.</p>

</fig>
<p>To test if ROCK skeletogenic phenotypes are due to its activity specifically in the skeletogenic cells, we inhibited ROCK in a culture of isolated skeletogenic cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J-N</xref>). The addition of ROCK inhibitor to the skeletogenic cell culture at 16hpf, before the spicules form, completely abolished spicule formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>). The addition of the inhibitor at 48hpf, after spicule formation, resulted with significantly shorter spicules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L, N</xref>) and increased branching compared to control spicules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2M</xref>). The reduction of the spicule length becomes more significant with increasing concentration of the ROCK inhibitor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2N</xref>). Overall, ROCK skeletogenic phenotypes in the isolated skeletogenic cell culture are similar to its phenotypes in whole embryos, verifying that it’s specific activity in the skeletogenic cells is essential for spicule formation, normal elongation and prevention of branching.</p>

<title>ROCK inhibition reduces spicule volume, surface area and total length, but not thickness (SR-µCT)</title>
<p>To quantify the effect of ROCK inhibition on mineral deposition and skeletal shape we used synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR-µCT) that enables three-dimensional visualization and quantification of spicule morphology at 2 and 3dpf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>, see methods for details). The aberrant morphology of ROCK inhibited spicules is visible at both developmental time points (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The ectopic branching occurs both at the tips where tip-splitting is detected (arrowheads, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), as well as in the back, where small spicule extensions, or mineral ‘dripping’ are observed (arrow at 48hpf, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). This implies that the regulation of mineral deposition is perturbed both at the tip and in the back of the spicules under ROCK inhibition.</p>

<p>When compared to control spicules, ROCK inhibition leads to a ∼2.5-fold reduction of the spicule volume and surface area in both 2 and 3dpf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-D</xref>, see Table S2 for measured values and standard deviations and S3 for statistical analyses). These SR-µCT measurements show that the rate of mineral deposition is significantly reduced under ROCK inhibition.</p>
<p>To understand the specific effect of ROCK inhibition on spicule elongation vs. thickening, we compared the total length and the mean thickness of the spicules between control and ROCK inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-G</xref>). The total length of control spicules was on average about 2.5-times longer than the length under ROCK inhibition in both 2dpf and 3dpf (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>, tables S2 and S3). In contrast to its effect on the spicule length, ROCK inhibition caused a minor increase of the spicule thickness at 2dpf and at 3dpf the thickness was not affected by the inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E, G</xref>, Tables S2, S3). These SR-µCT measurements indicate that ROCK activity plays a crucial role in controlling the rate of mineral deposition at the tips of the rods and in spicule elongation, and is not affecting spicule thickening.</p>

<title>ROCK activity does not control mineral uptake but is required for “tip-dominance”</title>
<p>To test the effect of ROCK inhibition on mineral intake, we used the fluorescent chromophore, calcein that binds to divalent ions including Ca<sup>+2</sup> and is widely used to track the calcium pathway in biomineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). We measured the number of calcein stained vesicles per area as well as the number of pixels of calcein signal per area in the skeletogenic cells, in control and under ROCK inhibition at 1dpf and 2dpf (Fig. S6A-E). Continuous ROCK inhibition does not change the number of calcium bearing vesicles at 1dpf, but the number of calcein stained pixels significantly increases in this condition, possibly indicting that the vesicle volume is larger (Fig. S6F, G). At 2dpf, the number of calcein stained pixels is similar in control and in continuous ROCK inhibition, suggesting that the overall calcium content does not change in this condition (Fig. S6H, I). The number of calcein stained vesicles is however decreased under ROCK inhibition, possibly indicating that there are fewer vesicles with larger volume. Addition of ROCK inhibitor at 25hpf affects neither the number of calcein stained vesicles nor the number of calcein stained pixels in the skeletogenic cells. Together, these measurements show that ROCK is not required for the uptake of calcium into the cells. Therefore, the skeletal phenotypes occurring under ROCK inhibition are not related to a decrease in calcium uptake or shortage in intracellular calcium, but are due to defects in mineral deposition.</p>
<p>To monitor the effect of ROCK inhibition on mineral deposition rate and distribution, we applied two pulses of different calcein dyes: blue calcein was added at 29hpf and washed after one hour, followed by green calcein added at 44hpf and washed after one hour. Hence, blue calcein marks the initial triradiate region and green calcein marks the edges of the spicules that were recently deposited (blue and green arrows in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H, I</xref>). The dye FM4-64 was used to mark the cell membranes. Under ROCK inhibition, the green labeled region is much closer to the blue labeled region compared to control, due to the reduction in skeletal elongation rate, in agreement with our SR-µCT measurements. However, while in control embryos each body rod has a single tip stained in green calcein, under ROCK inhibition one of the body rods has two tips and both are stained in green. This indicates that mineral is being deposited in both edges, and the mechanism that prevents the growth of multiple tips in each rod, enabling “tip-dominance”, (in analogy to plant stem apical dominance), is disrupted under ROCK inhibition.</p>

<title>The activity of the actomyosin network is essential for normal spicule elongation and inhibition of ectopic branching</title>
<p>In other systems, major roles of ROCK are to control F-actin polymerization and MyoII activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), hence we wanted to directly test the role of these actomyosin components in sea urchin skeletogenesis. To directly inhibit F-actin polymerization we used Latrunculin-A (Lat-A), that prevents the polymerization of actin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) and was shown to be effective in sea urchin embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). To directly inhibit actomyosin contractility we used Blebbistatin (Blebb), that interferes with MyoII ATPase activity, prevents actin-myosin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) and was shown to be effective in sea urchin embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). To prevent interference with the early cell divisions where the actomyosin network plays a critical role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), we added the inhibitors, individually or together, before or after spicule formation (20hpf and 25hpf, see methods for details). We tested the resulting phenotypes at 2dpf (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-G</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results indicate that F-actin polymerization and to a lesser extent, actomyosin contractility, are essential for normal skeletal growth and inhibition of ectopic branching. The majority of the embryos where MyoII activation was inhibited show mild ectopic branching mostly at the tips of the rods, and a minor delay in skeletal growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, C, G</xref>). The majority of the embryos where F-actin formation was inhibited show significant reduction of skeletal growth and severe ectopic skeletal branching (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref> and similar phenotypes to <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, statistics in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). In some embryos, additional spicules form (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F, G</xref>). The co-inhibition of F-actin polymerization and MyoII activity results in skeletogenic phenotypes that resemble, but are slightly stronger, than those of the inhibition of F-actin alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, G).</p>
<p>To test whether actin polymerization and myosin activity specifically in the skeletogenic cells underlies the observed skeletogenic phenotypes, we inhibit both in an isolated skeletogenic cell culture (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H-K</xref>). We added the inhibitors after the spicule formed (&gt;48hpf) and observed the phenotypes at 3dpf. Both inhibitors reduced skeletal growth, with Lantruculin-A having a significantly stronger effect than Blebbistatin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>), in agreement with the effect of these inhibitors in whole embryos. However, differently than in whole embryos, skeletal branching in both Lantruculin-A and Blebbistatin is not affected and is similar to the observed branching in control cultures. The absence of the branching phenotype in the skeletogenic cell culture could be due to the increased rigidity of the substrate that could compensate for the reduce actomyosin activity. Another option is that the branching phenotype in whole embryos could be due to the reduction of the activity of the actomyosin network in non-skeletogenic cells. Nevertheless, these results indicate that normal skeletal growth depends on F-actin polymerization and myosin contractility in the skeletogenic cells.</p>

<title>ROCK activity is required for F-actin organization around the forming spicule</title>
<p>Next, we tested whether ROCK regulates the actomyosin structure and activity during skeletal formation. To accomplish this we used phalloidin, a fluorophore that binds F-actin specifically, an antibody that detects phosphorylated MyoII (MyoIIP, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>)) and the skeletogenic marker, 6a9 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In control embryos, F-actin is detected around the tri-radiate calcite spicules at 27hpf (green arrow in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, in agreement with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>)). The pseudopodia cable that connects the skeletogenic cells shows lower F-actin signal compared to the signal around the spicule (blue line in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, C, E</xref> blue arrows in Fig. S7B, C, E). MyoIIP signal is not enriched in the skeletogenic cells nor in the spicule (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, S7D). Under continuous ROCK inhibition, the pseudopodia that connects the skeletogenic cells still forms (Fig. S7H) and F-actin accumulation is still observed in the lateral skeletogenic cell clusters; but unlike control embryos, F-actin is not organized and the spicule cavity is not formed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). MyoIIP signal seems unchanged by ROCK inhibition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>, S7I), in agreement with the weak and late phenotype of MyoII inhibition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>). These findings suggest that ROCK activity is essential for F-actin organization around the spicules, but not for the formation of the pseudopodia cable.</p>

<title>F-actin is enriched at the tips of the elongating spicules independently of ROCK activity</title>
<p>To assess the role of ROCK in actomyosin organization during skeletal elongation we compared F-actin and myoIIP signals between control embryos and embryos where ROCK inhibitor was added at 25hpf (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K-T</xref>, S7). At the prism stage, F-actin is enriched at the tips of the spicules in both control and ROCK inhibited embryos (white arrowheads in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5L, O</xref>). We quantified the F-actin signal at the tips compared to the back in both treatments (Fig. S7K, L, see methods for details). The phalloidin signal is on average 3-fold stronger at the tips of the spicules compared to the back, in both control and ROCK inhibition, indicating that F-actin enrichment at the tips is significant and independent of ROCK activity. In both control and ROCK inhibited embryos, the F-actin signal was markedly higher in the regions of the pseudopodia cable where the spicule cavity had formed, compared to the regions where the spicule cavity had not yet formed (blue arrows in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L-O, Q-T</xref>). We did not detect an enhanced signal of MyoIIP around the spicules or in the skeletogenic cells, in either condition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5N, S</xref>). At the pluteus stage, F-actin is enriched at the tips of the spicules in both control and ROCK inhibited embryos (white arrowheads in Fig. S7N-Q, S-V). Some non-skeletogenic cells that are enriched with MyoIIP signal are detected at this time (red arrowheads in Fig. S7N-P). Together these data demonstrate that F-actin coats the spicule cavity and is enriched at the tip of the rods, independently of ROCK activity.</p>
<p>We tested the effect of ROCK inhibition on F-actin in skeletogenic cell cultures. F-actin is detected at the tips, in both control cultures and cultures where ROCK was inhibited after spicule formation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5U, V</xref>). Yet, under ROCK inhibition, branching is enhanced and F-actin is enriched at the splitting tips of the spicule rods (Fig, 5V). The enrichment of F-actin at the splitting tips of the spicule under ROCK inhibition in skeletogenic cell culture resembles the calcein staining at the two tips in the embryo in this condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). These observation further supports the role of ROCK activity in regulating tip-dominance during sea urchin skeletogenesis.</p>

<p>Both continuous and late ROCK inhibition, strongly affect the spatial expression of key regulatory and biomineralization genes that are normally expressed differentially within the skeletogenic lineage at the pluteus stage (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6D-F</xref>, S8). These include, the VEGF receptor (VEGFR), the biomineralization genes <italic>SM50</italic> and <italic>SM30,</italic> skeletogenic transcription factors, Ets1, Alx1 and Erg1 that are essential for skeletogenic cell specification and biomineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) and the transcription factors Hex and MyoD1. In normal plutei these genes are differentially expressed within skeletogenic lineage, but in both continuous and late ROCK inhibition the expression of these genes becomes localized to the two lateral skeletogenic cell clusters and their vicinity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-F</xref>, S8). The lateral skeletogenic cells clusters are the cells where these genes are expressed in the gastrula stage (24-27hpf) and where spicule formation begins in normal embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The expression of VEGFR and SM50 under ROCK inhibition is more expanded than the other tested genes and is also observed at the anterolateral rods (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B, C</xref>).The VEGF ligand that is normally expressed in the ectodermal cells near the four tips of the post-oral and anterolateral rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), is expressed at four ectodermal domains near the lateral skeletogenic cell clusters and near the end of the anterolateral chain, under ROCK inhibition (Fig. S8G).</p>
<p>Overall, under ROCK inhibition, the expression of key regulatory and biomineralization genes is downregulated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) and remains localized to the area near the lateral skeletogenic cells clusters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-F</xref>, S8). This localization is despite the proper formation of the dorsal, anterolateral and mid-ventral chains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). This implies that ROCK activity provides regulatory cues to the skeletogenic GRN required for the dynamic progression of gene expression within the skeletogenic lineage.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Biomineralization is a complex morphogenetic process, encoded in the species genome and executed by the GRNs and the cellular machinery. Here we used the sea urchin larval skeletogenesis to investigate the role of ROCK and the actomyosin network in biomineral formation and in regulating gene expression, as we summarize in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. ROCK expression is enriched in the skeletogenic cells, partially depending on VEGF signaling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). ROCK activity in the skeletogenic cells is necessary for spicule formation, skeletal elongation and prevention of ectopic skeletal branching (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, S3, 4). Direct inhibition of F-actin polymerization results in similar but not identical skeletogenic phenotypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) and F-actin is organized around the spicule cavity and enriched at the spicule tips (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>, S7). ROCK activity feeds back into the skeletogenic GRN and affects regulatory and biomineralization gene expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Below we discuss our findings and their implications for the biological control and evolution of biomineralization.</p>

</fig>
<p>The first step in generating the sea urchin spicules is the construction of the spicule cavity, a membrane filled with calcium carbonate and coated with F-actin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). ROCK activity is necessary for the formation of the spicule cavity and for the organization of F-actin around it (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). A direct perturbation of F-actin polymerization strongly disrupts spicule growth and shape (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). F-actin is enriched in the regions of the pseudopodia cable that are filled with mineral, supporting its role in mineral deposition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Overall, our studies indicate that ROCK activity in the skeletogenic cells is essential for the formation of the spicule cavity and for the initial F-actin organization around it, which could be essential for mineral deposition into it (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>After the spicule cavity has formed, the spicules elongate inside the pseudopodia chord by mineral deposition at the tips of the spicule rods, which depends on ROCK activity and on F-actin polymerization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, S7, 7D-F). F-actin is detected along the spicules and is significantly enriched at the tips of the elongating spicules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, S7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>)). F-actin enrichment at the tips is independent on ROCK activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K-T</xref>, S7K, F), yet under ROCK inhibition and under the inhibition of F-actin polymerization, ectopic branching is observed at the tips and in the back (tip splitting and spicule dripping, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2J, N</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5V</xref>). The participation of F-actin and ROCK in polarized growth and vesicle exocytosis has been observed in both animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). F-actin is used for short range myosin trafficking of vesicles toward the secretion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). Once the secretory vesicle fuses with the membrane, it is coated with F-actin that stabilizes the vesicle and enables MyoII binding and ROCK-regulated contraction, necessary for content secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). In plant cells, F-actin accumulate at the growing tip of the cell and assists vesicle exocytosis necessary for polarized tip-growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Our observations suggest that ROCK, F-actin and MyoII could be regulating the localized exocytosis of mineral-bearing vesicles during sea urchin skeletogenesis. The delay in spicule growth and the ectopic branching could be due to impaired and misplaced vesicle trafficking and deposition under ROCK and F-actin inhibition, but the exact protein regulatory network is still to be determined.</p>
<p>ROCK activity is necessary for correct spatiotemporal expression of regulatory and biomineralization genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). ROCK inhibition downregulates the expression level of skeletogenic genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) and prevents the spatial progression of key skeletogenic genes toward the edges of the skeletal rods (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). In other systems, ROCK activity was shown to regulate gene expression through various intracellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Furthermore, ROCK has an important role in mechano-sensing of matrix rigidity and transducing it into changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Relatedly, stiff matrix activates ROCK in pre-osteoblastic cells, which activates Erk that leads to osteogenic differentiation and upregulation of osteogenic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Sea urchin ROCK could be sensing the spicule stiffness and transducing it into gene expression, providing a necessary feedback between spicule elongation and the skeletogenic GRN. Further studies are required to identify the specific molecular mechanisms activated by ROCK to affect gene expression in the skeletogenic cells.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings and the role of actomyosin remodeling in biomineralization, from calcifying and silicifying single cells to vertebrates’ bones and teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>), suggest that this molecular machinery is a part of the common molecular tool-kit of biomineralization. Most likely, the actomyosin network was employed independently, downstream of distinct GRNs across Eukaryotes, to control mineral growth and morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Western Blot</title>
<p>Embryo cultures treated with 150 nM Axitinib, or DMSO as control, were collected at 22hpf, 27hpf and 33hpf by centrifugation of 10,000g for 2 minutes. We lysed the pellet in 150µL lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8) with protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor cocktail w/o metal chelator; Sigma, P8340; 1:100) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM Na4P2O7, 1mM, βGP) as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). 40µg protein were loaded on 8% SDS-acrylamide gel, transferred to PVDF membranes for Western blot analysis. Anti-ROCK antibody (ab45171, Abcam) was used in a 1:300 dilution followed by anti-rabbit HRP secondary antibody diluted to 1:2500 (Jackson ImmunoResearch 111-035-003). For the loading control, the membrane was incubated with anti-β-tubulin antibody (1:5000; Sigma) followed by anti-mouse antibody 1:5000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch 115-035-003). Quantification of ROCK signal was done using Image studio lite vr. 5.2. ROCK signal was divided by Tubulin signal and then the ratio between ROCK/Tubulin in control vs. VEGFR inhibition was calculated. The graph in Fig. S2 was generated based on three biological replicates (different sets of parents) at 27hpf and 33hpdf and four biological replicates at 22hpf.</p>

<title>Quantification of Anti-ROCK and Phalloidin signal</title>
<p>A graphical program was written to allow manual quantification of the fluorescent signal from the spicule regions by identifying “stained” pixels per selected area. The ratio of stained anti-ROCK to region total area was compared between ectodermal and skeletogenic cells, and between control and VEGFR inhibited embryos at 22, 27 and 33hpf. The average ratios and ztest for significance difference from 1, are 22hpf control, ∼1.3, z=0.0006; VEGFR inhibition ∼1, z=0.5, 27hpf control ∼1.8, z&lt;10-11; VEGFR inhibition ∼1.6, z&lt;10-8, 33hpf control ∼4.6, z&lt;10-23; VEGFR inhibition ∼1.5, z&lt;10-5. For phalloidin analyses, embryos at 33hpf of control and ROCK inhibitor addition at 25hpf were used and for each image, two regions were selected: an area at the tip of the spicule and an area at the back of the spicule, about ∼10 microns apart. The ratio of stained phalloidin to region total area was compared between tip and back, in control and ROCK inhibited embryos. Paired t-test was used to compare the differences in phalloidin signal between the tip and back of the spicules across all groups and between control and ROCK inhibited embryos.</p>

<title>Synchrotron and lab-based SR-µCT</title>
<p>Dry and loose skeletal spicules prepared as described above, were used for the SR-µCT analysis. We analyzed 14 sets of spicules from three (control) and four (ROCK inhibited) pairs of parents, divided into four groups: 2dpf, control, n=44; 2dpf ROCK inhibited, n=93; 3dpf control, n=51; 3dpf ROCK inhibited, n=93, see Table S1). Spicules were glued to sharpened toothpick tips, either in bulk or individually when picked by hand by means of a brush bristle. Each toothpick loaded with spicules, was mounted on a 3ml vial twist-off lid and for transportation securely stored in the vial (Fig. S5A, B). For each set 2-3 µCT-samples were prepared, which allowed the acquisition of statistically relevant sample sizes (40+ spicules/group, Table S1). Tomographic data sets were acquired using the following scanning parameters; for the lab based µCT (RX Solutions, Chavanod, France) 90kV, 143-160µA, 1440 images, average frames 10, frame rates 0.4-1, voxel sizes: 0.45-59µm; and for the synchrotron radiation µCT (Anatomix, Synchrotron SOLEIL, Gif-sur-Yvette, France) 2048 images, angle between projections 0.09°, voxel size: 0.65µm. Tomographic data reconstruction was performed with commercial (RX Solutions, Chavanod, France) and PyHST2 software (A. Mirone et al., Nucl. Instrum. Meth.

<title>Three-dimensional (3D) data analysis</title>
<p>Data visualization, pre-processing including cropping and image type conversion to 16bit (of the Sr-µCT data), and user-augmented segmentation of intact spicules were performed in Amira using off-the-shelf modules (Fig. S5C-E, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>)). Volume and area measurements were performed on the segmented spicules, <italic>i.e.</italic> the label-fields using Amira’s material.statistics module (Volume3D and Area3D). Average spicule thickness and total length measurements were performed with python code, utilizing available python libraries (<italic>e.g.</italic>, skimage, skan, scipy). The code was applied to 3D-tif files created from Amira’s label-fields, which contained the segmented spicules. For length measurements, the spicules were skeletonized and the chord lengths of the branches forming a spicule-skeleton were summed up to obtain the total spicule length. For thickness measurements, we performed Euclidean distance transforms for each spicule using scipy’s ndimage.morphology.distance_transform_edt package, and calculated the average spicule thickness based on the distance measurements obtained at each voxel from spicule-skeleton to the nearest spicule surface. Quality control of our measurements was performed with open source software, Fiji and available plugins (e.g. BoneJ, FiberJ, DiameterJ).</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> paper addresses a notable problem, the cell biological control of biomineralization, with the sea urchin embryo as an experimental model. The paper provides evidence that ROCK and the cytoskeleton play a role in biomineralization, but the evidence is deemed currently <bold>incomplete</bold>, as there are concerns regarding the efficacy and specificity of the reagents used to perturb ROCK function. In addition, the data do not point to a plausible mechanism by which the actin cytoskeleton might regulate the biomineralization process.</p>

<p>Using a pharmacological and knock-down approach, the authors could demonstrate that ROCK activity is required for the normal development of the larval skeleton. The presence of ROCK in the pluteus stage depends on the activity of VEGF that is responsible for the formation of the tubular syncytial sheath of the calcifying primary mesenchyme cells in which the skeleton forms. The importance of ROCK in skeleton formation was confirmed in cell culture experiments, demonstrating that ROCK inhibition leads to decreased elongation and abnormal branching of spicules. µCT analyses underline this finding demonstrating that the inhibition of ROCK mainly affects the elongation of spicules while growth in girth is little affected. F-actin labeling experiments could demonstrate that ROCK inhibition interferes with the organization of the actomyosin network in the early phase of skeleton formation, while f-actin organization in the tips of the elongating spicule is unaffected by the pharmacological inhibition of ROCK. Finally, ROCK inhibition strongly affects the expression of major regulatory and calcification-related genes in the calcifying cells. Based on these findings the authors propose a model for the regulatory interaction between the skeletogenic GRN, ROCK, and the f-actin system relevant for skeletogenesis.</p>
<p>I reviewed this paper previously for submission to another Journal. I emphasize again, that this is an interesting and important work that aims to uncover the interaction between the Rho-associated Kinase, ROCK, the actomyosin network, and its relevance for the formation of the calcitic skeleton of the sea urchin larva. I carefully went through the revised manuscript. In their new version, the authors rearranged the figures to provide a more direct comparison between the in vivo and cell culture experiments which mitigates the criticism of collateral effects by the inhibitors on the whole organism. The authors also performed an additional experiment localizing the F-Actin signal in spicules of PMC cell cultures under ROCK inhibition. This experiment strengthens the concept that ROCK activity is important for tip dominance rather than CaCO3 deposition rates. The results section was substantially reorganized and only very minor changes were made to the introduction and discussion.</p>
<p>I think that this work has great potential to provide seminal insights into an understudied aspect of the biomineralization process - the role and regulation of the cytoskeleton in calcifying cells. As I mentioned in my previous review there are some gaps in this work that need to be answered to provide a conclusive dataset on the role of ROCK and the actomyosin system in the mineralization process. The manuscript in its current form provides evidence for the interaction of ROCK with the actomyosin system in the sea urchin larva and that perturbation of this system affects skeletogenesis. However, it is missing an explanation regarding the mechanism by which ROCK affects skeleton formation. No difference in f-actin localization was found at the spicule tips in control and ROCK-inhibited larvae. A slight hint was found in the difference in vesicle size and f-actin organization within calcifying cells, but it remains unresolved if ROCK activity impacts the trafficking of calcification vesicles. The authors provide an interesting discussion on the involvement of f-actin and ROCK on vesicular trafficking, and exocytosis based on existing knowledge from animal and plant models. But for the sea urchin larva, this important link between ROCK, f-actin, and the biomineralization process remains unanswered. In their previous work by Winter et al. 2021, the authors demonstrated excellent technologies to monitor vesicular dynamics in the calcifying cells. This tool would be ideal to investigate the role of ROCK and the actomyosin network on the trafficking dynamics of Ca2+-rich vesicles. These experiments (among others suggested in the following review) may help to uncover the critical mechanism to resolve the missing gap in this manuscript.</p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>
One MASO led to reduced skeleton formation while the other one additionally induced ectopic branching. How was the optimum concentration for the MASOs determined? Did the authors perform a dose-response curve? What is the reason for this difference? Which of the two MASOs can be validated by reduced ROCK protein abundance? Since the ROCK antibody works, I would like to see a control experiment on Rock protein abundance in control and ROCK MO injected larvae which is the gold-standard for validating the knock-down.</p>
<p>L212 &quot;Together, these measurements show that ROCK is not required for the uptake of calcium into cells.&quot; But what about trafficking and exocytosis? As mentioned earlier, I think this is a really important point that needs to be confirmed to understand the function of ROCK in controlling calcification. In their previous study (reference 45) the authors demonstrated that they have superior techniques in measuring vesicle dynamics in vivo. Here an acute treatment with the ROCK inhibitor would be sufficient to test if calcein-positive vesicle motion, including the observed reduction in velocity close to the tissue skeleton interface, is affected by the inhibitor.</p>
<p>Is there a colocalization of ROCK and f-actin in the tips of the spicules? This would support the mechano-sensing-hypothesis by ROCK.</p>
<p>L 283. &quot;F-actin is enriched at the tips of the spicules independently of ROCK activity&quot; The results of this paragraph clearly demonstrate that ROCK inhibition has no effect on the localization of f-actin at the tips of the growing spicules. In addition, the new cell culture experiments underline this observation. Still, the central question that remains is, what is the interaction between ROCK, f-actin, and the mineralization process, that leads to the observed deformations? What does the f-actin signal look like in a branched phenotype or in larvae that failed to develop a skeleton (inhibition from Y20)?</p>
<p>Immunohistochemical analyses on f-actin localization and abundance should be additionally performed with ROCK knock-down phenotypes to confirm the pharmacological inhibition.</p>
<p>L 365 &quot;...supporting its role in mineral deposition...&quot; &quot;...Overall, our studies indicate that ROCK activity....is essential for the formation of the spicule cavity......which could be essential for mineral deposition...&quot; I think the authors need to do a better job in clearly separating between the potential processes impacted by ROCK perturbation. Is it stabilization and mechano-sensing in the spicule tip or the intracellular trafficking and deposition of the ACC? If the dataset does not allow for a definite conclusion, I suggest clearly separating the different possibilities combined with thorough discussion-based findings from other mineralizing systems where the interaction between ROCK and F-actin has been described.</p>

<p>This manuscript reports on the role of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) in biomineralization of sea urchin larval skeletons. A number of experiments examine the initiation, growth, and patterning of the skeleton in an effort to determine if, and how, ROCK participates in skeletal formation. The authors conclude that ROCK controls the formation, growth, and morphology (patterning) of the skeleton based on a number of inhibition studies. The main target of the experiments is the actomyosin cytoskeleton which has been the focus of many ROCK studies in vertebrates. Based on similar experimental outcomes when comparing the results here with published data from vertebrates, they suggest that ROCK and the actomyosin network operate in a similar way in biomineralization despite independent evolutionary origins of the sea urchin larval skeletons and the skeletons of vertebrates.</p>
<p>My concerns are the interpretation of the experiments. The main overriding concern is a possible over-interpretation of the role of ROCK. In the literature that ROCK participates in many biological processes with a major contribution to the actin cytoskeleton. And when a function is attributed to ROCK, it is usually based on the determination of a protein that is phosphorylated by this kinase. Here that is not the case. The observation here is in most cases stunted growth of the spicule skeleton and some mis-patterning occurs or there is an absence of skeleton if the inhibitor is added prior to initiation of skeletal growth. They state in the abstract that ROCK impairs the organization of F-actin around the spicules. The evidence for that as a direct role is absent. They use morpholino data and ROCK inhibitor data to draw their conclusion. My main concern is the concentration of the inhibitor used since at the high concentrations used, the inhibitor chosen is known to inhibit other kinases as well as ROCK (PKA and PKC). They indicate that this inhibition is specifically in the skeletogenic cells based on the isolation of skeletogenic cells in culture and spicule production either under control or ROCK inhibition and they observe the same - stunting and branching or absence of skeletons if treated before skeletogenesis commences. Again, however, the high concentrations are known to inhibit the other kinases. They use blebbistatin and latrunculin and show that these known inhibitors of actin cytoskeleton lead to abnormal spiculogenesis, This coincidence is suggestive but is not proof that it is ROCK acts on the actomyosin cytoskeleton given the specificity concerns.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for selecting our paper for peer review and for the thorough evaluation of our manuscript. We appreciate your assessment and the reviewers’ comments that value our work and identify important points that will enable us to improve the paper. We are now working on key experiments to further test the hypothesis that ROCK is essential for the formation, growth, and morphology of the sea urchin larval skeleton. We will address the reviewers’ comments in detail in the revised version of the paper that we will submit after completing the experiments, but for now, there are two points we would like to clarify.</p>
<p>We thank the first reviewer for the appreciation of this paper and of our previous work where we studied calcium vesicle dynamics in whole embryos (Winter et al, Plos Com Biol 2021). In Winter et al 2021, we found that the skeleton (spicules) doesn’t grow when the embryos are immobilized in either control or treated embryos. As a consequence, we cannot determine the role of ROCK in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis based on experiments conducted in whole embryos. We are developing an alternative assay for vesicle tracking using cell cultures, but that is beyond the scope of this current work.</p>
<p>As for the second reviewer’s criticism of the usage of Y-27632 to block ROCK activity: The ROCK inhibitor concentrations we used (30-80µM) are similar the those commonly used in mammalian systems and in Drosophila to block ROCK activity, for example: (Becker et al., 2022; Canellas-Socias et al., 2022; Fischer et al., 2009; Kagawa et al., 2022; Segal et al., 2018; Su et al., 2022). The manufactory datasheet indicates that: “Y-27632 dihydrochloride is a selective ROCK inhibitor (Ki values are 0.14-0.22, 0.3, 25, 26 and &gt; 250 μM for ROCK1 (p160 ROCK), ROCK2, PKA, PKC and MLCK respectively)”. That is, the affinities of Y-27632 for ROCK kinases are at least <italic>100 times higher</italic> than those for PKC, PKA, and MLCK. Furthermore, these Ki values are based on biochemistry assays where the activity of the inhibitor is tested in-vitro with the purified protein. Therefore, these concentrations are not relevant to cell or embryo cultures where the inhibitor has to penetrate the cells and affect ROCK activity in-vivo. Y-27632 activity was studied both in-vitro and in-vivo in Narumiya, Ishizaki and Ufhata, Methods in Enzymology 2000 (Narumiya et al., 2000). This paper reports similar concentrations to the ones indicated in the manufactory data sheet for the in-vitro experiments, but shows that 10µM concentration or higher are effective in cell cultures. As stated above, we will add additional experimental verifications to the revised version, but even at this stage, the concentrations we used and the agreement between our pharmacological and genetic perturbations suggests that the affected protein is indeed ROCK.</p>
<p>We share the reviewers and editors wish to identify the molecular targets of ROCK and the specific cellular processes that ROCK is involved in, and we are actively working on achieving this goal. However, we believe that this paper is an important step towards illuminating the cellular components that participate in biomineral construction and the feedback between the cellular machinery and gene expression.</p>
