<title>Abstract</title><p>Recent studies have shown that, in human cancer cells, the tetrameric Shieldin complex (comprising REV7, SHLD1, SHLD2, and SHLD3) facilitates non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) while blocking homologous recombination (HR). Surprisingly, several eukaryotic species lack SHLD1, SHLD2 and SHLD3 orthologs, suggesting that Rev7 may leverage an alternative mechanism to regulate the double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway choice. Exploring this hypothesis, we discovered that <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Rev7 physically interacts with the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) subunits, impedes G-quadruplex DNA synergised-HU-induced toxicity and facilitates NHEJ, while antagonizing HR. Notably, we reveal that a 42-amino acid C-terminal fragment of Rev7 binds to the subunits of MRX complex, protects <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells from G-quadruplex DNA-HU-induced toxicity, and promotes NHEJ by blocking HR. By comparison, the N-terminal HORMA domain, a conserved protein–protein interaction module, was dispensable. We further show that the full-length Rev7 impedes Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities without affecting the latter’s ATP-binding ability. Combined, these results provide unanticipated insights into the functional interaction between the MRX subunits and Rev7 and highlight a mechanism by which Rev7 facilitates DSB repair via NHEJ, and attenuation of HR, by blocking Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A hallmark of low fidelity DNA polymerases, also known as DNA translesion synthesis polymerases (TLS polymerases), with no detectable proofreading activity, is their ability to catalyse DNA synthesis across a variety of bulky, helix-distorting DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Prakash et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Vaisman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Maiorano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ling et al., 2022</xref>). The TLS polymerases are also involved in a plethora of cellular processes, including but not limited to epigenetics, immune signalling, viral mutagenesis and cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Paniagua and Jacobs, 2023</xref>). Indeed, translesion DNA synthesis is a source of mutagenesis, potentially contributing to the development of cancer and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lange et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baranovskiy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Pilzecker et al., 2019</xref>). The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> TLS Polζ (henceforth referred to as ScPolζ) is a four-subunit enzyme, comprised of catalytic subunit Rev3, two regulatory subunits of Rev7 and the accessory subunits Pol31 and Pol32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Makarova et al., 2012</xref>). Current evidence suggests that the error rate during ScPolζ-catalysed replication of undamaged DNA templates is much higher than that of DNA polymerases, as it lacks 3′-to-5′ proofreading exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lawrence et al., 1985a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">1985b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Huang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Northam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Zhong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kochenova et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this, <italic>S. cerevisiae rev3, rev7</italic> or <italic>pol32</italic> mutant strains show greatly reduced spontaneous mutation frequencies, confirming that ScPolζ is responsible for DNA damage-induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Quah et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lawrence et al., 1985a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">1985b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Morrison et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Nelson et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The TLS Polζ exists in a wide range of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, including fungi, plants, and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Maiorano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ling et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Paniagua and Jacobs, 2023</xref>). While the catalytic subunit Rev3 alone is capable of replicating damaged DNA, Rev7 enhances its catalytic efficiency by twenty-to thirtyfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Quah et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Morrison et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Nelson et al., 1996</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>) and the accessory subunits Pol31 and Pol32 further raise it by three-to tenfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Makarova et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that they abet the processivity of translesion DNA synthesis by Polζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acharya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bezalel-Buch et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, Rev7 (also known as MAD2B and MAD2L2) is an adapter protein, which acts as a bridge between Rev3 and Rev1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Haracska et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kikuchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Pustovalova et al., 2012</xref>). Various structural and biochemical investigations have uncovered unique structural features of Polζ, wherein its subunits interact with each other to form an highly proficient, multi-subunit TLS holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gómez-Llorente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Malik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Du Truong et al., 2021</xref>). The high-resolution cryo-EM structures of ScPolζ holoenzyme have revealed that the subunits Rev3, Rev7, Pol31, and Pol32 assemble into a pentameric ring-shaped structure in which they are maintained by a chain of uninterrupted protein-protein interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gómez-Llorente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Malik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Du Truong et al., 2021</xref>). Precise details of how Polζ holoenzyme achieves its substrate specificity have not been fully understood. Shedding light on this, A. Aggarwal’s lab has recently provided insights into the mechanism by which the active site of ScPolζ responds to the A:C mismatched duplex DNA distortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Malik et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>A flurry of research has documented that the tetrameric Shieldin complex – comprising REV7, SHLD1, SHLD2 and SHLD3 – binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), blocks 5′ end resection and homologous recombination (HR), antagonizes the recruitment of BRCA1 to the DSB, while facilitating non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boersma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Mirman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Findlay et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Tomida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Noordermeer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). Investigations have also shown that the N-terminus of SHLD3 interacts with REV7 using a stereotypical “safety-belt” interaction mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Tomida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Noordermeer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Liang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Clairmont et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dai et al., 2020</xref>). In the alternative pathway, Shieldin-53BP1-RIF1 counteracts DSB resection and recruits the CST-Polα-primase complex to promote fill-in at the resected DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Mirman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">2023</xref>). Cells derived from Fanconi anaemia patients, caused by biallelic <italic>REV7</italic> mutations, display hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, accumulate chromosome breaks during S/G2 phase of the cell cycle and activation of the p53/p21 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bluteau et al., 2016</xref>), revealing its critical role in providing protection against FA disease. It is worth pointing out that Rev7 inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex by sequestering Cdh1, and modulates the transition from metaphase to anaphase, thereby contributing to mitotic fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Listovsky and Sale, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Vaisman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ling et al., 2022</xref>). However, a mechanistic understanding of how Rev7 regulates cell cycle events and how such roles differ or relate to its role in TLS remains underexplored. Although the emphasis of the findings differ, the fact that Rev7 functions as an anti-resection factor has spurred a new wave of experiments on DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Setiaputra and Durocher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Clairmont and D’Andrea, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>At DSBs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Mre11–Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) in conjunction with Sae2 first catalyses endonucleolytic cleavage of 5′-terminated DNA strands and then its 3’→5’ exonucleolytic activity produces a short 3’-ssDNA overhang, which is followed by resection in a 5′→3′ direction by either Exo1 or Dna2–Sgs1 complex to produce long tracks of ssDNA that are critically important for HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>). As such, the mechanism by which cells restrain over-resection of DSBs remains incompletely understood, although hyper-resection could potentially hinder optimal HR and trigger genomic instability. Surprisingly, however, Shieldin orthologs are absent in different organisms such as yeast, fruit fly, nematode worm, zebrafish and frog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Setiaputra and Durocher, 2019</xref>). Consequently, we hypothesized that Rev7 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (hereafter referred to as ScRev7) may recruit an unknown functional equivalent(s) of Shieldin orthologs to regulate the DSB repair pathway choice between HR and NHEJ. Thus, an alternative mechanism might involve the MRX complex on the basis of current knowledge that it plays multiple roles in signalling, processing and repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>). In this study, we provide robust evidence that ScRev7, via its 42-aminoacid C-terminal fragment in the “safety belt” region, physically interacts with the Mre11, Rad50 or Xrs2 subunits, protects <italic>rev711</italic> cells from G-quadruplex DNA/HU-induced toxicity and facilitates DSB repair via NHEJ while antagonizing HR. Mechanistic studies revealed that ScRev7 binds to the MRX subunits with sub-micromolar affinity, attenuates Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities, without affecting the ability of the latter to bind ATP. Collectively, our findings not only provide evidence for functional interaction between Rev7 and the MRX subunits, but also reveal novel insights into how Rev7 regulates the pathway choice between HR and NHEJ in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

<title>ScRev7 interacts with the MRX subunits</title>
<p>As noted above, studies in cancer cells have shown that the Rev7-Shieldin effector complex facilitates NHEJ by blocking 5′ end resection and HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boersma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Mirman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Findlay et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>). Since there are no identifiable Shieldin orthologs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Setiaputra and Durocher, 2019</xref>), we began our investigations with a hypothesis that Rev7 may recruit alternative factors such as the MRX subunits to block HR and enable NHEJ. To this end, yeast two-hybrid assay (Y2H) was leveraged for the purpose of studying binary protein-protein interactions between ScRev7 and the subunits of MRX complex, whereas in follow-up studies we mapped the minimal region of ScRev7 required for its association with the MRX subunits. The yeast strain PJ69-4A was co-transformed with plasmids (prey vectors) encoding the Mre11, Rad50 or Xrs2 subunits fused to GAL4 activation domain and ScRev7 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (bait vector). The positive colonies were selected on SC/-Trp-Leu-His dropout nutrient medium containing 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fields and Song, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">James et al., 1996</xref>). Remarkably, we found interactions between Rev7 and the Mre11, Rad50 and Xrs2 subunits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), whereas cells bearing empty vector and a plasmid expressing Mre11, Rad50 or Xrs2 subunits did not. Consistent with results from prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Rizzo et al., 2018</xref>), yeast cells transformed with prey and bait vectors expressing Rev7 showed robust growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating the assembly of Rev7 homodimers, which served as a positive control. In an analogous experiment, cells co-transformed with bait and prey vectors expressing Sae2 and Rev7, respectively, failed to grow in different strain backgrounds (bottom panel of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>), indicating lack of binary interaction between Sae2 and Rev7. Collectively, these results confirmed the binding specificity of Rev7 to the subunits of MRX complex.</p>

<p>Given that Rev3 has also been implicated in HR-mediated DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Sonoda et al., 2003</xref>), we asked whether the MRX subunits interact with ScRev7 in the <italic>rev3</italic>11 mutant strain. To address this question, the <italic>S. cerevisiae rev3</italic>11 strain was co-transformed with a combination of bait (pGBKT7 or pGBKT7-<italic>REV7</italic>) and prey vectors (pGADT7, pGADT7-<italic>REV7</italic>, pGADT7-<italic>MRE11</italic>, pGADT7-<italic>RAD50,</italic> pGADT7-<italic>XRS2 or</italic> pGADT7<italic>-SAE2</italic>). Interestingly, we observed binary interactions between the subunits of MRX complex and ScRev7 in the <italic>rev3</italic>11 mutant in the Y2H system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that Rev3 is dispensable for the binding of ScRev7 to the MRX subunits.

<title>ScRev7 physically interacts with the MRX subunits</title>
<p>Microscale thermophoresis (MST) allows for quantitative analysis of protein-protein interactions in free solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Wienken et al., 2010</xref>). Since the binding of ScRev7 to the MRX subunits was unanticipated, we sought to validate their interaction by an orthogonal assay and determine their binding affinities using purified proteins. To this end, we purified eGFP-tagged ScRev7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), confirmed its identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and leveraged MST titration approach to measure its binding affinity to purified Mre11, Rad50, Xrs2 and Rev1 subunits, and also to the Mre11-Rad50 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). The MST signals were plotted as a function of ligand concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A-F</xref>). Normalized MST data were fitted to a logistic binding curve, resulting in an apparent dissociation constants (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>) of 0.16 ± 0.07, 0.23 ± 0.06 and 0.18 ± 0.03 μM for Rad50, Mre11 subunits and Mre11-Rad50 complex, respectively, which is two-to threefold greater as compared with Xrs2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rev1 was used as a positive control to ensure the accuracy of the Y2H assay. The binding kinetics measured demonstrated that purified Rev1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) bound to Rev7 with an affinity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>), comparable to previously reported value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Rizzo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Guo et al., 2003</xref>). On the other hand, negative controls such as purified Sae2 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1— figure supplement 1E</xref>) and eGFP showed no significant binding to the MRX subunits and GFP-tagged Rev7, respectively (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3F</xref>). We next tested the affinity of Rev7-C1 for the Mre11, Rad50 and MR complex. The results showed that Rev7C1 binds to Mre11 with approximately 3-fold reduced affinity and to the Rad50 and MR complex with 10-fold reduced affinity (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Collectively, these results confirm the specificity of interaction between Rev7 and the MRX subunits. It is also noteworthy that the Hill coefficients (n<sub>H</sub>) indicate larger than one, implying positive cooperativity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).

<title>A 42-aminoacid C-terminal segment of Rev7 is critical for its interaction with the MRX subunits</title>
<p>Since the data obtained from the Y2H screening system and MST based protein-protein interaction assay suggested pairwise association between the subunits of MRX complex and Rev7, we sought to identify the functional domain(s) in the ScRev7 required for interaction with the MRX subunits. For this purpose, we generated three N-terminally truncated and an equal number of C-terminally truncated variants. We refer to these variants as Rev7-N1; Rev7-N2; Rev7-N3, and Rev7-C1, Rev7-C2 and Rev7-C3, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We then asked whether these variants bind to the MRX subunits and enable the growth of yeast cells on selection nutrient medium. Our experiments surprisingly revealed that cells expressing the ScRev7 N-terminally truncated variants showed robust cell growth (bottom panel of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) similar to the WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>), indicating that they interact with the subunits of MRX complex. Further, these results indicated that the Rev7’s N-terminal HORMA domain (residues 1-149), an evolutionarily conserved protein–protein interaction module, is dispensable for binding to the MRX subunits (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Notwithstanding, we do not exclude the possibility that it may play a role that is undetectable by the Y2H assay.</p>
<p>Next, we performed Y2H experiments using the C-terminally truncated species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and found that deletion of C-terminal forty-two amino acid residues (i.e., 203-245) resulted in loss of cell proliferation and growth (bottom panel of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, deletion of the C-terminal 150 to 203 amino acid residues of ScRev7 abrogated yeast cell growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). These results indicate that the C-terminal 42-residue segment of ScRev7 is critical for its interaction with the MRX subunits. To further confirm these results, an Y2H experiment was carried out with cells co-expressing 42 aa peptide and the Mre11, Rad50 or Xrs2 subunits. Such an analysis showed that the ScRev7’s 42 residue peptide alone was sufficient for interaction with each subunit of the MRX complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, it remained possible that the inability of cells expressing the C-terminally truncated variants of ScRev7 (with appropriate prey proteins) to grow in selection medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, bottom panel</xref>) may be due to altered expression or decreased abundance of truncated species. To explore this possibility, whole cell lysates derived from cells expressing the N– and C-terminally truncated variants, tagged with c-Myc epitope at the N-terminus, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-c-Myc antibody. Reassuringly, the results revealed comparable levels of N– and C-terminally truncated species of ScRev7 in the whole cell lysates of strains that were employed for Y2H analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Models predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer reveal that Mre11 and Rad50 subunits independently associate with Rev7</title>
<p>To further characterize the interaction between the MRX subunits and ScRev7, a structure prediction algorithm, AF2-multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Evans et al., 2022</xref>), was leveraged to construct structural models of ScRev7-Mre11 and ScRev7-Rad50 heterodimers. The models with the high pLDDT scores were considered for further analysis. Strikingly, the models indicated that Mre11 and Rad50 binding surfaces overlap with ScRev7, suggesting that the latter can bind these subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the model of Rev7-Mre11 complex, residues Asp 206 and Ile 240 in the Rev7 C-terminal “safety belt region” (green) mediate dimerization with Mre11 through residues Asp 131 and Arg 181. Interestingly, His 127 in the Rev7 N-terminal HORMA domain also contribute its binding to Asp 131 of Mre11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Furthermore, modelling studies of Rev7-Rad50 complex showed that the ScRev7 C-terminal residues Lys 168, Glu 184, Asn 189 and Asp 188 mediate dimerization with ScRad50 via residues Glu 577, Lys 596 and Arg 603 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Curiously, the AF2-multimer models also revealed that amino acid residues outside of the 42-residue fragment also contribute to pairwise interactions between Rev7 and the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits, although Y2H assays did not identify such interaction. Indeed, similar findings have been previously noted for several other interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">You et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Koegl and Uetz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hoff et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>The Rev7’s C-terminal 42-residue fragment mitigates the G-quadruplex-HU induced toxic effects</title>
<p>Several studies have documented the genome-wide prevalence of G-quadruplex DNA structures in various organisms ranging from viruses to humans, which play regulatory roles in diverse cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Rhodes and Lipps, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Spiegel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Yadav et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, it has been shown that Rev1-deficient chicken DT40 cells exhibit defects in replicating G quadruplex-forming motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Sarkies et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">2012</xref>). Similarly, computational and genetic studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have revealed that G-quadruplex-forming motifs cause slow growth in replication stressed Pif1-deficient cells and affect genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Capra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Paeschke et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">2013</xref>). Inspired by these findings, we sought to understand whether ScRev7 plays a role in genome maintenance using the assay developed by the V. Zakian’s lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Paeschke et al., 2011</xref>). We first compared the viability of <italic>rev7</italic>11 mutant cells devoid of exogenous G-quadruplex forming sequences with that of WT under conditions of optimal growth and HU-induced replication stress. This analysis revealed that, like the WT, <italic>rev7</italic>11 mutant cells grew robustly in the absence or presence of HU (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we next sought to determine whether the G-quadruplex DNA motifs affect cell viability in the absence and presence of HU. To address this question, we tested the effect of exogenous G-quadruplex forming sequences, positioned on either the leading or lagging template strands, on the viability of WT and <italic>rev7</italic>11 mutant strains, relative to cells expressing the ScRev7 variants (Rev7-C1 or 42-residue C-terminal peptide) on SC/-Leu medium lacking HU. We found that all strains used in this experiment showed comparable growth phenotypes on this medium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>rev7</italic>11 mutant and the strains expressing the variant Rev7-C1 were highly sensitive to exposure to HU when compared to the wild type cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Remarkably, however, cells expressing the Rev7’s 42-residue C-terminal peptide exhibited robust growth in the same medium containing HU (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Combining the results presented, we suggest that the 42-residue C-terminal peptide, but not Rev7-C1 variant, confers protection to cells from the toxic effects of HU/G-quadruplex DNA forming sequences, regardless of whether they occur in the leading or lagging template strands.</p>

To further explore the functional significance of complex formation between Rev7 and Mre11, ScRev7 and its truncated derivative ScRev7-C1 were expressed in and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> whole cell lysates to homogeneity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). We then performed an experiment in which equimolar amounts of MRX subunits were incubated with 5’-<sup>32</sup>P-labelled dsDNA in the presence or absence of ScRev7. The reaction products were analyzed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ghosal and Muniyappa, 2005</xref>). The results informed that (a) ScRev7 has no nuclease activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, lane 2</xref>) and (b) Mre11 cleaved <sup>32</sup>P-labelled dsDNA, generating a pattern of DNA fragments in a ladder-like pattern (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, lane 3</xref>). Subsequently, we investigated the effect of ScRev7 on MRX nuclease activity by co-incubating various concentrations of ScRev7 and a fixed amount of MRX complex, prior to the addition of 5’-<sup>32</sup>P-labelled dsDNA. We detected a notable and substantial inhibition in the MRX complex-mediated DNA cleavage activity, and almost complete inhibition at 2 μM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, lanes 4-12</xref>). We carried out additional experiments to test the effect Rev7-C1 on Mre11 nuclease activity. By comparison, the efficiency of inhibition was expectedly less than that of full-length ScRev7. Curiously, we note that the ScRev7-C1 does not faithfully recapitulate the Y2H results. One possible reason is that amino acid residues in the ScRev7-C1 fragment interact with Mre11 and cause partial inhibition, in good agreement with the AF2 modeling data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Many studies have demonstrated that Mre11 exhibits both endonuclease and exonuclease activities independently of Rad50 and Xrs2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>). Thus, we next examined the effect of ScRev7 on the Mre11 ssDNA-specific endonuclease activity in reactions lacking Rad50 and Xrs2. In accord with previous studies, Mre11 digested all the input ssDNA substrate into small fragments/nucleotides in a manner dependent on its concentration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the addition of increasing concentrations of ScRev7 coincided with a concomitant decrease in the Mre11 endonuclease activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). To ascertain the specificity, the effect of ScRev7 on Sae2’s endonuclease activity was investigated. As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lengsfeld et al., 2007</xref>; Ghodke et al., 2016), Sae2 exhibited concentration-dependent nuclease activity on dsDNA (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). However, ScRev7 did not inhibit Sae2’s nuclease activity, even at the highest concentration tested (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).

Interestingly, while ScRev7 itself has no ATPase activity, its addition led to inhibition of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by Rad50 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6J</xref>). The results of a parallel experiment indicated that Rev7 does not affect the ATPase activity of a meiosis-specific <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Dmc1, indicating its inhibitory specificity towards Rad50 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6H</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6J</xref>). Similar analysis showed that ScRev7-C1 inhibited the ATP hydrolysis of Rad50 but three-fold less efficiently than its full-length counterpart (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6I</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6J</xref>). These results were validated using a colorimetric molybdate/malachite green-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lanzetta et al., 1979</xref>). While ScRev7 inhibited the ATPase activity of Rad50 to an extent of 60% at the highest concentration tested, Rev7-C1 was about three-fold less inhibitory than its full-length counterpart at an identical concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively, our results support a model in which ScRev7 negatively regulates the catalytic activities of Mre11 and Rad50 subunits.</p>

<title><italic>REV7</italic> facilitates NHEJ in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></title>
<p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the heterotrimeric MRX complex has been implicated in both Ku-dependent NHEJ and microhomology-mediated end joining repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Moore and Haber, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Boulton and Jackson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Zhang and Paull, 2005</xref>). Multiple studies in cancers have shown that Rev7 inhibits DNA end-resection and favors NHEJ over HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Liang et al., 2020</xref>;). To our knowledge, it is unknown whether these findings are relevant to other species. However, we note that <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Rev7 has been shown to inhibit long-range resection at DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Leland et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, it is unclear whether the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rev1, Rev3 and Rev7 subunits are required for NHEJ. To investigate this, the efficiency of plasmid-based NHEJ repair was analyzed by transforming BamHI-linearized plasmid pRS416, which has no homology with the genomic DNA, into the WT and isogenic mutant strains as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Boulton and Jackson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Moreau et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Consistent with a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Boulton and Jackson, 1998</xref>), we found that NHEJ was undetectable in the <italic>mre1111</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Notably, while the <italic>rev1Δ and rev3</italic>Δ strains showed a modest decrease in the efficiency of NHEJ, <italic>rev7Δ</italic> single and <italic>rev1Δ rev3</italic>Δ double mutants exhibited about four– and twofold decrease, respectively, compared with the WT. Further analysis revealed that the NHEJ efficiency in double mutants – <italic>rev1Δ rev7Δ, rev3</italic>Δ <italic>rev7Δ</italic> and <italic>sae2Δ rev7Δ</italic> – was comparable to that of <italic>rev7Δ</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref> —<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Intriguingly, however, we found that ScRev7-42 aa peptide, but not the Rev7-C1 variant, fully restored the NHEJ efficiency in <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells to the WT levels. It remained possible that the significant reduction in NHEJ efficiency observed in the <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells could be due to aberrant cell cycle progression. To test this possibility, cell cycle progression in both WT and <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells was monitored using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Compared with the wild-type (WT) cells, we observed a slightly delayed cell cycle progression with <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells at 30 and 45 min after release from G1 arrest, and there were no differences in their mating type phenotypes. However, after 45 minutes, <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells exhibited a similar distribution of cells in the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle as observed in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these results indicate that <italic>rev711</italic> cells do not possess aberrant cell cycle or mating type defects as compared with the WT cells.</p>

<p>We next sought to determine whether ScRev7 plays a role in NHEJ pathway at the chromosome level. To address this question, the efficiency of NHEJ was evaluated using a “suicide-deletion” assay in which the I-SceI induced DSB can be repaired via NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Karathanasis and Wilson, 2002</xref>). Briefly, it is based on an approach wherein galactose-induced I-SceI endonuclease inflicts a pair of site-specific DSBs, resulting in the deletion of its own coding region, thereby facilitating the repair of DSB via NHEJ (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Using this approach, we determined the frequency of Ade2+ recombinants in the WT and isogenic mutant strains. A critical NHEJ factor Ku70 was used as a control. As expected, while NHEJ was undetectable in strains lacking <italic>MRE11</italic> and <italic>KU70</italic>, deletion of <italic>REV7, REV1</italic> and <italic>REV3</italic> led to a 9-fold, 2.3-fold– and 3.2-fold decrease, respectively, in the frequency of NHEJ compared with the WT strain.

These results reinforce the notion that Rev7 promotes NHEJ repair at DSBs.

<title>REV7 plays an anti-recombinogenic role during HR in S. cerevisiae</title>
<p>As mentioned above, current evidence suggests that the RIF1/REV7/Shieldin complex blocks DNA end resection and BRCA1-mediated HR, but promotes DSB repair through NHEJ in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gómez-Llorente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Du Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boersma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Mirman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Findlay et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Tomida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Noordermeer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Liang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Malik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Truong et al., 2021</xref>). A flurry of research on Shieldin complex in human cancer cells from other laboratories soon followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Clairmont and D’Andrea, 2021</xref>). However, the generality of these findings has remained elusive. Therefore, we leveraged a spot assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Paeschke et al., 2013</xref>) to understand whether <italic>REV7</italic> plays a role in the regulation of HR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In this assay, under conditions of optimal growth and replication stress, we measured the frequency of HR between the <italic>ura3-1</italic> allele on chromosome V and <italic>ura3-G4</italic> allele (<italic>ura3</italic> interrupted by G4 motifs) on the pFAT10-G4 plasmid (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). In the absence of HU, while no Ura3+ papillae were observed in the <italic>ura3-1</italic> strain carrying the empty vector (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B, top row</xref>), all other strains harboring the plasmid pFAT10-G4 formed Ura3<sup>+</sup> papillae (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>).</p>

<p>We sought to build on these observations by testing the effect of HU on the formation of Ura3<sup>+</sup> papillae by the strains (carrying pFAT10-G4 plasmid) used in the experiment. This analysis revealed that the <italic>ura3-1 rev7</italic>Δ double mutant strain formed significantly more Ura3<sup>+</sup> papillae than <italic>ura3-1</italic> strains, but less than what was seen in the absence of HU. As anticipated, we observed that both mre11-D56N,H125N (used as an internal control) and <italic>rev7</italic>Δ <italic>mre11-D56N,H125N</italic> mutant strains did not form Ura3+ papillae (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>). A similar analysis showed that <italic>ura3-1</italic> strain and the same strain expressing ScRev7-42 amino acid peptide, but not Rev7-C1 variant, displayed a very few, and small Ura3<sup>+</sup> papillae. As expected, Ura3+ papillae formation was not observed in the <italic>ura3-1</italic> strain carrying the empty vector. Quantification indicated that the <italic>ura3-1 rev7Δ</italic> mutant showed 11.5-fold increase in the formation of Ura3+ papillae as compared with <italic>ura3-1</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). Thus, we envision that the absence of Ura3+ papillae in the <italic>ura3-1</italic> strain (with or without empty vector) in the presence of HU might be related to Rev7-mediated suppression; whereas their absence in cells that lack functional Mre11 nuclease is due to HU-induced toxicity. Such an effect has been described previously in the Mre11 nuclease-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Tittel-Elmer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hamilton and Maizels, 2010</xref>). Regardless, these results support a model in which <italic>REV7</italic> gene product plays an anti-recombinogenic role during HR, thus its deletion unleashes the cells to facilitate HR between <italic>ura3G4</italic> and <italic>ura3-1</italic> mutant alleles located on the plasmid and chromosome V, respectively.</p>
<p>To confirm whether the G-quadruplex motifs stimulate HR in the <italic>rev7</italic>Δ strain, the frequency of HR was measured using pFAT10-G4-mut plasmid, which harbors mutations within G-tracts of the <italic>ura3G4</italic> allele. The results revealed that the frequency of HR reduced by about 5.8-fold, as compared to the strain carrying plasmid pFAT10-G4 with unmutated sequences, revealing that reduction in HR may be caused by mutations in the G-quadruplex forming sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="figs11">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). To assess whether increased frequency of HR is due to the instability of G-quadruplex DNA in <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells, the length of G4 DNA inserts was assessed in the plasmids isolated from WT and <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells. The results showed a DNA fragment of 829 bp corresponding to the expected size in both WT and <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="figs12">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>), raising the possibility that increased frequency of HR in <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells could be due to the loss of Rev7 function and instability of G-quadruplex forming sequences.</p>
<p>Finally, a qPCR-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mimitou and Symington, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ferrari et al., 2018</xref>) was employed to quantify the amounts of ssDNA generated in the <italic>rev711</italic> and <italic>rad51Δ mre11-H125N rev7Δ</italic> strains at a HO endonuclease-induced DSB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="figs13">Figure 9—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The results indicated a significant increase in the percentage of ssDNA 0.7 kb distal to the DSB at 4 h after its induction in the <italic>rev7Δ rad51Δ</italic> cells compared with <italic>rad51Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="figs13">Figure 9—figure supplement 3B</xref>). As expected, the DNA end resection rates in the <italic>mre11-H125N</italic> and <italic>mre11-H125N rev7Δ</italic> cells were similar to that in the <italic>rad51Δ</italic> cells. Importantly, at 3 kb distal to the DSB, <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells showed comparable rates of DNA end resection, in line with both <italic>rad51Δ</italic> and <italic>mre11-H125N</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="figs13">Figure 9—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Altogether, these results support the notion that Rev7 suppresses HR by inhibiting Mre11-mediated short-range DNA end resection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we reveal the surprising finding that Rev7 physically associates with the subunits of the MRX complex and also provide unanticipated insights into the mechanism by which it regulates the DSB repair pathway choice between HR and NHEJ in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> Notably, we demonstrate that Rev7 binds to the subunits of the MRX complex, via a 42-residue C-terminal segment (residues 203-245), protects cells form G4 DNA-HU-induced toxicity, facilitates DSB repair via NHEJ while blocking HR. In addition, we present robust evidence that ScRev7 impedes Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities, without affecting the latter’s ability to bind ATP. When seen from a teleological perspective, our work is conceptually reminiscent of Shieldin complex-mediated suppression of 5′ end resection and repair of DSBs via NHEJ by blocking HR in human cancer cells. It remains plausible that this alternative mechanism of DSB repair pathway choice in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> might be conserved across multiple species.</p>
<p>Historically, <italic>REV7</italic> was discovered as playing an important role in DNA damage-induced mutagenesis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lemontt, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lawrence et al., 1985a</xref>). Further investigations showed that Rev7 associates with Rev3 and functions as a regulatory subunit of eukaryotic TLS DNA polymerase Polζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Prakash et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Maiorano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ling et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Paniagua and Jacobs, 2023</xref>). While Rev7 has no known enzymatic activity, it acts as a versatile scaffolding protein with pleiotropic functions in diverse cellular processes including, but not limited to, epigenetics, immune signalling, viral mutagenesis and cancer development that were initially considered inconceivable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Decottignies, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">de Krijger et al., 2021</xref>). However, little is known about the nature of specific effector(s) that associate with Rev7 and regulate DSB repair pathway choice in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> As we discuss below, our work convincingly demonstrates that ScRev7 physically interacts with the individual subunits of MRX complex and regulates their activities. In line with this, MST based protein-protein interaction assays, supported by AF2-multimer modelling, imply tight association between the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits and ScRev7. It is interesting to note that Sae2, which cooperates with the MRX complex to initiate DNA end resection, does not associate with Rev7, suggesting interaction specificity between MRX subunits and Rev7.</p>
<p>However, an intriguing inquiry arises regarding whether the MRX subunits exist as separate entities in the cell. Although, to our knowledge, the existence and relative amounts of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric species of MRX subunits <italic>in vivo</italic> are unknown, current evidence suggests that both Mre11 and Rad50 subunits independently bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Stracker and Petrini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Paull, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Casari et al., 2019</xref>). Other studies have shown that MRX complex binds and tethers DNA ends, which is thought to be required for DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Trujillo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cassani et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, while data obtained from co-immunoprecipitation experiments implicate that Mre11, Rad50 and Xrs2 subunits exist as a hetero-trimeric complex <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Usui et al., 1998</xref>), <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have shown the formation of dimeric Mre11-Rad50 and trimeric MRX complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Oh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arora et al., 2017</xref>). Collectively, these results allow us to postulate that the monomeric, dimeric and trimeric species of MRX subunits might exist in a dynamic equilibrium under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions.</p>
<p>Given that Rev7 and MRX complex play essential roles in DNA repair pathways, our findings provide novel insights into how ScRev7 interacts with the MRX subunits and regulates their functions. Structure-function analysis showed that deletion of 42-amino acid residues (203-245) at the extreme C-terminus of ScRev7 abolished its ability to interact with the MRX subunits, whereas loss of the N-terminal HORMA domain, an evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interaction module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Muniyappa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Rosenberg and Corbett, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">de Krijger et al., 2021</xref>;) had no discernible effect on their interactions. Curiously, further analysis indicated that the 42-aminoacid peptide alone was sufficient to bind to the subunits of MRX complex and regulate the DSB repair pathway choice between NHEJ and HR. Reciprocally, future work will be required to determine the regions/domains of MRX subunits that interact with ScRev7 for a comprehensive understanding of the crosstalk between these components. Work is currently in progress to gather insights into these questions.</p>
<p>The data from MST-based protein-protein interaction assays informed that ScRev7 binds to the MRX subunits with sub-micromolar affinity, analogous to the interaction between HORMA-domain protein hMAD2 and hCDC20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Piano et al., 2021</xref>). How might ScRev7 attenuate the function of Mre11 and Rad50 subunits? Our finding indicate that nanomolar amounts of ScRev7 besides attenuating the Mre11 nuclease activity also impedes Rad50’s ATPase activity without obstructing the ability of the latter to bind ATP. Whilst the specific nuances of the interaction await further research, we surmise that physical interaction between ScRev7 and the Mre11/Rad50 subunits might contribute to the observed effects. Although we provide compelling Y2H data that the C-terminal 42-aminoacid peptide of Rev7 is critical for binding to the MRX subunits and protect cells from G4 DNA-HU-induced toxicity, and regulate the pathway choice between NHEJ and HR; however, we could not demonstrate its function <italic>in vitro</italic> because of technical difficulties associated with its expression and purification. By comparison, we found that the Rev7-C1 variant, which lacks the ability to interact with the MRX subunits in Y2H assays, was capable of blocking, albeit partially, the catalytic activities of Mre11 and Rad50 subunits <italic>in vitro</italic>. A likely possibility is that amino acid residues in the Rev7-C1 fragment might be involved in pairwise interactions between ScRev7 and the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits, as seen in AlphaFold2 models. Conversely, the 42-amino acid fragment as a part of whole protein might act as a lid to block the residues in the Rev7-C1 fragment, thereby enabling it to function effectively as a single site for binding to the MRX subunits in Y2H assays. Future studies are required to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Many lines of evidence indicate that G-quadruplex forming sequences are measurably enriched at certain functional regions in the genomes of all organisms, from humans to plants to microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Huppert and Balasubramanian, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Capra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Castillo Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lejault et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, G-quadruplex structures modulate diverse cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, translation, and are associated with certain diseases, characterized by high rates of chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Rhodes and Lipps, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Spiegel et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, we found that <italic>rev7</italic>11 mutant cells harbouring exogenous G-quadruplex forming sequences exhibit hypersensitivity to HU-induced genotoxic stress and cell death. This is consistent with emerging evidence that DNA replication stress induced by G-quadruplex structures play a prominent role in triggering genomic instability, which is exacerbated in the presence of HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Sato and Knipscheer, 2023</xref>). Although the precise mechanism remains unclear, it is tempting to speculate that Rev7 may recruit G4-resolving helicase(s) such as Sgs1 and Pif1 to unwind G-quadruplex structures prior to or during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Huber et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Paeschke et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, or in addition, it might generate G4 DNA intermediates which may be processed or cleaved by specific enzymes, including Mus81, Sgs1 or Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Regairaz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Sun et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ghosal and Muniyappa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">2007</xref>). Regardless, our data align with the notion that G-quadruplex structures are endogenous sources of replication stress and their formation and persistence may lead to genomic instability and cell death.</p>

Since 5′ end resection is the primary step in HR-mediated DSB repair, we hypothesized that physical interaction between ScRev7 and MRX subunits might block resection of DNA termini, and then facilitate NHEJ-dependent DSB repair instead of HR. Consistent with this premise, we found that ScRev7 promotes NHEJ by blocking HR. However, other regulatory components may also play a role in modulating the levels of NHEJ versus HR-mediated DSB repair. For instance, TRIP13 or p31<sup>comet</sup> inhibits the interaction of Rev7 with the SHLD3 subunit and regulates DNA end resection at DSBs and promotes their repair by HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sarangi et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, interaction between Rev7 and putative binding partners may be regulated by posttranslational modifications and chromatin accessibility under changing physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Although the mechanism underlying Rev7-mediated regulation of DSB repair between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human cancer cells indicate broad similarities, we also observed some notable differences. A fundamental difference between the results from cancer cells and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is that, while ScRev7 robustly interacts with and suppresses the biochemical activities of both Mre11 and Rad50 subunits to facilitate NHEJ, Rev7-Shieldin complex acts as a downstream effector of 53BP1-RIF1 in restraining DNA end resection to promote NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Clairmont and D’Andrea, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Paniagua and Jacobs, 2023</xref>). Furthermore, hRev7 interacts with the SHLD3 subunit via the HORMA domain, which is entirely dispensable in the case of ScRev7. Thus, we posit that the Shieldin complex-mediated regulation of DSB repair pathway choice might be a source of evolutionary innovation as an additional layer of regulation. In summary, our data provide novel insights into the alternative mechanism underlying the regulation of DSB repair pathway choice in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

The ODNs were labeled at the 5’ end using [ψ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Sambrook and Russell, 2001</xref>). The unincorporated [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP was removed using a Sephadex G-50 superfine mini-column. The dsDNA substrates were prepared as follows: 41 bp dsDNA by mixing aliquots of 5’-end <sup>32</sup>P-labeld OSB17 (upper strand) with a small excess of unlabeled complementary OSB20; 60 bp dsDNA by mixing OSB41 (upper strand) and OSB42 (lower strand) in 1X SSC buffer (0.3 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 3 M NaCl), followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooling to 24 °C over a period of 90 min. The substrates were resolved by non-denaturing 8% PAGE for 4 h at 4 °C (Thakur et al., 2016). The substrates were eluted from the gel slices in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mM EDTA) and stored at 4 °C for further use.</p>

<title>Exonuclease assay</title>
<p>The assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arora et al., 2017</xref>) with slight modifications. Two steps are involved in the assay: the first step involves the assembly of the ScRev7-MRX complex, and the second, DNA cleavage. The MRX subunits (100 nM each) were mixed with increasing concentrations of ScRev7 (0.05 to 2.5 μM) or ScRev7-C1 (1.5 and 3 μM) and incubated on ice for 15 min, prior to the addition of twenty μl of reaction mixture that contained 25 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 80 mM NaCl, 8% glycerol, 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 200 μg/ml BSA and 10 nM of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 60 bp dsDNA. Subsequently, reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the reaction stopped by adding a two μl solution containing two mg/ml proteinase K, 50 mM EDTA and 1% SDS. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, five μl of a solution containing 10 μg/ml glycogen, two μl 3 M sodium acetate and 50 μl of absolute ethanol was added to each sample and were frozen at –80°C. The thawed samples were centrifuged at 15000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellets were washed with 70% ethanol and centrifuged at 15000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The dried pellets were resuspended in 10 μl gel-loading dye (80% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol and 0.1% bromophenol blue) and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Aliquots were analyzed on a 8% denaturing polyacrylamide/7 M urea PAGE using TBE buffer (89 mM Tris-borate (pH 8.3) and 1 mM EDTA) for 2 h at 40 W. The gels were dried, exposed to a phosphorimager screen, and scanned using a Fuji FLA 9000 phosphor imager.</p>

<p>ATP hydrolysis was monitored by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphate released using acidic ammonium molybdate and malachite green assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lanzetta et al., 1979</xref>). The reaction mixtures (80 µl) contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 µM ATP, and increasing concentrations of ScRad50 (0.05 – 1 µM). After incubation at 30°C for 30 min, reaction was stopped by adding 20 µl of malachite green reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, MAK307). Incubation was continued for 15 min at 24 °C to allow the formation of phosphomolybdate malachite green chromogenic complex. The absorbance values, as a measure of the extent of ATP hydrolysis, at 620 nm (y-axis) were plotted against increasing concentrations of ScRad50 (x-axis). To test the effect of ScRev7 or ScRev7-C1 on Rad50 ATPase activity, increasing concentrations of ScRev7 or ScRev7-C1 (0.1 – 2 µM) were incubated with 0.25 µM of ScRad50 on ice for 20 min, prior to mixing it with the reaction mixture. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, ATP hydrolysis was monitored as described above.

<title>Mass spectrometry analysis</title>
<p>Mass spectrometry analysis of Rev7-GFP was carried out to ascertain its identity using orbitrap mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Zubarev and Makarov, 2013</xref>). In-gel trypsin digestion was performed as follows: 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile in 7:3 ratio was used for de-staining; following which, samples were reduced for 30 min by adding 10 mM DTT diluted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Following reduction, alkylation buffer (55 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate) was added and samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were treated with 10 ng trypsin (Mass spectrometry-grade, Sigma Aldrich, India), at 37°C for 12 h. The peptides were eluted with 70% acetonitrile (300 µL) containing 0.1% trifluoracetic acid, and the samples were dried in speed vacuum and the pellet was resuspended in 40 µL resuspension buffer (2% acetonitrile in LC-MS grade Milli-Q). Samples (10 µL) were injected into the Orbitrap Fusion tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA). Samples were run for 110 min using a nano-spray ionization (NSI) source and static spray voltage. Ions were detected by Orbitrap detector at 60000 resolution using quadrupole isolation. Daughter ions were detected by Ion Trap detector using quadrupole isolation mode. Following data acquisition, peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) and percentage peptide coverage were obtained for the samples. Collectively, these results confirmed that the purified protein is GFP-tagged ScRev7.</p>

At this stage, cells were synchronized at G2/M phase by adding nocodazole (10 μg/mL) and HO expression was induced by adding 2% galactose to the cell culture. For each time point, 20 mL samples were collected for each strain and 0.1% sodium azide was added immediately. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The bead-beating step was used for isolation of genomic DNA from the resuspended pellets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amberg et al., 2005</xref>). Samples were incubated with 10 units of StyI-HF and XbaI-HF (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA) in a reaction mixture containing 15 μg of genomic DNA, 1X CutSmart buffer at 37 °C for 7 h. In parallel, equal amounts of gDNA was mock-digested as control. DNA was precipitated by adding equal volumes of isopropanol, followed by centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 20 min. Pellets were washed with 1 mL of 70% ethanol, air dried, and resuspended in 50 μL of 1X Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 7.5). In qPCR analysis, equal amounts of DNA (1 ng) was used per reaction in a mixture containing 1X SYBR green master mix (G-Biosciences, St. Louis, MO) and 0.2 μM each of forward and reverse primers, as indicated in the Table S8. The qPCR reaction was performed using a Bio-Rad CFX96 thermocycler and 96-well PCR plates. The data obtained from the qPCR were analysed using the Bio-Rad CFX Maestro 1.1 software (version 2.3). The specificity of the qPCR was ascertained by (a) agarose gel electrophoresis and (b) melting curve analysis of qPCR products. Similarly, primer efficiencies were calculated by performing qPCR analysis using serially diluted DNA samples. The HO cut efficiencies across strains were estimated by qPCR analysis at a single HO site (Coordinates 284324-294420) with a unique upstream sequence on Chromosome III. Upon DSB induction, the percentage of ssDNA generated by end resection at different time points and distance (0.7 kb and 3 kb) from the break was calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ferrari et al., 2018</xref>).

<caption><title>ScRev7 inhibits the ATPase activity of ScRad50.</title><p>ATPase activity was measured using malachite green phosphate detection assay that quantifies the amount of Pi released upon ATP hydrolysis. (A) Increasing concentrations of ScRad50 (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8 and 1 µM) were incubated with reaction mixtures containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 150 µM ATP and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Absorbance values were then monitored spectrophotometrically at 620 nm. (B) Same as (A), but fixed concentrations of ScRad50 (0.25 µM) were pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of ScRev7 or ScRev7-C1 (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 µM). The graphs were generated by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (V. 5.0). Error bars represent standard deviation of data from two independent experiments.</p></caption>

<p>Cell cycle progression in wild-type and <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells was analyzed by synchronizing an equal number of cells at the G1 phase using α-factor (100 ng/mL) in the growth medium. After releasing cells from G1 arrest, they were collected at specified time points and stained with propidium iodide for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. The histograms illustrate the distribution of cells in the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle for both wild-type and <italic>rev7Δ</italic> strains.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The mammalian Shieldin complex consisting of REV7 (aka MAD2L2, MAD2B) and SHLD1-3 affects pathway usage in DSB repair favoring non-homologous endjoining (NHEJ) at the expense of homologous recombination (HR) by blocking resection and/or priming fill-in DNA synthesis to maintain or generate near blunt ends suitable for NHEJ. While the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not have homologs to SHLD1-3, it does have Rev7, which was identified to function in conjunction with Rev3 in the translesion DNA polymerase zeta. Testing the hypothesis that Rev7 also affect DSB resection in budding yeast, the work identified a direct interaction between Rev7 and the Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 complex by two-hybrid and direct protein interaction experiments. Deletion analysis identified that the 42 amino acid C-terminal region was necessary and sufficient for the 2-hybrid interaction. Direct biochemical analysis of the 42 aa peptide was not possible. Rev7 deficient cells were found to be sensitive to HU only in synergy with G2 tetraplex forming DNA. Importantly, the 42 aa peptide alone suppressed this phenotype. Biochemical analysis with full-length Rev7 and a C-terminal truncation lacking the 42 aa region shows G4-specific DNA binding that is abolished in the C-terminal truncation and with a substrate containing mutations to prevent G4 formation. Rev7 lacks nuclease activity but inhibits the dsDNA exonuclease activity of Mre11. The C-terminal truncation protein lacking the 42 aa region also showed some inhibition suggesting the involvement of additional binding sites besides the 42 aa region. Also, the Mre11 ssDNA endonuclease activity is inhibited by Rev7 but not the degradation of linear ssDNA. Rev7 does not affect ATP binding by Rad50 but inhibits in a concentration-dependent manner the Rad50 ATPase activity. The C-terminal truncation protein lacking the 42 aa region also showed some inhibition but significantly less than the full-length protein. Using an established plasmid-based NHEJ assay, the authors provide strong evidence that Rev7 affects NEHJ, showing a four-fold reduction in this assay. The mutations in the other Pol zeta subunits, Rev3 and Rev1, show a significantly smaller effect (~25% reduction). A strain expressing only the Rev7 C-terminal 42 aa peptide showed no NHEJ defect, while the truncation protein lacking this region exhibited a smaller defect than the deletion of REV7. The conclusion that Rev7 supports NHEJ mainly through the 42 aa region was validated using a chromosomal NHEJ assay. The effect on HR was assessed using a plasmid:chromosome system containing G4 forming DNA. The rev7 deletion strain showed an increase in HR in this system in the presence and absence of HU. Cells expressing the 42 aa peptide were indistinguishable from wild type as were cells expressing the Rev7 truncation lacking the 42 aa region. The authors conclude that Rev7 suppresses HR, but the context appears to be system-specific and the conclusion that Rev7 abolished HR repair of DSBs is unwarranted and overly broad.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>This is a well-written manuscript with well-executed experiments which suggest that Rev7 inhibits MRX-mediated resection to favor NEHJ during DSB repair. This finding is novel and provides insight into the potential mechanism of how the human Shieldin complex might antagonize resection.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The nuclease experiments were conducted using manganese as a divalent cation, and it is unclear whether there is an effect with the more physiological magnesium cation. The data largely support the conclusions, although the effect of Rev7 on HR is less well documented, as only a highly specialized assay is used that does not warrant the broad conclusion drawn. Specifically, the results that the Rev7 c-terminal truncation lacking the 42 aa region still suppresses HR is unexpected and unexplained.</p>
<p>In this revision the authors addressed most of my concerns by text revisions and addition of new data.</p>
<p>The new two hybrid data showing that the 42 amino acid segment interacts with MRN are valuable. However, it may not be clear to which subunit the 42 aa segment binds, as in the yeast 2H system the chromosomally encoded subunits are present or were the 2H experiments conducted in an MRN deletion background?. This could be acknowledged.</p>
<p>The material and methods section was updated to indicate use of 5 mM MnCl2 and 5 mM MgCl2 in the exonuclease assay but not the endonuclease assay. Please check if this is correct. Why the difference between both assays? There is a concern that the absence of ATP and Mg affects the endonuclease assay.</p>
<p>The addition of Dmc1 as a specificity control for the ATPase inhibition is nice and shows a specific effect. The use of Sae2 associated nuclease activity as a specificity control for the nuclease inhibition is problematic. There has been considerable debate about the Sae2 associated nuclease activity, which seems to have been solved by the Cejka lab showing that Sae2 is a cofactor of MRN without intrinsic nuclease activity (e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25231868/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25231868/</ext-link>). Or do the authors want to suggest that Sae2 has intrinsic nuclease activity? The control may still be useful mentioning that the nuclease is associated but not intrinsic and citing the relevant papers.</p>

<p>In this study, Badugu et al investigate the Rev7 roles in regulating the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex and in metabolism of G4 structures. The authors also try to make a conclusion that REV7 can regulate the DSB repair choice between homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining.</p>
<p>
The major observations of this study are:</p>
<p>(1) Rev7 interacts with the individual components of the MRX complex in a two-hybrid assay and in a protein-protein interaction assay (microscale thermophoresisi) in vitro.</p>
<p>
(2) Modeling using AlphaFold-Multimier also indicated that Rev7 can interact with Mre11 and Rad50.</p>
<p>
(3) Using a two-hybrid assay, a 42 C terminal domain in Rev7 responsible for the interaction with MRX was identified.</p>
<p>
(4) Rev7 inhibits Mre11 nuclease and Rad50 ATPase activities in vitro.</p>
<p>
(5) Rev 7 promotes NHEJ in plasmid cutting/relegation assay.</p>
<p>
(6) Rev7 inhibits recombination between chromosomal ura3-1 allele and plasmid ura3 allele containing G4 structure.</p>
<p>
(7) Using an assay developed in V. Zakian's lab, it was found that rev7 mutants grow poorly when both G4 is present in the genome and yeast are treated with HU.</p>
<p>
(8) In vitro, purified Rev7 binds to G4-containing substrates.</p>
<p>In general, a lot of experiments have been conducted, but the major conclusion about the role of Rev7 in regulating the choice between HR and NHEJ is not justified.</p>
<p>(1) Two stories that do not overlap (regulation of MRX by Rev7 and Rev7 role in G4 metabolism) are brought under one umbrella in this work. There is no connection unless the authors demonstrate that Rev7 inhibits the cleavage of G4 structures by the MRX complex.</p>
<p>(2) The authors cannot conclude based on the recombination assay between G4-containing 2-micron plasmid and chromosomal ura3-1 that Rev7&quot; completely abolishes DSB-induced HR&quot;. First of all, there is no evidence that DSBs are formed at G4. Why is there no induction of recombination when cells are treated with HU? Second, as the authors showed, Rev7 binds to G4, therefore it is not clear if the observed effects are the result of Rev7 interaction with G4 or impact on HR. The established HO-based assays where the speed of resection can be monitored (e.g., Mimitou and Symington, 2010) have to be used to justify the conclusion that Rev7 inhibits MRX nuclease activity in vivo.</p>
<p>Comments on the revised version:</p>
<p>I am satisfied with the revision. Specifically, i) the elimination of the G4 part and ii) the implementation of the HO-endonuclease resection assay described in Mimiou and Symington, 2010 significantly improved the clarity of the work and strengthened the conclusion about the Rev7 interference with DNA resection.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>REV7 facilitates the recruitment of Shieldin complex and thereby inhibits end resection and controls DSB repair choice in metazoan cells. Puzzlingly, Shieldin is absent in many organisms, and it is unknown if and how Rev7 regulates DSB repair in these cells. The authors surmised that yeast Rev7 physically interacts with Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 (MRX), the short-range resection nuclease complex and tested this premise using yeast two hybrid (Y2H) and microscale thermophoresis (MST). The results convincingly showed that the individual subunits of MRX interacts robustly with Rev7. By AlphaFold Multimer modelling followed by Y2H confirmed that the carboxy terminal 42 amino acid is essential for interaction with MR and G4 DNA binding by REV7. The mutant rev7 lacking the binding interface (Rev7-C1) to MR shows moderate inhibition to the nuclease and the ATPase activity of Mre11/Rad50 in biochemical assays. Deletion of REV7 also causes a mild reduction in NHEJ using both plasmid and chromosome-based assays and increases mitotic recombination between chromosomal ura3-01 and the plasmid ura3 allele interrupted by G4. The revision also showed that rev7 deleted cells exhibit mild hyper-resection phenotype at 0.7 and 3 kb from the DSB using qPCR assays. The authors concluded that Rev7 facilitates NHEJ and antagonises HR even in budding yeast, but it achieves this by blocking Mre11 nuclease and Rad50 ATPase.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several strengths to the studies and the broad types of well-established assays were used to deduce the conclusion. Nevertheless, there are notable discrepancies on the mutant phenotypes that were to test the functionality of Rev7-MRX interaction on the repair outcomes, raising concerns on the validity of the proposed model. The manuscript also needs a few additional functional assays to reach the accurate conclusions as proposed. The revision responded to several comments raised by the reviewers, but they are inadequate to address the key concerns and did not offer sufficient and compelling experimental support to the main premise that Rev7-Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 interactions regulate MRX activities in cells and thereby modulates DSB repair choice in budding yeast.</p>
<p>(1) AlphaFold model predicts that Mre11-Rev7 and Rad50-Rev7 binding interfaces overlap and Rev7 might bind only to Mre11 or Rad50 at a time. Interestingly, however, Rev7 appears dimerized (Fig.1). Since MR complex also forms with 2M and 2R in the complex, it should still be possible if REV7 can interact both M and R in the MR complex. The author should perform MST using MR complex instead of individual MR components. The authors should also analyze if Rev7-C1 is indeed deficient in interaction with MR individually and with complex using MST assay.</p>
<p>(2) The nuclease and the ATPase assays require additional controls. Does Rev7 inhibit the other nuclease or ATPase non-specifically? Are these outcomes due to the non-specific or promiscuous activity of Rev7? In fig.6, the effect of REV7 on the ATP binding of Rad50 could be hard to assess because the maximum Rad50 level (1 uM) was used in the experiments. The author should use the suboptimal level of Rad50 to check if REV7 still does not influence ATP binding by Rad50.</p>
<p>(3) The moderate deficiency in NHEJ using plasmid based assay in REV7 deleted cells can be attributed to aberrant cell cycle or mating type in rev7 deleted cells. The authors should demonstrate that rev7 deleted cells retain largely normal cell cycle pattern and the mating type phenotypes. The author should also analyze the breakpoints in plasmid based NHEJ assays in all mutants especially from rev7 and rev7-C1 cells.</p>
<p>(4) It is puzzling why the authors did not analyze end resection defects in rev7 deleted cells after a DSB. The author should employ the widely used resection assay after a HO break in rev3, rev7 and mre11 rev7 cells as described previously.</p>
<p>(5) Is it possible that Rev7 also contributes to NHEJ as the part of TLS polymerase complex? Although NHEJ largely depends on Pol4, the authors should not rule out the possibility if the observed NHEJ defect in rev7 cells are due at least partially to its well-known TLS defect and not all due to their role in MRX activity regulation as the authors proposed. In fact, rev3 or rev1 cells are partially defective in NHEJ (Fig. 7). Rev7-C1 is less deficient in NHEJ than REV7 deletion. These results predict that rev7-C1 rev3 could be more deficient than rev3 or rev7-C1, and such results might indicate that Rev7 contributes to NHEJ by two ways; one by interacting (and modulating) MRX and the other as part of Rev3-Rev7 complex. Additionally, the authors should examine if Rev7-C1 might be deficient in TLS. In this regard, does rev7-C1 reduce TLS and TLS dependent mutagenesis? Is it dominant? The authors should also check if Rev3/Rev1 complexes are stable in Rev7 deleted or rev7-C1 cells by immunoblot assays.</p>
<p>(6) Due to the G4 DNA and G4 binding activity of REV7, it is not clear which class of events the authors are measuring in plasmid-chromosome recombination assay in Fig.9. Do they measure G4 instability or the integrity of recombination or both in rev7 deleted cells. Instead, the effect of rev7 deletion or rev7-C1 on recombination should be measured directly by more standard mitotic recombination assays like mating type switch or his3 repeat recombination. The revision did not address these concerns, which still makes the interpretation of the provided recombination results difficult.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>The mammalian Shieldin complex consisting of REV7 (aka MAD2L2, MAD2B) and SHLD1-3 affects pathway usage in DSB repair favoring non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) at the expense of homologous recombination (HR) by blocking resection and/or priming fill-in DNA synthesis to maintain or generate near blunt ends suitable for NHEJ. While the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not have homologs to SHLD1-3, it does have Rev7, which was identified to function in conjunction with Rev3 in the translesion DNA polymerase zeta. Testing the hypothesis that Rev7 also affects DSB resection in budding yeast, the work identified a direct interaction between Rev7 and the Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 complex by two-hybrid and direct protein interaction experiments. Deletion analysis identified that the 42 amino acid C-terminal region was necessary and sufficient for the 2-hybrid interaction. Direct biochemical analysis of the 42 aa peptide was not possible. Rev7 deficient cells were found to be sensitive to HU only in synergy with G2 tetraplex forming DNA. Importantly, the 42 aa peptide alone suppressed this phenotype. Biochemical analysis with full-length Rev7 and a C-terminal truncation lacking the 42 aa region shows G4-specific DNA binding that is abolished in the C-terminal truncation and with a substrate containing mutations to prevent G4 formation. Rev7 lacks nuclease activity but inhibits the dsDNA exonuclease activity of Mre11. The C-terminal truncation protein lacking the 42 aa region also showed some inhibition suggesting the involvement of additional binding sites besides the 42 aa region. Also, the Mre11 ssDNA endonuclease activity is inhibited by Rev7 but not the degradation of linear ssDNA. Rev7 does not affect ATP binding by Rad50 but inhibits in a concentration-dependent manner the Rad50 ATPase activity. The C-terminal truncation protein lacking the 42 aa region also showed some inhibition but significantly less than the full-length protein.</p>
<p>Using an established plasmid-based NHEJ assay, the authors provide strong evidence that Rev7 affects NEHJ, showing a four-fold reduction in this assay. The mutations in the other Pol zeta subunits, Rev3 and Rev1, show a significantly smaller effect (~25% reduction). A strain expressing only the Rev7 C-terminal 42 aa peptide showed no NHEJ defect, while the truncation protein lacking this region exhibited a smaller defect than the deletion of REV7. The conclusion that Rev7 supports NHEJ mainly through the 42 aa region was validated using a chromosomal NHEJ assay. The effect on HR was assessed using a plasmid:chromosome system containing G4 forming DNA. The rev7 deletion strain showed an increase in HR in this system in the presence and absence of HU. Cells expressing the 42 aa peptide were indistinguishable from the wild type as were cells expressing the Rev7 truncation lacking the 42 aa region. The authors conclude that Rev7 suppresses HR, but the context appears to be system-specific and the conclusion that Rev7 abolished HR repair of DSBs is unwarranted and overly broad.</p>
<p>Strength</p>
<p>This is a well-written manuscript with many well-executed experiments that suggest that Rev7 inhibits MRX-mediated resection to favor NEHJ during DSB repair. This finding is novel and provides insight into the potential mechanism of how the human Shieldin complex might antagonize resection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 1 for their comprehensive summary of our work. The Reviewers' recognition that our manuscript is “well-written” with “many well-executed experiments” and our findings are “novel” is greatly appreciated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The nuclease experiments were conducted using manganese as a divalent cation, and it is unclear whether there is an effect with the more physiological magnesium cation. Additional controls for the ATPase and nuclease experiments to eliminate non-specific effects would be helpful. Evidence for an effect on resection in cells is lacking. The major conclusion about the role of Rev7 in regulating the choice between HR and NHEJ is not justified, as only a highly specialized assay is used that does not warrant the broad conclusion drawn. Specifically, the results that the Rev7 C terminal truncation lacking the 42 aa region still suppresses HR is unexpected and unexplained. The effect of Rev7 on G4 metabolism is underdeveloped and distracts from the main results that Rev7 modulated MRX activity. The authors should consider removing this part and develop a more complete story on this later.</p>

<p>We have addressed each point identified as “Weaknesses” by the reviewer, as described below:</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the Reviewer’s concern and apologize for not having been clear in our first submission.  However, several studies have demonstrated that Mre11 exhibits all three DNase activities, namely single-stranded endonuclease, double-stranded exonuclease and DNA hairpin opening only in the presence of Mn²⁺ but not with other divalent cations, such as magnesium or calcium (Paull and Gellert, Mol. Cell 1998; 2000; Usui et al., Cell 1998; Ghosal and Muniyappa, JMB, 2007; Arora et al., Mol Cell Biol. 2017). For this reason, Mn²⁺ was used as a cofactor for the Mre11 nuclease assays. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript. As a side note, Mg2+ serves as a cofactor for Rad50’s ATPase activity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additional controls for the ATPase and nuclease experiments to eliminate non-specific effects would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this important point, as it led us to evaluate and confirm the specificity of Rev7 and exclude its potential non-specific effects. To this end, we have performed additional experiments, which showed that (a) the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Dmc1 ATPase activity was not affected by Rev7, contrary to its inhibitory effect on Rad50 and (b) Rev7 had no discernible impact on the endonucleolytic activity of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sae2, whereas it inhibits DNase activities of Mre11. Thus, the lack of inhibitory effects on the ATPase activity of Dmc1 and nuclease activity of Sae2 confirm the specificity of Rev7 for Mre11 and Rad50 subunits. We have included this new data in Figure 6H and 6J and in Figure 5 –figure supplement 1, respectively, in the revised manuscript.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence demonstrating the inhibitory effect of REV7 on DNA end resection was lacking in the first submission. Reviewer 2 and 3 have also raised point. We now measured the rate of DNA end resection using a qPCR-based assay (Mimitou and Symington, EMBO J. 2010; Gnugge et al., Mol. Cell 2023). The results revealed that deletion of REV7 led to an enhancement in the rate of DNA end resection at a DSB site inflicted by HO endonuclease (Figure 9—figure supplement 3), providing direct evidence that loss of <italic>REV7</italic> contributes to increase in DNA end resection at the DSBs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Specifically, the results that the Rev7 C-terminal truncation lacking the 42 aa region still suppresses HR is unexpected and unexplained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a fair point, and we thank the reviewer for raising it. Although the interaction of Rev7-C1 in the yeast two-hybrid assays was not apparent, surprisingly, it partially suppressed HR (Figure 9). In line with this, biochemical assays showed that it exerts partial inhibitory effect on the Mre11 nuclease (Figure 5) and Rad50 ATPase (Figure 6) activities compared with the full-length Rev7. Consistent with <italic>vitro</italic> data, the AF2 models revealed that, in addition to the C-terminal 42-aa region, residues in the N-terminal region of Rev7 also interact with the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p>

<p>The effect of Rev7 on G4 metabolism is underdeveloped and distracts from the main results that Rev7 modulated MRX activity. The authors should consider removing this part and develop a more complete story on this later.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment “<italic>that the effect of Rev7 on G4 DNA metabolism is underdeveloped and distracts”</italic> from the central theme of the present paper, and suggested that we develop this part as a complete story later. This point has also been raised by Reviewer 2 and 3 and, therefore, Figures and associated text were removed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, Badugu et al investigate the Rev7 roles in regulating the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex and in the metabolism of G4 structures. The authors also try to make a conclusion that REV7 can regulate the DSB repair choice between homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining.</p>
<p>The major observations of this study are:</p>
<p>(1) Rev7 interacts with the individual components of the MRX complex in a two-hybrid assay and in a protein-protein interaction assay (microscale thermophoresisi) in vitro.</p>
<p>(2) Modeling using AlphaFold-Multimier also indicated that Rev7 can interact with Mre11 and Rad50.</p>
<p>(3) Using a two-hybrid assay, a 42 C terminal domain in Rev7 responsible for the interaction with MRX was identified.</p>
<p>(4) Rev7 inhibits Mre11 nuclease and Rad50 ATPase activities in vitro.</p>
<p>(5) Rev 7 promotes NHEJ in plasmid cutting/relegation assay.</p>
<p>(6) Rev7 inhibits recombination between chromosomal ura3-1 allele and plasmid ura3 allele containing G4 structure.</p>
<p>(7) Using an assay developed in V. Zakian's lab, it was found that rev7 mutants grow poorly when both G4 is present in the genome and yeast are treated with HU.</p>
<p>(8) In vitro, purified Rev7 binds to G4-containing substrates.</p>
<p>In general, a lot of experiments have been conducted, but the major conclusion about the role of Rev7 in regulating the choice between HR and NHEJ is not justified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate Reviewer 2 for comprehensive assessment of our manuscript and their insightful comments. However, we believe that the data (Figure 7-9) in our manuscript, together with new data (Figure 9- figure supplement 2 and 3) in the revised manuscript, clearly demonstrate that Rev7 regulates the choice between HR and NHEJ.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Two stories that do not overlap (regulation of MRX by Rev7 and Rev7's role in G4 metabolism) are brought under one umbrella in this work. There is no connection unless the authors demonstrate that Rev7 inhibits the cleavage of G4 structures by the MRX complex.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s point that the themes associated with the regulation of the functions of MRX subunits by Rev7 and its role G4 DNA metabolism do not overlap. This concern has also been expressed by Reviewer 1 and 3. According to their suggestion, we have deleted all figures and text describing the role of Rev7 in G4 DNA metabolism from the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors cannot conclude based on the recombination assay between G4-containing 2-micron plasmid and chromosomal ura3-1 that Rev7 &quot;completely abolishes DSB-induced HR&quot;. First of all, there is no evidence that DSBs are formed at G4. Why is there no induction of recombination when cells are treated with HU? Second, as the authors showed, Rev7 binds to G4, therefore it is not clear if the observed effects are the result of Rev7 interaction with G4 or its impact on HR. The established HO-based assays where the speed of resection can be monitored (e.g., Mimitou and Symington, 2010) have to be used to justify the conclusion that Rev7 inhibits MRX nuclease activity in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for the insightful comments and drawing our attention to the inference <italic>&quot;completely abolishes DSB-induced HR&quot;</italic>. We have we have rephrased the conclusion, and replaced it with <italic>“REV7</italic> gene product plays an anti-recombinogenic role during HR”. Then, the reviewer refers to lack of “<italic>evidence that DSBs are formed at G4”.</italic> At this point, unfortunately, our attempts to identify DSB at the G4 DNA site in the 2-micron plasmid did not provide a clear answer to this question. This might be related to the existence of myriad DNases in the cell and technical issues associated with the isolation of low-abundant, linearized 2-micron plasmid molecules. Because of these reasons, we cannot provide any data on DSB at the G4 site in the 2-micron plasmid.</p>
<p>The reviewer then correctly points out “Why is there no induction of recombination when cells are treated with HU?” These findings are consistent with previous studies which have shown that Mre11-deﬁcient cells are sensitivity to HU, resulting in cell death (Tittel-Elmer et al., EMBO J. 28, 1142-1156, 2009; Hamilton and Maizels, PLoS One, 5, e15387, 2010). However, a novel finding of our study is that ura3-1 rev7D cells and ura3-1 cells expressing Rev7-42 amino acid peptide (to limited extent) produce Ura3+ papillae. We have included this information in the Results section and adjusted the text to make this point clear to the reader.</p>
<p>In the same paragraph, the Reviewer expresses a concern about the interaction of Rev7 with G4 DNA substrates and its impact on HR. As discussed above, in response to your comment (1) and a similar comment of Reviewer 1 and 3, we have deleted all figures and text describing the role of Rev7 in G4 DNA metabolism in the revised manuscript. The reviewer specifically refers to a study by Mimitou and Symington, 2010 in which the speed DNA end resection at the HO endonuclease-inflicted DSB was quantified. We have carried out the suggested experiment and the results are presented in Figure 9─figure supplement 3.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>REV7 facilitates the recruitment of Shieldin complex and thereby inhibits end resection and controls DSB repair choice in metazoan cells. Puzzlingly, Shieldin is absent in many organisms and it is unknown if and how Rev7 regulates DSB repair in these cells. The authors surmised that yeast Rev7 physically interacts with Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 (MRX), the short-range resection nuclease complex, and tested this premise using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and microscale thermophoresis (MST). The results convincingly showed that the individual subunits of MRX interact robustly with Rev7. AlphaFold Multimer modelling followed by Y2H confirmed that the carboxy-terminal 42 amino acid is essential for interaction with MR and G4 DNA binding by REV7. The mutant rev7 lacking the binding interface (Rev7-C1) to MR shows moderate inhibition to the nuclease and the ATPase activity of Mre11/Rad50 in biochemical assays. Deletion of REV7 also causes a mild reduction in NHEJ using both plasmid and chromosome-based assays and increases mitotic recombination between chromosomal ura3-01 and the plasmid ura3 allele interrupted by G4. The authors concluded that Rev7 facilitates NHEJ and antagonizes HR even in budding yeast, but it achieves this by blocking Mre11 nuclease and Rad50 ATPase.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>There are many strengths to the studies and the broad types of well-established assays were used to deduce the conclusion. Nevertheless, I have several concerns about the validity of experimental settings due to the lack of several key controls essential to interpret the experimental results. The manuscript also needs a few additional functional assays to reach the accurate conclusions as proposed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are happy that the Reviewer has found “many strengths” in our manuscript and further noted that “<italic>results convincingly showed that the individual subunits of MRX interact robustly with Rev7</italic>”. We greatly appreciate the Reviewer for these encouraging words, and for specific suggestions that helped us to improve the manuscript. As suggested, we have performed additional experiments including key controls and the data is presented in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) AlphaFold model predicts that Mre11-Rev7 and Rad50-Rev7 binding interfaces overlap and Rev7 might bind only to Mre11 or Rad50 at a time. Interestingly, however, Rev7 appears dimerized (Figure 1). Since the MR complex also forms with 2M and 2R in the complex, it should still be possible if REV7 can interact with both M and R in the MR complex. The author should perform MST using MR complex instead of individual MR components. The authors should also analyze if Rev7-C1 is indeed deficient in interaction with MR individually and with complex using MST assay.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the valuable suggestion. As requested, MST titration experiments have been performed to examine the affinity of purified GFP-tagged Rev7-C1 for the Mre11, Rad50 and MR complex. The results revealed that Rev7-C1 binds to the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits with about 3- and 8.8-fold reduced affinity, respectively; whereas it binds to the MR complex with ~5.6-fold reduced affinity compared with full-length Rev7. The data is shown in Figure 1─figure supplement 4A-C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The nuclease and the ATPase assays require additional controls. Does Rev7 inhibit the other nuclease or ATPase non-specifically? Are these outcomes due to the non-specific or promiscuous activity of Rev7? In Figure 6, the effect of REV7 on the ATP binding of Rad50 could be hard to assess because the maximum Rad50 level (1 mM) was used in the experiments. The author should use the suboptimal level of Rad50 to check if REV7 still does not influence ATP binding by Rad50.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for these valuable comments (Reviewer 1 has raised similar issues). Thus, we performed additional control experiments and the results indicate that (a) the ATPase activity of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Dmc1 was not affected by Rev7 and (b) Rev7 does not inhibit the endonucleolytic activity of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sae2. The results are depicted in Figure 6H and 6J and Figure 5 –figure supplement 1A-D, respectively.</p>
<p>As suggested by the Reviewer, using suboptimal levels of Rad50 (0.2 mM), we carried out experiments to test the effect of varying concentrations of Rev7 on the ability of Rad50 to bind ATP and catalyse its hydrolysis. The results showed that Rev7 had no discernible effect on its ability to bind ATP, even at concentrations 30 times higher than the concentration of Rad50 (Figure 6B and 6D). However, Rev7 suppresses the ATPase activity of Rad50, but not that of Dmc1, in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure G, 6J).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The moderate deficiency in NHEJ using plasmid-based assay in REV7 deleted cells can be attributed to aberrant cell cycle or mating type in rev7 deleted cells. The authors should demonstrate that rev7 deleted cells retain largely normal cell cycle patterns and the mating type phenotypes. The author should also analyze the breakpoints in plasmid-based NHEJ assays in all mutants, especially from rev7 and rev7-C1 cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the Reviewer's critical and insightful comment. We monitored cell-cycle progression of both wild-type and <italic>rev7D</italic> cells over time using FACS. The results revealed that the cell cycle profiles and mating type phenotypes <italic>rev7D</italic> cells were similar to the wild type cells. The data is presented in Figure 7-figure supplement 1. This indicates that <italic>rev7D</italic> cells do not possess aberrant cell cycle or mating type defects as compared with the wild-type cells.</p>
<p>We find the second point raised by the Reviewer although is intriguing, its relevance to the current study is unclear. In our view, identification of breakpoints using plasmid-based NHEJ assays in all the mutants will require a significant amount of time, and the insight that we may gain is unlikely to add to the central theme of this paper.  Moreover, we know for sure that Rev7 has no DNA cleavage/nicking activity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It is puzzling why the authors did not analyze end resection defects in rev7 deleted cells after a DSB. The author should employ the widely used resection assay after a HO break in rev3, rev7, and mre11 rev7 cells as described previously.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. Reviewer 1 also has raised this point. As suggested, we have analysed end resection in the rev7D cells at a HO inflicted DSB site using a qPCR assay (Mimitou and Symington, EMBO J. 2010; Gnugge et al., Mol. Cell 2023). The results revealed that deletion of REV7 led to an enhancement in the rate of DNA end resection at a DSB inflicted by HO endonuclease (Figure 9—figure supplement 3),</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Is it possible that Rev7 also contributes to NHEJ as the part of TLS polymerase complex? Although NHEJ largely depends on Pol4, the authors should not rule out that the observed NHEJ defect in rev7 cells is due at least partially to its TLS defect. In fact, both rev3 or rev1 cells are partially defective in NHEJ (Figure 7). Rev7-C1 is less deficient in NHEJ than REV7 deletion. These results predict that rev7-C1, rev3 should be as defective as the rev7 deletion. Additionally, the authors should examine if Rev7-C1 might be deficient in TLS. In this regard, does rev7-C1 reduce TLS and TLS-dependent mutagenesis? Is it dominant? The authors should also check if Rev3 or Rev1 are stable in Rev7 deleted or rev7-C1 cells by immunoblot assays.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the possibility that Rev7 may play a role in translesion DNA synthesis and TLS-dependent mutagenesis. Accordingly, Rev7-C1 might be deficient in TLS. While we do not rule out such scenarios, we respectfully suggest that this is outside the scope of the current manuscript. This manuscript focuses on the role of Rev7 in NHEJ and HR pathways, not on translesion DNA synthesis. Nevertheless, we recognise the importance of this line of investigation, and we will certainly consider this suggestion in our future work. Thank you.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Due to the G4 DNA and G4 binding activity of REV7, it is not clear which class of events the authors are measuring in plasmid-chromosome recombination assay in Figure 9. Do they measure G4 instability or the integrity of recombination or both in rev7 deleted cells? Instead, the effect of rev7 deletion or rev7-C1 on recombination should be measured directly by more standard mitotic recombination assays like mating type switch or his3 repeat recombination.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the Reviewer for highlighting this important point and would like to take the opportunity to clarify the rationale behind plasmid-chromosome recombination assay, as previously described (Paeschke et al., Cell 145, 678, 2011). In this assay, we are measuring the rate of Ura+ papillae formation arising from integration of the targeting plasmid into the genome at the ura3-1 locus of wild-type and rev7D cells. Analysis of PCR-generated DNA fragments indicate that pFAT10-G4 plasmid integrates at the ura3-1 genomic locus of rev7D cells, but not in the wild-type cells (Figure 9-figure supplement 2). Further, we also measured the stability of G4 DNA and the results indicate that it is stable in rev7D cells.</p>

<p>Following this suggestion, we have included images of Coomassie blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Figure 1-figure supplement 1), which show the purity and size of GFP tagged Rev7, Rad50, Mre11, Xrs2, Rev1, Sae2 and Dmc1 proteins.</p>

<p>This is a fair point and we appreciate the reviewer for highlighting. The differences between the binding profiles of the Rad50, Mre11, and Xrs2 with Rev7 as shown in the previous version of the manuscript were not obvious because of cluttering of binding curves. Therefore, the binding profiles of interacting pair of proteins were plotted separately to highlight the differences (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).

<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. To test this premise, we expressed the terminal 42 amino acid sequence of Rev7 using bait pGBKT7 vector.

<p>(16) Figure 9: Rev7-C1 lacks the 42 a peptide that is postulated to mediate anti-resection but shows normal HR here. This seems unexpected based on the premise that the 42 aa fragment supports end-joining. Rev7 seems to suppress HR independent of the function of the 42 aa peptide.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This has been addressed in response to the query posed by Reviewer 1 in the Public Review. We do see that the Rev7-C1 lacking the 42 aa peptide suppresses HR, but the suppression was only partial as compared with the wild type. This is consistent with biochemical assays suggesting that Rev7-C1 exerts partial inhibition on the Mre11 nuclease (Figure 5) and Rad50 ATPase (Figure 6) activities. Further, the AF2 models indicate that, in addition to the C-terminal 42-aa region, other regions of Rev7 also interact with the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), consistent with biochemical and genetic data.</p>

<p>(1) It is very strange and unusual that Rev7 independently binds to all three subunits of the MRX complex, raising a question of how specific these interactions are. At least, it should be a negative control in their YH2 assay and protein-protein interaction assay in vitro that Rev7 does not bind to some other proteins. For example, Sae2 and Rev7 interactions can be tested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is right that it is important to validate the specificity of Y2H interactions as well as <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme assays. These findings are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 5-figure supplement 1.  As suggested by the Reviewer, we included <italic>SAE2</italic> in Y2H and MST assays, and Dmc1 and Sae2 <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme assays. Our results clearly showed that Sae2 neither interacts with MRX subunits in Y2H assays (Figure 1A-C) nor inhibits the Sae2’s nuclease and Dmc1’s ATPase activities <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure 6 and Figure 5-figure supplement 1)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It is surprising that in the Discussion the authors speculate that Rev7 might recruit Mus81 nuclease for cleavage, completely ignoring their own publication on the cleavage of G4 by MRX.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer, and we have added discussion about MRX (mentioned above by the reviewer) in revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) How does the AlphaFold-Multimer modeling predict the interaction between Rev7 and MRX as a complex? Are the same regions of MRX accessible for the interaction with Rev7 in this case? Similarly, how are the activities of the MRX complex and phosphorylated Sae2 (see P. Cejka's work) affected by Rev7?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. In this study, we investigated the interaction between Rev7 and Mre11, and between Rev7 and Rad50 subunits using AF2 algorithm. However, the three-dimensional structure of <italic>S. cerevisae</italic> MRX-Rev7 complex could not be constructed due to the size limits imposed by AF2 algorithm. Therefore, we are unable to comment on whether the same regions of MRX subunits in the complex are accessible for the interaction with Rev7. That said, AF2 algorithm has recently been used for structural modelling of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mre11 (1–533)-Rad50 (1–260 + 1,057–1,312) complex (Nicolas <italic>et al.,</italic> <italic>Mol. Cell</italic> <bold>84</bold>, 2223, 2024). As such, there are no AF2 structural models that cover the whole length of Mre11-Rad50 proteins.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point raised by the Reviewer, our results suggest that Rev7 does interact with Sae2 in Y2H assays. However, whether phosphorylated Sae2 could potentially affect the interaction between MRX subunits and Rev7 warrants further studies.</p>

<p>(5) Page 15. Lane 472 &quot;To assess whether increased frequency of HR is due to the instability of G-quadruplex DNA in rev7Δ cells, we examined the length of G4 DNA inserts in the plasmids carrying sequences during HR assay&quot;. It is not clear what does mean&quot; during HR assay&quot;? Did you examine the presence of G4 in Ura+ recombinants? If not, this analysis is meaningful.</p>

<p>The reviewer is correct. We measured the presence of G4 DNA insert in Ura+ recombinants. The text has been appropriately edited to reflect these necessary modifications.</p>

<p>(6) What is the nature of the ura3-1 allele? Can it revert to URA3 in rev7 mutants?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The <italic>ura3-1</italic> allele (glycine-to-glutamate substitution) reverts to Ura3+ at a low rate of ~2.5 × 10−9 in both orientations (Johnson et al., Mol. Cell 59, 163, 2015)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) From the way that the recombination process is depicted it seems that the authors believe that plasmid should integrate into the chromosome. In reality, in most cases it should be a gene conversion where the G4 sequence (if it indeed induces DSBs) should be replaced by the wild-type segment form ura3-1, integration is not required since it is 2-micron plasmid.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for not having made this clearer. The recombination assay with targeting plasmids containing G4 DNA forming sequences was performed as previously described (Paeschke et al., Cell 145, 678, 2011). In this assay, the appearance of Ura+ recombinants arise from the integration of the targeting plasmid bearing ura3G4 allele (with a G4 DNA forming insert) integrates into the genome at the ura3-1 locus. As shown in Author response image 1B, this is confirmed by PCR amplification of the insert in the genomic DNA of wild type and rev7D cells.</p>
