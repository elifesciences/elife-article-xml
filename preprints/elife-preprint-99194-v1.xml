<title>Abstract</title><p>Biofilms are complex bacterial communities characterized by a high persister prevalence, which contributes to chronic and relapsing infections. Historically, biofilm persister formation has been linked to constraints imposed by their dense structures. However, we observed an elevated persister frequency accompanying the stage of cell adhesion, marking the onset of biofilm development. Subsequent mechanistic studies uncovered a distinctive type of toxin-antitoxin (TA) module triggered by cell adhesion, which is responsible for this elevation. In this module, the toxin HipH acts as a genotoxic deoxyribonuclease, inducing DNA double strand breaks and genome instability. While the second messenger c-di-GMP functions as the antitoxin, exerting control over HipH expression and activity. The dynamic interplay between c-di-GMP and HipH levels emerges as a crucial determinant governing genome stability and persister generation within biofilms. These findings unveil a unique TA system, where small molecules act as the antitoxin, outlining a biofilm-specific molecular mechanism influencing genome stability and antibiotic persistence, with potential implications for treating biofilm infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The prevalence of chronic and recurrent microbial infections has been significantly attributed to the formation of biofilms - complex, surface-attached bacterial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Costerton et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hall-Stoodley et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lewis, 2005</xref>). In biofilms, bacteria exhibit reduced antibiotic sensitivities, a phenomenon occurring independently of the presence of resistance determinants on genetic elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ceri et al, 1999</xref>). This antibiotic insensitivity is linked to the elevated prevalence of persister cells in biofilms, with rates ranging from 10 to 1000 times higher compared to their planktonic counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lewis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yan &amp; Bassler, 2019</xref>). Persister cells, recognized as phenotypic variants in an isogenic population, demonstrate a remarkable ability to withstand antibiotic treatment and, intriguingly, can resuscitate once the antibiotic pressure is alleviated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balaban et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bigger, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lewis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhou et al, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>These characteristics collectively position persister cells as key contributors to the perpetuation of persistent infections of biofilms. Moreover, while persister cells themselves may not carry genetic mutations associated with resistance, their survival mechanisms create conditions that foster the evolution of antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brauner et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fridman et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Levin-Reisman et al, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the high frequency in biofilms and critical roles in both clinical context and evolution processes, the mechanisms underlying biofilm persister formation are the subject of intense debate. The effects induced by high density, including nutrient and oxygen deficiency, and quorum sensing within dense structure of developed biofilms, have long been considered as primary factors leading to persister formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ganesan et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nguyen et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yan &amp; Bassler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yan et al, 2018</xref>). This association originally stems from the hypothesis of limitations in nutrient, oxygen, or antibiotic penetration into the dense structures. Nevertheless, recent challenges to this hypothesis have arisen from studies indicating that the matrix mesh size of biofilms is significantly larger than the size of molecules such as nutrients, oxygen, and antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ganesan et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yan &amp; Bassler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yan et al, 2018</xref>). Notably, most antibiotics do not strongly interact with biofilm matrix components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Spoering &amp; Lewis, 2001</xref>). An alternative perspective emerges from observations that cells in mature biofilms exhibit metabolic activity similar to cells in the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nguyen et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Walters et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Waters et al, 2016</xref>), during which the rate of persister cell formation significantly surpasses that of cells in the exponential phase. This phenomenon is likely attributed to nutrient exhaustion in the local environment surrounding mature biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nguyen et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Walters et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Waters et al, 2016</xref>). Meanwhile, some findings propose the involvement of specific genes in persister cell formation in biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhao et al, 2013</xref>), many of these observations are derived from research conducted under planktonic (free-swimming) conditions with bulk cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yan &amp; Bassler, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Studying a biofilm during its early developmental stage offers a unique vantage point, minimizing the impact of dense structure or nutrient exhaustion, thus allowing for a controlled exploration of intrinsic factors influencing persister cell formation. Cell-surface adhesion is the critical initiation step in the early stage of biofilm development, encompassing both reversible and irreversible processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berne et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tolker-Nielsen, 2015</xref>). During reversible adhesion, planktonic bacteria utilize surface appendages such as flagella and pili, fostering a weak attachment through van der Waals forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ren et al, 2018</xref>). Subsequently, these reversible adhered cells sense environmental cues linked to the surface, activating signaling pathways that lead to the synthesis of cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP). Elevated c-di-GMP levels function as a secondary messenger, orchestrating a shift in bacterial behavior by influencing the expression of genes crucial to biofilm development. This signaling cascade propels the transition from reversible to irreversible adhesion, wherein bacteria establish microcolonies on the surface, solidifying a more stable and irreversible connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jenal et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Valentini &amp; Filloux, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>To explore the intrinsic factors influencing persister cell formation during the early stages of biofilm development, we employed a static biofilm system for our investigation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This system is widely employed in research to scrutinize the pivotal processes of initial adherence during biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Biswas &amp; Mettlach, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Merritt et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Seviour et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sung et al, 2022</xref>). In our initial study, we noted an increased persister frequency coinciding with the step of cell adhesion. This observation prompted the hypothesis that elevated c-di-GMP levels in individual cells potentially facilitate the formation of persister cells within biofilms. Further investigation substantiated this hypothesis, demonstrating that the elevation in c-di-GMP indeed promotes the formation of persister cells. Our detailed analysis uncovered the role of c-di-GMP as an antitoxin, exerting control over both the expression and genotoxicity of HipH, thereby regulating genome stability and persister cell formation. These findings propose a biofilm-specific mechanism for antibiotic persistence. Notably, targeting this toxin-antitoxin system effectively inhibited drug tolerance in Uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (UPEC) infections, presenting promising therapeutic strategies against chronic and relapsing infections.</p>

<p>To enhance the clinical relevance of our study, we employed UPEC, the predominant cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and responsible for approximately 80% of cases. UPEC has a notable ability to form biofilms on various surfaces, including catheter materials, bladder epithelial cell walls, and within bladder cells (Supplementary Information). In our investigation, we selected the clinical isolate UPEC16. This strain demonstrates a significant phylogenetic similarity to established UPEC reference strains such as CFT073 and UTI89 (Fig. S1A). Moreover, it displays sensitivity to a wide range of antibiotics and possesses the capability for surface adhesion. To culture UPEC16 cells in the static biofilm system, exponential phase cells with an optical density (OD600) of 0.3 were diluted in 10-fold in fresh media, followed by static incubation in microtiter dishes for varying time intervals. Planktonic bacteria were then gently washed away, leaving adhered cells for further investigation. In the persister counting assay, both the remaining adhered cells and the removed planktonic cells were exposed to bactericidal antibiotics (ampicillin, 150 Î¼g/ml, 10-fold of MIC) for varying durations. Subsequently, persister counting was conducted through plating.</p>
<p>Biphasic killing curves revealed distinct patterns. When cells were subjected to the same duration of static culture, the persister rate within the adhered population notably surpassed that observed in the planktonic population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). Additionally, the persister rate within adhered populations exhibited a positive correlation with the prolonged duration of static culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). In contrast, the persister rate within planktonic populations displayed little variation with an extended duration of static culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). These observations underscore the crucial role of cell adhesion in promoting persister cell formation during the early stages of biofilm development. This raises questions about established ideas linking persister formation mainly with the dense structure of biofilms, suggesting a need to reconsider the factors that influence persister dynamics during biofilm initiation.â</p>

<title>The correlation between heightened c-di-GMP levels and increased persister frequency</title>
<p>The increase in c-di-GMP levels is a distinctive feature of cell-surface adhesion, marking the transition of cells from a planktonic lifestyle to a sessile one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fernandez et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jones et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Valentini &amp; Filloux, 2016</xref>). Building on our observations of increased persister rates upon cell adhesion, we assumed that elevated c-di-GMP levels might play a role in promoting persister cell formation. To investigate this hypothesis and discern the relationship between c-di-GMP levels and persister rates, we introduced a ratiometric fluorescent c-di-GMP sensing system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Vrabioiu &amp; Berg, 2022</xref>) into the UPEC16 strain. MrkH is a transcription factor derived from <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. The system utilizes the conformational changes that occur in MrkH upon binding to c-di-GMP by strategically inserting it into mVenus<sup>NB</sup> between residues Y145 and N146, resulting in the creation of the biosensor referred to as mVenus<sup>NB</sup>-MrkH. This strategic integration results in a ratiometrically reduced fluorescence signal when the biosensor is bound to varying levels of c-di-GMP. Furthermore, a red fluorescent protein mScarlet-I is co-expressed under the regulation of the <italic>proC</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Davis et al, 2011</xref>), enabling the normalization of the systemâs expression level. Consequently, the inverse of the ratio between mVenus<sup>NB</sup>-MrkH and mScarlet-I (R<sup>-1</sup>) exhibits a direct correlation with the intracellular level of c-di-GMP, establishing a reliable indicator for monitoring c-di-GMP dynamics in UPEC16 (Fig. S1B).</p>
<p>By monitoring the fluorescent intensity of the system at the single-cell level under a time-lapse microscope, we observed the dynamic activation of c-di-GMP during the process of cell adhesion. We imaged subpopulations on the surface at varied intervals. In the initial 30 minutes following static incubation in microtiter dishes, the adhered subpopulation displayed a sharply peaked R<sup>-1</sup> distribution with a low median of 0.64 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). As the attachment duration increased to 2 hours, the R<sup>-1</sup> distribution broadened, accompanied by a higher median of 0.93 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Further extension to 3.5 hours resulted in a continued broadening of the R<sup>-1</sup> distribution, accompanied by an even higher median of 1.18 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the R<sup>-1</sup> distribution of the planktonic subpopulation from the same culture system and time points remained low, with a median of 0.31 to 0.35, repectively (Fig. S1C-E). These findings replicate the observed positive correlation between c-di-GMP production and attachment duration. Moreover, the results suggest a positive association between c-di-GMP levels and the persister rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>).</p>
<p>Microcolonies emerged on the surface of microtiter dishes when the duration of static culture extended to 24 hours (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). We employed confocal laser scanning microscopy to monitor spatial distribution of c-di-GMP signals within these microcolonies. This investigation revealed a stratified pattern of c-di-GMP levels across the cross-section of the static biofilms (R<sup>-1</sup>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), highlighting the intricate regulatory role of this signaling molecule in shaping bacterial behavior and biofilm structure. Notably, cells with the highest c-di-GMP levels were surface attached, predominantly situated at the bottom layers of the biofilm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). To further investigate this observation, we isolated the surface attached cells and unattached cells in the biofilms for persister counting assay. The results demonstrate that this spatial distribution aligned with a subpopulation that exhibited the highest persister rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Furthermore, we resuspended the cells within the static biofilms and used FACS to isolate subpopulations with varying levels of c-di-GMP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). An antibiotic killing assay revealed that subpopulations with higher concentrations of c-di-GMP had a higher frequency of persister cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Time-lapse imaging also revealed that cells with high intracellular c-di-GMP levels survived antibiotic treatment and resuscitated to form microcolonies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). These findings collectively suggest that increased levels of cellular c-di-GMP play a crucial role in promoting persister formation.</p>

<p>To investigate the involvement of c-di-GMP in promoting the transition of persister phenotype in biofilms, we first constructed a UPEC16 strain with the ability to degrade c-di-GMP in a controlled manner. This was achieved through the overexpression of PdeH, an efficient c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase in <italic>E. coli</italic>, under the control of the araBAD promoter (pBAD::<italic>pdeH</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pesavento et al, 2008</xref>). Inducing PdeH expression before cell attachment disrupted cell adhesion, validating the efficacy of our system. Initiating with uninduced cells, we allowed them to adhere to a surface in a microliter dish (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). After a 2-hour incubation, we observed robust cell adhesion similar to the vector control, reflected in comparable c-di-GMP R<sup>-1</sup> medians. Following this initial observation, we replaced the old medium with fresh medium containing arabinose (0.2%) for PdeH induction. After an additional 30 minutes of incubation, we noted a substantial decrease in c-di-GMP R<sup>-1</sup> levels in the PdeH overexpression strain (median of 0.75) compared to the vector control strain (median of 0.98) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). Crucially, the biphasic killing curve showed significantly lower persister rates in adhered populations with PdeH overexpression compared to the vector control strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). These findings suggest that c-di-GMP plays a pivotal role in promoting persister cell formation during cell-surface adhesion.</p>

<p>In parallel, we engineered a UPEC16 strain overexpressing DgcZ, a highly efficient diguanylate cyclase responsible for synthesizing c-di-GMP, under the araBAD promoter (pBAD::<italic>dgcZ</italic>). In a consistent approach, we allowed the cells to adhere to a surface in a microliter dish before induction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). After a 2-hour incubation, we observed cell adhesion comparable to the vector control, reflected in similar c-di-GMP R<sup>-1</sup> medians. Subsequently, we replaced the old medium with fresh medium containing arabinose (0.2%) for DgcZ induction. Following an additional 30 minutes of incubation, we noted a substantial increase in c-di-GMP R<sup>-1</sup> levels in the DgcZ overexpression strain (median of 1.72) compared to the vector control strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Consistently, the biphasic killing curve indicated significantly higher persister rates in adhered populations with DgcZ overexpression compared to the vector control strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). These findings reinforce the critical role of c-di-GMP in promoting persister cell formation during cell-surface adhesion.</p>

<title>Toxin protein HipH acts downstream of c-di-GMP signaling in regulating persister formation in biofilms</title>
<p>Consistent with the observations in adherent cells, planktonic cells with DgcZ overexpression demonstrated a significant increase in the persister ratio (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Yet, cells overexpressing DgcZ-mutant (DgcZ-m, G206A, G207A, E208Q), which lacks diguanylate cyclase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boehm et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jonas et al, 2008</xref>), did not manifest a parallel increase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). These results reinforce that elevated levels of c-di-GMP play a key role in promoting persister cell transition. To explore the mechanisms by which elevated c-di-GMP levels promote bacterial persister formation, we employed a systematic screening approach using the <italic>E. coli</italic> Keio Knockout Collection (KEIO collection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Baba et al, 2006</xref>). Given that the K-12 strain, the background strain of the KEIO collection, might not be ideal for cell adhesion and biofilm formation, we initially introduced the pBAD::<italic>dgcZ</italic> construct into individual mutant strains. This allowed us to establish a background characterized by increased c-di-GMP levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Subsequently, persister counting assays were performed by exposing exponentially growing transformed strains to the antibiotic ampicillin at a concentration of 150 Î¼g/ml for a duration of 3 hours, followed by plating. This experimental design allowed us to assess the impact of upregulated c-di-GMP on persister cell formation within specific genetic backgrounds. Results show that knocking out the toxin gene <italic>hipH</italic> significantly reduces the frequency of persister formation in the presence of high levels of c-di-GMP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Meanwhile, the knockout of <italic>hipH</italic> alone does not lead to a significant alteration in persister frequency during the exponentially growing phase. These observations suggest that HipH acts downstream of c-di-GMP signaling in the process of persister formation and antibiotic tolerance. Considering HipH belongs to the family of HipA-like Ser/Thr kinases, we investigated the impact of knocking out <italic>hipA.</italic> In contrast, knocking out <italic>hipA</italic> had little effect on the frequency of persister formation with elevated c-di-GMP levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This observation suggests that HipH plays a distinct role from HipA in inducing persister formation.</p>

<p>Given that c-di-GMP exhibits upregulation in cell-surface adhesion, we conducted a <italic>hipH</italic> knockout in UPEC16 strain (UPEC16-Î<italic>hipH</italic>) and evaluated its influence on persister formation in biofilms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). In <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilms, we observed a substantial decrease in persister levels following <italic>hipH</italic> knockout, contrasting with the wild-type strain that consistently displayed notably high levels of persister cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). These results suggest that c-di-GMP regulated HipH toxicity plays a crucial role in persister formation of biofilms. For <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm formation, we introduced both the wild-type and UPEC16-Î<italic>hipH</italic> strains, each at a concentration of 2*10^8 CFU, into the mouse bladders through transurethral catheterization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Following 24 hours duration of infection, both strains exhibited comparable levels of intracellular bacterial communities (IBC) within the epithelial cells lining the bladder lumen (Fig. S2A-B).</p>
<p>Subsequently, the infected mice were sacrificed, and their bladders were isolated for colony counting assays and antibiotic killing assays. Consistent with the findings from <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilms, the wild-type UPEC16 strain displayed a notably high rate of persister formation. In contrast, the UPEC16-Î<italic>hipH</italic> strain exhibited a substantial reduction in persister cell frequency under the same conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). The impact of HipH knockout on persister formation is consistently observed in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> settings associated with biofilms, but not in planktonic populations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, left panel). These results reinforce HipH toxicity is under the regulation of c-di-GMP, and emphasize the significance of HipH in shaping the persistence and antibiotic tolerance characteristics of biofilms.</p>
<p>We observed a significant elevation in <italic>hipH</italic> gene expression upon the overexpression of DgcZ (pBAD::<italic>dgcZ</italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G-H</xref>). Conversely, the strain overexpressing DgcZ-m, which is unable to increase c-di-GMP levels after induction, exhibit no activation of <italic>hipH</italic> gene expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Furthermore, we labeled HipH with BFP at the C-terminal end and placed it under the <italic>hipH</italic> native promoter in the UPEC16 strain with c-di-GMP sensing system. Fluorescent imaging revealed a positive correlation between HipH and c-di-GMP expression at the single-cell level (Fig. S3A), supported by a correlation coefficient of 0.694 (Fig. S3B). Additionally, we engineered an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain in which <italic>hipH</italic> promoter is replaced by the constitutive promoter p-rhaB (Fig. S3C). In this strain, <italic>hipH</italic> expression remains unaffected by changes in c-di-GMP levels (Fig. S3D), indicating that regulation occurs at the promoter region. Furthermore, the persister ratio was comparable to that of the Î<italic>hipH</italic> strain but significantly lower than that of wild-type strain under high c-di-GMP levels (Fig. S3E). These results together suggest that c-di-GMP exerts a transcriptional regulatory role in controlling the expression of HipH.</p>

<title>c-di-GMP and HipH form a toxin-antitoxin module</title>
<p>We then independently overexpressed HipH (pBAD::<italic>hipH</italic>) to observe its impact on cell growth. The results demonstrated that HipH overexpression substantially inhibit cell growth, with only 9.8Â±3.4% of cells retaining growth potential (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). Further analysis of the growth-inhibited cells revealed a predominant presence of Viable but Non-Culturable (VBNC) cells, constituting 72Â±5% of the total cell population, alongside a significant proportion of dead cells, accounting for 17.9Â±2.3% of the total cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>). This evidence suggests that HipH functions as a potent toxin capable of inhibiting cell growth or even inducing cell death. Interestingly, despite the observed decrease in growth potential, the persister rate remains low as that of wild-type strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>). This phenomenon is interpreted as cells entering a state of deep dormancy with reduced resuscitation capabilities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the role of c-di-GMP as an antitoxin in alleviating the toxic effect of HipH, we elevated intracellular c-di-GMP levels by overexpressing DosC, a moderately efficient diguanylate cyclase, or DgcZ, a highly efficient diguanylate cyclase, in the strain overexpressing HipH. This manipulation resulted in a 2.72-fold and 4.22-fold increase in the mean of c-di-GMP R<sup>-1</sup> score, respectively (Fig. S3F). Comparing to the strain overexpressing HipH alone, those strains co-overexpressing HipH and c-di-GMP exhibited a significantly recovered growth potential (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). Specifically, 36Â±6.7% of cells retained growth potential in the strain expressing HipH and DosC, while approximately 85Â±18% retained growth potential in the strain expressing HipH and DgcZ. Further analyzing the portion of growth-inhibited cells revealed that the strain overexpressing HipH and DosC exhibited a decreased rate of VBNC cells (62Â±6% of the total cell population) and dead cells (2.1Â±0.2% of the total cell population) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>). The strain overexpressing HipH and DgcZ showed an even lower rate of VBNCs (14Â±17% of the total cell population) and dead cells (1.5Â±0.4% of the total cell population) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>). These results support the assumption that c-di-GMP acts as an effective antitoxin, enabling HipH-toxified cells to recover their growth potential. Consistently, increased rates of persister cells were observed, with 10^-2.8Â±0.19 in the strain overexpressing HipH and DosC, and 10^-2.5Â±0.34 in the strain overexpressing HipH and DgcZ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>). These results collectively indicate that c-di-GMP functions as an antitoxin in alleviating HipHâs harmful effects, steering cells from deep dormancy depth to a shallower dormancy state with enhanced resuscitation capabilities, thereby promoting persister cell formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref>).</p>

<title>HipH is a deoxyribonuclease inducing genome instability</title>
<p><italic>hipH</italic> stands out as an atypical toxin gene due to its lack of a genetically linked antitoxin cognate, existing as a solitary gene unlike the typical toxin-antitoxin gene pairs found within the same operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jurenas et al, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Maeda et al, 2017</xref>).

<p>Structure analysis revealed that, in addition to its kinase catalytic motif (amino acid 340-372), HipH also contains a DNA binding HTH domain (amino acid 11-32), a gly loop and autophosphorylation site (amino acid 190-215), and an activation loop (amino acid 222-229) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). To identify the specific domain responsible for its toxicity, we generated various truncated mutants and evaluated their capacity in inhibiting cell growth. Our results showed that overexpression of mutants lacking the DNA binding domain HTH (Î1 and Î2) did not inhibit cell growth or induce VBNCs or dead cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-C</xref>). This indicates that the DNA binding domain HTH is indispensable for the observed toxicity of HipH. Consistent with these results, fluorescent microscopy confirmed the nucleoid localization of wild-type HipH (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), indicating that the primary function of HipH is related to DNA interaction.</p>
<p>We observed the elongated filamentous shape induced by HipH overexpression in cells (Fig. S4A), which is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gratani et al, 2023</xref>). We interpret this as a potential characteristic associated with DNA damage. Furthermore, considering the results of the truncated mutation assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>), we hypothesize that HipH plays a role in inducing DNA damage. To investigate this hypothesis, we first examined whether HipH overexpression induces the SOS response, a bacterial defense mechanism against DNA damage involving the expression of various genes. qPCR analysis revealed a significant upregulation of SOS response genes, such as <italic>recA</italic>, <italic>sulA</italic>, and <italic>tisB</italic>, in cells overexpressing HipH (Fig. S4B). Notably, the near abolition of cell growth potential upon knockout of <italic>recA,</italic> a crucial protein essential for DNA damage repair, in cells overexpressing HipH further supports the conclusion that HipH induces DNA damage (Fig. S4C).</p>
<p>To investigate the specific type of DNA damage caused by HipH, we conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA-cleaving assays using purified HipH. To address its insolubility, we engineered a fusion construct with a high solubility protein, GFP, at the C-terminal end to facilitate protein purification. The results demonstrated HipHâs capability to cleave supercoiled plasmids, leading to the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs), as evidenced by prominent smears observed on agarose gels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-G</xref>). Further analysis revealed a positive correlation between HipHâs DNA cleavage capacity and its protein concentration, temperature, and incubation time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-G</xref>). These findings collectively indicate that HipH cleaves DNA and produces DSBs. The overexpression of RecG, a key player in the repair of DSBs in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Whitby et al, 1994</xref>),</p>
<p>successfully rescued growth deficient cells resulting from HipH overexpression (Fig. S4D), providing additional evidence that HipH induces DSBs in DNA. These compelling results demonstrate that HipH functions as a deoxyribonuclease, exerting genotoxic effects on genomic DNA integrity.</p>

<title>c-di-GMP acts as an antitoxin to alleviate HipH genotoxicity</title>
<p>To investigate whether c-di-GMP plays as an antitoxin to mitigate HipH genotoxicity, we first explored the potential of direct interaction between c-di-GMP and HipH. A biotinylated c-di-GMP pull-down assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chambers &amp; Sauer, 2017</xref>), conducted from both cell lysate and purified protein, revealed a physical binding between c-di-GMP and HipH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-D</xref>, Fig. S5A-B), confirming their direct interaction. The dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>), calculated based on the concentration of c-di-GMP at which half-maximal binding of HipH occurs, was determined as 7.6 Î¼M (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, bottom panel). Additionally, c-di-GMP successfully displaced HipH-GFP-His from HipH-GFP-His/biotin-c-di-GMP complexes, while other nucleotides such as cAMP and GTP did not exhibit the same effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>).

<p>Subsequently, we introduced c-di-GMP into the HipH DNA-cleavage assay system, and notably, its addition exerted a significant suppressive effect on the cleavage activity of HipH. This effect was observed for both relaxed and supercoiled plasmids, as evidenced by a reduction of smears and double-strand break (DSB) bands on agarose gels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-I</xref>). It is noteworthy that other nucleotides, including cAMP and GTP, did not demonstrate the same suppressive effect on HipHâs cleavage activity (Fig. S5C). Furthermore, it has been reported that HipB serves as an antitoxin for HipH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gratani et al, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Maeda et al, 2017</xref>). However, when we tested the potential impact of HipB on HipHâs DNase activity by purifying and introducing HipB into our cleavage system, we found that HipB failed to inhibit HipHâs DNase activity (Fig. S5C). These findings suggest that c-di-GMP specifically interacts with HipH, leading to the inhibition of its DNase activity.</p>
<p>To monitor DNA breakage in live bacterial cells with varying stoichiometry between HipH and c-di-GMP, we utilized Gam-GFP, a double-strand DNA end-binding protein of bacteriophage Mu that forms foci at DSBs in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shee et al, 2013</xref>). Microscopic examination revealed that cells overexpressing HipH alone displayed Gam-GFP foci in 8.85Â±1.28% of cases, while only 0.30Â±0.12% of wild-type cells demonstrated such foci (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J-K</xref>). Further investigations showed that elevation of intracellular c-di-GMP levels resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage of cells with Gam-GFP foci, with DosC addition decreasing the occurrence to 1.34Â±0.39% and DgcZ to 0.46Â±0.19% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J-K</xref>).

<p>In the intricate biofilm dynamics, the origin of persister formation has largely been ascribed to the constraints imposed by the dense structures, such as limited nutrients, oxygen, and antibiotics penetration, or quorum sensing. Our investigation reveals that cell adhesion, a pivotal event initiating biofilm development, emerges as a trigger for persister formation. This concept introduces a layer of complexity that reshapes our understanding of drug tolerance in biofilms. Beyond the traditional emphasis on dense biofilm structures, the scope should now encompass single-layer cells on the surface. Such a deviation from conventional perspectives highlights the necessity for a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to address the challenges of antibiotic efficacy within biofilm communities.</p>
<p>c-di-GMP emerges as a pivotal secondary messenger in the intricate orchestration of bacterial lifestyles, playing a key role in mediating cell-surface adhesion and exerting influence over the transition from planktonic to sessile existence. Our comprehensive exploration, employing a spectrum of techniques, brings to light a significant revelation: heightened levels of c-di-GMP in cells drive the formation of persisters. Contrary to conventional understanding, this system unveils a unique function for c-di-GMPâit acts as a noncanonical antitoxin, which controls both the expression and genotoxicity of toxin protein HipH. Within this framework, c-di-GMP, a small molecule with just two guanine bases, takes on the role of an antitoxin, counterbalancing the toxin. This discovery challenges established toxin-antitoxin (TA) system norms, in which antitoxins typically manifest as proteins or RNA molecules directly encoded from gene pairs within the same operon of toxin. The unconventional role of c-di-GMP as an antitoxin redefines our comprehension of the molecular players orchestrating persister formation, adding a layer of complexity to the regulatory mechanisms governing bacterial adaptation to sessile lifestyle.</p>
<p>HipH emerges as an intriguing toxin within the bacterial realm, standing apart due to its solitary existence without a genetically linked antitoxin cognateâan uncommon trait in known toxin-antitoxin systems. Previous studies have identified HipH as a Ser/Thr protein kinase, sharing homology with the well-characterized toxin HipA. These studies demonstrated its primary protein substrates to be the ribosomal protein RpmE (L31) and the carbon storage regulator CsrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gratani et al, 2023</xref>). While the overproduction of HipH was observed to impact bacterial DNA segregation and cell division, the underlying mechanism remained unexplained. In this study, we have uncovered that HipH primarily functions as a potent DNase, providing an explanation for the observed phenomenon. Our findings further reveal that that HipH, as a potent DNase, induces a deep cell dormancy depth and elevated rates of VBNC cells and dead cells, rather than persister cells with the capacity of resuscitation. Significantly, our investigation further sheds light on the regulation of HipH genotoxicity by c-di-GMP in a dual manner.</p>
<p>Firstly, high intracellular levels of c-di-GMP induce HipH expression. Subsequently, c-di-GMP acts as an antitoxin, mitigating the potent toxicity of HipH. This, in turn, maintains cells with an adequate dormancy depth, facilitating the formation of persister cells and conferring antibiotic tolerance. It is intriguing to delve deeper into research exploring the domain-function relationship in HipH. However, our efforts have often encountered challenges, as mutations can readily induce protein aggregates, impeding thorough analysis. Achieving a comprehensive understanding of this domain-function relationship necessitates the development of innovative methodologies and approaches.</p>
<p>Taken together, we reveal a sophisticated regulatory circuit underlying bacterial genome instability and antibiotic persistence in biofilms. This regulated genome instability can have significant implications for adaptive potential of bacterial populations, shaping their ability to persist, evolve, and develop resistance mechanisms. By targeting this c-di-GMP regulated genotoxicity of toxin protein HipH, we successfully inhibited drug tolerance in UPEC induced biofilms. These findings provide potential therapeutic strategies for combating chronic and relapsing infections associated with biofilms.</p>

<p>Bacterial strains used in this study included <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains MG1655, BW25113, UPEC16, and the Keio library Knockout Collection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). UPEC16 was isolated from a urine sample (#16) obtained from a local urinary tract infection (UTI) patient at the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, following the guidelines of the Committee on Human Subject Research and Ethics (2022-L-203 and CHSRE2022030). The genome sequence has been deposited in the National Genomics Data Center under the accession number âGWHERGI00000000â. All strains were cultured in Luria Broth (LB) medium, with routine growth condition at 37Â°C and 220 rpm. To support plasmid maintenance, media were supplemented with the corresponding antibiotics as needed: chloramphenicol (25 Âµg/ml), kanamycin (20 Âµg/ml), gentamicin (20 Âµg/ml), and ampicillin (100 Âµg/ml). For inducible expression experiments, the medium was supplemented with induces such as 0.002%-0.2% arabinose for the Arabinose-induction system, 1 mM IPTG for the Lac-induction system, and 1 Âµg/ml anhydrotetracycline for the Tet-induction system.</p>

<title>Construction of Target DNA Knockout</title>
<p>The generation of target DNA knockout strains involved the use of Î»-red mediated gene replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Datsenko &amp; Wanner, 2000</xref>). In this procedure, a 500 bp upstream region of the target DNA sequence, a resistance cassette for substitution (CmR for UPEC16 Î<italic>hipH</italic>, GmR for UPEC16 Î<italic>araD-B</italic>), and a 500 bp downstream region of the target DNA sequence were fused through fusion PCR. The resulting fusion fragments were then transformed into electrocompetent cells along with a recombineering helper plasmid, pSim6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Datta et al, 2006</xref>). After a recovery period of 3-5 hours, the transformed cells were plated on selection plates containing the corresponding antibiotics. The antibiotic-selected recombinant colonies were subsequently validated through PCR analysis and sequencing. Finally, the correct recombinants were incubated at 42Â°C to eliminate the temperature-sensitive helper plasmid pSim6.</p>

<title>Recombinant Plasmid Construction</title>
<p>Construction of recombinant plasmids was performed using the 2 Ã MultiF Seamless Assembly Mix (ABclonal, RK21020). To tag HipH, <italic>hipH</italic>, together with its native promoter, was fused with Blue Fluorescent Protein gene <italic>bfp</italic> and inserted into the pBAD backbone by <italic>in vitro</italic> recombination. For Gam-GFP overexpression, the <italic>gam</italic> gene from bacteriophage Mu was fused with Green Fluorescent Protein gene <italic>gfp</italic> and inserted into a p15A ori plasmid by <italic>in vitro</italic> recombination.

<title>Static biofilm culture</title>
<p>The methodology employed in this study was adapted from the established one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Merritt et al, 2005</xref>). Bacterial strains of interest were initially inoculated in a 3-to-5-ml culture in tubes and allowed to grow overnight. Subsequently, the stationary cultures were diluted 1:100 in the desired media and cultured until reaching the exponential phase with an OD600 of 0.3. Next, 2 ml of each diluted culture was transferred into a fresh microtiter dish (Biosharp, Cat#BS-20-GJM), which has not been undergo tissue culture treatment. In cases where the subsequent experiment involves imaging, it is necessary to ensure that the microtiter dish has a glass bottom. The plate was covered and incubated at optimal growth temperature for the desired amount of time. While the lids for the microtiter dishes are reusable, it is important to clean them with 70% (v/v) ethanol and allow them to air-dry prior to each experiment.</p>
<p>For cultures involving PdeH or DgcZ induction, it is important to statically incubate cells in microtiter dish for 2 hours at 37Â°C first. This incubation period allows cells adherence to the surface. Subsequently, the inducer arabinose was added to the desired concentration to initiate protein induction with desired duration.</p>

<title>Antibiotic killing assay and persister counting</title>
<p>For cells from static culture, planktonic cells were directly transferred into new tubes and harvested by centrifugation. The remained microliter dishes were gently washed twice by PBS buffer, and adherent cells were harvested by vigorous pipetting. In other cases, the cells were harvested routinely.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the harvested cells directly plated on LB plate for colony-forming unit (CFU) counting without antibiotic challenge.</p>
<p>The harvested cells were washed with PBS buffer and subsequently resuspended into fresh LB containing 150 Î¼g/ml ampicillin and incubated for varying durations (0 to 4.5 hours) at 37Â°C with shaking at 220 rpm. The survived cells after ampicillin challenge were harvested by centrifugation and diluted in PBS, followed by plating on LB plate for overnight culture at 37Â°C. Persister counting was performed on the next day. Persister ratios were calculated as the ratio of the CFU after antibiotic treatment to the CFU without antibiotics challenge. At least three biological replicates were performed for each experiment.</p>

<title>Cell growth potential assay and VBNC determination</title>
<p>To evaluate growth potential, bacterial cells were cultured to exponential phase in LB medium to an OD600 of 0.3. For strains harboring an arabinose-induction system for specific protein expression, 0.002% arabinose (w/v) was added to the medium for 3 to 4 hours at 37Â°C with shaking at 220 rpm. The cells were then plated for colony-forming unit (CFU) counting on LB plates before and after arabinose induction. The cells with growth potential were determined as the ratio of CFUs after arabinose induction to CFUs before arabinose induction. The dead cells ratio was assessed by staining with PI dye. The ratio of VBNC cells was calculated as 100% minus the sum of the ratios of cells with growth potential and dead cells. Averages and standard deviations presented are representative of three biological replicates.</p>

<title>Bright-field and fluorescence imaging</title>
<p>Inverted microscope Nikon (eclipse Ti2) and confocal microscope (Leica, Stellaris 5 WLL) were used in this study. The illumination was provided by different lasers, at wavelengths 405 nm for BFP and Hoechst 33258, 488 nm for GFP and SYTO<sup>TM</sup>24, 488 nm (Nikon) or 515 nm (Leica) for mVenus<sup>NB</sup>, 561 nm for propidium iodide (PI) and mScarlet-I, respectively.

<title>Gam-GFP foci imaging</title>
<p>The method employed in this study was adapted from the established one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shee et al, 2013</xref>). Cells expressing toxin protein HipH along with DosC or DgcZ under the arabinose-induction system and expressing Gam-GFP under Tetracycline-induction system were cultured to exponential phase in LB medium with supplement of adequate antibiotics for plasmid maintenance. Gam-GFP was induced by 1 Î¼g/ml anhydrotetracycline for 30 minutes and then HipH and DosC (or DgcZ) were induced by 0.2% (w/v) arabinose for 2.5 h at 37Â°C and 220 rpm. The cells were washed twice using PBS buffer and then visualized under a fluorescence microscope. The Gam-GFP foci were analyzed using ImageJ software from the individual cell intensity histograms. At least four neighboring pixels, each with an individual fluorescence intensity (f) greater than 1.2 times the mean fluorescence intensity of the cell (a), were deemed as foci. Meanwhile, the area occupied by these pixels needed to be less than one-fifth of the total bacterial area.</p>

<p>This preprint explores the involvement of cyclic di-GMP in genome stability and antibiotic persistence regulation in bacterial biofilms. The authors proposed a novel mechanism that, due to bacterial adhesion, increases c-di-GMP levels and influences persister formation through interaction with HipH. While the work may provide <bold>useful</bold> insights that could attract researchers in biofilm studies and persistence mechanisms, the main findings are <bold>inadequately</bold> supported and require further validation and refinement in experimental design.</p>

<p>The authors propose a UPEC TA system in which a metabolite, c-di-GMP, acts as the AT with the toxin HipH. The idea is novel, but several key ideas are missing in regard to the relevant literature, and the experimental design is flawed. Moreover, they are absolutely not studying persister cells as Figure 1b clearly shows they are merely studying dying cells since no plateau in killing (or anything close to a plateau) was reached. So in no way has persistence been linked to c-di-GMP. Moreover, I do not think the authors have shown how the c-di-GMP sensor works. Also, there is no evidence that c-di-GMP is an antitoxin as no binding to HipH has been shown. So at best, this is an indirect effect, not a new toxin/antitoxin system as for all 7 TAs, a direct link to the toxin has been demonstrated for antitoxins.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) L 53: biofilm persisters are no different than any other persisters (there is no credible evidence of any different persister cells) so this reviewer suggests changing 'biofilm persisters' to 'persisters' throughout the text.</p>
<p>(2) L 51: persister cells do not mutate and, once resuscitated, mutate like any other growing cell so this sentence should be deleted as it promotes an unnecessary myth about persistence.</p>
<p>(3) L 69: please include the only metabolic model for persister cell formation and resuscitation here based on single cells (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.01.102">doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.01.102</ext-link> , <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2019.100792">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2019.100792</ext-link> ); otherwise, you write as if there are no molecular mechanisms for persistence/resuscitation.</p>
<p>(4) The authors should cite in the Intro or Discussion that others have proposed similar novel TAs including a ppGpp metabolic toxin paired with an enzymatic antitoxin SpoT that hydrolyzes the toxin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.04.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.04.002</ext-link>).</p>
<p>(5) Figure 1b: there are no results in this paper related to persister cells. Figure 1b simply shows dying cells were enumerated. Hence, the population of stressed cells increased, not 'persister cells' (Figure 1f), in the course of these experiments.</p>
<p>(6) Figure S1: I see no evidence that the authors have shown this c-di-GMP detects different c-di-GMP levels since there appears to be no data related to varying c-di-GMP concentrations with a consistent decrease. Instead, there is a maximum. What are the concentration of c-di-GMP on the X-axis for panels C, D, and E? How were c-di-GMP levels varied such that you know the c-di-GMP concentration?</p>
<p>(7) The viable portion of the VBNC population are persister cells so there is no reason to use VBNC as a separate term. Please see the reported errors often made with nucleic acid staining dyes in regard to VBNCs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Hebin et al reported a fascinating story about antibiotic persistence in the biofilms. First, they set up a model to identify the increased persisters in the biofilm status. They found that the adhesion of bacteria to the surface leads to increased c-di-GMP levels, which might lead to the formation of persisters. To figure out the molecular mechanism, they screened the E.coli Keio Knockout Collection and identified the HipH. Finally, the authors used a lot of data to prove that c-di-GMP not only controls HipH over-expression but also inhibits HipH activity, though the inhibition might be weak.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>They used a lot of state-of-the-art technologies, such as single-cell technologies as well as classical genetic and biochemistry approaches to prove the concept, which makes the conclusions very solid. Overall, it is a very interesting and solid story that might attract diverse readers working with c-di-GMP, persisters, and biofilm.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Is HipH the only target identified by screening the E.coli Keio Knockout Collection?</p>
<p>(2) Since the story is complicated, a diagrammatic picture might be needed to illustrate the whole story. And the title does not accurately summarize the novelty of this study.</p>
<p>(3) The ratio of mVenus NB to mScarlet-I (R) negatively correlates with the concentration of c-di-GMP. Therefore, R -1 demonstrates a positive correlation with the concentration of c-di-GMP. Is this method validated with other methods to quantify c-di-GMPï¼ or used in other studiesï¼</p>
<p>(4) References are missing throughout the manuscript. Please add enough references for every conclusion.</p>
<p>(5) The novelty of this study should be clearly written and compared with previous references. For example, is it the first study to report the mechanism that the adhesion of bacteria to the surface leads to increased persister formation?</p>
<p>(6) in vitro DNA cleavage assay. Why not use bacterial genomic DNA to test the cleaving of HipH on the bacterial genome?</p>
<p>(7) C-di-gmp -HipH is not a TA, it does not fit in the definition of the TA systems. You can say C-di-gmp is an antitoxin based on your study, but C-di-gmp -HipH is not a TA pair.</p>
