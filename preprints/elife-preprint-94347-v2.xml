<title>Summary</title><p>Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causes significant human disease that, with no approved treatment or vaccine, constitutes a major public health concern. Its life cycle entirely relies on the cytoplasmic fate of the viral RNA genome (vRNA) through a fine-tuned equilibrium between vRNA translation, replication and packaging into new virions, all within virus-induced replication organelles (vRO). In this study, with an RNAi mini-screening and subsequent functional characterization, we have identified insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) as a new host dependency factor that regulates vRNA synthesis. In infected cells, IGF2BP2 associates with viral NS5 polymerase and redistributes to the perinuclear viral replication compartment. Combined fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization-based confocal imaging, <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays, and immunoprecipitation coupled to RT-qPCR, showed that IGF2BP2 directly interacts with ZIKV vRNA 3’-nontranslated region. Using ZIKV sub-genomic replicons and a replication-independent vRO induction system, we demonstrated that IGF2BP2 knockdown impairs <italic>de novo</italic> viral organelle biogenesis and, consistently, vRNA synthesis. Finally, the analysis of immunopurified IGF2BP2 complex using quantitative mass spectrometry and RT-qPCR, revealed that ZIKV infection alters the protein and RNA interactomes of IGF2BP2. Altogether, our data support that ZIKV hijacks and remodels the IGF2BP2 ribonucleoprotein complex to regulate vRO biogenesis and vRNA neosynthesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is the causative agent in several epidemics in the last 10 years, with the biggest outbreak in Latin America in 2015, making ZIKV a major public health concern. ZIKV belongs to the <italic>Orthoflavivirus</italic> genus within the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family which comprises over 70 arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV) and yellow fever virus. Similar to the closely related DENV, ZIKV is primarily transmitted to humans by <italic>Aedes</italic> spp mosquito bites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) and can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. When vertically transmitted to a fetus during pregnancy, this neurotropic virus can infect the placenta as well as neural progenitor cells, microglial cells and astrocytes in the developing brain, which may eventually cause severe microcephaly in newborns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Unfortunately, no antiviral treatments against ZIKV or prophylactic vaccines are currently approved. It is thus important to better understand the molecular mechanisms controlling the ZIKV replication in order to identify new therapeutic targets. ZIKV is a single-stranded positive sense enveloped RNA virus. Its ∼11 kb-long viral RNA (vRNA) genome is composed of an open reading frame flanked by 5’ and 3’nontranslated regions (NTR). The vRNA plays a central role in different steps of the viral replication cycle including being translated to produce all viral proteins, is used as template for genome neosynthesis and is selectively packaged into assembling viral particles. The vRNA, translated at the ER membrane, encodes one polyprotein which is matured into 10 viral proteins. Three structural proteins (C, prM and E), together with vRNA assemble new viral particles, and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) are responsible for vRNA neosynthesis, via the activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5 along with the contribution of other viral proteins and host factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). To efficiently replicate, orthoflaviviruses have evolved to establish a fine-tuned equilibrium between vRNA translation, replication and encapsidation steps since they cannot occur simultaneously. However, the mechanisms underlying the spatio-temporal fate of vRNA remain elusive. These processes occur in viral replication organelles (vRO) which result from major alterations of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are believed to coordinate in time and space the steps of the life cycle, notably through the spatial segregation of the vRNA, at different steps of the life cycle. vROs accumulate in a large cage-like compartment which is located in the perinuclear area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Three architectures of these viral organelles-like ultrastructures have been described: vesicle packets (VP), virus bags (VB), and convoluted membranes (CM). The VPs resulting from ER invagination, are spherical vesicles with a diameter of approximately 90 nm connected to the cytosol through a 10 nm-wide pore-like opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). They are believed to host vRNA synthesis. Indeed, the non-structural proteins NS5, NS3, NS1, NS4A and NS4B, absolutely required for vRNA replication, and also double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the viral RNA replication intermediate, are enriched in VPs as imaged by immunogold labeling followed by transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). It has been proposed that the RNA genome exit VPs through their pore to be directly packaged into assembling particles budding into the ER lumen. Immature virions geometrically accumulate in dilated ER cisternae referred to as virus bags (VB). The viral and cellular determinants of vRO biogenesis are poorly understood mostly because this process will be impacted (even indirectly) by any perturbations of viral replication efficiency and hence, viral factors abundance. The recent advent of replication-independent VP induction systems identified several determinants of <italic>de novo</italic> VP biogenesis, most notably including, ZIKV NS4A, NS1 and 3’NTR RNA, as well as host factors ATL2, VCP and RACK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>
<p>Multiple reports have shown that cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBP) regulate the replication, translation and/or encapsidation of vRNA often through associations with 5’ or 3’ NTRs (for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)). For instance, YBX1 associates with 3’ NTR of DENV vRNA and regulates both vRNA translation and viral particle production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether all these proteins are co-opted and regulate replication within a single ribonucleprotein (RNP) complex. In case of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> from the <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> genus, it was shown that the YBX1 RNP comprising HCV vRNA, IGF2BP2, LARP1, DDX6 and other cell proteins regulates the equilibrium between viral RNA replication and infectious particle production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). However, it is unknown whether this is a conserved co-opting mechanism in the <italic>Orthoflavivirus</italic> genus (which belongs also to the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family) and if so, whether these viruses modulate the composition of this complex to rewire its functions in favor of replication. Finally, considering that the 3’ NTR of vRNA is a key player of vRO morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), this raises the hypothesis that this viral process involves host vRNA-binding proteins prior to vRNA synthesis.</p>
<p>To determine whether the co-opting of these RNA-binding proteins was conserved in the <italic>Orthoflavivirus</italic> genus, we have assessed in this study the potential role of 10 host RBPs in ZIKV and DENV replication. We have identified insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) as a new host dependency factor for the ZIKV life cycle which regulates vRNA synthesis. In infected cells, IGF2BP2 associates with NS5 viral polymerase and vRNA 3’NTR. Importantly, IGF2BP2 impairs <italic>de novo</italic> vRO biogenesis and consistently, vRNA synthesis. Finally, ZIKV infection alters the protein and RNA interactomes of IGF2BP2. Altogether, our data support that ZIKV hijacks and remodels the IGF2BP2 ribonucleoprotein complex, to regulate vRO biogenesis and vRNA neosynthesis.</p>

<title>IGF2BP2 regulates ZIKV replication cycle</title>
<p>To identify new cellular proteins regulating ZIKV and DENV vRNA functions during viral replication, we hypothesized that these orthoflaviviruses have evolved to share conserved host co-opting mechanisms with HCV which belongs to the <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> genus within the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family like the <italic>Orthoflavivirus</italic> genus. Based on our previous work with host RBPs regulating HCV life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), we performed a targeted small scale RNA interference (RNAi) screening assessing the requirement of 10 host RBPs for ZIKV and DENV replication. Protein knockdown (KD) in human hepatocarcinoma Huh7.5 cells was achieved through the transduction of short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing lentiviruses, whose respective efficiencies in this cell line were previously validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). None of these shRNA had any impact on cell viability as measured by MTT assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Two days post transduction, cells were infected with pathogenic contemporary ZIKV H/PF/2013 strain (Asian lineage), ancestral ZIKV MR766 strain (African lineage) or serotype 2 DENV2 16681s strain. Two days post-infection (dpi), infectious viral particle production was measured by plaque assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). The KD of DEAD-box helicases RHA (RNA helicase A, also named DHX9), DDX6, DDX21 or DDX5 had no significant impact in virus production when compared to the non-target control shRNA (shNT). In contrast, the knockdowns of IGF2BP2 and LARP1 resulted in significant decrease and increase in the titers of both ZIKV strains, respectively. The observed phenotype was specific to ZIKV since no significant impact was observed for DENV. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>).</p>

<p>To validate these phenotypes, we took advantage of ZIKV FSS13025 strain-based reporter viruses expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc), whose activity in infected cells can be used as a read-out of overall vRNA replication (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). IGF2BP2 KD resulted in a significant 60% decrease in viral replication. In contrast, LARP1 KD had no stimulatory effect on viral replication, suggesting a role of this host factor in virus assembly and/or release. Of note YBX1, YBX2 and DDX3 KD all resulted in a decrease in ZIKV replication although this did not translate into impacts in virus titers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-F</xref>). We decided to focus further investigation on IGF2BP2 since it was our best candidate in terms of ZIKV replication impairment upon knockdown (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). First, western blotting and RT-qPCR with transduced Huh7.5 cell lysates validated that IGF2BP2 was efficiently knocked down upon transduction at both protein and mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>), which correlated with a 74% decrease in ZIKV production (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and reductions in the expression of viral proteins NS3, NS4A and NS5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Comparable impairment of ZIKV titers upon IGF2BP2 knockdown was observed in other cell lines relevant for ZIKV pathogenesis, namely human immortalized astrocytes (NHA-hTERT; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and cancer-derived trophoblasts (JEG-3; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) as well as for a third wild-type ZIKV strain in Huh7.5 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), <italic>i.e</italic> ZIKV FSS13025 (Asian lineage, isolated in Cambodia in 2010).</p>

<p>Our initial screen showed that IGF2BP2 KD had minimal impact on DENV2 replication, suggesting a ZIKV-specific phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). To confirm this, we have included in our workflow four additional strains of DENV representing the four known serotypes. IGF2BP2 knockdown did not changed the production of DENV1, DENV2 or DENV4, while DENV3 replication was only slightly decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-E</xref>). As control, treatment with NITD008, an inhibitor of flaviviral NS5 polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) completely abrogated viral particle production for all orthoflaviviruses tested. Finally, IGF2BP2 KD had no impact on the replication of either WNV, another orthoflavivirus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3F</xref>), or of SARS-CoV-2, another positive strand RNA virus from the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Overall, these data clearly show that the IGF2BP2 is a specific host dependency factor for ZIKV replication.</p>

<title>IGF2BP2 redistributes to ZIKV replication complexes in infected cells</title>
<p>Following the observations that IGF2BP2 is a ZIKV host dependency factor, we investigated the impact of ZIKV infection on IGF2BP2 expression and subcellular distribution. We performed western blotting on extracts of either uninfected or ZIKV-infected Huh7.5 cells. IGF2BP2 expression remained unchanged at 2 and 3 days post-infection in contrast to DDX3 and DDX5 whose levels were decreased over the course of infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Then, we investigated the localization of IGF2BP2 in infected cells using confocal microscopy. In uninfected cell, IGF2BP2 exhibited a homogenous distribution throughout the cytoplasm. In ZIKV-infected cells, an accumulation of IGF2BP2 in areas enriched for NS3 and viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was observed at 2 days post-infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), correlating with a partial colocalization with NS3 and dsRNA (Manders’ coefficients of 0.45±0.04 and 0.46±0.04, respectively). dsRNA is an intermediate of vRNA replication and hence, anti-dsRNA antibodies detect replication complexes, which along with VPs, typically accumulate in a cage-like region in the perinuclear area with viral proteins required for vRNA replication step, such as NS3 and NS5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). This compartment is typically surrounded by NS3-positive convoluted membranes which are devoid of dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).

<p>The relocalization of IGF2BP2 into the replication compartment raised the hypothesis that this protein interacts with viral proteins involved in vRNA replication. To test this, we generated Huh7.5 cells stably expressing HA-tagged IGF2BP2 to subsequently perform co-immunoprecipitation assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). As control, we first confirmed that this tagged recombinant protein, similarly to endogenous IGF2BP2, also redistributed to the dsRNA-positive area in ZIKV infected cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). We next performed anti-HA immunoprecipitations with extracts from uninfected and ZIKV infected cells. Western blot analysis of immunopurified complexes showed that IGF2BP2-HA specifically associates with ZIKV NS5 polymerase but not with NS3 protease/helicase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-D</xref>).

<title>IGF2BP2 associates with ZIKV RNA</title>
<p>Considering that IGF2BP2 associates with NS5 in the replication compartment and that it possesses RNA-binding activities, we evaluated whether IGF2BP2 interacts with ZIKV vRNA. IGF2BP2, along with IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP3 paralogues are highly conserved oncofetal RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) belonging to the Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein family, which typically regulate the post-transcriptional regulation of cellular RNAs. With their roles in the splicing, transport, translation, and stabilization of a wide variety of RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), IGF2BP1, 2 and 3 are involved in numerous cellular function, such as differentiation, migration, metabolism and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). IGF2BP2 is composed of six canonical RNA-binding domains, namely two N-terminal RNA-recognition motifs (RRM) and four C-terminal human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-K homology (KH) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess a potential association between IGF2BP2 and ZIKV vRNA, we first performed protein immunostaining coupled to single RNA molecule fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) using signal-amplified DNA branched probes to detect IGF2BP2 and ZIKV RNA, respectively. ZIKV RNA was specifically visualized since no FISH signal was detected in uninfected cells while in ZIKV-infected cells, vRNA exhibited a punctate distribution (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Co-staining of vRNA and IGF2BP2 revealed their partial colocalization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, white arrows, mean Manders’ coefficient=0.28±0.02 (n=31)), which strongly suggests that IGF2BP2 associates with the ZIKV RNA genome.</p>

<p>To test this, we performed anti-HA co-immunoprecipitation assays using extracts of Huh7.5 cells as in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>. Immune complexes were subjected to RNA purification and subsequently to RT-qPCR to detect viral genome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). While the overexpression of IGF2BP2 had no impact on total vRNA levels, we detected a highly significant enrichment of vRNA in purified IGF2BP2-HA complexes compared to the negative specificity control (no IGF2BP2-HA expression). This demonstrates that vRNA and IGF2BP2 are part of the same RNP complex. To further investigate if IGF2BP2 can interact with ZIKV vRNA in a direct manner, we have performed <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays using microscale thermophoresis (MST) with different regions of ZIKV vRNA and IGF2BP2 protein. We have focused our analysis on vRNA 5’ NTR and 3’ NTR, which are highly structured and are absolutely required for vRNA synthesis and translation, notably through interactions with viral and host factors (for a review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)). Moreover, it has been shown that IGF2BP2 preferentially binds to 3′ and 5′ untranslated regions of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). ZIKV RNA 3’ NTR and 5’ NTR were synthetized by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. In parallel recombinant IGF2BP2 N-terminal and C-terminal moieties containing either the two RRM (IGF2BP2<sub>RRM</sub>) or both KH3 and KH4 domains (IGF2BP2<sub>KH34</sub>), respectively were produced in bacteria and subsequently purified (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). MST revealed that IGF2BP2<sub>KH34</sub> binds both ZIKV 5’ NTR and 3’ NTR with high affinity with respective K<sub>d</sub> of 203 nM ± 51 and 418 nM ± 49, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). In stark contrast, IGF2BP2<sub>RRM</sub> specifically associated with ZIKV 3’ NTR with a lower affinity (K<sub>d</sub> = 1,598 nM ± 257) but this interaction was highly specific since no binding was detected between this recombinant protein and ZIKV 5’ NTR. It is noteworthy to mention that we could not assess higher IGF2BP2<sub>RRM</sub> concentrations than 10 μM to reach binding saturation because of protein aggregation. Overall, these data demonstrate that IGF2BP2 directly and specifically interacts with vRNA in infected cells.</p>

<title>ZIKV regulates vRNA replication</title>
<p>The fact that IGF2BP2 associates with both ZIKV NS5 RdRp and vRNA led us to hypothesize that IGF2BP2 is involved in the vRNA replication step of ZIKV life cycle. To test this, we took advantage of reporter ZIKV subgenomic replicons based on the H/PF/2013 genome (ZIKV sgR2A; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). This engineered genome has been deleted for the coding sequence of structural proteins and expresses Rluc in frame with the NS1-NS5 polyprotein. When <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed genomes are introduced in cells by electroporation, they autonomously replicate but neither virus assembly nor entry occur because of the lack of structural proteins. Hence, the luciferase activity in transduced Huh7.5 cells was used as a read-out of viral RNA replication two days post-electroporation. Strikingly, ZIKV sgR2A replication was attenuated in IGF2BP2 KD, with a significant 40% decrease (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). To rule out that this phenotype was due to a potential defect in vRNA translation, we used mutated Rluc-expressing ZIKV sub-genomes which express a defective NS5 RdRp and do no replicate (ZIKV sgR2A GAA; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A, B</xref>). Hence, the Rluc activity detected at 4 hours post-electroporation entirely relies on viral RNA translation. IGF2BP2 knockdown did not have any significant impact on Rluc activity in Huh7.5 cells transfected with either sgR2A or sgR2A GAA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). These data show that IGF2BP2 positively regulates ZIKV genome replication (but not its translation), which is most likely mediated through its interactions with NS5 and vRNA.</p>

<title>ZIKV infection modulates the interactions between IGF2BP2 and its endogenous mRNA ligands</title>
<p>Since IGF2BP2 associates with NS5 and vRNA and accumulates in the viral replication compartment, we hypothesized that ZIKV infection induces a remodeling of IGF2BP2 RNP notably regarding its content in endogenous mRNA partners. To test this, we performed immunopurifications of IGF2BP2 complexes followed by RT-qPCR as in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> in order to determine the relative abundance of three known IGF2BP2 mRNA ligands (namely <italic>TNRC6A</italic>, <italic>PUM2</italic> and <italic>CIRBP</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) in both control and ZIKV-infected cells. <italic>TRNC6A, PUM2</italic> and <italic>CIRBP</italic> mRNAs were selected because ZIKV is known to alter their N6-adenosine methylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), an epitranscriptomic RNA modification that increases the affinity for IGF2BP2, a known “m6A reader”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). As expected, we could specifically detect these mRNA in purified IGF2BP2 complexes in uninfected cells (Mock+IGF2BP2-HA condition; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7A-C</xref>). Interestingly, the levels of co-immunoprecipitated <italic>TNRC6A</italic> and <italic>PUM2</italic> mRNAs cell were significantly decreased when Huh7.5 were infected with ZIKV while total mRNA levels remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>), suggesting that ZIKV induced a loss of binding between IGF2BP2 and these endogenous mRNAs. In contrast, no significant changes in IGF2BP2 association were observed for <italic>CIRBP</italic> mRNA in either condition although it is noteworthy that total levels were increased in total extracts when IGF2BP2 was overexpressed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7C</xref>).

<title>ZIKV alters IGF2BP2 proteo-interactome in infected cells</title>
<p>Next, to assess our hypothesis of a ZIKV-remodeled IGF2BP2 RNP, we investigated whether ZIKV infection changes the protein interaction profile of IGF2BP2. We first performed western blotting on purified IGF2BP2-HA samples (prepared as in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>) to detect IGF2BP1, IGF2BP3 and YBX1 which are known IGF2BP2 partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>).

As expected from results shown in 4C, the viral RdRp NS5 was readily detected in this complex. Interestingly, confocal microscopy showed ZIKV infection induced an accumulation of IGF2BP1, IGF2BP3 and YBX1 in the replication compartment as for IGF2BP2 with partial colocalization with dsRNA and NS3 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs. S4</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5C-D</xref>), which supports that ZIKV physically co-opts an RNP containing these fours RBPs. This phenotype was specific to these host factors as it was not observed for the RNA-binding proteins DDX5 and LARP1 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A-D</xref>). Consistent with the fact that these proteins (including NS5) belong to a ribonucleoprotein complex containing IGF2BP2, their interaction with IGF2BP2 was RNA-dependent since they were barely detectable in the immunoprecipitates when the cell extracts were treated with RNase A prior to anti-HA pull-down (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>) To globally evaluate changes in the IGF2BP2 interactome upon infection, we analyzed the protein composition of IGF2BP2-HA complexes immunopurified from uninfected cells or infected with ZIKV or DENV by mass spectrometry. We identified 527 proteins which specifically interacted with IGF2BP2 (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A-B</xref>; Table S1). The abundance of over 86% of the proteins in IGF2BP2-HA complexes (455 proteins), including IGF2BP1, IGF2BP3 and YBX1 remained unchanged upon either infection (as expected from <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A-D</xref>). In contrast, in ZIKV-infected cells, the interactions of IGF2BP2 with 40 and 22 proteins were either decreased or increased, respectively, with 52 of these changes being specifically observed only in ZIKV-infected cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>).

In line with our gene ontology analysis, one of these clusters comprised proteins involved in mRNA splicing for most of which interaction with IGF2BP2 was significantly decreased during ZIKV infection (red circles). The second identified cluster was related to ribosome biogenesis.</p>

<p>The fact that ZIKV infection promotes IGF2BP2 association with ATL2 led us to hypothesize that IGF2BP2 regulates vRNA replication by contributing to ZIKV replication organelle biogenesis. Since IGF2BP2 KD decreases vRNA replication and thus, indirectly reduces the overall synthesis of viral proteins that drive vRO formation, evaluating this hypothesis in infected cells was not possible. To tackle this challenge, we took advantage of a recently described plasmid-based system (named pIRO-Z)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) which induces vROs <italic>de novo</italic> in transfected cells in a replication-independent manner (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>).

For instance, YBX1, IGF2BP2, LARP1, DDX6, C1QBP1 were reported to positively regulate HCV RNA synthesis while inhibiting the production of infectious viral particles. Our RNAi mini-screen assessing the impact of gene depletion on DENV or ZIKV infection revealed that overall, such host factor-mediated regulations are not fully conserved across the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. Only LARP1 knockdown reduced ZIKV replication while it increased virus production as observed for HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). A comparable trend was observed for YBX1 although the differences were not significant. In case of DENV, none of the tested RNA-binding proteins increased infectious particle production. The fact that the phenotypes did not fully mirror those we have reported for HCV might reflect the differences in the architecture of the vROs induced by orthoflaviviruses (<italic>i.e.</italic>, invaginated vesicles in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>)) compared to that of HCV double-membrane vesicles which result from ER protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). The best observed phenotype in our RNAi mini-screen was observed with IGF2BP2 knockdown which inhibited the replication of ZIKV but not that of other tested orthoflaviviruses or SARS-CoV-2, another positive-strand RNA virus from the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family. We further observed that ZIKV induced a relocalization of IGF2BP2 to the replication compartment in which it associates with NS5 and vRNA. Consistently, IGF2BP2 knockdown decreased the efficiency of vRNA synthesis (but not its translation) correlating with an impairment in VP formation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). This highlights that IGF2BP2 is an important regulator of the vRNA replication step of ZIKV life cycle. Of note, the overexpression did not result in an increase of vRNA abundance. We believe that this is because endogenous IGF2BP2 is highly expressed in cancer cells such as the Huh7.5 cells used here and is presumably not limiting for viral replication in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>).</p>
<p>Early in the ZIKV replication cycle, newly produced viral nonstructural proteins induce ER alterations to form VPs which will host the vRNA synthesis machinery including NS5 RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms governing VP morphogenesis remain poorly understood, mostly because it is experimentally challenging to discriminate phenotypes related to vRO morphogenesis from those resulting from perturbations in vRNA replication which reduce viral protein input and hence, VP abundance indirectly. In this study, using a recently engineered replication-independent VP induction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), we identified IGF2BP2 as a novel regulator of ZIKV <italic>de novo</italic> VP biogenesis. Interestingly, IGF2BP2 associates with ZIKV RNA 3’ NTR and ATL2, which are both co-factors of VP formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), suggesting that they all regulate this process as part of the same RNP complex. <italic>In vitro</italic> RNA binding assays showed that IGF2BP2 can interact directly and specifically with vRNA 3’NTR via its RRM domains. A recombinant protein comprising the third and fourth KH domains of IGF2BP2 also bound 3’ NTR. However, this interaction appeared less specific since a comparable affinity was observed for the 5’ NTR <italic>in vitro</italic>. Besides, we cannot exclude that IGF2BP2 binds additional vRNA regions in the coding sequence, which was not tested in this study. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the KH domains of IGF2BPs mediate the binding to <italic>N<sup>6</sup></italic>-methylated adenosines in mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), a modification that has been detected within the RNA genome of ZIKV and other <italic>Flavividae</italic> viruses, including in the 3’ NTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Since IGF2BP2 is a “m6A reader” through KH3 and KH4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), it is highly plausible that this RNA modification contributes to the vRNA binding specificity and the proviral roles of this host factor. Considering that the binding of KH3 and KH4 of IGF2BP1 paralogue to RNA can induce conformational changes of the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>), it will be interesting to evaluate whether IGF2BP2 co-opting by replication complexes (most likely via NS5) contributes to the structural switches and/or secondary and tertiary structures of vRNA controlling its fate during the life cycle.</p>
<p>To study the impact of ZIKV infection on IGF2BP2 association with endogenous RNAs, we decided to focus our analysis on three known IGF2BP2 mRNA ligands namely <italic>CIRBP</italic>, <italic>TNRC6A</italic> and <italic>PUM2</italic>. We chose to focus on those mRNA because: i) ZIKV, in addition to other <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> viruses (DENV, WNV and HCV) alter their N<sup>6</sup>-adenosine methylation status during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>), and ii) IGF2BP2 is a well described “m<sup>6</sup>A reader” which regulates the fate of bound RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>) . More specifically, it has been shown that ZIKV infection decreases m<sup>6</sup>A content of <italic>CIRBP</italic> mRNA and increases the one of <italic>PUM2</italic> and <italic>TNRC6A</italic> mRNAs. Unexpectedly, we observed a decreased interaction between these overmethylated mRNAs and IGF2BP2 while IGF2BP2/<italic>CIRBP</italic> mRNA association remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This counterintuitive observation might be due to additional layers of IGF2BP2 regulation such as potential virus-dependent posttranslational modifications. Indeed, the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) was reported to phosphorylate two residues of IGF2BP2 (Ser162/Ser164) which are located between the second RRM domain and the first KH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). The simultaneous phosphorylation of these two serine residues strongly enhances the interaction between IGF2BP2 and IGF-II leader 3 mRNA 5’UTR. Interestingly, our preliminary mass spectrometry analysis of IGF2BP2 phosphopeptides abundance indicate that ZIKV decreases phosphorylation of Ser162, but not that of Ser164. Moreover, several studies reported that ZIKV infection inhibits mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that ZIKV, through the mTOR pathway, regulates the affinity of IGF2BP2 for endogenous mRNAs by modulating its phosphorylation status. Our interactome analysis revealed global changes in the composition of IGF2BP2 RNP with 62 cellular proteins whose association with IGF2BP2 was altered during ZIKV infection. Most notably, ZIKV infection decreased IGF2BP2 interaction with 15 proteins of the mRNA splicing machinery. Interestingly, there is evidence that IGF2BP2 regulates mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) in addition to its most characterized functions in mRNA stability and translation. Furthermore, several studies reported that ZIKV infection alters mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). It was proposed that the expression of the subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), a viral non-coding RNA comprising vRNA 3’ NTR (and hence, predicted to associate with IGF2BP2 as ZIKV genome) alters splicing efficiency by sequestering splicing factors SF3B1 and PHAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). In case of DENV, NS5 was shown to associate with core components of the U5 snRNP particle and to also modulate splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). If such activity is conserved for ZIKV NS5, it is tempting to speculate that mRNA splicing is regulated in ZIKV-infected cells by an IGF2BP2/NS5/sfRNA complex. We have also demonstrated that ZIKV infection specifically induces the association between IGF2BP2 and ATL2, an ER-shaping protein which was previously reported to be required for DENV and ZIKV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). The fact that the knockdown of IGF2BP2 and ATL2 (this study and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>)) both impaired vRO biogenesis suggests that this process involves this ZIKV-specific ATL2-IGF2BP2 complex. Considering that 3’NTR is an important co-factor of VP formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), this complex might contribute to enriching vRNA to VPs through IGF2BP2/3’NTR interaction. It is noteworthy to mention that in DENV-infected cells, IGF2BP2 is relocalized to the replication compartment and associates with vRNA (unpublished data) but not with ATL2 (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7C-D</xref>). However, IGF2BP2 KD had very little or no effect on all tested DENV strains in contrast to ZIKV and despite our multiple attempts, we could not demonstrate evidence of a specific interaction between IGF2BP2 and DENV NS5. This suggests that i) ATL2 and NS5 are not directly involved in IGF2BP2 physical hijacking and RNA-binding activity, ii) that the physical co-opting of IGF2BP2 is not sufficient to confer the proviral activity of this host factor. However, ATL2 was reported to regulate DENV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) even if it does not associate with IGF2BP2 in that infection context. Interestingly, ATL2 interactome analysis in uninfected and DENV-infected cells showed that it associates RBMX and HNRNPC, two other known “m<sup>6</sup>A readers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). Intriguingly, ATL2/RBMX interaction was detected only in DENV-infected cells, suggesting that it is induced by the infection and might play a similar role as the one of IGF2BP2/ATL2 in case of DENV. Finally, the interaction of IGF2BP2 with both NS5 and ATL2 was RNA-dependent (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>), which is not surprising as RNA is often a structural component of ribonucleoprotein complexes. This further supports the idea that IGF2BP2 associates with NS5 and the ER after its binding to the viral RNA.</p>
<p>The results described in this study allows the elaboration of a model for IGF2BP2 involvement in ZIKV life cycle (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>). In this model, very early in the life cycle, IGF2BP2 associates with vRNA and subsequently to newly synthesized NS5 (step 1). This correlates with changes in the protein composition of IGF2BP2 RNP, including induced interactions with ATL2, which target NS5/vRNA complex to the ER (step 2). Via these changes in the stoichiometry of IGF2BP2 RNP, specific endogenous IGF2BP2 mRNA ligands such as <italic>PUM2</italic> and <italic>TNRC6A</italic> mRNAs are excluded from IGF2BP2 RNP. Subsequently, this ER-bound complex induces morphological alterations of the ER membrane with the contribution of vRNA 3’ NTR and the ER-shaping activity of ATL2 to generate VPs (step 3). In addition to providing an optimal environment for vRNA synthesis, the VPs are believed to contribute to the spatial segregation of the replication complexes, assembling particles and the translation machinery, hence regulating the equilibrium between the multiple fates of vRNA. With that in mind, we cannot exclude that IGF2BP2 contributes to the coordination between replication and assembly by targeting vRNA to/through the VP pore for selective encapsidation into particles budding into the ER (step 4).</p>

<p>Overall, this study highlights the physical and functional interplay between ZIKV replication machinery and IGF2BP2 RNP in infected cells. Considering the diverse roles of IGF2BP2 in mRNA metabolism, it is tantalizing to speculate that the physical and functional hijacking of IGF2BP2 RNP contributes to ZIKV pathogenesis, including developmental defects of the fetal brain.</p>

After lysate incubation with the antibodies, the first 3 washes were done with 1mL of lysis buffer (10 minutes each) at 4°C on a rotating wheel and spun down 1 min at 10,000 rpm. The last quick wash was done with detergent-free washing buffer (150 mM NaCl; 50 mM TrisCl pH 8.0) and spun down for 1 min at 10,000 rpm. After the removal of buffer excess, and using a cut 200 μL tips, beads were transferred into new low-binding tubes. We performed 3 quick washes with 1mL of washing buffer. After removal of the buffer, the samples were snap-frozen in ice dry and stored at -80 °C until use.</p>

<p>For the determination of IGFBP2 interactome, five independent affinity purifications using an anti-HA conjugated agarose beads (Millipore-Sigma) were performed for each experimental condition. Confluent monolayers of Huh7.5 cells constitutively expressing empty ctrls (NT) or HA-tagged IGFBP2 were mock-infected or infected with DENV or ZIKV at an MOI of 5 and 10, respectively. Cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (cOmplete and PhosStop, Roche), and processed as previously described (PMID: 30177828). Bound proteins (IP) or 50 µg of normalized whole cell lysates (Input) were denatured by incubation in 40 µl U/T buffer (8 M Urea, 6M Thiurea, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5), and reduction and alkylation carried out with 10 mM DTT and 55 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ABC buffer (50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> in water pH 8.0), respectively. After digestion with 1 µg LysC (WAKO Chemicals USA) at room temperature for 3 h, the suspension was diluted in ABC buffer, and the protein solution was digested with trypsin (Promega) overnight at room temperature. Peptides were purified on stage tips with three C18 Empore filter discs (3M) and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>).</p>
<p>Samples were analysed on a nanoElute (plug-in v.1.1.0.27; Bruker) coupled to a trapped ion mobility spectrometry quadrupole time of flight (timsTOF Pro) (Bruker) equipped with a CaptiveSpray source. Peptides were injected into a Trap cartridge (5 mm × 300 μm, 5 μm C18; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and next separated on a 25 cm × 75 μm analytical column, 1.6 μm C18 beads with a packed emitter tip (IonOpticks). The column temperature was maintained at 50 °C using an integrated column oven (Sonation GmbH). The column was equilibrated using 4 column volumes before loading samples in 100% buffer A (99.9% Milli-Q water, 0.1% formic acid (FA)). Samples were separated at 400 nl min−1 using a linear gradient from 2 to 17% buffer B (99.9% ACN, 0.1% FA) over 60 min before ramping up to 25% (30 min), 37% (10 min) and 95% of buffer B (10 min) and sustained for 10 min (total separation method time, 120 min). The timsTOF Pro was operated in parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) mode using Compass Hystar v.5.0.36.0. Settings were as follows: mass range 100– 1700 m/z, 1/K0 start 0.6 V⋅s/cm2End 1.6 V⋅s/cm2; ramp time 110.1 ms; lock duty cycle to 100%; capillary voltage 1,600 V; dry gas 3 l min−1; dry temperature 180 °C. The PASEF settings were: 10 tandem mass spectrometry (MS) scans (total cycle time, 1.27 s); charge range 0–5; active exclusion for 0.4 min; scheduling target intensity 10,000; intensity threshold 2,500; collision-induced dissociation energy 42 eV.</p>

<title>Raw data processing and analysis</title>
<p>Raw MS data were processed with the MaxQuant software v.1.6.17 using the built-in Andromeda search engine to search against the human proteome (UniprotKB, release 2019_10) containing forward and reverse sequences concatenated with the DENV-2 16681 strain (UniprotKB #P29990) and ZIKV H/PF/2013 strain (UniprotKB #KU955593) with the individual viral open reading frames manually annotated, and the label-free quantitation algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). Additionally, the intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) algorithm and match between runs option were used. In MaxQuant, carbamidomethylation was set as fixed and methionine oxidation and N-acetylation as variable modifications. Search peptide tolerance was set at 70 p.p.m. and the main search was set at 30 p.p.m. (other settings left as default). Experiment type was set as TIMS-DDA with no modification to the default settings. Search results were filtered with a false discovery rate of 0.01 for peptide and protein identification. The Perseus software v.1.6.15 was used to process the data further. Protein tables were filtered to eliminate the identifications from the reverse database and common contaminants. When analysing the MS data, only proteins identified on the basis of at least one peptide and a minimum of three quantitation events in at least one experimental group were considered. The iBAQ protein intensity values were normalized against the median intensity of each sample (using only peptides with recorded intensity values across all samples and biological replicates) and log-transformed; missing values were filled by imputation with random numbers drawn from a normal distribution calculated for each sample. PCA analysis was used to quality control variance across biological replicates, and remove outliers (replicate 1 and 5 of IGFBP2 pull-downs were removed from all the matrix).</p>
<p>Significant interactors were determined by multiple ANOVA T-tests with permutation-based false discovery rate statistics. We performed 250 permutations, and the FDR threshold was set at 0.05. The parameter S0 was set at 1 to separate background from specifically enriched interactors. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of proteins was performed on logarithmized and z-scored intensities of ANOVA significant interactors. Five unique clusters of proteins differentially regulated upon viral infection were identified (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). Results were plotted as scatter plot and heat map using Perseus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>) or Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<p>Lunet T7 cells expressing a cytosolic T7 polymerase, were seeded into 6-well plates and transduced with lentivirus (MOI 5) containing shRNA sequences targeting either IGF2BP2 or nontarget (NT). After 2 days, transduced cells were then seeded into 24-well plates (30,000 cells/well). One day later, cells were transfected with the pIRO-Z system as described in (Goellner et. al. 2020 and Cerikan et. al. 2020), using Mirus TransIT transfection reagent. After 18 hours, cells were fixed with 1.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M HEPES buffer (for EM imaging) or processed for Immunofluorescence, western blot, or RT-qPCR as described above.</p>
<p>To prepare cells for EM imaging, glutaraldehyde fixed samples were washed three times with 0.2 M HEPES. Next, samples were incubated with 1% osmium tetroxide/0.1 M Cacodylate for 1 hour and washed three times with HPLC grade water. Samples were then incubated with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 minutes at 60℃ followed by washing with HPLC-grade water three times. Progressive dehydration was performed with increasing concentrations of ethanol (40% to 100%). Cells were embedded into an Eponate 12 Resin (Ted Pella inc) and left for two days at 60°C to achieve complete polymerization. Embedded samples were sectioned into 70-nm-thick slices using a Leica EM UC6 microtome and a diamond knife (Diatome). Sections were counterstained with 4% uranyl acetate for 5 minutes and 2% lead citrate for 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Sections were then mounted on EM grids for imaging. Electron microscopy images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-1400 120 kV LaB6 transmission electron microscope with a Gatan US1000 CCD camera at 8000X magnification. Quantification was performed by systematically surveying cells and evaluating the presence of VPs. Only cells with &gt;2 VPs were considered as positive. For each condition, &gt;50 cells were surveyed over 4 biological replicas. All observed VPs were imaged, and VP diameters were determined using ImageJ by measuring the distance across two axes and averaging.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigated the co-option of IGF2BP2, an RNA binding protein by ZIKV proteins. Designed experiments evaluated if IFG2BP2 co-localized to sites of viral RNA replication, interacted with ZIKV proteins and how ZIKV infection changed the IGF2BP2 interactome.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have used multiple interdisciplinary techniques to address several questions regarding the interaction of ZIKV proteins and IGF2BP2.</p>
<p>The findings could be exciting if concerns are addressed, specifically regarding how ZIKV infection alters the interactome of IGF2BP2.</p>
<p>Comments on thee revised version:</p>
<p>Following response to reviews, the authors have addressed a majority of the concerns with the exception of the western blots:</p>
<p>As requested in the previous review, the authors did quantify the western blot data for half of the blot in 2A, but did not quantify blots in D and E. Please quantify ALL blots. Also, the first two lanes of 2A. The same goes for 4A only infected is quantified, please quantify Mock as well. In the quantification of 4C, all lanes should be quantified, not only the NS5 from C. Also, unclear which lanes were quantified (H/PF/2013 or MR766)? Also, quantification needs to be generally shown as a graph and not included on top of the western blot.</p>

<p>Clément Mazeaud et al. identified the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) as a proviral cellular protein that regulates Zika virus (ZIKV) RNA replication by modulating the biogenesis of virus-induced replication organelles. Based on their findings and previously published data, the authors propose a model outlining the role of IGF2BP2 in the ZIKV infectious cycle. This model details the changes in IGF2BP2 interactions with both cellular and viral proteins and RNAs during viral infection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This revised manuscript presents an interesting and convincing mechanism by which a cellular RNA-binding protein alters its protein and RNA interactome during viral infection. Using various molecular biology methods, proteomic analysis and a newly described replication-independent vesicle packets induction system, the authors describe the relevance of IGF2BP2 protein during Zika virus infection.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the proposed model, the IGF2BP2 protein specifically binds to the 3' nontranslated region (NTR) of the ZIKV genome, while excluding binding to the 5' NTR. However, the authors cannot rule out the possibility that this host protein associates with other regions of the viral genome, a topic which is discussed in the manuscript.</p>
<p>In this study, the physiological cellular consequences of altering the interaction of IGF2BP2 with its endogenous mRNA ligands due to ZIKV infection remain unexplored. This aspect would be of interest for future studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Mazeaud and colleagues pursued a small scale screen of a targeted RNAi library to identify novel players involved in Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) virus replication. Loss-of-function of IGF2BP2 resulted in reduced titers for ZIKV of the Asian and African lineages in hepatic Huh7.5 cells, but not for either of the four DENV serotypes nor for West Nile virus (WNV). The phenotype was further confirmed in two additional cell lines and using a ZIKV reporter virus. In addition, using immunoprecipitation assays the interaction between IGF2BP2 and ZIKV NS5 protein and RNA genome was detected. The work addressed the role of IGF2BP2 in the infected cell combining confocal microscopy imaging, and proteomic analysis. The approach indicated an altered distribution of IGF2BP2 in infected cells and changes in the protein interactome including disrupted association with partner mRNAs and modulation of the abundance of a specific set of protein partners in IGF2BP2 immunoprecipitated ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Finally, based on the changes in IGF2BP2 interactome and specifically the increment in the abundance of Atlastin 2, biogenesis of ZIKV replication organelles (vRO) is investigated using a genetic system that allows virus replication-independent assembly of vRO. Electron microscopy showed that knock down of IGF2BP2 expression reduced the number of cells with vRO.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The role of IGF2BP2 as a proviral factor for ZIKV replication is novel</p>
<p>The study follows a logical flow of experiments that altogether support the assembly of a specialized RNP complex containing IGF2BP2 and ZIKV NS5 and RNA genome</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The specificity for the direct interaction between IGF2BP2 and ZIKV RNA genome remains elusive in particular regarding the regions in the virus genome that drive interaction.</p>

<p>Clément Mazeaud et al. identified the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) as a proviral cellular protein that regulates Zika virus RNA replication by modulating the biogenesis of virus-induced replication organelles.</p>
<p>The absence of IGF2BP2 specifically dampens ZIKV replication without having a major impact on DENV replication. The authors show that ZIKV infection changes IGF2BP2 cellular distribution, which relocates to the perinuclear viral replication compartment. These assays were conducted by infecting cells with an MOI of 10 for 48 hours. Considering the ZIKV life cycle, it is noteworthy that at this time there may be a cytopathic effect. One point of concern arises regarding how the authors can ascertain that the observed change in localization is a consequence of the infection rather than of the cytopathic effect. To address this concern, shorter infection periods (e.g., 24 hours post-infection) or additional controls, such as assessing cellular proteins that do not change their localization or infecting with another flavivirus lacking the IGF2BP2 effect, could be incorporated into their experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these relevant comments regarding the specificity of IGF2BP2 relocalization to the ZIKV replication compartment.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that we chose the 2-day post-infection time point for our analyses because it corresponds to the peak of replication with much more titers produced compared to those at 24 hours post-infection (generally ~106 PFU/mL vs. ~104 PFU/mL). Consistently, the abundance of viral replication factories is more obvious at this time-point. A MOI of 5-10 was chosen to maximize the % of infected cells. That said, as suggested by the reviewer, we have analyzed the distribution of IGF2BP2 in ZIKV-infected cells at one-day post-infection, and we provide evidence in Figure S1 that IGF2BP2 relocalizes to the dsRNA-containing compartment at this time point.</p>
<p>Importantly, we now show in Figure S5 that in contrast to IGF2BP2, other host RNA-binding proteins such as LARP1 and DDX5 do not accumulate to ZIKV replication compartment at 2 days post-infection. LARP1 actually seems to be excluded from it while DDX5 remains nuclear. Of note, consistent with the ZIKV-induced decrease in expression observed in western blots (Fig 4A), the intensity of DDX5 signal decreases in infected cells. Altogether, this demonstrates that the IGF2BP2 relocalization phenotype is specific and is not due to ZIKV-induced cell death.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>By performing co-immunoprecipitation assays on mock and infected cells that express HAtagged IGF2BP2, the authors propose that the observed change in IGF2BP2 localization results from its recruitment to the replication compartment by the viral NS5 polymerase and associated with the viral RNA. Given that both IGF2BP2 and NS5 are RNA-binding proteins, it is plausible that their interaction is mediated indirectly through the RNA molecule. Notably, the authors do not address the treatment of lysates with RNase before the IP assay, leaving open the possibility of this indirect interaction between IGF2BP2 and NS5.</p>

<p>We agree with the hypothesis of the reviewer. As suggested, we have performed coimmunoprecipitation assays following RNase A treatment of the cell lysates. As shown in new Fig S6, the abundance of ZIKV NS5 co-immunoprecipitating with IGF2BP2-HA is drastically decreased upon RNase A treatment compared to the untreated condition. This demonstrates that the IGF2BP2/NS5 interaction is mostly RNA-dependent, which is not surprising as RNA is often a structural component of ribonucleoprotein complexes. Of note, the same is observed with ATL2. This new set of data allows us to refine our model of Figure 11 and the discussion as they strongly suggest that the direct binding of IGF2BP2 to viral RNA (evidenced in vitro; Fig 5D) is required for subsequent association with NS5 and ER-shaping protein ATL2. This is in line with the fact that viral RNA is a co-factor in the biogenesis of ER-derived ZIKV vesicle packets (PMID: 32640225). However, we cannot exclude a contribution of cellular RNA in these processes as discussed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In in vitro binding assays, the authors demonstrate that the RNA-recognition motifs of the IGF2BP2 protein specifically bind to the 3' nontranslated region (NTR) of the ZIKV genome, excluding binding to the 5' NTR. However, they cannot rule out the possibility of this host protein associating with other regions of the viral genome. Using a reporter ZIKV subgenomic replicon system in IGF2BP2 knock-down cells, they additionally demonstrate that IGF2BP2 enhances viral genome replication. Despite its proviral function, the authors note that the &quot;overexpression of IGF2BP2 had no impact on total vRNA levels.&quot; However, the authors do not delve into a discussion of this latter statement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comments. We now mention in the discussion that we cannot exclude the possibility that IGF2BP2 associates with RNA motifs within the coding region of the viral genomic RNA, especially considering that it contains N6A-methylated sequences (PMID: 27773535; 27773536; 29373715). Moreover, we discuss the observation that IGF2BP2 overexpression has no impact on vRNA levels (as well as titers). We believe that this is because endogenous IGF2BP2 is highly expressed in cancer cells such as the Huh7.5 and JEG-3 cells used here and is presumably not limiting for viral replication in our system (PMID: 38320625; 35111811; 34309973; 35023719; 37088822; 33224879; 35915142).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In this study, the authors extend their findings by illustrating that ZIKV infection triggers a remodeling of IGF2BP2 ribonucleoprotein complex. They initially evaluate the impact of ZIKV infection on IGF2BP2's interaction with its endogenous mRNA ligands. Their results reveal that viral infection alters the binding of specific mRNA ligands, yet the physiological consequences of this loss of binding in the cell remain unexplored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that it would be of interest to further study the physiological relevance of the modulation of IGF2BP2 ribo-interactome. Since we have focused here on the role of IGF2BP2 in viral replication, we feel that this will be the focus of future studies notably involving a larger omic-centered approach to identify the most impacted IGF2BP2 mRNA ligands. Of note, Gokhale and colleagues have already reported that CIRBP, TNRC6A and PUM2 proteins regulates the replication of Flaviviridae (PMID: 31810760).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, the authors demonstrate that ZIKV infection modifies the IGF2BP2 interactome. Through proteomic assays, they identified 62 altered partners of IGF2BP2 following ZIKV infection, with proteins associated with mRNA splicing and ribosome biogenesis being the most represented. In particular, the authors focused their research on the heightened interaction between IGF2BP2 and Atlastin 2, an ER-shaping protein reported to be involved in flavivirus vesicle packet formation. The validation of this interaction by Western blot assays prompted an analysis of the effect of ZIKV on organelle biogenesis using a newly described replication-independent vesicle packet induction system. Consequently, the authors demonstrate that IGF2BP2 plays a regulatory role in the biogenesis of ZIKV replication organelles.</p>
<p>Based on these findings and previously published data, the authors propose a model outlining the role of IGF2BP2 in ZIKV infectious cycle, detailing the changes in IGF2BP2 interactions with both cellular and viral proteins and RNAs that occur during viral infection.</p>
<p>The conclusions drawn in this paper are generally well substantiated by the data.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for this encouraging general comments on our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, it is worth noting that the majority of infections were conducted at a high MOI for 48 hours, spanning more than one infectious cycle. To enhance the robustness of their findings and mitigate potential cell stress, it would be valuable to observe these effects at shorter time intervals, such as 24 hours post-infection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As explained above, IGF2BP2 relocalization to the (dsRNA-enriched) replication compartment was also observed in ZIKV infected cells at one day post-infection.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, the assertion regarding the association of IGF2BP2 with NS5 could be strengthened through additional immunoprecipitation (IP) assays. These assays, performed in the presence of RNAse treatment, would help exclude the possibility of an indirect interaction between IGF2BP2 and NS5 (both RNA-binding proteins) through viral RNA, thus providing more confidence in the observed association.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Mazeaud and colleagues pursued a small-scale screen of a targeted RNAi library to identify novel players involved in Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) virus replication. Loss-of-function of IGF2BP2 resulted in reduced titers for ZIKV of the Asian and African lineages in hepatic Huh7.5 cells, but not for either of the four DENV serotypes nor West Nile virus (WNV). The phenotype was further confirmed in two additional cell lines and using a ZIKV reporter virus. In addition, using immunoprecipitation assays the interaction between IGF2BP2 and ZIKV NS5 protein and RNA genome was detected. The work addressed the role of IGF2BP2 in the infected cell combining confocal microscopy imaging, and proteomic analysis. The approach indicated an altered distribution of IGF2BP2 in infected cells and changes in the protein interactome including disrupted association with partner mRNAs and modulation of the abundance of a specific set of protein partners in IGF2BP2 immunoprecipitated ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Finally, based on the changes in IGF2BP2 interactome and specifically the increment in the abundance of Atlastin 2, the biogenesis of ZIKV replication organelles (vRO) is investigated using a genetic system that allows virus replication-independent assembly of vRO. Electron microscopy showed that knockdown of IGF2BP2 expression reduced the number of cells with vRO.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The role of IGF2BP2 as a proviral factor for ZIKV replication is novel. The study follows a logical flow of experiments that altogether support the assembly of a specialized RNP complex containing IGF2BP2 and ZIKV NS5 and RNA genome.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their positive feedback on our study and its novelty.</p>

<p>The claim that IGF2BP2 knockdown impairs de novo viral organelle biogenesis and viral RNA synthesis is built upon data that show a reduction in RNA synthesis &lt;0.5-fold as assessed using a reporter replicon, thus suggesting a limited impact of the knockdown on RNA replication.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a 50% decrease in the replication of our reporter replicon might be considered mild. However, we want to pinpoint that in an infectious set-up, the phenotypes were higher as demonstrated by an 80% decrease in viral particle production even when IGF2BP2 levels were never depleted more that 80% compared to endogenous levels. Moreover, our findings were validated through the analysis of de novo vRO biogenesis by electron microscopy in a replication-independent set-up. Together, these experiments provide compelling evidence for a role for IGF2BP2 in the early stages of viral genome replication.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Validation of IGF2BP2 partners that are modulated upon ZIKV infection (i.e. virus yield in knocked down cells) can be relevant especially for partners such as Atlastin 2, as the hypothesis of a role for IGF2BP2 RNP in vRO biogenesis is based on the observed increase in the abundance of Atlastin 2 in the RNP complex preciìtated from infected cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First, we would like to emphasize that the proviral role of ATL2 in flavivirus replication, including links to vRO biogenesis, was already reported in two independent studies notably by one of the co-authors (PMID: 31636417; 31534046). Therefore, we have chosen to discuss these previous studies in the manuscript rather than repeating published experiments.  Second, we agree that it would be interesting to further interrogate the role of modulated IGF2BP2 protein partners in ZIKV replication. However, these experiments would constitute a new project per se involving fastidious RNAi-based phenotypic screening and subsequent functional characterization of the identified hits. Therefore, this will be the focus of follow-up studies.</p>

<p>Figure 2A: If shGF2BP2 reduces viral titer, the NS3 should show a reduction in 2A, but it doesn't.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. Although NS3 seems not to be decreased upon IGF2BP2 knockdown in the experiment initially shown in Figure 2A, it should be noted that our homemade rat anti-NS3 antibody is highly sensitive, leading to signal saturation that makes it challenging to distinguish changes in NS3 expression without diluting substantially the lysate sample before the PAGE-SDS. The initial reason for including Fig 2A was not to make a statement about viral protein expression but to validate IGF2BP2 knock-down efficiency. Conclusions about NS3 levels in the initial figure are further complicated by the high MOI of ZIKV was used in Huh7.5 cells which are not quantitative for viral replication measurements. To address this issue, we assessed the impact of IGF2BP2 knockdown on viral protein abundance (as a read-out of overall viral replication) with a lower MOI of ZIKV. The results of the repeat experiment (seen in the new Fig. 2A) show that IGF2BP2 knockdown leads to a decrease in the abundance of NS4A, NS5 and NS3, which is consistent with the titer decrease phenotypes.</p>

<p>In addition to replication complexes, NS3 labels convoluted membranes which are devoid of dsRNA and IGF2BP2 and surround the cage-like replication compartment as large puncta (PMID: 27545046; 33432690; 28249158). The signal overlap is more obvious between IGF2BP2 and NS3/dsRNA-containing areas, which is reflected by the Mander’s coefficients that have been included in the revised version (Fig. S5C-D). We have also adjusted the text to conclude that the colocalization was partial and that IGF2BP2 accumulated in the replication compartment. We acknowledge that the dsRNA signal is weak, and we have updated the images (and others, when relevant) to better visualize this viral component. Moreover, we have rephrased the sentence to remove the word “strongly”.</p>

<p>Figure 5A: Once again similar to other IFAs, the co-localization is only minimal and thus difficult to claim as &quot;co-localization&quot; is actually happening. It would be good to either improve the images or discuss this observation in the text and reduce the claim of colocalization. Specifically, since the two proteins might be co-localizing in specific regions which would make it a very interesting observation. Also, quantification of co-localizing regions would be beneficial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included the requested colocalization analysis. We have been cautious to indicate that colocalization was only partial. It is noteworthy that, despite many efforts in the optimization of the cell permeabilization procedure, we noticed that the FISH probes were not very efficient in accessing the perinuclear area of the infected cells, where replication complexes accumulate. In that respect, it is likely that this imaging approach “miss” some of the IGF2BP2/vRNA complexes and that the determined colocalization factor is underestimated. This explains why the confirmation of the vRNA/IGF2BP2 complex with a biochemical approach (Fig. 5B) was very relevant.</p>

<p>Figure 9: The electron microscopy to quantify vesicles should be carried out using whole-cell tomography in order to get the most accurate quantification of the vesicles following different treatments.

It is unclear how many cell profiles were used for the quantification and how the calculations were carried out.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that ideally, one should perform 3D electron tomography to precisely assess the morphology of VPs. Regardless the fact that we do not possess the imaging infrastructure to perform that type of analysis, such an approach would represent a tremendous amount of work if one would like to process at least 200-400 vesicles from &gt; 50 cells and their whole cytoplasm (as we did). Despite not having 3D images, this number of data points is sufficient to see general changes in viral replication vesicle morphology, especially considering that Huh7-Lunet cells are relatively flat cells. (PMID: 32640225; 36700643; 34696522; 31636417). Furthermore, since IGF2BP2 knockdown decreases the abundance of VPs and does not impact their diameter, we believe that the addition of sophisticated 3D analysis would not bring any new and relevant information and that the TEM data stand by themselves for the conclusion we made. A more refined morphological analysis to determine how IGF2BP2 is structurally involved in virus-mediated membrane reorganization could be the focus of a future study.</p>
<p>We feel that we have already provided sufficient information about the quantification in the Material &amp; Methods section of the first version of the manuscript: “Quantification was performed by systematically surveying cells and evaluating the presence of VPs. Only cells with &gt;2 VPs were considered as positive. For each condition, &gt;50 cells were surveyed over 4 biological replicas. All observed VPs were imaged, and VP diameters were determined using ImageJ by measuring the distance across two axes and averaging”.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The inclusion of a control in the knock-down and infection assays with the reporter virus could enhance the validity of the findings. Introducing STAT2 knockdown, a recognized antiviral protein for ZIKV, as a control would provide a valuable benchmark to evaluate the extent of viral enhancement in the experiments. This additional control not only supports the proposed function of LARP1 in virus assembly/release but also strengthens the overall interpretation of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that adding a positive control could have been relevant for assessing the extent of replication modulation, especially for increases such as that observed with shLARP1. However, finding such control proteins in our system was a challenge. Indeed, STAT2 would not have been a good control for these experiments since we used Huh7.5 cells for the RNAi mini-screening, which do not express a functional RIG-I protein, and generally do not produce type I and III interferons. Thus, STAT2 knockdown is not expected to result in an increase in replication. That said, we feel that it was unnecessary to include a control for replication inhibition here given that only a few statistically reliable candidates we obtained. Instead, we have opted for an extensive secondary validation approach by assessing the proviral role of IGF2BP2 for multiple viruses - DENV1-2-3-4, WNV and SARS-CoV-2, and 3 ZIKV strains in three relevant cell types.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, in Figure S4, the authors employ an antibody against NS5 that specifically recognizes ZIKV NS5 but not DENV NS5. Given the objective of highlighting distinctions between these two viruses, it is advisable to use an antibody that detects DENV NS5 as well. This approach would contribute to a more comprehensive comparison, ensuring a balanced representation of both viruses in the experimental analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this relevant suggestion. We have repeated the coimmunoprecipitation assays using antibodies specific to DENV NS5 (Aithor response image 1). While we specifically pulled down ZIKV NS5 with IGF2BP2-HA as expected, this was not the case for DENV NS5 when using extracts from DENV-infected cells despite our multiple attempts. Indeed, the amount of pulled-down DENV NS5 with IGF2BP2-HA was always comparable to that in the negative control (“empty” pWPI lentivirus-transduced cells, “-“ condition), which corresponds to non-specific binding to the HA-resin. Thus, while the antibody was very efficient at detecting DENV NS5 in the cell extracts, no specific binding between DENV NS5 and IGF2BP2-HA could be evidenced. Consistent with our different replication phenotypes between DENV and ZIKV, this strongly supports that the NS5/IGF2BP2 interaction is specific to ZIKV. The specificity of the IGF2BP2 interaction with ZIKV NS5 compared to DENV NS5 is discussed in the updated manuscript.</p>

<p>We prefer showing the data as fold reduction as they better reflect the IGF2BP2 knockdowninduced phenotypes across the independent biological replicates.

<p>As mentioned in the discussion and above, ATL2 was already reported to be required for DENV and ZIKV replication in two independent studies (including one by one of the coauthors)(PMID: 31636417; 31534046). We have not tested whether ATL2 associates with NS5. However, new Fig. S7 of the revised manuscript shows that IGF2BP2/ATL2 is RNAdependent. This suggests that, as initially depicted in our model, IGF2BP2 associates with the ER (and thus, ATL2) after its binding to the viral RNA. Further interrogation into the role of atlastins in the flavivirus replication cycle is the focus of another ongoing IGF2BP2-unrelated study from one of the co-authors which will be reported elsewhere.</p>
