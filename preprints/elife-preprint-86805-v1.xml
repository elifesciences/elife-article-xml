<abstract>
<p>Psychosis is characterized by a diminished ability of the brain to distinguish externally driven activity patterns from self-generated activity patterns. Antipsychotic drugs are a class of small molecules with relatively broad binding affinity for a variety of neuromodulator receptors that, in humans, can prevent or ameliorate psychosis. How these drugs influence the function of cortical circuits, and in particular their ability to identify self-generated activity patterns, is still largely unclear. Here we used widefield calcium imaging to determine the cell type specific functional effects of antipsychotic drugs in mouse dorsal cortex during visuomotor integration. By comparing cell type specific activation patterns between locomotion onsets that were experimentally coupled to self-generated visual feedback and locomotion onsets that were not coupled, we show that deep cortical layers were differentially activated in these two conditions. We then show that the antipsychotic drug clozapine disrupted visuomotor integration at locomotion onsets also primarily in deep cortical layers. Given that one of the key components of visuomotor integration in cortex is long-range cortico-cortical connections, we tested whether the effect of clozapine was detectable in the correlation structure of activity patterns across dorsal cortex. We found that clozapine as well as two other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole and haloperidol, resulted in a strong reduction in correlations of layer 5 activity between cortical areas and impaired the spread of visuomotor prediction errors generated in visual cortex. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that a major functional effect of antipsychotic drugs is an alteration of the activation of internal representations as a consequence of reduced long-range layer 5 mediated communication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Under normal conditions, self-generated movements are coupled to sensory feedback in different modalities. Locomotion, for example, is coupled to proprioceptive feedback from muscle movements, somatosensory and auditory feedback from touching the ground, vestibular feedback from translational acceleration, and visual feedback in the form of expanding visual flow. This coupling is key to our brain’s ability to learn internal models of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jordan and Rumelhart, 1992</xref>). Internal models are the transformations between cortical areas and can be used to predict the sensory consequences of movement. Hallucinations and delusions can be explained as a misconfiguration of these internal models: inaccurate predictions of the sensory consequences of movements can result in self-generated activity that is not correctly distinguished from externally driven activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fletcher and Frith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Frith, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Self-generated movements result in broad activation of most regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>), including some primary sensory areas like visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saleem et al., 2013</xref>) where they have been shown to depend on visual context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>). The framework of predictive processing postulates that in cortex, these movement related signals are internal model based predictions of the sensory consequences of movement that are compared to externally generated bottom-up input to compute prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jiang and Rao, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</xref>). Evidence for this interpretation has mainly come from the discovery of movement related prediction error responses in a variety of different cortical regions and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Attinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Audette et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ayaz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Eliades and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Heindorf et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Keller and Hahnloser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stanley and Miall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zmarz and Keller, 2016</xref>), and the observation that top-down inputs from motor areas of cortex appear to convey movement related predictions of sensory input to sensory areas of cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Leinweber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schneider et al., 2018</xref>). The neurons on which the opposing bottom-up input and top-down prediction converge are referred to as prediction error neurons and are thought to reside primarily in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jordan and Keller, 2020</xref>). To complete the circuit, there also needs to be a population of neurons that integrate over prediction error responses. These are referred to as internal representation neurons. It is still unclear which cortical neuron type functions as internal representation neurons, but based on anatomical arguments it has been speculated that they can be found in deep cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bastos et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In humans, externally driven and self-generated activity patterns can be experimentally separated at least partially, for example, by showing subjects a visual stimulus and later asking them to visualize the same stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Le Bihan et al., 1993</xref>). This type of experiment is considerably more difficult to perform in animals. Using movement as a proxy for self-generated activity patterns, however, using a virtual environment, we can compare a condition in which self-generated and externally generated activity patterns are correlated to a condition in which they are not. In the visual system, we can use a virtual reality environment to experimentally couple or decouple locomotion from visual flow feedback. We will refer to the former as a closed loop condition and to the latter as an open loop condition. Assuming the predictive processing model is correct, we should find differences in the activation patterns in dorsal cortex in response to locomotion onsets as a function of whether they occurred with or without coupled visual flow feedback. Both prediction error neurons as well as internal representation neurons should respond differentially. Thus, we set out to investigate whether there are differences between closed and open loop activation patterns of mouse dorsal cortex, and whether these differences are neuron type specific. If hallucinations are indeed the result of aberrant activation of internal representations, possibly as a result of misconfigured internal models, antipsychotic drugs should alter the differential activation patterns in these neurons.</p>

<title>Tlx3 positive layer 5 (L5) intratelencephalic (IT) neurons distinguished closed and open loop visuomotor coupling</title>
<p>To investigate neuron type specific differences in activity patterns at locomotion onsets with and without self-generated visual feedback in mouse dorsal cortex, we quantified locomotion onset activity using widefield calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wekselblatt et al., 2016</xref>). A GCaMP variant was expressed using either a retro-orbital injection of an AAV-PHP.eB vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chan et al., 2017</xref>), or a cross between a Cre line and the Ai148 GCaMP6 reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>) (see Methods; <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref></bold>). Mice expressed a GCaMP variant either brain wide (C57BL/6), or in genetically identified subsets of excitatory or inhibitory neurons using Cre driver lines. Please note, we use the term ‘brain wide’ here to describe an expression pattern that was determined by the intersection of the AAV-PHP.eB tropism and the expression pattern of EF1α or hSyn1 promoters but that was otherwise brain wide (see Discussion). We used Emx1-Cre mice to target expression to cortical excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>), Cux2-CreERT2 mice to target expression to L2/3 and L4 layer excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Franco et al., 2012</xref>), Scnn1a-Cre mice to target expression to a subset of L4 excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>), Tlx3-Cre mice to target expression to a subset of L5 IT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gerfen et al., 2013</xref>), and Ntsr1-Cre mice to target expression to a subset of L6 excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gong et al., 2007</xref>). To target subpopulations of inhibitory neurons, we used PV-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</xref>), VIP-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>), and SST-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>) (see Methods). Prior to the start of the imaging experiments, mice were implanted with a crystal skull cranial window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). We used crystal skull preparations as we found that hemodynamic artifacts were smaller in this preparation compared to those observed in clear skull preparations (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref></bold>). For all experiments, mice were head fixed and free to locomote on a spherical treadmill (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). Activity from dorsal cortex was imaged while mice were in a closed loop visuomotor condition, in which locomotion on the spherical treadmill controlled forward movement in a virtual corridor. Following this, mice were exposed to an open loop condition during which mice were presented with a replay of the visual flow they had self-generated in the preceding closed loop condition.</p>

<p>We first compared locomotion onset responses in the closed loop condition to those in the open loop condition in mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide (C57BL/6). Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>), we found that locomotion onset resulted in broad activation across most of dorsal cortex in both conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). However, comparing locomotion onsets in mice that expressed GCaMP6 only in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons, we found that the activation pattern was strikingly different between closed and open loop conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). While locomotion onset in the open loop condition resulted in an increase in activity across dorsal cortex similar to that observed in C57BL/6 mice with brain wide GCaMP expression, locomotion onset in the closed loop condition resulted in a very different activation pattern: In posterior parts of dorsal cortex, the activity decreased, while in anterior parts of the dorsal cortex, the activity increased. To quantify these activation patterns across mice, we selected six regions of interest: primary visual cortex (V1), antero-medial secondary visual cortex (V2am), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), primary motor cortex (M1), anterior cingulate cortex at the level of bregma (A24b), and secondary motor cortex (M2) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). In C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide, closed loop locomotion onset resulted in similar activity patterns across these six regions (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>). This activity pattern was not markedly different from that observed during locomotion onsets in an open loop condition (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></bold>). To quantify the contribution of visual flow onset to the closed loop locomotion onset activity, we measured responses to visual flow onsets that occurred in the absence of locomotion in the open loop condition (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref></bold>). In C57BL/6 mice with brain wide GCaMP expression, visual flow onsets resulted in responses that were small compared to those observed during locomotion onset, even in V1. Note that a visual flow onset is a relatively weak visual stimulus compared to a drifting grating stimulus. A grating stimulus is typically composed of a gray screen or a standing grating stimulus that suddenly transitions to a drifting grating, and thus the visual flow undergoes a very high acceleration. A visual flow onset in an open loop condition is the replay of previously self-generated visual flow and thus exhibits much lower visual flow acceleration. The absence of a strong visual flow onset response in C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide is consistent with a high similarity of closed and open loop locomotion onset responses.</p>
<p>In mice that expressed GCaMP6 in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons, the closed loop locomotion onset patterns differed markedly when compared across the six regions of interest (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref></bold>). Moreover, these activation patterns were different from those observed during open loop locomotion onsets (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref></bold>). While these responses could partially be explained by hemodynamic occlusion, the time course of hemodynamic occlusion in Tlx3-Cre mice that expressed eGFP in L5 IT neurons was similar to that observed in C57BL/6 mice that expressed eGFP brain wide and mainly resulted in a decrease of fluorescence (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1D</xref></bold>). In Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons, open loop visual flow onsets that occurred in the absence of locomotion resulted in quantifiable responses in V1 and V2am (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref></bold>), but the closed loop locomotion onset responses in V1 could not be explained by the sum of locomotion and visual flow onset responses (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>). Most of the widefield signals we record here likely originate in compartments in superficial layers which are composed of axons and dendrites of local neurons, and long-range inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allen et al., 2017</xref>) (see Discussion). To test how well the widefield signals recorded in V1 reflected local somatic activity in V1, we repeated the experiments using two-photon calcium imaging of somatic activity in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons. We found that while there were differences between the responses measured with widefield imaging and those measured at the soma, both for locomotion onset responses and visual responses, these differences did not change our conclusions (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We then repeated these experiments and analyses for the other excitatory and inhibitory cortical neuron types (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref></bold>). For each neuron type, we quantified the similarity of the activity patterns associated with closed and open loop locomotion onsets by calculating the correlation coefficient between the activity traces in a window around locomotion onset (−5 s to +3 s) and averaging across regions of interest (see Methods). We found the highest similarity between closed and open loop locomotion onsets in C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide and in mice that expressed GCaMP6 in PV positive interneurons, and the similarity was lowest in mice that expressed GCaMP6 in Tlx3 positive L5 IT and Ntsr1 positive L6 excitatory neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref></bold>). Thus, excitatory neurons of deep cortical layers exhibited the strongest differences between closed and open loop locomotion related activation. The remarkable aspect of these findings is not that there are differences between closed and open loop locomotion onsets, particularly in visual regions of cortex one would perhaps expect to find differences, but that these differences are larger specifically in the deep cortical layers.</p>
<p>To quantify how the interaction between locomotion and visual flow feedback changes across dorsal cortex, we computed correlations between calcium activity and locomotion speed for each region of interest, for closed and open loop conditions separately. In C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide, this correlation was comparable between closed and open loop conditions, was highest in posterior regions of dorsal cortex, and lower in more anterior regions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref></bold>). In mice that expressed GCaMP6 in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons, the correlation between locomotion speed and calcium activity in the closed loop condition was negative in posterior regions of dorsal cortex and positive in anterior regions. Conversely, in open loop conditions, the correlation was positive throughout dorsal cortex (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref></bold>). To test whether it was the coupling of visual flow that resulted in a reduction of the correlation in the closed loop condition or whether the presence of an uncoupled visual stimulus resulted in an increase of correlation in the open loop condition, we also compared these correlations to those observed when mice were locomoting in relative darkness (see Methods). In C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide, the correlation of calcium activity with locomotion in darkness was indistinguishable from that in closed or open loop (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). In mice that expressed GCaMP6 in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons, an interesting pattern emerged. In visual regions of dorsal cortex, the correlation between locomotion speed and calcium activity in relative darkness resembled that observed in open loop conditions, while in frontal regions, it resembled that observed in closed loop conditions. In visual regions, the coupling of visual flow resulted in a reduction of correlation, while in frontal regions the presence of an uncoupled visual stimulus resulted in an increase of correlations. Thus, the difference between closed and open loop conditions likely had different origins in visual and frontal regions of dorsal cortex. Overall, we concluded that the coupling of locomotion and resulting visual flow feedback not only activated Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons differentially but did so throughout dorsal cortex, well beyond visual regions.</p>

<title>Visuomotor prediction errors originated in visual cortical regions and had opposing effects on Tlx3 positive L5 IT activity</title>
<p>A consequence of the natural coupling of locomotion and visual flow feedback is that movements are a good predictor of self-generated sensory feedback. In our closed loop experiments, forward locomotion was a strong predictor of backward visual flow. It has been speculated that such predictions are used to compute prediction errors in L2/3 of cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jordan and Keller, 2020</xref>). Prediction errors come in two variants: Positive prediction errors that signal more visual flow than predicted and negative prediction errors that signal less visual flow than predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>). To probe for negative and positive prediction error signals, we quantified the responses to visuomotor mismatch events and to unexpected visual stimuli (representing less and more visual flow input than expected, respectively). Visuomotor mismatch was introduced by briefly (1 s) halting visual flow during self-generated feedback in the closed loop condition. Visual responses were elicited by presenting drifting grating stimuli to a passively observing mouse (see Methods). Please note, both types of prediction errors can be probed using a variety of stimuli, but the two we are using here, in our experience, are the most robust at eliciting strong responses in V1. In C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide, both visuomotor mismatch and grating stimuli resulted in increases of activity that were strongest and appeared first in visual regions of dorsal cortex (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref></bold>). In mice that expressed GCaMP6 in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons, visuomotor mismatch resulted in an increase of activity in V1, while grating onsets resulted in a decrease of activity in V1 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref></bold>). Thus, in dorsal cortex, both mismatch and drifting grating stimuli primarily activated visual cortex but resulted in opposing activation patterns in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons. An increase in activity to negative prediction errors and a decrease to positive prediction errors would be consistent with either a population of negative prediction error neurons or a type of internal representation neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>). Given that L5 neurons in V1 do not exhibit the opposing influence of top-down and bottom-up inputs necessary to compute prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jordan and Keller, 2020</xref>), we speculated that Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons might function as a type of internal representation neuron.</p>

<title>The antipsychotic drug clozapine alters visuomotor integration in L5</title>
<p>The activation of an internal representation is the brain’s best guess at what the stimuli in the environment are. We speculated that the activation of such an internal representation would be particularly susceptible to substances that are known to reduce illusory percepts, like antipsychotic drugs. We thus quantified the changes in dorsal cortex activity associated with a single intraperitoneal injection of an antipsychotic drug (clozapine). In C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide, we found that closed and open loop locomotion onsets were almost unaffected by clozapine (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref></bold>), while there was a small increase in open loop visual flow onset responses (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). In mice that expressed GCaMP6 in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons, however, clozapine fundamentally changed both closed and open loop locomotion onset responses. In V1, both types of locomotion onset now resulted in a massive increase in activity (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref></bold>). Conversely, open loop visual flow onset responses remained largely unchanged (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>). These effects could not be explained by clozapine induced changes in hemodynamic occlusion (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref></bold>) or locomotion behavior (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5B</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5C</xref></bold>). Clozapine also had an opposing effect on the average correlation of activity with locomotion speed in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons. While the average correlation between activity and locomotion speed was increased in C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide, the same measure was decreased in mice that expressed GCaMP6 in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D</xref></bold>). Finally, we confirmed that this effect was also present when recording somatic activity in V1. Using two-photon imaging, after clozapine administration we observed an increase of somatic responses during locomotion onsets that was very similar to that observed with widefield imaging (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5E</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5F</xref></bold>). Thus, consistent with the speculation that Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons might function as internal representation neurons, clozapine exhibited a substantially stronger influence on locomotion onset responses in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons than would be expected from the effect of clozapine on brain wide responses.</p>

<title>Antipsychotic drugs decouple long-range cortico-cortical activity</title>
<p>L5 IT neurons are likely the primary source of long-range cortical communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Leinweber et al., 2017</xref>). Given that clozapine increased locomotion onset responses in L5 IT neurons in V1, we wondered whether clozapine might more generally change the long-range influence between L5 IT neurons. To investigate this possibility, we computed the correlations of calcium activity between the six regions of interest across both hemispheres and all recording conditions. We did this first in C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide before (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>) and after a single intraperitoneal injection of clozapine (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). Overall, clozapine resulted in a relatively modest decrease in correlations. On repeating this experiment in mice that expressed GCaMP6 in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons, we found a larger decrease in correlations that appeared to be stronger for regions that were further apart (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref></bold>). To quantify these changes, we plotted the correlations as a function of linear distance between the regions as measured in a top-down view of dorsal cortex (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref></bold>). Note, this is only an approximation of the actual axonal path length between the regions. To visualize the distribution of correlations, we interpolated the data and represented them as heatmaps (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref></bold>). The resulting representation for the data from C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide before and after clozapine injection is shown in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref></bold>, respectively. We then split the data into approximately equal portions of short-and long-range correlations using a cutoff of 0.9 times the bregma-lambda distance (approximately 3.8 mm). While both short-and long-range correlations were reduced, this reduction was not significant in either case (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>). We also found no evidence of a difference between short-and long-range correlation changes. In mice that expressed GCaMP6 in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons, however, we found a significant reduction in both short-and long-range correlations (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref></bold>), and both were more strongly reduced than in C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide (C57BL/6 vs Tlx3-Cre x Ai148, short-range: p &lt; 0.05; long-range: p &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>; rank-sum test). Moreover, the reduction in activity correlations was stronger for long-range correlations than it was for short-range correlations (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref></bold>). To control for possible clozapine induced changes in hemodynamic occlusion, we repeated the experiment and analyses in Tlx3-Cre mice that expressed eGFP in L5 IT neurons and found that alterations in hemodynamic occlusion could not account for the decrease in correlations but resulted in a small increase of the same metric (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6C</xref>-<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6E</xref></bold>). To further dissect the spatial scale at which this decorrelation occurs, we repeated the experiments in Tlx3-Cre x Ai148 mice that expressed GCaMP6 in L5 IT neurons, recording calcium activity using both a widefield and a two-photon microscope. We found that while the activity correlations measured with the widefield imaging decreased (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7A</xref>-<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7C</xref></bold>), pairwise somatic activity correlations measured by two-photon imaging did not (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7D</xref></bold>). This is consistent with the idea that the decorrelation primarily occurs for long-range interactions. Finally, to confirm that the clozapine induced reduction in correlation was stronger in deep cortical layers, we repeated the experiment in a population of L2/3 and L4 excitatory neurons using Cux2-CreERT2 x Ai148 mice. We found that clozapine also decreased correlations of cortical activity in superficial excitatory neurons (<bold><xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref></bold>). However, this reduction was significantly weaker than the reduction we observed in mice that expressed GCaMP6 in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons (Cux2-CreERT2 x Ai148 vs Tlx3-Cre x Ai148, short-range: p &lt; 0.005, long-range: p &lt; 10<sup>-8</sup>, rank-sum test). Thus, administration of the antipsychotic drug clozapine resulted in a decorrelation of activity across dorsal cortex that was stronger in L5 IT neurons (Tlx3) than it was in either upper layer excitatory neurons (Cux2) or in the brain wide average (C57BL/6).</p>

<p>To test whether the decorrelation of the activity of L5 IT neurons is specific to clozapine or might more generally be a functional signature of antipsychotic drugs, we repeated the experiments with two additional antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole and haloperidol. We found that the principal effect of decorrelation of the activity patterns of Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons was preserved with both drugs (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref></bold>). These changes in correlation were absent upon injection of a psychostimulant, amphetamine (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7G</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref></bold>). Thus, it is possible that a decrease in long-range correlations between cortical L5 IT neurons might be a common mechanism of action for antipsychotic drugs.</p>

<p>Changes in the correlation between cortical regions could either be driven by changes in correlated external inputs or through changes in communication between cortical regions. If antipsychotic drugs primarily reduce correlations by reducing the strength of communication between cortical regions, independent of whether this communication is direct or indirect, we would expect to find changes in the way responses spread between cortical regions. We used visuomotor prediction error responses that originated in V1 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>) to quantify how the spread of these responses in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons was influenced by antipsychotic drugs. The computation of negative prediction errors during movement is thought to be driven by an excitatory prediction of visual flow mediated by long-range cortical input from L5 neurons in regions like A24b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Leinweber et al., 2017</xref>), as well as an inhibitory bottom-up visual input. By contrast, the computation of a positive prediction error during passive observation is thought to be driven by an excitatory bottom-up visual input and an inhibitory top-down input. Thus, we would primarily expect to find a reduction in mismatch responses in L5 IT neurons and a reduction in the spread of this signal to secondary visual regions. This is indeed what we observed: Mismatch responses were partially reduced in V1 and almost absent in V2am after injection of antipsychotic drugs (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref></bold>). While responses to onsets of drifting gratings were also reduced in V2am, they were overall less affected by the antipsychotic drugs than mismatch responses (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref></bold>). These results are consistent with the interpretation that antipsychotic drugs reduce lateral communication in L5. Whether this communication is mediated by direct long-range connections between L5 neurons, or indirectly via other cortical neurons or subcortical loops, remains to be tested.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When interpreting our results, it should be kept in mind that the source of the widefield imaging signal in these experiments is not entirely clear and is likely a combination of somatic, dendritic, and axonal signals. Given that the signal attenuation half depth in cortex is on the order of 100 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aravanis et al., 2007</xref>), most signals likely come from the superficial 100 µm of tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allen et al., 2017</xref>). In the case of the Tlx3 recordings, this would mean that we were recording a mixture of axonal and dendritic signals of the Tlx3 neurons that have their soma in L5 but have a dense net of axons and dendrites in L1. In the case of the brain wide expression of GCaMP using an AAV-PHP.eB in C57BL/6 mice, the signals we recorded likely also include contributions from thalamic axons. In addition to this, there is a hemodynamic contribution to the signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Valley et al., 2020</xref>) that is the result of varying occlusion by blood vessels. We attempted to correct for the hemodynamic response using a 405 nm wavelength isosbestic illumination of GCaMP6 but could not recover the hemodynamic responses measured in eGFP experiments. Accurate correction likely requires calibration on eGFP measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Valley et al., 2020</xref>). Given that hemodynamic responses should not systematically differ between different mouse lines, and that in the crystal skull preparation the contribution of hemodynamic occlusion to increases in fluorescence was relatively small (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref></bold>), these hemodynamic artefacts should not substantially alter our conclusions. Lastly, it should be kept in mind that responses in these widefield recordings inherently reflect population averages. Assuming there is some form of lateral inhibition among neurons, population averages need not reflect responses of neurons that are tuned to the specific stimulus presented. For example, the suppression to grating stimuli we observed in V1 Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons could be the result of a subset of Tlx3 neurons that are strongly responsive to the specific grating presented suppressing the rest of the population of Tlx3 neurons. The sum of both could then result in a net decrease in calcium activity. Thus, an understanding of the mechanism that results in opposing population responses of Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons to positive and negative prediction errors will require measurements with single neuron resolution.</p>
<p>In our experiments we have focused on Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons, but given that L5 IT neurons are densely connected to L5 pyramidal tract neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kiritani et al., 2012</xref>) and to L6 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yamawaki and Shepherd, 2015</xref>), it is not unlikely that these neuron types would follow similar patterns of activity and exhibit similar susceptibility to the influence of antipsychotic drugs. In the comparison of closed and open loop locomotion onsets, we do indeed find that Ntsr1 positive L6 excitatory neurons exhibit similar levels of dissimilarity as those observed in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref></bold>). It is possible that responses in the Ntsr1 recordings, however, were noisier than those in the Tlx3 recordings (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref></bold>), likely because of the lower dendritic and axonal volume of Ntsr1 positive neurons in L1. Thus, while we have focused on the Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons mainly for reasons of experimental convenience, it is possible that both the differential activation in closed and open loop locomotion onsets as well as the susceptibility of long-range correlations to antipsychotic drugs is a general feature of cortical layers 5 and 6.</p>
<p>It is still unclear what the relevant sites of action in the brain are of antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotic drugs are often antagonists of the D2 receptors, which are most strongly expressed in striatum. Consequently, it is sometimes assumed that the relevant site of action of antipsychotics is the striatum. Consistent with this, an increase in striatal dopamine activates auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Maia and Frank, 2017</xref>) and mediates hallucination-like perceptions in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schmack et al., 2021</xref>). It is intriguing, however, to speculate that the effects we observed in L5 IT neurons, which provide a dominant input to striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Morita et al., 2019</xref>), may be an alternate site of action. While it is possible that the primary site of action of the antipsychotic drugs with respect to the L5 decorrelation phenotype we observed is striatum, this is unlikely. Changes to striato-thalamo-cortical loops could appear as changes in functional connectivity observed in cortex. However, feedback from striatum to cortex is exclusively mediated through thalamus, and neither L4, the primary thalamo-recipient layer in cortex, nor our brain wide recordings exhibited any of the effects we saw in L5 IT neurons. Thus, the effects we saw in L5 IT neurons are either not inherited from striatum or are mediated by a separate set of thalamic neurons via direct thalamic input to deep cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Constantinople and Bruno, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Douglas and Martin, 1991</xref>). Thalamocortical collaterals in deep layers, however, come from thalamic neurons that project primarily to superficial layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Oberlaender et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we think it is unlikely that the observed effects in L5 IT neurons were inherited from striatum. Independent of whether the treatment-relevant site of action of antipsychotic drugs is indeed in L5 IT neurons, the long-range decorrelation of activity we observed after antipsychotic drug injection could be used as a basis for a functional screen for compounds with antipsychotic efficacy. Given that in the brain wide recordings the decorrelation of activity was weaker compared to that observed in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons, it might be possible to test for similar effects in human subjects using layer specific fMRI recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Haarsma et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>A rather surprising implication of our results is that the dominant mode of coupling in cortex might be lateral, not vertical. Two findings would argue for this interpretation. First, while L5 was differentially activated across cortical regions during closed and open loop locomotion onsets, L2/3 exhibited rather limited differences. Second, antipsychotics decorrelated L5 activity but had no effect on L2/3. Both findings could be explained if the long-range lateral coupling within L5 is stronger than the local vertical coupling between L2/3 and L5.</p>
<p>One of the diseases treated with antipsychotic drugs is schizophrenia. It has been speculated that disrupted resting-state functional connectivity in brain networks involving cortex is central to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Northoff and Duncan, 2016</xref>). Treatment-naïve schizophrenia patients predominantly exhibit increases in resting state functional connectivity between cortical regions, while medicated schizophrenia patients exhibit more balanced fractions of increased and decreased functional connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Auditory hallucinations, one of the hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia, are associated with increased activation of diverse cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Catafau et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dierks et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shergill et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that antipsychotic drugs counteract this by reducing the strength of long-range cortical connectivity mediated by L5 IT neurons, independent of whether the increased activity in schizophrenic patients is indeed driven by aberrant increases in the strength of long-range cortical connections or is a consequence of an aberrant increase in the strength of striato-thalamo-cortical loops. However, a direct involvement of cortical circuits in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia is consistent with the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. This hypothesis is based on the finding that NMDA receptor antagonists induce schizophrenia-like symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Moghaddam and Javitt, 2012</xref>), and that disturbances of NMDA and AMPA receptor related gene expression are associated with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Harrison and Weinberger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Singh et al., 2020</xref>). In V1, it has been shown that NMDA receptors are necessary during visual development to establish normal prediction error signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Widmer and Keller, 2021</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that a disruption of glutamatergic signaling in cortex that alters the way internal representations are activated by prediction errors is central to the etiology of schizophrenia. If so, we should find impairments in all domains of cortical function, including sensory processing. In the case of the sensory cortex, cortical dysfunctions should be apparent earlier in development, concurrent with the critical period for plasticity in sensory areas of cortex. While the core symptoms of schizophrenia typically appear in late adolescence, sensory processing is indeed impaired in schizophrenic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Javitt, 2009</xref>) and is apparent, for example, in the reduction of surround suppression in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yoon et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, some of these disturbances are detectable already during childhood as visuo-perceptual and reading anomalies in some subjects that later develop schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Parellada et al., 2017</xref>). Positive symptoms of schizophrenia can be explained in a predictive processing framework of cortical function as a disturbance of a prediction error based update of internal representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fletcher and Frith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Frith, 2005</xref>). There are two types of prediction error neurons, positive and negative, and, given that cortex likely implements a non-hierarchical variant of predictive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Garner and Keller, 2022</xref>), two types of internal representation neurons. One set of internal representation neurons is excited by positive prediction errors and inhibited by negative prediction errors, and the other one is inhibited by positive prediction errors and excited by negative prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</xref>). Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons exhibited opposing responses to positive and negative prediction errors (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>), consistent with the responses of internal representation neurons. Given that the effects of antipsychotic drugs are predominantly observed in L5 IT neurons, and that anesthesia is thought to decouple L5 neuron soma from their apical tuft and thereby prevent conscious perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Suzuki and Larkum, 2020</xref>), we speculate that Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons may be one type of internal representation neuron and one of the functionally relevant sites of antipsychotic action.</p>

The mice used for widefield imaging in this study were kept on a C57BL/6 background and were of the following genotype: 6 C57BL/6 (Charles River Laboratories), 4 Emx1-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>), 4 Cux2-CreERT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Franco et al., 2012</xref>), 7 Scnn1a-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>), 22 Tlx3-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gerfen et al., 2013</xref>), 3 Ntsr1-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gong et al., 2007</xref>), 2 PV-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</xref>), 6 VIP-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>), and 5 SST-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>) mice. Ai148 ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>), Jackson Laboratories, stock #030328) mice were used as breeders to drive GCaMP6f expression in Cre positive neurons. An additional 8 C57BL/6 and 7 Tlx3-Cre mice were used in experiments controlling for hemodynamic responses. To induce expression of Cre in the Cux2-CreERT2 line, mice were provided for at least 1 week with tamoxifen containing food (Envigo, 400 mg tamoxifen per kg of food) as their sole food source. Mice were group housed in a vivarium (light/dark cycle: 12/12 hours). Experimental mice were of either sex.</p>

<title>Surgery and virus injections</title>
<p>For all surgical procedures, mice were anesthetized using a mixture of fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg; Actavis), midazolam (5.0 mg/kg; Dormicum, Roche), and medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg; Domitor, Orion). In a subset of mice (6 C57BL/6, 4 Emx1-Cre, and 4 SST-Cre mice), we injected an AAV vector based on the PHP.eB capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chan et al., 2017</xref>) retro-orbitally (6 μl each eye of at least 10<sup>13</sup> GC/ml) to drive expression of GCaMP under either the EF1α or hSyn1 promoter pan-neuronally, or in a cell type specific manner using a double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) construct. For hemodynamic response control experiments, we used an AAV-PHP.eB-EF1α-eGFP to pan-neuronally express eGFP (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref></bold>) or an AAV-PHP.eB-EF1α-DIO-eGFP to restrict eGFP expression to L5 IT neurons in Tlx3-Cre mice (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1D</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5A</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6C</xref>-<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6E</xref></bold>). To improve optical access to the cortex, we implanted crystal skull cranial windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Prior to removing the skull plate overlying dorsal cortex, we recorded the location of bregma relative to other landmarks on the skull. Superglue (Pattex) was used to glue the crystal skull in place in the craniotomy. In a subset of mice, for the comparison of hemodynamic responses (<bold>Figure S1A and S1B</bold>), we used a clear skull preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). To do this, we attached the crystal skull coverslip directly onto the cleaned skull surface with a three-component polymer (C&amp;B Metabond, Parkell). A custom-machined titanium head bar was attached to the skull using dental cement (Paladur, Heraeus). An epifluorescence overview image was taken to mark reference points on the dorsal cortical surface. Anesthesia was antagonized by an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg; Anexate, Roche) and atipamezole (2.5 mg/kg; Antisedan, Orion Pharma). For peri-and post-operative analgesia we injected buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg; Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare (UK) Ltd.) and Metacam (5 mg/kg; Boehringer Ingelheim). Imaging commenced at the earliest 1 week after head bar implantation or 3 weeks after retro-orbital AAV injection. Clozapine (Novartis), aripiprazole (Otsuka Pharmaceutical), haloperidol (Janssen), or amphetamine (Hänseler) was intraperitoneally injected at 0.2 μg/g - 10 μg/g, 0.2 μg/g, 0.1 μg/g or 4 μg/g body weight, respectively.</p>

<title>Virtual reality setup and stimulus design</title>
<p>For all experiments we used a virtual reality setup as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Leinweber et al., 2014</xref>). Mice were head-fixed and free to run on a spherical, air-supported Styrofoam ball. A virtual corridor was projected (using a Samsung SP-F10M projector) onto a toroidal screen positioned in front of the mouse covering a field of view of approximately 240 degrees horizontally and 100 degrees vertically. Recordings were blocked into 5-minute sessions. Experiments typically commenced with 4 sessions of a closed loop condition in which the rotation of the spherical treadmill was coupled to the movement in a virtual corridor. To introduce mismatches, we broke the coupling between locomotion and visual flow by briefly halting visual flow for 1 s at random times. Closed loop sessions were followed by 4 sessions of an open loop condition, in which rotation of the spherical treadmill and movement in the virtual corridor were decoupled. The visual stimulus consisted of a replay of the visual flow recorded in the previous closed loop condition. Following this we recorded 2 sessions of what we refer to as a dark condition in which the virtual reality was switched off. Please note, this was not complete darkness, primarily because the shielding of the blue excitation light was not light proof. Finally, we recorded activity in 2 sessions of a grating condition in which we presented drifting grating stimuli (8 directions of 6 s ± 2 s (mean ± SD) duration each with an inter-grating interval of 4.5 s ± 1.5 s (mean ± SD) gray screen, presented in randomized order). These sessions, totaling approximately 1 hour of recording time per day, were acquired for 3 consecutive days. For mice in which we went on to test the effect of drugs on dorsal cortex activity, the first post-drug injection data were acquired +1 h after drug injection (+30 mins in the case of amphetamine because of faster onset kinetics of the drug) and further data were collected at the +24 h and +48 h timepoints. Data in the manuscript are shown as the combined data over either all data collected before drug injection (labelled as naive) or after drug injection (labelled as clozapine, aripiprazole, haloperidol or amphetamine, respectively).</p>

<title>Data acquisition</title>
<p>All widefield imaging experiments were performed on a custom-built macroscope consisting of commercially available objectives mounted face-to-face (Nikon 85 mm/f1.8 sample side, Nikon 50 mm/f1.4 sensor side). We used a 470 nm LED (Thorlabs) powered by a custom-built LED driver for exciting GCaMP (or eGFP) fluorescence through an excitation filter (SP490, Thorlabs) reflected off a dichroic mirror (LP490, Thorlabs) placed in the parfocal plane of the objectives. Green fluorescence was collected through a 525/50 emission filter on an sCMOS camera (PCO edge 4.2). Apertures on objectives were usually kept maximally open and the current at the LED driver was used to adjust fluorescence intensity to a value that was kept below 25% of the maximum dynamic range of the sensor. In cases where this was not possible (e.g., transfection of eGFP yielded extremely bright fluorescence, often visible with the naked eye), objective apertures were gradually reduced to avoid overexposure of the sensor. LED illumination was adjusted with a collimator (Thorlabs SM2F32-A) to achieve homogenous illumination across the surface of the cranial window. The resulting Gaussian profile of the illumination cone was further trimmed with black tape on the sample side objective to avoid light shining directly into the mouse’s eye. An Arduino board (Arduino Mega 2560) was used to control LED onsets synced to the frame trigger signal of the camera. The duty cycle of the 470 nm LED was 90%. Raw images were acquired at full speed (100 Hz; except for eGFP controls, which were acquired at 50 Hz effective frame rate) and full dynamic range (16 bit) of the sensor. The raw images were cropped on-sensor and the resulting data was streamed to disk with custom written software in LabVIEW (National Instruments), resulting in an effective pixel size of 60 μm<sup>2</sup> at a standardized imaging resolution of 1108 pixels x 1220 pixels (1.35 MP).</p>
<p>Two-photon calcium imaging was performed using a custom-built microscope based on a Thorlabs B-scope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Leinweber et al., 2014</xref>). Illumination source was a tunable femtosecond laser (Coherent Chameleon) tuned to 930 nm. Emission light was band-pass filtered using a 525/50 filter for GCaMP and detected using a GaAsP photomultiplier (H7422, Hamamatsu). Photomultiplier signals were amplified (DHPCA-100, Femto), digitized (NI5772, National Instruments) at 800 MHz, and band-pass filtered around 80 MHz using a digital Fourier-transform filter implemented in custom-written software on an FPGA (NI5772, National Instruments). The scanning system of the microscope was based on a 12 kHz resonant scanner (Cambridge Technology). Images were acquired at a resolution of 750 pixels x 400 pixels at a 60 Hz frame rate and a piezo-electric linear actuator (P-726, Physik Instrumente) was used to move the objective (Nikon 16x, 0.8 NA) in steps of 15 µm between frames to acquire images at 4 different depths. This resulted in an effective frame rate of 15 Hz. The field of view was 350 µm x 350 µm.</p>

<title>Data processing</title>
<p>Off-line data processing and data analysis (section below) were done with custom-written MATLAB (2021a) scripts. For widefield macroscope imaging, raw movie data was manually registered across days by aligning subsequent mean projections of the data to the first recorded image sequence. We placed regions of interest (ROIs) relative to readily identifiable anatomical landmarks that had been previously noted during cranial window surgery (see above). This resulted in the selection of six 20 pixels x 20 pixels ROIs per hemisphere. Of those ROIs, we calculated the activity as the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, wherein F<sub>0</sub> was the median fluorescence of the recording (approximately 30 000 frames in a 5 min recording). ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was corrected for slow fluorescence drift caused by thermal brightening of the LED using 8<sup>th</sup> percentile filtering with a 62.5 s moving window similar to what was described previously for two-photon imaging (Daniel A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dombeck et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Raw two-photon imaging data were full-frame registered to correct for brain motion. Neurons were manually selected based on mean and maximum fluorescence images. Raw fluorescence traces were corrected for slow drift in fluorescence using an 8<sup>th</sup> percentile filtering with a 15 s window (Daniel A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dombeck et al., 2007</xref>). ΔF/F traces were calculated as mean fluorescence in a selected region of every imaging frame and subsequently subtracted and normalized by the median fluorescence.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Locomotion and visual flow onsets were determined based on threshold crossing of locomotion or visual flow speed. To select only well isolated onsets, we used a speed threshold of 30 cm/s and excluded all onsets with locomotion or visual flow in the 3 s window preceding the onset. To increase the number of locomotion onsets that passed the speed threshold criterion for the eGFP imaging data (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5A</xref></bold>), we excluded only those onsets if there was locomotion in the 1 s window preceding onset.</p>
<p>All stimulus response curves (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1L</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>-<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5A</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5B</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5E</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5F</xref></bold>) were baseline subtracted. The baseline subtraction window for unpredictable stimuli (mismatches and grating onsets) was −200 ms to 0 ms before stimulus onset. For closed loop and open loop locomotion onsets, and open loop visual flow onsets, to accommodate calcium indicator offset dynamics and potential anticipatory activity, we placed the baseline subtraction windows for these onsets at −2900 ms to −2700 ms for GCaMP imaging, or −900 ms to −700 ms for eGFP imaging. Varying this window within the bounds of offset dynamics of the indicator and anticipatory activity onset did not change the conclusions drawn in this manuscript. Analyses in which image sequences were aligned to event onsets (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></bold>) used the same parameters as above.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, we observed seizure-like activity after antipsychotic drug injection. These events resulted in atypically high levels of correlation, and to avoid them from influencing our conclusions we excluded these data from further analysis. We excluded sessions if they contained an event in which average activity of all 12 ROIs remained elevated above 30% ΔF/F for more than 10 s. This criterion led to the exclusion of 0.26% of data (10 out of 3801 of 5 min recording sessions).</p>
<p>To quantify the similarity of closed loop and open loop locomotion onset responses shown in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref></bold> we calculated the correlation coefficient between the averaged responses (onsets and mice, 1 s moving average) in a window −5 s to +3 s, for each ROI.</p>
<p>To calculate the maps that show the timing of activation of individual dorsal cortex regions (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref></bold>), we first aligned the craniotomies of all mice within one genotype to the first mouse’s average grating response map and then calculated an average dorsal cortex response time course. For each pixel of this image sequence, we then determined the time at which the pixel’s value crossed a threshold of the maximum value in the entire time course, divided by 6 standard deviations of the pixel’s baseline value (−200 ms to 0 ms before event onset, as stated above). The resulting maps were denoised using a Gaussian filter and we removed all pixel clusters that contained fewer than 500 connected pixels. For illustration purposes, these maps were overlaid over an example crystal skull craniotomy to produce the panels shown in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>.</p>
<p>For the correlation analyses shown in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>-<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8</xref></bold>, we first calculated the correlation coefficient of neuronal activity (or fluorescence change, in the case of Tlx3-Cre mice that had been retro-orbitally injected with an AAV-PHP.eB-Ef1α-DIO-eGFP to express eGFP in L5 IT neurons) for all possible pairs of the 12 regions of interest. We then determined the distance between each pair of ROIs and normalized this value by the distance between bregma and lambda obtained from the images during initial surgery for each mouse (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref></bold>). We plotted the correlation against the distance for each pair of regions of interest and binned the data in a 40 x 40 grid and smoothed the resulting image with a gaussian filter (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref></bold>), to obtain the heatmaps shown in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6B</xref>-<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6D</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7A</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7B</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8C</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8D</xref></bold>. Contour lines in the heatmaps were then drawn to 50% of the maximum value in the plot. The boxplot quantifications (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6E</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7C</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8E</xref></bold>) were calculated as the change in correlation coefficient of activity after and before treatment for all pairs of regions of interest, normalized to the value before treatment and split into short-and long-range using a threshold of 0.9 of the bregma-lambda distance for each mouse. For pairwise neuronal correlations that had been recorded with two-photon imaging (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7D</xref></bold>), we calculated the correlation coefficient separately for all pairs of neurons within each field of view. We noticed extreme synchrony of activity of L5 IT soma recorded in 1 field of view with two-photon imaging after clozapine injection and show, both distributions for all data, as well as the distribution when this 1 field of view is excluded.</p>
<p>For <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>, onset aligned data were first averaged for each mouse and then summed in the given combinations. The SEM was calculated over mice.</p>
<p>To obtain the differences in the correlation between activity and locomotion after and before clozapine injection (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D</xref></bold>), we first averaged all correlation coefficients in the individual sessions of a condition (closed loop, open loop, or dark) to generate one correlation coefficient per mouse and ROI, for each condition. We then calculated and plotted the difference between these correlation values after and before clozapine injection.</p>

<p>The authors present a study of visuo-motor coupling primarily using wide-field calcium imaging to measure activity across the dorsal visual cortex. They used different mouse lines or systemically injected viral vectors to allow imaging of calcium activity from specific cell-types with a particular focus on a mouse-line that expresses GCaMP in layer 5 IT (intratelencephalic) neurons. They examined the question of how the neural response to predictable visual input, as a consequence of self-motion, differed from responses to unpredictable input. They identify layer 5 IT cells as having a different response pattern to other cell-types/layers in that they show differences in their response to closed-loop (i.e. predictable) vs open-loop (i.e. unpredictable) stimulation whereas other cell-types showed similar activity patterns between these two conditions. They analyze the latencies of responses to visuomotor prediction errors obtained by briefly pausing the display while the mouse is running, causing a negative prediction error, or by presenting an unpredicted visual input causing a positive prediction error. They suggest that neural responses related to these prediction errors originate in V1, however, I would caution against over-interpretation of this finding as judging the latency of slow calcium responses in wide-field signals is very challenging and this result was not statistically compared between areas. Surprisingly, they find that presentation of a visual grating actually decreases the responses of L5 IT cells in V1. They interpret their results within a predictive coding framework that the last author has previously proposed. The response pattern of the L5 IT cells leads them to propose that these cells may act as 'internal representation' neurons that carry a representation of the brain's model of its environment. Though this is rather speculative. They subsequently examine the responses of these cells to anti-psychotic drugs (e.g. clozapine) with the reasoning that a leading theory of schizophrenia is a disturbance of the brain's internal model and/or a failure to correctly predict the sensory consequences of self-movement. They find that anti-psychotic drugs strongly enhance responses of L5 IT cells to locomotion while having little effect on other cell-types. Finally, they suggest that anti-psychotics reduce long-range correlations between (predominantly) L5 cells and reduce the propagation of prediction errors to higher visual areas and suggest this may be a mechanism by which these drugs reduce hallucinations/psychosis.</p>
<p>This is a large study containing a screening of many mouse-lines/expression profiles using wide-field calcium imaging. Wide-field imaging has its caveats, including a broad point-spread function of the signal and susceptibility to hemodynamic artifacts, which can make interpretation of results difficult. The authors acknowledge these problems and directly address the hemodynamic occlusion problem. It was reassuring to see supplementary 2-photon imaging of soma to complement this data-set, even though this is rather briefly described in the paper. Overall the paper's strengths are its identification of a very different response profile in the L5 IT cells compared other layers/cell-types which suggests an important role for these cells in handling integration of self-motion generated sensory predictions with sensory input. The interpretation of the responses to anti-psychotic drugs is more speculative but the result appears robust and provides an interesting basis for further studies of this effect with more specific recording techniques and possibly behavioral measures.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work investigates the effects of various antipsychotic drugs on cortical responses during visuomotor integration. Using wide-field calcium imaging in a virtual reality setup, the researchers compare neuronal responses to self-generated movement during locomotion-congruent (closed loop) or locomotion-incongruent (open loop) visual stimulation. Moreover, they probe responses to unexpected visual events (halt of visual flow, sudden-onset drifting grating). The researchers find that, in contrast to a variety of excitatory and inhibitory cell types, genetically defined layer 5 excitatory neurons distinguish between the closed and the open loop condition and exhibit activity patterns in visual cortex in response to unexpected events, consistent with unsigned prediction error coding. Motivated by the idea that prediction error coding is aberrant in psychosis, the authors then inject the antipsychotic drug clozapine, and observe that this intervention specifically affects closed loop responses of layer 5 excitatory neurons, blunting the distinction between the open and closed loop conditions. Clozapine also leads to a decrease in long-range correlations between L5 activity in different brain regions, and similar effects are observed for two other antipsychotics, aripripazole and haloperidol, but not for the stimulant amphetamine. The authors suggest that altered prediction error coding in layer 5 excitatory neurons due to reduced long-range correlations in L5 neurons might be a major effect of antipsychotic drugs and speculate that this might serve as a new biomarker for drug development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Relevant and interesting research question:</p>
<p>The distinction between expected and unexpected stimuli is blunted in psychosis but the neural mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, it is critical to understand whether and how antipsychotic drugs used to treat psychosis affect cortical responses to expected and unexpected stimuli. This study provides important insights into this question by identifying a specific cortical cell type and long-range interactions as potential targets. The authors identify layer 5 excitatory neurons as a site where functional effects of antipsychotic drugs manifest. This is particularly interesting as these deep layer neurons have been proposed to play a crucial role in computing the integration of predictions, which is thought to be disrupted in psychosis. This work therefore has the potential to guide future investigations on psychosis and predictive coding towards these layer 5 neurons, and ultimately improve our understanding of the neural basis of psychotic symptoms.</p>
<p>- Broad investigation of different cell types and cortical regions:</p>
<p>One of the major strengths of this study is quasi-systematic approach towards cell types and cortical regions. By analysing a wide range of genetically defined excitatory and inhibitory cell types, the authors were able to identify layer 5 excitatory neurons as exhibiting the strongest responses to unexpected vs. expected stimuli and being the most affected by antipsychotic drugs. Hence, this quasi-systematic approach provides valuable insights into the functional effects of antipsychotic drugs on the brain, and can guide future investigations towards the mechanisms by which these medications affect cortical neurons.</p>
<p>- Bridging theory with experiments:</p>
<p>Another strength of this study is its theoretical framework, which is grounded in the predictive coding theory. The authors use this theory as a guiding principle to motivate their experimental approach connecting visual responses in different layers with psychosis and antipsychotic drugs. This integration of theory and experimentation is a powerful approach to tie together the various findings the authors present and to contribute to the development of a coherent model of how the brain processes visual information both in health and in disease.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Unclear relevance for psychosis research:</p>
<p>From the study, it remains unclear whether the findings might indeed be able to normalise altered predictive coding in psychosis. Psychosis is characterised by a blunted distinction between predicted and unpredicted stimuli. The results of this study indicate that antipsychotic drugs further blunt the distinction between predicted and unpredicted stimuli, which would suggest that antipsychotic drugs would deteriorate rather than ameliorate the predictive coding deficit found in psychosis. However, these findings were based on observations in wild-type mice at baseline. Given that antipsychotics are thought to have little effects in health but potent antipsychotic effects in psychosis, it seems possible that the presented results might be different in a condition modelling a psychotic state, for example after a dopamine-agonistic or a NMDA-antagonistic challenge. Therefore, future work in models of psychotic states is needed to further investigate the translational relevance of these findings.</p>
<p>- Incomplete testing of predictive coding interpretation:</p>
<p>While the investigation of neuronal responses to different visual flow stimuli Is interesting, it remains open whether these responses indeed reflect internal representations in the framework of predictive coding. While the responses are consistent with internal representation as defined by the researchers, i.e., unsigned prediction error signals, an alternative interpretation might be that responses simply reflect sensory bottom-up signals that are more related to some low-level stimulus characteristics than to prediction errors. Moreover, This interpretational uncertainty is compounded by the fact that the used experimental paradigms were not suited to test whether behaviour is impacted as a function of the visual stimulation which makes it difficult to assess what the internal representation of the animal actual was. For these reasons, the observed effects might reflect simple bottom-up sensory processing alterations and not necessarily have any functional consequences. While this potential alternative explanation does not detract from the value of the study, future work would be needed to explain the effect of antipsychotic drugs on responses to visual flow. For example, experimental designs that systematically vary the predictive strength of coupled events or that include a behavioural readout might be more suited to draw from conclusions about whether antipsychotic drugs indeed alter internal representations.</p>
<p>- Methodological constraints of experimental design:</p>
<p>While the study findings provide valuable insights into the potential effects of antipsychotic drugs, it is important to acknowledge that there may be some methodological constraints that could impact the interpretation of the results. More specifically, the experimental design does not include a negative control condition or different doses. These conditions would help to ensure that the observed effects are not due to unspecific effects related to injection-induced stress or time, and not confined to a narrow dose range that might or might not reflect therapeutic doses used in humans. Hence, future work is needed to confirm that the observed effects indeed represent specific drug effects that are relevant to antipsychotic action.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Overall, the results support the idea that antipsychotic drugs affect neural responses to predicted and unpredicted stimuli in deep layers of cortex. Although some future work is required to establish whether this observation can indeed be explained by a drug-specific effect on predictive coding, the study provides important insights into the neural underpinnings of visual processing and antipsychotic drugs, which is expected to guide future investigations on the predictive coding hypothesis of psychosis. This will be of broad interest to neuroscientists working on predictive coding in health and in disease.</p>

<p>The study examines how different cell types in various regions of the mouse dorsal cortex respond to visuomotor integration and how antipsychotic drugs impacts these responses. Specifically, in contrast to most cell types, the authors found that activity in Layer 5 intratelencephalic neurons (Tlx3+) and Layer 6 neurons (Ntsr1+) differentiated between open loop and closed loop visuomotor conditions. Focussing on Layer 5 neurons, they found that the activity of these neurons also differentiated between negative and positive prediction errors during visuomotor integration. The authors further demonstrated that the antipsychotic drugs reduced the correlation of Layer 5 neuronal activity across regions of the cortex, and impaired the propagation of visuomotor mismatch responses (specifically, negative prediction errors) across Layer 5 neurons of the cortex, suggesting a decoupling of long-range cortical interactions.</p>
<p>The data when taken as a whole demonstrate that visuomotor integration in deeper cortical layers is different than in superficial layers and is more susceptible to disruption by antipsychotics. Whilst it is already known that deep layers integrate information differently from superficial layers, this study provides more specific insight into these differences. Moreover, this study provides a first step into understanding the potential mechanism by which antipsychotics may exert their effect.</p>
<p>Whilst the paper has several strengths, the robustness of its conclusions is limited by its questionable statistical analyses. A summary of the paper's strengths and weaknesses follow.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors perform an extensive investigation of how different cortical cell types (including Layer 2/3, 4 , 5, and 6 excitatory neurons, as well as PV, VIP, and SST inhibitory interneurons) in different cortical areas (including primary and secondary visual areas as well as motor and premotor areas), respond to visuomotor integration. This investigation provides strong support to the idea that deep layer neurons are indeed unique in their computational properties. This large data set will be of considerable interest to neuroscientists interested in cortical processing.</p>
<p>The authors also provide several lines of evidence that visuomotor information is differentially integrated in deep vs. superficial layers. They show that this is true across experimental paradigms of visuomotor processing (open loop, closed loop, mismatch, drifting grating conditions) and experimental manipulations, with the demonstration that Layer 5 visuomotor integration is more sensitive to disruption by the antipsychotic drug clozapine, compared with cortex as a whole.</p>
<p>The study further uses multiple drugs (clozapine, aripiprazole and haloperidol) to bolster its conclusion that antipsychotic drugs disrupt correlated cortical activity in Layer 5 neurons, and further demonstrates that this disruption is specific to antipsychotics, as the psychostimulant amphetamine shows no such effect.</p>
<p>In widefield calcium imaging experiments, the authors effectively control for the impact of hemodynamic occlusions in their results, and try to minimize this impact using a crystal skull preparation, which performs better than traditional glass windows. Moreover, they examine key findings in widefield calcium imaging experiments with two-photon imaging.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A critical weakness of the paper is its statistical analysis. The study does not use mice as its independent unit for statistical comparisons but rather relies on other definitions, without appropriate justification, which results in an inflation of sample sizes. For example, in Figure 1, independent samples are defined as locomotion onsets, leading to sample sizes of approx. 400-2000 despite only using 6 mice for the experiment. This is only justified if the data from locomotion onsets within a mouse is actually statistically independent, which the authors do not test for, and which seems unlikely. With such inflated sample sizes, it becomes more likely to find spurious differences between groups as significant. It also remains unclear how many locomotion onsets come from each mouse; the results could be dominated by a small subset of mice with the most locomotion onsets. The more disciplined approach to statistical analysis of the dataset is to average the data associated with locomotion onsets within a mouse, and then use the mouse as an independent unit for statistical comparison. A second example, for instance, is in Figure 2L, where the independent statistical unit is defined as cortical regions instead of mice, with the left and right hemispheres counting as independent samples; again this is not justified. Is the activity of cortical regions within a mouse and across cortical hemispheres really statistically independent? The problem is apparent throughout the manuscript and for each data set collected.</p>
<p>An additional statistical issue is that it is unclear if the authors are correcting for the use of multiple statistical tests (as in for example Figure 1L and Figure 2B,D). In general, the use of statistics by the authors is not justified in the text.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that whilst the study demonstrates that antipsychotics may selectively impact visuomotor integration in L5 neurons, it does not show that this effect is necessary or sufficient for the action of antipsychotics; though this is likely beyond the scope of the study it is something for readers to keep in mind.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors present a study of visuo-motor coupling primarily using wide-field calcium imaging to measure activity across the dorsal visual cortex. They used different mouse lines or systemically injected viral vectors to allow imaging of calcium activity from specific cell-types with a particular focus on a mouse-line that expresses GCaMP in layer 5 IT (intratelencephalic) neurons. They examined the question of how the neural response to predictable visual input, as a consequence of self-motion, differed from responses to unpredictable input. They identify layer 5 IT cells as having a different response pattern to other cell-types/layers in that they show differences in their response to closed-loop (i.e. predictable) vs open-loop (i.e. unpredictable) stimulation whereas other cell-types showed similar activity patterns between these two conditions. They analyze the latencies of responses to visuomotor prediction errors obtained by briefly pausing the display while the mouse is running, causing a negative prediction error, or by presenting an unpredicted visual input causing a positive prediction error. They suggest that neural responses related to these prediction errors originate in V1, however, I would caution against over-interpretation of this finding as judging the latency of slow calcium responses in wide-field signals is very challenging and this result was not statistically compared between areas.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, they find that presentation of a visual grating actually decreases the responses of L5 IT cells in V1. They interpret their results within a predictive coding framework that the last author has previously proposed. The response pattern of the L5 IT cells leads them to propose that these cells may act as 'internal representation' neurons that carry a representation of the brain's model of its environment. Though this is rather speculative. They subsequently examine the responses of these cells to anti-psychotic drugs (e.g. clozapine) with the reasoning that a leading theory of schizophrenia is a disturbance of the brain's internal model and/or a failure to correctly predict the sensory consequences of self-movement. They find that anti-psychotic drugs strongly enhance responses of L5 IT cells to locomotion while having little effect on other cell-types. Finally, they suggest that anti-psychotics reduce long-range correlations between (predominantly) L5 cells and reduce the propagation of prediction errors to higher visual areas and suggest this may be a mechanism by which these drugs reduce hallucinations/psychosis.</p>
<p>This is a large study containing a screening of many mouse-lines/expression profiles using wide-field calcium imaging. Wide-field imaging has its caveats, including a broad point-spread function of the signal and susceptibility to hemodynamic artifacts, which can make interpretation of results difficult. The authors acknowledge these problems and directly address the hemodynamic occlusion problem. It was reassuring to see supplementary 2-photon imaging of soma to complement this data-set, even though this is rather briefly described in the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will expand on the discussion of caveats as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall the paper's strengths are its identification of a very different response profile in the L5 IT cells compared other layers/cell-types which suggests an important role for these cells in handling integration of self-motion generated sensory predictions with sensory input. The interpretation of the responses to anti-psychotic drugs is more speculative but the result appears robust and provides an interesting basis for further studies of this effect with more specific recording techniques and possibly behavioral measures.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work investigates the effects of various antipsychotic drugs on cortical responses during visuomotor integration. Using wide-field calcium imaging in a virtual reality setup, the researchers compare neuronal responses to self-generated movement during locomotion-congruent (closed loop) or locomotion-incongruent (open loop) visual stimulation. Moreover, they probe responses to unexpected visual events (halt of visual flow, sudden-onset drifting grating). The researchers find that, in contrast to a variety of excitatory and inhibitory cell types, genetically defined layer 5 excitatory neurons distinguish between the closed and the open loop condition and exhibit activity patterns in visual cortex in response to unexpected events, consistent with unsigned prediction error coding. Motivated by the idea that prediction error coding is aberrant in psychosis, the authors then inject the antipsychotic drug clozapine, and observe that this intervention specifically affects closed loop responses of layer 5 excitatory neurons, blunting the distinction between the open and closed loop conditions. Clozapine also leads to a decrease in long-range correlations between L5 activity in different brain regions, and similar effects are observed for two other antipsychotics, aripripazole and haloperidol, but not for the stimulant amphetamine. The authors suggest that altered prediction error coding in layer 5 excitatory neurons due to reduced long-range correlations in L5 neurons might be a major effect of antipsychotic drugs and speculate that this might serve as a new biomarker for drug development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Relevant and interesting research question:</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>The distinction between expected and unexpected stimuli is blunted in psychosis but the neural mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, it is critical to understand whether and how antipsychotic drugs used to treat psychosis affect cortical responses to expected and unexpected stimuli. This study provides important insights into this question by identifying a specific cortical cell type and long-range interactions as potential targets. The authors identify layer 5 excitatory neurons as a site where functional effects of antipsychotic drugs manifest. This is particularly interesting as these deep layer neurons have been proposed to play a crucial role in computing the integration of predictions, which is thought to be disrupted in psychosis. This work therefore has the potential to guide future investigations on psychosis and predictive coding towards these layer 5 neurons, and ultimately improve our understanding of the neural basis of psychotic symptoms.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Broad investigation of different cell types and cortical regions:</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>One of the major strengths of this study is quasi-systematic approach towards cell types and cortical regions. By analysing a wide range of genetically defined excitatory and inhibitory cell types, the authors were able to identify layer 5 excitatory neurons as exhibiting the strongest responses to unexpected vs. expected stimuli and being the most affected by antipsychotic drugs. Hence, this quasi-systematic approach provides valuable insights into the functional effects of antipsychotic drugs on the brain, and can guide future investigations towards the mechanisms by which these medications affect cortical neurons.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Bridging theory with experiments</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>Another strength of this study is its theoretical framework, which is grounded in the predictive coding theory. The authors use this theory as a guiding principle to motivate their experimental approach connecting visual responses in different layers with psychosis and antipsychotic drugs. This integration of theory and experimentation is a powerful approach to tie together the various findings the authors present and to contribute to the development of a coherent model of how the brain processes visual information both in health and in disease.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Unclear relevance for psychosis research</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>From the study, it remains unclear whether the findings might indeed be able to normalise altered predictive coding in psychosis. Psychosis is characterised by a blunted distinction between predicted and unpredicted stimuli. The results of this study indicate that antipsychotic drugs further blunt the distinction between predicted and unpredicted stimuli, which would suggest that antipsychotic drugs would deteriorate rather than ameliorate the predictive coding deficit found in psychosis. However, these findings were based on observations in wild-type mice at baseline. Given that antipsychotics are thought to have little effects in health but potent antipsychotic effects in psychosis, it seems possible that the presented results might be different in a condition modelling a psychotic state, for example after a dopamine-agonistic or a NMDA-antagonistic challenge. Therefore, future work in models of psychotic states is needed to further investigate the translational relevance of these findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree that it is unclear how the effects of antipsychotics in mice relate to the drug effects that would be observed in schizophrenic patients. It is also correct that the reduction of the difference between closed and open loop locomotion onset response in L5 IT neurons (Figure 4) is not what we would have expected to find under the assumption that psychosis is characterized by a blunted distinction between predicted and unpredicted stimuli. We are not sure how to interpret this finding. However, it is probably important to note that the difference is only reduced when using a normalized comparison. Looking just at the subtraction of the two curves, the difference between closed and open loop locomotion onset responses remains unchanged before and after antipsychotic drug injection. The finding of a decorrelation of layer 5 activity, however, is easier to interpret under the assumption that layer 5 functions as an internal representation. If speech hallucinations, for example, are the consequence of a spurious activation of internal representations in speech processing areas of cortex, then antipsychotics might reduce the probability of these spurious activation events by reducing the lateral influence between layer 5 neurons in different cortical areas.</p>
<p>We do indeed plan to address the question of how antipsychotics influence cortical processing in mouse models of schizophrenia in the future.</p>

<p>We agree that much additional work will be necessary to identify internal representation neurons. However, it is difficult to envision how behavioral output could be used to make inferences about internal representations in sensory areas of cortex. In humans, for example, there is evidence that internal representations in visual cortex and behavioral output are not always directly related: binocular rivalry activates representations of both stimuli shown in visual cortex, while the conscious experience that drives behavioral output is only of one of the two stimuli. Hence, we would assume that the internal representation in visual cortex does not necessarily relate to behavioral output.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that both dosages and a broader spectrum of non-antipsychotic compounds will need to be investigated. We are in the process of building a screening pipeline to perform exactly these types of experiments. We would however argue that the paper already includes a control condition in the form of the amphetamine data (Figure 7). While it is possible that amphetamine might have an effect that exactly cancels out potential i.p. injection- or stress-induced changes, we would argue it is more probable that these changes had no measurable effect on Tlx3 positive L5 IT neuron calcium activity per se. We will provide additional evidence that time or injection stress alone do not result in the observed effects.</p>

<p>For example, in Figure 1, independent samples are defined as locomotion onsets, leading to sample sizes of approx. 400-2000 despite only using 6 mice for the experiment. This is only justified if the data from locomotion onsets within a mouse is actually statistically independent, which the authors do not test for, and which seems unlikely.

</disp-quote>
<p>This may partially be a misunderstanding. Figures 1F-1K indeed use locomotion onsets as a unit, but there were no statistical comparisons. In these Figures we were addressing the question of whether locomotion onsets in closed loop differ from those in open loop. Thus, we quantify variability as a unit of locomotion onsets. The question of mouse-to-mouse variability of this analysis is a slightly different one. We did include the same analysis (for visual cortex) with the variability calculated across mice as Figure S2. We will expand this supplementary figure with the equivalent data of Figure 3 to further address this concern.</p>
<p>For Figure 1L (we assume the reviewer means Figure 1L, not Figure 2L), the unit we used for analysis was cortical area. We will update and improve the analysis. This was indeed not optimal, and we will replace the statistical testing with hierarchical bootstrap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906290/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906290/</ext-link>) to account for nested data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>An additional statistical issue is that it is unclear if the authors are correcting for the use of multiple statistical tests (as in for example Figure 1L and Figure 2B,D). In general, the use of statistics by the authors is not justified in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will update and improve the analysis shown in Figure 1L.</p>
<p>In Figures 2B and 2D, we think adding family-wise error correction would be slightly misleading. We could add a correction – our conclusions would remain unchanged almost independent of the choice of correction (most of the significant p values are infinitesimally small, see Table S1). However, our interpretation is not focusing on one particular comparison (of many possible comparisons) that is significant - all comparisons between closed and open loop data points were significant in the L5 IT recordings and none of them were significant in the recordings in C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain-wide.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, it is important to note that whilst the study demonstrates that antipsychotics may selectively impact visuomotor integration in L5 neurons, it does not show that this effect is necessary or sufficient for the action of antipsychotics; though this is likely beyond the scope of the study it is something for readers to keep in mind.</p>
