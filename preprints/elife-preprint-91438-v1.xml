<title>Abstract</title><p>The nuclear receptor, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR/NR1H4), is increasingly recognized as a promising drug target for metabolic diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Protein coding genes regulated by FXR are well known, but whether FXR also acts through regulation of expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which vastly outnumber protein-coding genes, remains unknown. Utilizing RNA-seq and GRO-seq analyses in mouse liver, we found that FXR induces many RNA transcripts from chromatin regions bearing enhancer features. Among these we discovered a previously unannotated liver-enriched enhancer-derived lncRNA (eRNA), termed <italic>FincoR</italic>. We further show that <italic>FincoR</italic> is specifically induced by hammerhead-type FXR agonists, including GW4064 and tropifexor. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated liver-specific knockdown of <italic>FincoR</italic> in dietary NASH mice reduced the beneficial effects of tropifexor, an FXR agonist currently in clinical trials for NASH and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), indicating that that amelioration of liver fibrosis and inflammation in NASH treatment by tropifexor is mediated in part by FincoR. Overall, our results indicate that pharmacological activation of FXR by hammerhead-type agonists induces a novel eRNA, <italic>FincoR</italic>, ameliorating NASH in mice. <italic>FincoR</italic> may represent a new drug target for combating metabolic disorders, including NASH.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and a leading cause of liver transplants and liver-related death <italic>(Friedman and Sanyal 2018)</italic>. NAFLD begins with simple steatosis but may further progress to a severe form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and later, fatal cirrhosis and liver cancer <italic>(Friedman and Sanyal, 2018)</italic>. Despite its striking global increase and clinical importance, there is no approved drug for NASH. The urgent need for development of therapeutic agents for NASH has greatly increased research interest in the nuclear receptor, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR, NR1H4) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Evans and Mangelsdorf, 2014</xref>)</italic>.</p>
<p>FXR is activated by its physiological ligands, bile acids (BAs), and regulates expression of genes involved in BA, lipid, and glucose metabolism and hepatic autophagy, which maintains metabolite levels and metabolic homeostasis <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calkin and Tontonoz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Seok et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kliewer and Mangelsdorf, 2015</xref>)</italic>. Ligand-activated FXR also protects against hepatic inflammation and liver injury <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jung et al., 2020</xref>)</italic>. The action of FXR, similar to other nuclear receptors, is achieved primarily by binding to chromatin at specific gene loci to regulate the transcription of target genes <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calkin and Tontonoz, 2012</xref>)</italic>. Consistent with its crucial physiological functions, FXR is increasingly recognized as a promising drug target, particularly for liver diseases, such as NASH and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Downes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abenavoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kremoser, 2021</xref>)</italic>. For example, semi-synthetic or non-steroidal synthetic agonists of FXR, including obeticholic acid (OCA) and hammerhead-type agonists, such as tropifexor and cilofexor, are currently under clinical trials for NASH and PBC patients <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tully et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abenavoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kremoser, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sanyal et al., 2023</xref>)</italic>. However, how pharmacological activation of FXR mediates such beneficial therapeutic effects is poorly understood.</p>
<p>Non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are one of the fascinating discoveries of modern biology <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cech and Steitz, 2014</xref>)</italic>. Indeed, only about 2% of the human genome encodes proteins, while the vast majority are transcribed into ncRNAs <italic>(The ENCODE Project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Consortium, 2012</xref>)</italic>. Of these ncRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides and play important roles in diverse biological processes <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sartorelli and Lauberth, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Statello et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mattick et al., 2023</xref>)</italic>. Many lncRNAs are produced from genomic regions bearing epigenetic features of enhancers <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mattick et al., 2023</xref>)</italic>. This is consistent with the idea that many transcriptional enhancers actively transcribe noncoding RNAs that are referred to as eRNAs, some of which are functionally important for enhancer functions <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lai and Shiekhattar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2016</xref>)</italic>. Due to the increasing technical sensitivity of RNA detection, many enhancers have been found to produce eRNAs (&gt;85k in humans and &gt;57k in mice) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hirabayashi et al., 2019</xref>)</italic>. Many eRNAs have not yet been annotated in current lncRNA databases, such as GENCODE. Exploring eRNA landscapes and functions in diverse biology and disease states will facilitate our understanding of both lncRNAs and enhancers <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mattick et al., 2023</xref>)</italic>. However, the landscape of eRNAs in mouse liver has been minimally explored <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fang et al., 2014</xref>)</italic>, and has not been studied in response to specific nuclear receptor activation, such as by FXR. Moreover, functional role of eRNAs in vivo in intact organisms is understudied.</p>
<p>FXR was shown to regulate expression of small non-coding microRNA (miR) genes, for example <italic>miR-34a and miR-802 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Seok et al., 2021</xref>)</italic>, but it has not been reported whether FXR mediates its function through regulating lncRNAs, which far outnumber miRs. Because FXR directly regulates expression of its target genes <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2012</xref>)</italic>, we examined if FXR regulates enhancer-derived lncRNAs, and if such transcripts participate in its physiological or pharmacological functions. By utilizing RNA-seq and GRO-seq analyses of mouse liver treated by FXR ligands, we identified a series of FXR-regulated eRNAs, including many that were previously unannotated. Among these, we focused on a highly induced and abundantly expressed eRNA that we referred to as FXR-induced non-coding RNA (<italic>FincoR</italic>) for functional studies. <italic>FincoR</italic> is highly enriched in mouse liver and is induced specifically by hammerhead-type FXR agonists, including GW4064 and tropifexor. In vivo studies utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated liver-specific knockdown of <italic>FincoR</italic> in dietary NASH mice indicated that <italic>FincoR</italic> is critically involved in mediating the beneficial pharmacological effects of tropifexor in reducing liver fibrosis and inflammation.</p>

<title>Activation of FXR by GW4064 induces a novel eRNA, FincoR, in mouse liver</title>
<p>To identify enhancer-derived lncRNAs (eRNAs) potentially regulated by FXR, we first obtained a list of putative enhancers in mouse liver based on ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP-Seq data (ENCFF001KMI, see <bold>methods</bold>). Then, we performed ribo-depleted total RNA-seq in the livers from mice treated with a specific FXR agonist, GW4064, to identify transcripts produced from these enhancer regions (see <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table"><bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold></xref>). To avoid confounding issues of RNA signals from genes, we specifically focused on intergenic enhancer regions (+/-3kb from H3K27ac peak center) that harbor discernible RNA-Seq signals (RPKM &gt; 1).</p>
<p>This genomic analysis resulted in identification of 190 high-confidence eRNAs in mouse liver. Among these, 14 eRNAs were upregulated and 5 were downregulated by GW4064 treatment (FDR &lt; 0.05, Log2 FC &gt; 1, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>) (see <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table"><bold>Supplementary Table S2</bold></xref>). FXR-regulated eRNAs were produced adjacent to many genes with important roles in liver metabolism and disease, for example, <italic>Hes1</italic> (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1-Figure Supplement 1A, B</bold></xref>). One of the most robustly induced eRNAs was <italic><underline>F</underline>XR-induced <underline>n</underline>on-<underline>co</underline>ding <underline>R</underline>NA</italic> (<italic>FincoR)</italic>, an unannotated novel transcript located on chromosome 19 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref><bold>, B, C</bold>). Reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) confirmed that treatment with GW4064 substantially induced expression of <italic>FincoR,</italic> more than 10-fold in mouse liver, which is similar to induction of <italic>Shp</italic>, a well-known FXR target gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Goodwin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Claudel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Evans and Mangelsdorf, 2014</xref>)</italic>. Induction of <italic>FincoR</italic> by GW4064 was transient, peaked within 1 h and then, declined gradually, similar pattern to <italic>Shp</italic> (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1-Figure Supplement 1C</bold></xref>). Expression of genes adjacent to <italic>FincoR</italic>, including <italic>Gcnt1, Rfk, Pcsk5 and Prune2,</italic> did not change after acute 1 h FXR activation as shown by RNA-seq (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>), and confirmed for <italic>Gcnt1</italic> by time course qPCR (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1-Figure Supplement 1C</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Ligand-activated FXR directly activates transcription of eRNAs, including FincoR</title>
<p>We sought to examine, 1) if these eRNAs were directly activated by FXR, and 2) if the activation takes place transcriptionally using FXR liver-specific knockout (FXR-LKO) mice that were treated with GW4064 to determine if FXR was required for induction of eRNAs by GW4064. FXR-LKO mice were generated from FXR floxed mice (FXR-flox) <bold>(</bold><xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2-Figure Supplement 1A</bold></xref>) and transcription of eRNAs was detected by global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), a widely used method to detect nascent RNA transcription, including eRNAs <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sartorelli and Lauberth, 2020</xref>)</italic>. GRO-seq showed that FXR-induced eRNAs were activated transcriptionally by GW4064 in FXR-flox mice, but such induction was abolished in FXR-LKO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). In particular, <italic>FincoR</italic> is robustly induced in the GRO-Seq analysis and its induction is dependent on hepatic FXR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>).

<p>We next examined if FXR binds to these enhancers that produce the identified eRNAs by analyzing published mouse liver ChIP-Seq data for FXR (<xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table"><bold>Supplementary Table S3</bold></xref>) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2012</xref>)</italic>. FXR binding was strongly enriched at the enhancers associated with FXR-induced eRNAs as were the enhancer marks H3K27ac and H3K4me1 (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2-Figure Supplement 1C</bold></xref>). In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>, the results show the binding of FXR and the presence of histone marks at the <italic>FincoR</italic> enhancer region determined by ChIP-seq as compared with nascent transcripts detected by Gro-seq. These analyses support the conclusion that activation of FXR transcriptionally induces this series of eRNAs via chromatin binding at these enhancers, including <italic>FincoR</italic>. We validated FXR binding at the enhancer region that produces <italic>FincoR</italic> using mouse liver ChIP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>).

GW4064 treatment resulted in substantial increases in recruitment of both FXR and RXRÎ± to the enhancer region close to the transcription start site of <italic>FincoR</italic> (arrow shown below in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), whereas binding was not detected at a control region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>). We also found that BRD4 occupancy was increased at this enhancer region after GW4064 treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>). These results indicate that GW4064 activation of FXR leads to increased occupancy of the FXR/RXRÎ± heterodimer and BRD4 to the enhancer region to upregulate <italic>FincoR</italic> eRNA in the liver.</p>
<p>We identified an inverted repeat1 (IR1) motif that was known to bind FXR <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calkin and Tontonoz, 2012</xref>)</italic> within the major FXR binding peak near the start site of <italic>FincoR</italic> (arrow shown below in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), which we also refer to as FXRE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref><bold>, C</bold>). We examined the functionality of this IR1 motif for mediating transcriptional activation by GW4064 using reporter assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>). We cloned the region containing the IR1 motif into the pGL4.23 luciferase reporter and generated a mutated IR1 motif construct as a comparison (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>). After transfection into human hepatic HepG2 cells, GW4064 treatment significantly elevated the luciferase activity of the reporter with the wild type IR1 motif, but not with the mutated IR1 motif (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>). Together, these results suggest that GW4064-activated FXR directly upregulates <italic>FincoR</italic> expression.</p>

<p>We adopted a mouse model that had been fed the Amylin Liver NASH-promoting (AMLN) diet <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hernandez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sun et al., 2022</xref>)</italic>, and examined the effects of liver-specific downregulation of FincoR in potentially impacting tropifexor effects on NASH pathology.

Also, FincoR downregulation had little effects on liver cholesterol and gallbladder bile acid levels, although these levels were reduced by Tropifexor (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6D</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with the phenotypes, hepatic expression of key genes involved in BA synthesis was dramatically reduced by tropifexor treatment (i.e., <italic>Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1</italic>), which is consistent with decreased gallbladder BA levels by this drug (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6E</bold></xref>).

<p>In the same AMLN diet-fed mice above (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>), analyses of liver sections revealed that tropifexor treatment reduced hepatocyte swelling/ballooning (H&amp;E staining), decreased numbers of apoptotic cells (TUNEL staining), alleviated fibrosis (Sirius red staining), and lowered infiltration of macrophages (F4/80 staining) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>FXR maintains metabolic homeostasis by transcriptional regulation of genes. Direct regulation of protein-coding genes by FXR, including <italic>Shp</italic>, is well characterized. In this study we show that FXR also mediates its functions by induction of lncRNA genes, which vastly outnumber protein-coding genes. We further show that pharmacological activation of FXR by hammerhead-type agonists induces a liver-specific enhancer-derived lncRNA, which we named FincoR, that contributes to reduction of NASH pathologies in mice.</p>
<p>FincoR is specifically induced by the hammerhead class of FXR agonists, such as GW4064, cilofexor, and tropifexor. It was not induced by other FXR ligands, including its endogenous ligand, cholic acid, suggesting that FincoR does not contribute to physiological functions of FXR, but instead plays a role in pharmacological FXR responses and possibly in pathological processes. GW4064 is the mother compound of these isoxazole type ligands but is not an ideal therapeutic agent because of its poor water solubility and pharmacokinetics <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abel et al., 2010</xref>)</italic>. In contrast, tropifexor and cilofexor have better pharmacokinetics and were generally well-tolerated in clinical trials for NASH and PBC patients <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tully et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abenavoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kremoser, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sanyal et al., 2023</xref>)</italic>, but the underlying mechanisms for their beneficial effects are poorly understood. Intriguingly, a recent study showed that the gene signature regulated by tropifexor-activated FXR appears to be broader than that of OCA, partly because the tropifexor backbone allows a more favorable interaction of FXR with coactivators or epigenomic modulators <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hernandez et al., 2019</xref>)</italic>. Further, tropifexor was shown to regulate distinct sets of genes, particularly those promoting fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress, in experimental NASH <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hernandez et al., 2019</xref>)</italic>. Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated liver-specific knockdown of FincoR in diet-induced NASH mice, we demonstrate that beneficial effects on reducing liver fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis mediated by tropifexor were largely dependent on FincoR (Model, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 7E</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The roles of regulatory RNAs in liver function and diseases and as therapeutic targets or drugs are increasingly being appreciated (<italic>Sallam et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brocker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al., 2021</xref>)</italic>. For example, a critical role for an oxysterol nuclear receptor LXR-induced lncRNA, LeXis, in feedback modulation of cholesterol biosynthesis has been shown <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sallam et al., 2016</xref>)</italic>. Recently, the role of a lncRNA, Pair, in the liver phenylalanine metabolism has been demosntrated <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al., 2021</xref>)</italic>. Enhancer RNAs are a less characterized class of lncRNAs and are highly associated with enhancer functions in gene regulation <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2016</xref>)</italic>. Numerous studies have revealed transcriptional roles for eRNAs in various cellular processes <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lai and Shiekhattar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2016</xref>)</italic> but most previous eRNA studies have used culture cells <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hsieh et al., 2014</xref>)</italic>, with only a few in vivo studies in mouse models <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mirtschink et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tang et al., 2023</xref>)</italic>. In our current study, through integrative analysis of transcriptome and histone mark ChIP-Seq, we identified FXR-induced eRNAs, including the highly induced <italic>FincoR</italic>. We further examined the expression of function of <italic>FincoR</italic> utilizing mouse models. Our current work characterized the role of <italic>FincoR</italic> in gene regulation and in mediating beneficial pharmacological effects of FXR agonists in NASH, representing an important progress in understanding physiological/pathological roles of eRNAs in vivo. Future work is warranted to understand the exact mechanisms by which <italic>FincoR</italic> facilitates action of FXR agonists to alleviate inflammation, fibrosis and apoptosis.</p>
<p>While this study focused on regulation of <italic>FincoR</italic> by pharmacological activation of FXR, physiological and pathological regulations of <italic>FincoR</italic> appear to be complex. <italic>FincoR</italic> was not induced by acute cholic acid feeding, but <italic>FincoR</italic> levels were elevated in mouse models of cholestatic liver (data not shown), where BA metabolism is dysregulated. Since different BAs can activate or repress the gene-regulating function of FXR <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wahlstrom et al., 2016</xref>)</italic>, altered BA composition in cholestatic liver may contribute to induction of <italic>FincoR</italic>. Further, binding peaks for multiple nuclear receptors, FXR, LXR, PPARÎ±, RXRÎ±, and HNF-4Î±, were detected in the <italic>FincoR</italic> gene locus so that regulation of <italic>FincoR</italic> likely involves combinatorial regulation by multiple nuclear receptors (<xref rid="ufigs1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Other Supplementary</bold> Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, occupancy of the nuclear receptor PPARÎ± at the enhancer region was increased in fasted mice (<xref rid="ufigs2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Other Supplementary</bold> Figure 2</xref>). It will be interesting to see whether expression of <italic>FincoR</italic> is differently regulated by these nuclear receptors in response to physiological and pathological cues.</p>
<p>FXR is increasingly recognized as an important therapeutic target for enterohepatic diseases, but the development of clinically applicable and more targeted FXR-based therapy is still challenging. In this study, we provided the first characterization of an eRNA, <italic>FincoR</italic>, induced by pharmacological activation of FXR and show that <italic>FincoR</italic> has a beneficial role in reducing liver fibrosis and inflammation in dietary NASH mice. Complete understanding of the function and mechanisms of <italic>FincoR</italic> may provide novel insights for the development of desirable therapy for NASH and other chronic liver diseases.</p>

<title>Animal experiments</title>
<p>All animal studies were performed according to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care &amp; Use Committee at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Mice were maintained in 12/12 h light/dark cycles and fed standard rodent chow. FXR-LKO mice were generated by breeding FXR floxed mice with Albumin-Cre mice (The Jackson Lab). FincoR-LKD mice were generated as previously reported <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>)</italic>. Briefly, Cas9 transgenic mice (JAX #024858) were via the tail vein injected with adenoviruses (approximately 5x10<sup>8</sup> PFU) expressing two sgRNAs targeting FincoR (sgRNA1: <italic>GGGTTAAGAGCTGTAGGCTG</italic> and sgRNA2: ACTTCTATGTCCAACAACCG). The sequences of sgRNAs were designed using a CRISPR design tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu/">http://crispr.mit.edu/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Mice were given a single dose of vehicle or 30 mg/kg GW4064 (in corn oil, Tocris Bioscience, #2473) after overnight fasting. Mice were treated with 0.5 mg/kg tropifexor (in corn oil, MedChem Express, HY-107418), 30 mg/kg cilofexor (in corn oil, MedChemExpress, HY-109083), 100 mg/kg fexaramine (in 0.5% methylcellulose, MedChem Express, HY-10912), and 20 mg/kg OCA (in 0.5% methylcellulose, MedChem Express, HY-12222) as indicated.

<title>Construction of strand-specific RNAseq libraries</title>
<p>Construction of the RNAseq libraries and sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 were performed at the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After DNase digestion, purified total RNAs were analyzed on a Fragment Analyzer (Agilent) to evaluate RNA integrity. The total RNAs were converted into individually barcoded polyadenylated mRNAseq libraries with the Kapa HyperPrep mRNA kit (Roche). Libraries were barcoded with Unique Dual Indexes (UDIâs) which have been developed to prevent index switching. The adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNAs were amplified by PCR for 8 cycles with the Kapa HiFi polymerase (Roche). The final libraries were quantitated with Qubit (ThermoFisher) and the average cDNA fragment sizes were determined on a Fragment Analyzer. The libraries were diluted to 10 nM and further quantitated by qPCR on a CFX Connect Real-Time qPCR system (Bio-Rad) for accurate pooling of barcoded libraries and maximization of number of clusters in the flowcell.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Sequencing of libraries in the NovaSeq</title>
<p>The barcoded RNAseq libraries were loaded on one SP lane on a NovaSeq 6000 for cluster formation and sequencing. The libraries were sequenced from one end of the fragments for a total of 100 bp. The fastq read files were generated and demultiplexed with the bcl2fastq v2.20 Conversion Software (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The quality of the demultiplexed fastq files was evaluated with the FastQC software, which generates reports with the quality scores, base composition, k-mer, GC and N contents, sequence duplication levels and overrepresented sequences.</p>

<title>GRO-seq</title>
<p>To harvest the nuclei from mouse liver cells, the liver was harvested at indicated time and washed with a cold swelling buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 U/ml Superase-In). The nuclei were prepared by Dounce homogenization in cold swelling buffer and filtered using the cell strainer (100 Î¼m, BD Biosciences). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 400 x g for 10 min, then resuspended in the lysis buffer (swelling buffer with 10% glycerol and 1% IGEPAL) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were washed twice with the lysis buffer and resuspended at a concentration of 10<sup>8</sup> nuclei/ml in the freezing buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EDTA). We then followed our previous method <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Oh et al., 2021</xref>)</italic> to conduct nuclear run-on and GRO-Seq library preparation. Briefly, the nuclei in freezing buffer were subjected to the nuclear run-on reaction by mixing with an equal volume of run-on buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 300 mM KCl, 20 units of Superase-In, 1% sarkosyl, 500 ÂµM ATP, GTP, Br-UTP and 2 ÂµM CTP) for 5 min at 30 Â°C. The BrU-labeled run-on RNAs were extracted by TRIzol and purified by anti-BrdU agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech, sc-32323 AC). The run-on RNAs were then subjected to end repair by T4 PNK, poly-adenylation, and then to cDNA first strand synthesis by a custom primer (oNTI223) that allows circularization of the cDNA. This cDNA then was re-linearized by Ape1 (NEB), size selected by TBE gel and the products of the desired size were excised (â¼320â350 bp) for final library prep and sequencing. GRO-Seq samples were run on a NextSeq 500 sequencer from Illumina with a single-end 80 nt model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the article titled &quot;Hammerhead-type FXR agonists induce an eRNA FincoR that ameliorates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice,&quot; the authors explore the role of the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) in treating metabolic disorders like NASH. They identify a new liver-specific long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), FincoR, regulated by FXR, notably induced by agonists such as tropifexor. The study shows that FincoR plays a significant role in enhancing the efficacy of tropifexor in mitigating liver fibrosis and inflammation associated with NASH, suggesting its potential as a novel therapeutic target. The study makes a promising contribution to understanding the role of FincoR in alleviating liver fibrosis in NASH, providing initial insights into the mechanisms involved. While it offers a valuable starting point, there is potential for further exploration into the functional roles of FincoR and their specific actions in human NASH cases. Building upon the current findings to elucidate more detailed mechanistic pathways through which FincoR exerts its therapeutic effects in liver disease would elevate the research's significance and potential impact in the field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study stands out for its comprehensive and unbiased approach to investigating the role of FincoR, a liver-specific lncRNA, in the treatment of NASH. Key strengths include: 1) The application of advanced sequencing methods like GRO-seq and RNA-seq offered a comprehensive and unbiased view of the transcriptional changes induced by tropifexor, particularly highlighting the role of FincoR. 2) Utilizing a genetic mouse model of FXR KO and a FincoR liver-specific knockdown (FincoR-LKD) mouse model provided a controlled and relevant environment for studying NASH, allowing for precise assessment of tropifexor's therapeutic effects. 3) The inclusion of tropifexor, an FDA-approved FXR agonist, adds significant clinical relevance to the study. It bridges the gap between experimental research and potential therapeutic application, providing a direct pathway for translating these findings into real-world clinical benefits for NASH patients. 4) The study's rigorous experimental design, incorporating both negative and positive controls, ensured that the results were specifically attributable to the action of FincoR and tropifexor.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study presents several notable weaknesses that could be addressed to strengthen its findings and conclusions: 1) The authors focus on FincoR, but do not extensively test other lncRNAs identified in Figure 1A. A more comprehensive approach, such as rescue experiments with these lncRNAs, would provide a better understanding of whether similar roles are played by other lncRNAs in mitigating NASH. 2) FincoR was chosen for further study primarily because it is the most upregulated lncRNA induced by GW4064. Including another GW4064-induced lncRNA as a control in functional studies would strengthen the argument for FincoR's unique role in NASH. 3) The study does not conclusively demonstrate whether FincoR is specifically expressed in hepatocytes or other liver cell types. Conducting FincoR RNA-FISH with immunofluorescent experiments or RT-PCR, using markers for different liver cell types, would clarify its expression profile. 4) Understanding the absolute copy number of FincoR is crucial. Determining whether there are sufficient copies of FincoR to function as proposed would lend more credibility to its suggested role. 5) The manuscript, although technically proficient, does not thoroughly address the relevance of these findings to human NASH. Questions like the conservation of FincoR in humans and its potential role in human NASH should be discussed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NASH), recently renamed as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a leading cause of liver-related death. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a promising drug target for treating NASH and several drugs targeting FXR are under clinical investigation for their efficacy in treating NASH. The authors intended to address whether FXR mediates its hepatic protective effects through the regulation of lncRNAs, which would provide novel insights into the pharmacological targeting of FXR for NASH treatment. The authors went from an unbiased transcriptomics profiling to identify a novel enhancer-derived lncRNA FincoR enriched in the liver and showed that the knockdown of FincoR in a murine NASH model attenuated part of the effect of tropifexor, an FXR agonist, namely inflammation and fibrosis, but not steatosis. This study provides a framework for how one can investigate the role of noncoding genes in pharmacological intervention targeting known protein-coding genes. Given that many disease-associated genetic variants are located in the non-coding regions, this study, together with others, may provide useful information for improved and individualized treatment for metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study leverages both transcriptional profile and epigenetic signatures to identify the top candidate eRNA for further study. The subsequent biochemical characterization of FincoR using FXR-KO mice combined with Gro-seq and Luciferase reporter assays convincingly demonstrates this eRNA as a FXR transcriptional target sensitive to FXR agonists. The use of in vitro culture cells and the in vivo mouse model of NASH provide multi-level evaluation of the context-dependent importance of the FincoR downstream of FXR in the regulation of functions related to liver dysfunction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As discussed, future work to dissect the mechanisms by which FincoR facilitates the action of FXR and its agonists is warranted. It would be helpful if the authors could base this on the current understanding of eRNA modes of action and the observed biochemical features of FincoR to speculate potential molecular mechanisms explaining the observed functional phenotype. It is unclear if this eRNA is conserved in humans in any way, which will provide relevance to human disease. Additionally, the eRNA knockdown was achieved by deletion of an upstream region of the eRNA transcription. A more direct approach to alter eRNA levels, e.g., overexpression of FincoR in the liver would provide important data to interpret its functional regulation.</p>
