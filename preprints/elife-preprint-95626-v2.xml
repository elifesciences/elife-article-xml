<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone cancer in children and young adults. In 85% of patients, a translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 results in a potent fusion oncoprotein, EWSR1::FLI1. EWSR1::FLI1 is the only genetic alteration in an otherwise unaltered genome of Ewing sarcoma tumors. The EWSR1 portion of the protein is an intrinsically disordered domain involved in transcriptional regulation by EWSR1::FLI1. The FLI portion of the fusion contains a DNA binding domain shown to bind core GGAA motifs and GGAA repeats. A small alpha-helix in the DNA binding domain of FLI1, DBD-α4 helix, is critical for the transcription function of EWSR1::FLI1. In this study, we aimed to understand the mechanism by which the DBD-α4 helix promotes transcription, and therefore oncogenic transformation. We utilized a multi-omics approach to assess chromatin organization, active chromatin marks, genome binding, and gene expression in cells expressing EWSR1::FLI1 constructs with and without the DBD-α4 helix. Our studies revealed DBD-α4 helix is crucial for cooperative binding of EWSR1::FLI1 at GGAA microsatellites. This binding underlies many aspects of genome regulation by EWSR1::FLI1 such as formation of TADs, chromatin loops, enhancers and productive transcription hubs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive bone-associated tumor currently treated with dose-intense chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pappo and Dirksen, 2018</xref>). It affects adolescents and young adults with an incidence rate of 3 per million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ozaki, 2015</xref>). Of these patients, 25-35% have overt metastatic disease with a recurrence rate of 50-80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gaspar et al., 2015</xref>). Roughly a quarter of patients with localized disease also relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Van Mater and Wagner, 2019</xref>). The five-year survival rate of metastatic and relapsed patients is only 10-30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stahl et al., 2011</xref>). Treatment options for relapsed/metastatic Ewing sarcoma patients have not improved for the last four decades. The lack of efficient and targeted treatment for Ewing sarcoma can be attributed to our poor understanding of how precisely Ewing sarcoma is driven by a fusion oncoprotein called EWSR1::FLI1.</p>
<p>Expression of EWSR1::FLI1 results from a translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 that fuses two genes, <italic>EWSR1</italic> and <italic>FLI1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Delattre et al., 1992</xref>). As a result, the transcription activation domain of EWSR1 and the DNA binding domain of FLI1 fuse together to create a potent transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">May et al., 1993</xref>). The EWSR1 domain is highly disordered and is important for multimerization and transcriptional hub formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chong et al., 2018</xref>). The FLI portion contains a DNA binding domain that binds at two distinct sites: canonical FLI1 binding sites containing a GGAA core and microsatellites containing GGAA repeats (<bold><italic>Gangwal et al., 2008b</italic></bold>). At these GGAA microsatellites, EWSR1::FLI1 binding creates de-novo enhancers driving genome-wide reprogramming of enhancers to Ewing-specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Riggi et al., 2014</xref>). Regulation of Ewing-specific enhancers underlies the mechanisms by which EWSR1::FLI1 regulates expression of thousands of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grunewald et al., 2015</xref>). More specifically, activation of genes involved in proliferation, migration and invasion pathways leads to oncogenic transformation of precursor cells to Ewing sarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kauer et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In our recent studies of EWSR1::FLI1, we found a small alpha helix in the DNA binding domain, DBD-α4, to be required for transcription and regulation by the fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boone et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, this study did not find any change in chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) and genome localization of EWSR1::FLI1 constructs (CUT&amp;RUN) when the DBD-α4 helix was deleted leaving the mechanistic basis for the requirement of the DBD-α4 in transcription regulation unclear. In parallel studies, we also observed that EWSR1::FLI1 expression results in widespread changes to 3D chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Showpnil et al., 2022</xref>). These results together prompted us to consider whether the DBD-α4 helix is contributing towards EWSR1::FLI1’s abilities to make changes in the epigenome and the local chromatin structure. To assess whether the DBD-α4 helix is important in chromatin organization, we used our “knock-down/rescue” system in A-673 and TTC-466 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Theisen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Showpnil et al., 2022</xref>) in conjunction with genomics techniques including RNA-Seq, CUT&amp;Tag, and Micro-C. These sets of experiments allowed us to characterize the involvement of the DBD-α4 helix in modulating the chromatin organization, epigenetic reprogramming of enhancers, binding at GGAA microsatellites, and promoting transcription leading to transformation.</p>

<title>The DBD-<bold>α</bold>4 helix of FLI1 domain is required to restructure 3D chromatin in A-673 cells</title>
<p>To assess the mechanism by which the DBD-α4 promotes transcription, we depleted endogenous EWSR1::FLI1 expression with shRNA (KD) and rescued with previously published DBD and DBD+ EWSR1::FLI1 constructs with 3X-FLAG tags in A-673 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <bold><italic>Boone et al.</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2021</italic></bold>)). The main difference between DBD and DBD+ constructs is the presence of DBD-α4 helix in DBD+ (Supplementary igure 1A). We recapitulated our previous findings that DBD is unable to rescue the same number of Ewing-sarcoma specific genes as DBD+, therefore incapable of driving oncogenic transformation (Supplementary Figure 1B-D, <bold><italic>Boone et al.</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2021</italic></bold>)).</p>

<p>Next, we sought to understand the role of DBD-α4 helix in 3D chromatin organization. We carried out Micro-C experiments in KD, DBD and DBD+ cells. First, we performed multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis of the top 1000 interactions of Micro-C matrices at 500kb resolution to assess the global regulation of 3D chromatin organization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). KD replicates clustered together with DBD replicate 1 on both axes and with DBD replicate 2 on y-axis. DBD+ replicates, on the other hand, clustered away from both KD and DBD replicates. These observations suggest that the global chromatin structure of DBD replicates are more similar to KD than DBD+ replicates. We also assessed the contact frequency across the genome in KD, DBD and DBD+ cells at 5kb resolution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We found that at the mid region of the plot (10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> bp), DBD+ cells make more contacts in comparison to KD and DBD cells. This pattern of contact frequency was also detected in replicates 2, but not in replicates 1 when plotted separately (Supplementary 2A-B). At this genome-wide level, we observe that DBD cells display similar contact frequency as KD cells suggesting that the DBD-α4 helix is required for EWSR1::FLI1 mediated 3D chromatin restructuring.</p>
<p>To determine if these changes were significant, we conducted differential interaction analysis using 500kb matrices to compare DBD and DBD+ biological replicates to KD replicates. First, we detected 14,326 and 65 interactions in DBD+ and DBD cells respectively using cut-off values of adjusted p-value &lt; 0.2 and log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 0.5. Then, we used cut-off values of adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 1.5 to identify differentially interacting regions (DIRs). We found that DBD+ cells have 151 DIRs compared to KD cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) whereas DBD cells only have 7 DIRs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the DBD-α4 helix of FLI1 domain is required for EWSR1::FLI1 to restructure 3D chromatin in A-673 cells.</p>

<title>Altered TAD structure in A-673 DBD cells is linked to GGAA microsatellite binding</title>
<p>To investigate the necessity of the DBD-α4 helix for higher-order chromatin organization, we carried out topologically associated domain (TAD) analysis in A-673 cells using HiCExplorer suite of tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wolff et al., 2020</xref>). TADs are functional subunits of chromatin that define regulatory landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Szabo et al., 2019</xref>). Within these domains, chromatin interactions including those involving regulatory elements are spatially confined, often by insulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nora et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, genes located in the same TAD are typically co-regulated together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dixon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ramírez et al., 2018</xref>) and this co-regulation is facilitated by interactions between enhancers and promoters, which also tend to occur within the confines of a same TAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bonev et al., 2017</xref>). Our initial step involved identifying TADs in both DBD and DBD+ matrices with hicFindTADs at 10kb, 25kb, 50kb and 100kb resolutions. Subsequently, we computed differential TADs with hicDifferentialTAD. This analysis entailed a comparison of precomputed TAD regions of DBD and DBD+ matrices with the same regions of KD matrix. The purpose was to detect TADs that appeared specifically in response to the expression of DBD and DBD+ constructs in comparison to KD sample (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). At each resolution, the number of TADs detected when DBD+ was expressed was far greater than when DBD was expressed.</p>

</fig>
<p>To exclude duplicated TADs when combining TADs from different resolutions, we used the default threshold value of 5000bp as the minimum boundary difference required to consider two TADs as distinct. With this approach, we found 6,690 total TADs for DBD and 15,412 total TADs for DBD+ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). To understand the local biological context of these total TADs in DBD and DBD+ cells, we annotated the whole width of the TADs with CTCF and FLAG CUT&amp;Tag peaks (FDR &lt; 0.05, FC &gt;8, counts &gt; 80, IDR &lt; 0.01) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In DBD cells, we detected 11.2% of the TADs bound by CTCF only, 12.9% bound by DBD FLAG only, 36.3% bound by both CTCF and DBD FLAG, and 39.6% bound by neither. In contrast, for DBD+, we detected 7.4% and 7.0% of the TADs bound by only CTCF and only DBD+ FLAG, respectively, 29.0% bound by both and 56.6% bound by neither. These observations highlight both the increased number of total TADs detected in DBD+ cells and a notable increase in the percentage of TADs detected in DBD+ cells with no CTCF or FLAG association. This suggests a broader role for the DBD-α4 helix in genome-wide reorganization of TADs by EWSR1::FLI1, consistent with the results discussed above relating to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Next, we overlapped total TADs from DBD and DBD+ conditions and identified 2,530 TADs common to both. There were 4,345 unique TADs in DBD cells and 12,971 unique TADs in DBD+ cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). To understand the transcriptional activity driven by the DBD-α4 helix at GGAA repeats, we focused on the whole width of unique TADs containing DBD and DBD+ FLAG peaks at GGAA microsatellites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). This analysis narrowed the TADs down to 868 unique ones for DBD cells and 2,460 unique TADs for DBD+ cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). We observed that within these TAD subsets containing FLAG peaks at GGAA microsatellites, the intensity of the DBD+ FLAG peaks was higher compared to DBD FLAG peaks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, TADs uniquely bound by DBD+ at GGAA microsatellites were not only wider (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) but also contained a higher number of differentially expressed genes compared to those bound only by DBD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and Supplementary Figure 3A). Further analysis of GGAA microsatellites bound by DBD and DBD+ peaks within unique TADs revealed that the DBD+ FLAG peaks were associated with longer microsatellites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>) and denser GGAA motifs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, density calculated by multiplying the number of GGAA motif by 4 and dividing by the total length of the microsatellites) in contrast those bound by DBD alone. These findings suggest that DBD+ accesses longer and denser microsatellites within larger TADs and binds to these sites with higher binding intensity than DBD. Furthermore, these TADs with DBD+ bound microsatellites show greater changes in genes expression suggesting a functional role for the DBD-α4 helix in gene regulation within TADs.</p>
<p>TAD boundaries are regions between TADs that act as insulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>) and are often marked by active chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ay et al., 2014</xref>). We conducted a similar analysis as above in a 20kb region around unique TAD boundaries (Supplementary Figure 3B-3G). We observed a comparable percentage of the unique TAD boundaries were bound by only CTCF peaks in DBD and DBD+ cells (36.3% and 32.2%, respectively). The percentage of boundaries with FLAG peaks in DBD and DBD+ cells were 15.2% and 8.6%, respectively (Supplementary Figure 3B). When we considered boundaries that overlap with FLAG peaks at microsatellites (Supplementary Figure 3C-3G), we observe similar findings as those spanning the whole width of TADs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, 2F-2H). The FLAG peaks at DBD+ specific TAD boundaries were of higher intensity than FLAG peaks at DBD specific TAD boundaries (Supplementary Figure 3C). Next we assessed gene expression at TAD boundaries and found DBD+ boundaries contained more significantly regulated genes (Supplementary Figure 3D-3E). The GGAA microsatellites bound by DBD+ FLAG peaks at boundaries were also longer and denser than DBD bound microsatellites (Supplementary Figure 3F-3G). These data demonstrate that the DBD-α4 helix affects overall DNA binding at GGAA microsatellites and gene expression in the context of TAD organization.</p>

<title>DBD and DBD+ form loops at GGAA microsatellites, but DBD+ rescues more and shorter loops in A-673 cells</title>
<p>Previously, we observed that EWSR1::FLI1 promotes chromatin loop formation at GGAA microsatellites leading to enhancer activation and upregulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Showpnil et al., 2022</xref>). We next asked whether the DBD-α4 helix participates in functions of EWSR1::FLI1 pertaining to the formation of loops by calling chromatin loops with Mustache algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Roayaei Ardakany et al., 2020</xref>) in matrices of A-673 DBD and DBD+ cells compared to KD cells at 1kb resolution. We detected loops in 3 ranges defined as short-range (&lt;50kb), mid-range (50kb-500kb), and long-range (&gt;500kb) loops based on the linear genomic distance between loop anchors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The only range with a difference between DBD and DBD+ cells was short-range loops. Specifically, we found that DBD+ expressed cells gained 1,913 more short-range loops than DBD expressed cells compared to KD. Both conditions had a similar number of short-range lost loops (5,100 and 5,463 for DBD and DBD+ respectively, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). For an overlap analysis between DBD and DBD+ conditions, we included all lost loops and found 5610 loops that were commonly lost in both conditions (Supplementary Figure 4A). When the same overlap analysis was carried out for DBD and DBD+ gained loops of all ranges, we found only 219 common loops (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This small overlap of gained loops suggested that although they have a similar number of total gained loops, DBD and DBD+ cells contain loops with very different anchors. These sets of observations suggest that formation of distinct set of short-range loops is a potential mechanism by which the DBD-α4 helix restructures chromatin organization in A-673 cells.</p>

<p>Prompted by the above difference in short-range loop formation, we further investigated uniquely gained loops of all ranges in DBD (9,005) and DBD+ (10,774) conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). When individual anchors of loops were overlapped with GGAA microsatellites, we found 92.4% and 92.2% of DBD and DBD+ loop anchors were at GGAA microsatellites. We then assessed overall gene expression at all uniquely gained loop anchors and found DBD+ loop anchors associated with more gene activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) and downregulation compared to DBD specific anchors (Supplementary Figure 4B). Next, we focused our analysis on gained loop anchors with FLAG peak at GGAA microsatellites in DBD and DBD+ cells. We found 102 and 20 FLAG peaks overlapping with DBD and DBD+ loop anchors respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). At this subset, FLAG peaks had a higher intensity in DBD+ compared to DBD expressed cells. The GGAA microsatellites overlapping with DBD and DBD+ FLAG peaks at gained loop anchors were further characterized in length and density (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-F</xref>). We found that DBD+ FLAG peaks were bound at GGAA microsatellites that are long and dense in comparison to DBD bound microsatellites. Taken together, these data indicate that the DBD-α4 helix facilitates formation of short-range loops by promoting binding at long and dense GGAA microsatellites, thus leading to more gene regulation.</p>

<title>DBD+ rescues de-novo enhancer formation at GGAA microsatellites in A-673 cells</title>
<p>Multiple studies have shown that binding of EWSR1::FLI1 at GGAA microsatellites results in genomewide de-novo enhancer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Riggi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tomazou et al., 2015</xref>; <bold><italic>Sheffield et al., 2017</italic></bold>). Ewing-specific enhancer establishment at GGAA microsatellites are functionally linked to the oncogenic transformation (<bold><italic>Johnson et al., 2017a</italic></bold>). We therefore sought to understand whether the DBD-α4 helix of EWSR1::FLI1 has any role in modulating the Ewing-specific enhancer landscape. To assay the enhancer landscape, we collected H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag data from A-673 KD, DBD and DBD+ cells. Principal component analysis of H3K27ac localization shows that the DBD replicates were clustered closer to the KD replicates while being in between the KD and the DBD+ replicates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that the DBD-α4 helix is required to reshape the enhancer landscape. Next, we did overlap analysis of H3K27ac peaks of DBD and DBD+ cells. There were 7,854 H3K27ac peaks unique to DBD cells, 35,583 peaks common between DBD and DBD+ cells, and 26,317 peaks unique to DBD+ cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), highlighting the vastly different enhancer landscapes of DBD and DBD+ conditions. Next, we sought to understand the extent of GGAA microsatellite driven H3K27 acetylation by conducting overlap analysis of H3K27ac peaks and GGAA microsatellites that were previously characterized (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <bold><italic>Johnson et al.</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2017a</italic></bold>)). Interestingly, for each group of H3K27ac peaks we considered (i.e. DBD, common, and DBD+), we found around 40% of the H3K27ac peaks overlapped with GGAA microsatellites. Overall, a significant portion of H3K27ac peaks correlated with GGAA microsatellites in both DBD and DBD+ conditions underscoring the importance of GGAA repeats in formation of novel enhancers by fusions involving the transcriptional activation domain of EWSR1 with the FLI1 DNA binding domain. However, these results suggest that the DBD-α4 helix is required for modulating the enhancer landscape in Ewing cells to specifically promote oncogenic transformation.</p>

<p>Transcription factors have been shown to establish super-enhancers at key genes that drive cellular identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore sought to understand whether the DBD-α4 helix participates in formation of super-enhancers. We utilized ROSE algorithm to define enhancers and super-enhancers in DBD and DBD+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lovén et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). We found 9,480 and 10,370 typical enhancers in DBD and DBD+, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We also identified 707 and 454 super-enhancers in DBD and DBD+, respectively. Although the super-enhancers associated with DBD+ were fewer in numbers compared to DBD, these super-enhancers were larger in size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) and contained more H3K27ac peaks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We also assessed the expression level of genes associated with super-enhancers and found DBD+ super-enhancer genes had more gene activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and deactivation (Supplementary Figure 5A). These data suggest the DBD-α4 helix is required in formation of enhancers and super-enhancers, therefore important in regulation of genes from those highly clustered regions of the genome.</p>

<title>The DBD-<bold>α</bold>4 helix promotes binding at longer and denser GGAA microsatellites in A-673 cells</title>
<p>The results of TAD, loop and enhancer analysis hinted towards a mechanism of the DBD-α4 helix in binding GGAA microsatellites that differed from our prior CUT&amp;RUN analysis which showed no difference in binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boone et al., 2021</xref>). We decided to further investigate binding patterns of DBD and DBD+ FLAG peaks genome-wide from our A-673 CUT&amp;Tag dataset generated for this study. We found 8,118 DBD+ and 10,101 DBD FLAG peaks genome-wide that passed the threshold of FDR &lt; 0.05, FC &gt; 8, counts &gt; 80, IDR &lt; 0.01. When we overlapped the two sets of FLAG peaks, we found 6,102 common, 3,999 DBD unique and 2,016 DBD+ unique FLAG peaks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). When each group of FLAG peaks was overlapped with genomic GGAA microsatellites, we found that 70.68% of DBD+ unique and 73.04% of common peaks bind at GGAA microsatellites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). When we considered DBD unique peaks, we found GGAA microsatellites binding shifted down to 53.04% (Figure 5B, DBD bar). Common FLAG peaks were found to have the highest peak intensity, followed by DBD+ peaks then DBD peaks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate a role of the DBD-α4 helix in binding at a subset of GGAA microsatellites.</p>

<p>We therefore further characterized the GGAA microsatellites bound by these 3 sets of peaks: DBD unique, common and DBD+ unique peaks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-H</xref>). We assessed the length of microsatellites and found uniquely DBD bound GGAA microsatellites to be shorter (mean=36.61bp) than uniquely DBD+ bound GGAA microsatellites (43.25bp) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). GGAA microsatellites bound by both DBD and DBD+ were the longest (50.94bp) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). When we quantified the total number of GGAA repeats, we found that the mean number of GGAA motifs in uniquely DBD bound GGAA microsatellites was 4.66 compared to 7.78 in uniquely DBD+ bound GGAA microsatellites and 8.70 in GGAA microsatellites commonly bound in both conditions that were significantly different from each other (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Next, we quantified the maximum consecutive GGAA repeats within a microsatellite and found that the DBD unique peaks contained GGAA repeats no longer than 2 repeats (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>) whereas common and DBD+ unique peaks were localized at approximately 5 consecutive GGAA repeats (mean = 5.21 and 5.32 for common and DBD+, respectively, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Next we plotted GGAA motif density and observed that DBD unique microsatellites are on average (mean=0.54) less dense compared to common (0.65) and DBD+ (0.69) bound GGAA microsatellites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Inverse of GGAA density is the max gap or number of non-GGAA bp in the microsatellites. We then assessed the gap size in each of the groups and found DBD+ binds microsatellites that contain the least amount of gaps (mean=8.3) followed by common (9.1) then DBD unique peak microsatellites (10.1) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). These analyses demonstrate that the DBD-α4 helix is required for effective binding at GGAA microsatellites that are medium in length and denser in its GGAA motifs.</p>

<title>The DBD-<bold>α</bold>4 helix is necessary for productive transcription hub formation at GGAA microsatellites in A-673 cells</title>
<p>Transcription is a process that is regulated across large genomic distances, time, and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cramer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee and Young, 2013</xref>). One of the emerging concepts that unifies observations of such a regulation is the concept of transcriptional hubs. Transcriptional hubs are actively transcribed regions containing clusters of transcription factors and RNA Pol II, and they are highly characterized by enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lim and Levine, 2021</xref>). EWSR1::FLI1 has been shown to form such hubs via the intrinsically disordered region of EWSR1 at GGAA microsatellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chong et al., 2018</xref>). Since the DBD-α4 helix is required in effective binding at GGAA microsatellites and the downstream regulation of 3D chromatin, we sought to understand if the DBD-α4 helix participates in the function of EWSR1::FLI1 in the formation of transcriptional hubs.</p>
<p>To characterize EWSR1::FLI1-driven transcription hubs, we turned to a region containing the <italic>FCGRT</italic> gene in A-673 cells since EWSR1::FLI1 at this locus is shown to form a hub at GGAA repeats (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <bold><italic>Gangwal et al.</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2008a</italic></bold>); <bold><italic>Chong et al.</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2018</italic></bold>)). The <italic>FCGRT</italic> gene resides in a 250kb TAD (top panel) in both DBD and DBD+ cells. Considering that TADs are highly self-interacting regions and that interactions across different TADs are limited by insulator elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nora et al., 2012</xref>), we used TADs as proxy for hubs as we did not expect hubs to extend beyond TAD boundaries. Within the hub, we observed instances where DBD and DBD+ clusters appear in similar locations. In DBD cells, however, we noticed increases in the intensity of all peaks except the <italic>FCGRT</italic> promoter GGAA microsatellite peak (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, magenta tracks). When we zoomed in on this microsatellite, DBD and DBD+ peaks had a similar binding pattern (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, magenta and green tracks). Despite this similarity, DBD binding did not facilitate the formation of chromatin loops at the <italic>FCGRT</italic> promoter as efficiently as DBD+ (inverted red arcs). Furthermore, this lack of loop formation correlated with decreased enhancer marks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, green tracks and bar) and decreased expression of the <italic>FCGRT</italic> gene (black tracks, padj &lt; 0.05, FC &gt; 2). Even though binding at the <italic>FCGRT</italic> microsatellite is comparable between DBD and DBD+, DBD is less able to modulate transcription and chromatin at this microsatellite with high GGAA motif density (0.79, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>We also studied the DBD peaks that had higher intensity compared to DBD+ peaks. The majority of these peaks were at microsatellites of varying density (0.35-0.75) and two peaks at the promoters of <italic>PRR12</italic> and <italic>RRAS</italic> were not at GGAA repeats (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). These peaks were still near GGAA microsatellites with densities of 0.53 and 0.28 for <italic>PRR12</italic> and <italic>RRAS</italic> peaks respectively. Upon analysis of the RNA-sequencing data, we found that the expression of genes associated with this subset of peaks were not significantly differentially expressed in both DBD and DBD+ cells compared to KD (Supplementary Table 1). The only gene with significantly changed expression was <italic>FCGRT</italic> and only in DBD+ cells compared to KD. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the DBD-α4 helix is required in regulating expression of the <italic>FCGRT</italic> gene.</p>
<p>Another locus we investigated in A-673 cells is <italic>CCND1</italic>, where hub formation at GGAA repeats is also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Riggi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chong et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>CCND1</italic> locus is located at the border of a 700kb TAD in both DBD and DBD+ cells (Supplementary Figure 6). However, in DBD+ cells, formation of two smaller TADs nested within the larger TAD is detected with an increased number of loops (Supplementary Figure 6B). DBD and DBD+ peaks cluster in similar locations across the hub. However, DBD+ binding at <italic>MYEOV</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> promoters were the only ones that effectively modulated chromatin at these microsatellites to promote gene expression (black tracks, padj &lt; 0.05, FC &gt;2). The <italic>CCND1</italic> promoter microsatellite has a density of 1 meaning that it only consists of GGAA repeats without any gaps, whereas <italic>MYEOV</italic> microsatellites densities were 0.44 and 0.28. We also found similar results at two more loci with EWSR1::FLI1-bound GGAA microsatellites: <italic>NKX2-2</italic> and <italic>GSTM4</italic> (Supplementary Figure 7 &amp; 8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Showpnil et al., 2022</xref>). These findings further demonstrate the preference of DBD-α4 helix for binding at dense GGAA repeats and the increased binding intensity seen for DBD without the DBD-α4 helix at shorter and less dense GGAA microsatellites. Taken together, these data provide examples of transcriptional hubs spanning a large genomic distance containing numerous genes and show how transcriptional output at these hubs can be regulated by EWSR1::FLI1 binding at GGAA microsatellites.</p>

<title>The DBD-<bold>α</bold>4 helix is required for transcription and chromatin regulation in TTC-466 cells</title>
<p>In order to understand if these observations from A-673 cells are applicable in other models of Ewing sarcoma, we used our conventional KD/rescue system in TTC-466 cells, which express the EWSR1::ERG fusion. We depleted endogenous EWSR1::ERG with shRNA and rescued with DBD and DBD+ constructs and tested expression of rescue constructs, transcriptional changes and transformation in agar before performing Micro-C analysis (Supplementary Figure 9A-C). Importantly, the winged helix-turn-helix domain of wildtype FLI1 is highly homologous to ERG. From the first α1 helix through the flanking α4 helix of the ETS DBD, ERG varies from FLI1 in only two residues of α1 (alanines in FLI1 that are serines in ERG, <bold><italic>Poon and Kim</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2017</italic></bold>)). Our DBD and DBD+ constructs are thus &gt;97% homologous with analogous constructs for ERG. These experiments largely recapitulated our results in A-673 cells (Supplementary Figure 1). Notably, PCA analysis of RNA-seq data showed that, as for A-673 cells, wtEF clustered away from the KD condition, with DBD+ clustering with wtEF and DBD clustering between KD and wtEF. (Supplementary Figure 9B and Supplementary Figure 1C). Taken together, these data suggest that the DBD-α4 helix is also required in transcription and transformation processes of Ewing sarcoma in TTC-466 cells.</p>
<p>Next, we sought to understand the 3D chromatin organization of TTC-466 cells expressing DBD and DBD+ proteins. First, we performed MDS analysis of the top 1000 interactions of Micro-C matrices at 500kb resolution (Supplementary Figure 10A). KD replicates clustered furthest away from DBD+ replicates. Additionally, DBD replicates fell between the KD and DBD+ replicates. We also assessed the contact frequency across the genome in combined replicates of KD, DBD and DBD+ cells at 5kb resolution (Supplementary Figure 10B). At short distance (up to around 10<sup>5</sup> bp), cells expressing DBD have more contacts in comparison to KD and DBD+ cells, while DBD+ expressing cells make more frequent contacts than KD and DBD cells at longer distances (Supplementary Figure 10B). We further conducted differential interaction analysis using 500kb matrices to compare cells expressing DBD and DBD+ replicates to KD cells using the same cutoff values as above for A-673 cells. (Supplementary Figure 10C-D). First, we detected 42,891 and 2,598 interactions in DBD+ and DBD cells, respectively, using cutoffs of p-value &lt; 0.2 and log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 0.5. We then used more stringent criteria (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 1.5) to identify DIRs. We found that DBD+ cells have 1,742 DIRs compared to KD cells (Supplementary Figure 10C) whereas DBD cells have 72 DIRs (Supplementary Figure 10D). Taken together, these results suggest that the DBD-α4 helix of FLI1 is required for restructuring 3D chromatin organization in TTC-466 cells.</p>
<p>We then repeated the TAD and loop level analysis in DBD and DBD+ expressing TTC-466 cells with respect to the KD condition. Surprisingly, we found more TADs and loops in DBD expressing cells (16,350 TADs; 1,646 loops) compared to DBD+ cells (7,099 TADs; 297 loops) with comparable patterns of overlap between DBD and DBD+ in both TAD and loop analysis (Supplementary Figures 11-12). Notably, despite a finding significantly more loops in the DBD condition, overlap analysis showed that the loops gained in DBD and DBD+ expression conditions are largely different while the loops lost in both conditions are similar (Supplementary Figure 12B-C). This pattern was also detected in A-673 cells (Supplementary 4A) suggesting that common mechanisms drive altered chromatin looping in both cell lines.</p>
<p>We next used CUT&amp;Tag for H3K27ac and FLAG to assess the enhancer landscape and construct binding in DBD and DBD+ expressing TTC-466 cells (Supplementary Figure 13). Similar to A-673 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) and reflecting the transcriptional changes seen in RNA-seq (Supplementary Figure 9B), we found the H3K27ac signal for DBD samples clustered between DBD+ and KD conditions in TTC-466 cells (Supplementary Figure 13A). In contrast to A-673 cells, we found many more FLAG peaks in DBD+ expressing TTC-466 cells (61,665) compared to DBD expressing cells (21,000) with most DBD-bound loci commonly also bound by DBD+ (Supplementary Figure 13B). We further found that 55.29% of common peaks overlapped GGAA microsatellites, while 48.13% and 42.99% unique DBD and DBD+ peaks overlapping GGAA microsatellites, respectively (Supplementary Figure 13C). We then characterized the GGAA microsatellites uniquely bound by either DBD, DBD+, or both (Supplementary Figure 13D-13H). We found the common FLAG peaks were overlapped with the longest set of GGAA repeats (mean=37.79bp) compared to unique DBD peaks (mean=30.28bp) and DBD+ unique peaks (mean=22.74bp), and this led to common peaks having the longest and densest GGAA microsatellites in TTC-466 cells (Supplementary Figure 13D-H).</p>
<p>We then sampled <italic>FCGRT</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>NKX2-2</italic>, and <italic>GSTM4</italic> in TTC-466 cells (Supplementary Figures 14-17, <bold><italic>Gangwal et al.</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2008b</italic></bold>); <bold><italic>Luo et al.</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2009</italic></bold>); <bold><italic>Showpnil et al.</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2022</italic></bold>); <bold><italic>Riggi et al.</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2014</italic></bold>); <bold><italic>Chong et al.</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2018</italic></bold>)). At these loci in TTC-466 cells, we found only few loops in <italic>CCND1</italic> and <italic>GSTM4</italic> regions (Supplementary Figures 14-17) and no TADs were detected, reflecting differences in our TAD and loop analysis between cell lines as outlined above and discussed below. However, the overall pattern of DBD and DBD+ binding was similar to that seen in A-673 cells, with DBD showing greater peak intensity at non-GGAA microsatellites and equal or lesser intensity at EWSR1::FLI1-bound GGAA microsatellites. Additionally, DBD+ expressing cells had greater H3K27ac peak intensity at these loci, also similar to that seen in A-673 cells and consistent with the rescue of transcriptional activity observed for DBD+ in both A-673 and TTC-466 cell lines. Thus, the genome-wide analyses and the Ewing-specific loci multi-omic analysis using RNA-seq, Micro-C, H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag, and FLAG CUT&amp;Tag indicate that the DBD-α4 helix is required for fusion-driven oncogenic gene regulation in Ewing sarcoma.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found generally concordant results between cell lines, further supporting the critical role for the DBD-α4 helix in EWSR1::FLI1-mediated changes to transcription, the enhancer landscape, and 3D chromatin structure. There were a few differences between cell lines and this has many possible explanations, none of which are mutually exclusive. One possibility is the high level of heterogeneity found in genome regulation between Ewing sarcoma cell lines. Though there are several critical genes found to be regulated by EWSR1::FLI1 in many samples, very few genes are regulated the same way across all tested cell lines. As an example, high expression of <italic>NKX2-2</italic> can be used as a diagnostic marker in Ewing sarcoma and is upregulated by EWSR1::FLI1 binding at a distal GGAA microsatellite in many cell lines, including A-673 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Riggi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Showpnil et al., 2022</xref>). However, the chromatin architecture in TC71 cells has a unique TAD boundary insulating the <italic>NKX2-2</italic> gene from the EWSR1::FLI1-bound GGAA microsatellite and <italic>NKX2-2</italic> is instead highly expressed through other regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Showpnil et al., 2022</xref>). To address the cell line to cell line variability, we plotted RNA-seq of the replicates from both cell lines on a same PCA plot (Supplementary Figure 18A) and found that cell line specific gene expression comprised the majority of the variability, with each line clustering together along the first principal component. Notably, within each cell line similar clusters were found placing DBD+ near wtEF away from the KD condition along the second principal component, with DBD between these two clusters (Supplementary Figure 18A).</p>
<p>Another possible reason for differences, particularly in the TAD and loop analyses, is related to the sequencing depths in both cell lines. We plotted the sequencing depth of each replicate of Micro-C data in both cell lines (Supplementary 18B-C). In A-673 cells, the total reads were similar between biological replicates as well as different conditions: 900,000,000 reads (Supplementary 18B). For TTC-466 cells, there is more variability both between the replicates of the same condition as well as between conditions (Supplementary 18C). Specifically, the DBD+ replicates had total read of 450,000,000 (Supplementary Figure 18C, middle bars). This relatively low coverage of DBD+ replicates could contribute to lower numbers of TADs and loops detected in DBD+ TTC-466 cells compared to DBD TTC-466 cells. Lastly, another notable difference was found in the microsatellite binding preferences of different constructs in different cell lines. We found many more DBD+ FLAG peaks in TTC-466 cells. This may have captured many more binding events at smaller and less dense microsatellites. As it is difficult to analytically normalize for the possibility of cell-line specific factors that influence CUT&amp;Tag, a more reductionist biochemical approach may be needed to fully resolve differences in affinities for GGAA microsatellites of varying characteristics between DBD and DBD+. Nonetheless, at specific loci regulated by EWSR1::FLI1 binding at GGAA repeats we found similar patterns of FLAG binding in A-673 and TTC-466. Specifically, DBD+ showed relatively higher peak intensity at long and dense GGAA microsatellites as compared to DBD. The opposite was true at the other shorter or non-GGAA microsatellite bound sites, with DBD showing a relatively higher peak intensity.</p>
<p>Detailed differential analysis of genomic binding patterns of DBD and DBD+ was not previously performed. In our previous study, we used CUT&amp;RUN to identify DBD and DBD+ peaks and found 90% overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boone et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, CUT&amp;Tag showed that this overlap is only 60%. This provided us with an opportunity to discern meaningful difference in genomic localization and sequence characteristics of bound loci across three groups: DBD unique, common, and DBD+ unique peaks. Importantly, the methods utilize different enzymes for the digestion step: Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) for CUT&amp;RUN and Tn5 transposase for CUT&amp;Tag. Thus, a few possible factors might explain the differences in peak detection between the two techniques. MNase enzyme has cleavage preferences at sites rich in adenylate, deoxyadenylate, and thymidylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cuatrecasas et al., 1967</xref>). It also shown to have a preference for open chromatin or nucleosome-free regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Henikoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Weiner et al., 2010</xref>). Because the specific effects of EWSR1::FLI1 binding on GGAA repeats in chromatin is unknown, these loci may be particularly susceptible to excess cleavage by MNase in a way that biases CUT&amp;RUN results. In contrast, the Tn5 transposase is especially efficient at integrating adapters into open chromatin without chromatin degradation and may, therefore, be particularly efficient at capturing binding at GGAA repeat regions. Additionally, CUT&amp;RUN generally has lower signals, higher background, and lower yields compared to CUT&amp;Tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kaya-Okur et al., 2019</xref>). We thus attribute the difference in detection of FLAG peaks in our previous and current studies to the different enzymes and their ability to recognize and access repetitive elements such as GGAA repeats.</p>
<p>With the current results, we favor a model whereby the DBD-α4 helix stabilizes collective binding at high density GGAA microsatellites. Our findings underscore the specific characteristics of GGAA repeats bound by EWSR1::FLI1 to drive pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma. At Ewing-specific gene loci such as <italic>FCGRT</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> and Supplementary Figure 5), we found dense microsatellites. This finding was also recapitulated at the genome-wide level as seen in the preference of DBD+ unique peaks for denser microsatellites compared to common peaks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). The DBD+ unique peaks also show a preference of binding at microsatellites that are longer than the DBD unique peaks and shorter than the common peaks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) aligning with our previous findings that an optimal number of GGAA repeats is required for binding by EWSR1::FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma transformation (<bold><italic>Johnson et al., 2017b</italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Although our data demonstrates that the DBD-α4 helix is required in collective binding at GGAA repeats, we are still unable to decipher the exact mechanism of stabilization at such repeats with our current set of data. There are a few possible mechanisms. The DBD-α4 helix could be directly interacting with the DNA or the DNA binding domain of the adjacently bound EWSR1::FLI1 molecule. Another possibility is the DBD-α4 helix affects its function through interactions with other epigenetic regulators or transcription machinery proteins. Alternatively, intramolecular interaction with the EWSR1 domain may stabilize DNA binding and could further promote phase condensates. We favor the last mechanism since de-novo ability of EWSR1::FLI1 binding GGAA repeats depends on the presence of the EWSR1 domain (<bold><italic>Johnson et al., 2017a</italic></bold>). Further directed studies are needed to address these possible mechanisms.</p>
<p>The multi-omics approach utilized in this study provided us with an opportunity to characterize transcription hubs driven by EWSR1::FLI1 genome-wide. We have shown the clustering of EWSR1::FLI1 at GGAA microsatellites underlies the formation of local 3D features such as TADs and chromatin loops. If we use TADs as proxies for hubs, we detected thousands more of these hubs in DBD+ cells compared to DBD cells, highlighting the importance of DBD-α4 helix in binding at dense GGAA repeats and formation of hubs across the genome. We also observed thousands of loops at unique microsatellites for both DBD and DBD+ cells adding detail to the architecture of hubs, often represented as flower-shaped structures of many loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). We also probed another aspect of hubs with our H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag data: the presence of enhancers and super-enhancers. We showed that the DBD-α4 helix promotes more active marks genome-wide compared to DBD leading to formation of enhancers and super-enhancer. Finally, we presented select loci as specific examples of productive transcription hubs driven by EWSR1::FLI1 binding at dense GGAA microsatellites. Our study thus suggests a surprising role for FLI1 DBD in the process of hub formation which is usually attributed to the EWSR1 low complexity domain.</p>
<p>Because EWSR1::FLI1 is the sole driver mutation in Ewing sarcoma tumors, it is an attractive therapeutic target. However, many approaches to target EWSR1::FLI1 have been hampered by common issues that arise with targeting transcription factors, such as its location in the nucleus, its abundance in cells, and its lack of an enzymatic pocket to design a small molecule tailored to target it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Knott et al., 2019</xref>). We propose the DBD-α4 helix is a promising therapeutic target as it doesn’t directly bind the major groove of the DNA. Additionally, because the DBD-α4 is a helix, it provides a structured region to design small molecules to disrupt its interaction unlike the EWSR1 low complexity domain. Moreover, its importance in maintaining effective binding at GGAA microsatellites offers an opportunity to target EWSR1::FLI1 at the most mechanistically important sites in pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism by which the DBD-α4 helix promotes effective binding at GGAA microsatellites and regulates transcription hub formation.</p>

Batch effect was removed using removeBatchEffect from limma package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) before plotting the top 1000 interactions. For distance-decay plot (Figre 1C), individual replicates were combined. First, the combined matrices were normalized using hicNormalize function from HiCExplorer to scale the libraries to the smallest library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wolff et al., 2020</xref>). Scaled libraries were then plotted for diagnostic plots to determine the thresholds to use in hicCorrectMatrix function for ICE normalization. ICE-corrected 5kb matrices were then plotted with hicPlotDistVsCounts. For differentially interacting region analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-F</xref>), multiHiCcompare package was used (<bold><italic>Stansfield et al., 2019</italic></bold>). Briefly, individual replicates of KD, DBD and DBD+ were loess normalized and pairwise comparison of DBD+ to KD and DBD to KD was done using QLF (quasi-likelihood) method with batch effect correction. Volcano plots of differentially interacting regions with padj &lt; 0.05 and fold-change &gt; 1.5 plotted for each comparison (DBD+ and DBD vs KD).</p>
<p>For TAD analysis, individual replicates were combined and then scaled using the smallest library size with hicNormalize from HiCExplorer (v.3.7.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wolff et al., 2020</xref>). Then matrices at 10kb, 25kb, 50kb and 100kb resolutions were ICE-corrected with the thresholds determined from diagnostic plots. First, using hicFindTADs function, we called TADs at the previously mentioned 4 resolutions for DBD and DBD+ matrices. Then, hicDifferentialTAD used to compute differential TADs by comparing the precomputed DBD and DBD+ TAD regions with the same regions of KD matrix. Differential TADs from each resolution were combined using hicMergeDomains with default –value of 5000 to account for duplicated TADs. For CUT&amp;Tag peak annotation, peaks (FDR &lt; 0.05, log2 Fold-Change &gt; 8, mean normalized counts of signal &gt; 80, and IDR &lt; 0.01) were overlapped with findOverlaps functions from GenomicRanges package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>For loop calling, combined replicates at 1kb resolution matrices that were scaled and normalized in same manner for TAD analysis were used with Mustache (v.1.2.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Roayaei Ardakany et al., 2020</xref>). Mustache uses scale-space theory in computer vision to detect chromatin loops. For differential loops compared to KD matrix, diff_mustache.py was used to detect loops that were gained in DBD and DBD+ compared to KD and loops that were lost in DBD and DBD+ compared to KD matrix.</p>

<p>This paper investigates how the EWS::FLI1 fusion protein organizes chromatin topology and regulates gene expression in an aggressive pediatric bone cancer known as Ewing sarcoma. The authors used the most recent genomics methodologies to provide <bold>solid</bold>-based evidence for the role of a short alpha helix in the DNA binding domain of FLI1 in modulating binding to GGAA microsatellites and promoting enhancer activity. The study provides <bold>valuable</bold> insight into the underlying oncogenic mechanisms in Ewing sarcoma, despite the inherent limitations of the some of the techniques used.</p>

<p>Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer driven by the EWS-FLI oncogene. Ewing sarcoma cells are addicted to this chimeric transcription factor, which represents a strong therapeutic vulnerability. Unfortunately, targeting EWS-FLI has proven to be very difficult and better understanding how this chimeric transcription factor works is critical to achieving this goal. Towards this perspective, the group had previously identified a DBD-𝛼4 helix (DBD) in FLI that appears to be necessary to mediate EWS-FLI transcriptomic activity. Here, the authors used multi-omic approaches, including CUT&amp;tag, RNAseq, and MicroC to investigate the impact of this DBD domain. Importantly, these experiments were performed in the A673 Ewing sarcoma model where endogenous EWS-FLI was silenced, and EWS-FLI-DBD proficient or deficient isoforms were re-expressed (isogenic context). The authors found that the DBD domain is key to mediate EWS-FLI cis activity (at msat) and to generate the formation of specific TADs. Furthermore, cells expressing DBD deficient EWS-FLI display very poor colony forming capacity, highlighting that targeting this domain may lead to therapeutic perspectives.</p>
<p>This new version of the study comprises as requested new data from an additional cell line. The new data has strengthened the manuscript. Nevertheless, some of the arguments of the authors pertaining to the limitations of immunoblots to assess stability of the DBD constructs or the poor reproducibility of the Micro C data remain problematic. While the effort to repeat MicroC in a different cell line is appreciated, the data are as heterogeneous as those in A673 and no real conclusion can be drawn. The authors should tone down their conclusions. If DBD has a strong effect on chromatin organization, it should be reproducible and detectable. The transcriptomic and cut and tag data are more consistent and provide robust evidence for their findings at these levels.</p>
<p>Concerning the issue of stability of the DBD and DBD+ constructs, a simple protein half-life assay (e.g. cycloheximide chase assay) could rule out any bias here and satisfactorily address the issue.</p>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>The Reviewing Editor and a referee have considered the revised version and the responses of the referees. While the additional data included in the new version has consolidated many conclusions of the study, the MicroC data in the new cell line are also heterogeneous and as the authors argue, this may be an inherent limitation of the technique. In this situation, the best would be for the authors to avoid drawing robust conclusions from this data and to acknowledge its current limitations.</p>
<p>The referee and Reviewing Editor also felt that the arguments of the authors concerning a lack of firm conclusions on the stability of EWS-FLI1 under +/-DBD conditions could be better addressed. We would urge the authors to perform a cycloheximide chase type assay to assess protein half-life. These types of experiments are relatively simple to perform and should address this issue in a satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer driven by the EWS-FLI oncogene. Ewing sarcoma cells are addicted to this chimeric transcription factor, which represents a strong therapeutic vulnerability. Unfortunately, targeting EWS-FLI has proven to be very difficult, and a better understanding of how this chimeric transcription factor works is critical to achieving this goal. Towards this perspective, the group had previously identified a DBD-𝛼𝛼4 helix (DBD) in FLI that appears to be necessary to mediate EWS-FLI transcriptomic activity. Here, the authors used multi-omic approaches, including CUT&amp;tag, RNAseq, and MicroC to investigate the impact of this DBD domain. Importantly, these experiments were performed in the A673 Ewing sarcoma model where endogenous EWS-FLI was silenced, and EWS-FLI-DBD proficient or deficient isoforms were re-expressed (isogenic context). They found that the DBD domain is key to mediating EWS-FLI cis activity (at msat) and to generating the formation of specific TADs. Furthermore, cells expressing DBD-deficient EWS-FLI display very poor colony-forming capacity, highlighting that targeting this domain may lead to therapeutic perspectives.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 1 for their strong summary of Ewing sarcoma background and accurate description of our experimental approaches and findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The group has strong expertise in Ewing sarcoma genetics and epigenetics and also in using and analyzing this model (Theisen et al., 2019; Boone et al., 2021; Showpnil et al., 2022).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>They aim at better understanding how EWS-FLI mediated its oncogenic activity, which is critical to eventually identifying novel therapies against this aggressive cancer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are happy to see that our overall aim was also appreciated by Reviewer 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>They use the most recent state-of-the-art omics methods to investigate transcriptome, epigenetics, and genome conformation methods. In particular, Micro-C enables achieving up to 1kb resolved 3D chromatin structures, making it possible to investigate a large number of TADs and sub-TADs structures where EWS-FLI1 mediates its oncogenic activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 1 for their acknowledgement of our approaches and the resolution achieved with our Micro-C experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>They performed all their experiments in an Ewing sarcoma genetic background (A673 cells) which circumvents bias from previously reported approaches when working in non-orthologous cell models using similar approaches.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer about the importance of using model systems that accurately capture features of the disease being studied. As we have added an additional cell line in the revision we should note that this second model also represents a Ewing sarcoma genetic background while representing tumors expressing another oncogenic fusion found in this disease.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness comes from the poor reproducibility of Micro-C data . Indeed, it appears that the distances/clustering observed between replicates are typically similar or even larger than between biological conditions. For instance, in Figure 1B, I do not see any clustering when considering DBD1, DBD2, DBD+1, DBD+2.</p>
<p>Lanes 80-83: &quot;KD replicates clustered together with DBD replicate 1 on both axes and with DBD replicate 2 on the y-axis. DBD+ replicates, on the other hand, clustered away from both KD and DBD replicates. These observations suggest that the global chromatin structure of DBD replicates is more similar to KD than DBD+ replicates.&quot;</p>
<p>When replacing DBD replicate 1 with DBD replicate 2, their statement would not be true anymore.</p>
<p>Additional replicates to clarify this aspect seem absolutely necessary since those data are paving the way for the entire manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These are valid concerns and we thank the reviewers for highlighting this limitation of poor clustering of Micro-C replicates on MDS plot. We account for this variability between different replicates when identifying differentially interacting regions. By using an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, we aim to ensure that repeating the experiments we will discover the same differentially interacting regions with a false discovery rate of 5%.</p>
<p>We also would like to note that the replicates cluster much closely on PCA plot of RNA-seq data (Supplementary Figure 1C) and as well as on PCA plot of H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag data (Figure 4A). Notably, the RNA-seq result has now reproduced when performed with different sets of hands across multiple studies (Boone, et. al., 2021 and this report), as well as in a second cell line (as reported in this manuscript revision). These observations suggest that the cells of these replicates are functionally similar to each other at a population level. Chromatin organization detected by Micro-C is a highly heterogenous within cells of a population (Misteli, et. al., 2020). Moreover, despite increased resolution with Micro-C over Hi-C, the conventional sequencing depth that Micro-C is performed at makes resolving finer scale 3D interactions, particularly between enhancers and promoters, challenging (Goel, et. al., 2023). Thus biologically relevant interactions driving EWSR1::ETS transcriptional regulation through de novo enhancers may have relatively weak signal in Micro-C. Both the strength of the signal and the heterogeneous chromatin state present in bulk samples could affect the average signal leading to poor clustering replicates (Hafner and Boettiger, 2022).</p>
<p>Importantly, rather than add an additional replicate of a single cell line, we repeated our study in an additional cell line, TTC466, and largely reproduced our high-level findings for transcription, enhancer formation, and 3D chromatin. Specific limitations of the TTC466 study are addressed in the Discussion section (392-420). The reproduction of weak/moderate clustering in the MDS plot in both A673 and TTC466 cell lines suggests the α4 helix of EWSR1::ETS fusions are important for reshaping 3D chromatin. However, higher resolution analyses focused on specific EWSR1::ETS-bound loci are likely an important area of future study required to fully understand the role of the α4 helix in chromatin regulation in Ewing sarcoma.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly:</p>
<p>- In Figure 1C, how would the result look when comparing DBD2/KD2/DBD+2? Same when comparing DBD 1 with KD1 and DBD+1. Would the difference go in the same direction?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a great point. We added distance decay plots of individual replicates in Supplementary Figure 2 and added discussion of these results in lines 88-89 of the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Figure 1D-E. How would these plots look like when comparing each replicate to each other's? How much difference would be observed when comparing, for instance, DBD1/DBD2 ? or DBD1/DBD+1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, separate replicates are required to conduct Differentially Interacting Region analysis as it determines statistically significant interactions. Therefore, we are unable to plot these analyses with individual replicates.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Figure 2: again, how would these analyses look like when performing the analysis with only DBD1/DBD+1/KD1 or DBD2/DBD+2/KD?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good suggestion. It is possible to do such analysis. However, we will lose resolution as such that we may not accurately detect TADs, especially smaller TADs. Therefore, we decided to combine the biological replicates.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another major question is the stability of EWS-FLI DBD vs EWS-FLI DBD+ proteins. In the WB, FLAG intensities seem also higher (2/3 replicates) in DBD+ condition compared to the DBD condition (Figure S1B).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a valid concern with shRNA knock-down/rescue system and we regularly validate new constructs to ensure that they have similar expression levels as rescue with the wildtype fusion before proceeding to more exhaustive experimental workups. We would note that while we have not tested for differences in protein stability, for these constructs we largely see similar expression levels across multiple experiments, multiple cell lines, and multiple sets of hands. There may be some variations in expression level from experiment to experiment, but western blotting is a semiquantitative assay and it is also not possible to rule out that slight differences in band intensity may be a result of error in gel loading. For this reason, alongside western blotting for construct expression, we also validate construct function using RNA-seq and colony formation assays (as reported in this manuscript) and these show good agreement across biological replicates.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Indeed, it seems that they have more FLAG (i.e., EWS-FLI) peaks in the DBD+ condition compared to the DBD condition (Figure 2B).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comment since the legend of Figure 2B led to a misunderstanding. Figure 2B depicts the number of TADs detected in DBD and DBD+ conditions (height of the bar graphs) and the proportion of those TADs overlapped with FLAG, CTCF, both or neither peaks on y-axis. The number of FLAG peaks is actually lower in DBD+ as compared to DBD as shown in Figure 5A-B.  We clarified our Figure 2 legend to accurately describe the various proportions (color coded section) of TADs bound by DBD/DBD+ FLAG and CTCF.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Would it be possible that DBD+ is just more expressed or more stable than DBD? The higher stability of the re-expressed DBD+ could also partially explain their results independently of the 3D conformational change. In other words, can they exclude that DBD+ and DBD binding are not related to their respective protein stability or their global re-expression levels?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is possible that DBD+ protein is overexpressed or more stable than DBD. With our current set of data, we cannot conclusively exclude if binding by DBD and DBD+ are not related to their expression level or stability. We would note, as above, that western blots, RNA-seq, and agar assays have largely reproduced across experiments, hands, and cell lines and that western blot is an imperfect assay for assessing protein stability.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Surprisingly, WB FLI bands in DBD+ conditions are systematically (3/3 replicates) fainter than in DBD conditions (Figure S1B). How do the authors explain these opposite results between FLI and FALG in the WB?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent observation that highlights one of the intricacies of studying EWSR1::FLI1 in our KD/rescue system. Often the limiting factor for an experiment is whether or not the KD condition maintains KD through a second viral transduction for rescue and selection. We have observed over many years of working with this system that rescue conditions which are fully functional (i.e. wildtype EWSR1::FLI1, DBD+, etc.) tend to maintain better KD of endogenous EWSR1::FLI1. Constructs that don’t rescue EWSR1::FLI1 function sometimes maintain KD to a lesser degree, though frequently to a functional degree (i.e. cells are not transformed and EWSR1::FLI1 transcriptional regulation is not rescued). We suspect this observation, also raised by Reviewer 1 is resulted from a potential selection of cells with more endogenous EWSR1::FLI1 escaping KD in in DBD conditions due to selective pressures during expansion in tissue culture.</p>
<p>We should note that the antibody used for detecting FLI recognizes residues that are deleted in</p>
<p>DBD and DBD+ constructs, such that the FLI1 blot in Supplementary Figure 1B does not detect either construct. It only detects endogenous EWSR1::FLI1 and the 3X-FLAG-EWSR1::FLI1 construct in the middle lane that runs at a slightly higher molecular weight. The FLAG antibody is the only antibody that detects all three rescue constructs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Bayanjargal et al. entitled &quot;The DBD-alpha4 helix of EWS::FLI is required for GGAA microsatellite binding that underlies genome regulation in Ewing sarcoma&quot; reports on the critical role of a small alpha helix in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the FLI1 portion of EWS::FLI1 that is critical for binding to repetitive stretches of GGAA-motifs, i.e. GGAA microsatellites, which serve as potent neoenhancers in Ewing sarcoma.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 2 for their succinct and accurate summary of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper is generally well-written, and easy to follow and the data presented are of high quality, welldescribed and underpin the conclusions of the authors. The report sheds new light on how EWS::FLI1 mechanistically binds to and activates GGAA microsatellite enhancers, which is of importance to the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s assessment of our work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While there are no major weaknesses in this paper, there are a few minor issues that the authors may wish to address before publication:</p>
<p>(1) While the official protein symbol for the gene EWSR1 is indeed EWS, the protein symbol for the gene FLI1 is identical, i.e. FLI1. The authors nominate the fusion oncoprotein EWS::FLI1 (even in the title) but it appears more adequate to use EWS::FLI1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. Indeed, the most recent guideline for fusion proteins nomenclature is to use the full gene symbols separated by double colons. Therefore, the accurate nomenclature is EWSR1::FLI1. We replaced instances of EWS::FLI with EWSR1::FLI1 and have used the EWSR1::ERG nomenclature in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The used cell lines should be spelled according to their official nomenclature (e.g. A-673 instead of A673).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Corrected, thanks!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It appears as if the vast majority of results were generated in a single Ewing sarcoma cell line (A-673) which is an atypical Ewing sarcoma cell line harboring an activating BRAF mutation and may be genomically quite unstable as compared to other Ewing sarcoma cell lines (Kasan et al. 2023 preprint at bioRxiv <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.20.567802v1__;!!NiUAmZJ8c1GNWg!WRwwmxSFLSZ14AEuz9Ts4yabgWTzic6wtBat2ukTMMGfQemYLpUtgYItiKPYzfE5bkanLEO9nOCuG284kgmLIWYxmQxcfgZvBfbBEg$">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.20.567802v1)</ext-link>. Hence, it may be supportive for the paper to recapitulate/cross-validate a few key results in other Ewing sarcoma cell lines, e.g. by using EWS::ERG-positive cell lines. Perhaps the authors could make use of available published data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 2 for this helpful comment. We replicated the experiments in TTC-466 cells containing EWSR1::ERG fusion and found that as for A-673 cells the DBD-α4 helix is important for transcriptional, enhancer, and 3D chromatin regulation (Supplementary Figures 9-18).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 5 are very interesting but focus on two selected target genes of the fusion (FCGRT and CCND1). It would be interesting to see whether these findings also extend to common EWS::ETS transcriptional signatures that have been reported. The authors could explore their data and map established consensus EWS::ETS signatures to investigate which other hubs might be affected at relevant target genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We expanded our analysis to other genes demonstrated to be regulated by EWSR1::FLI1 nucleated transcriptional hubs (Chong, et. al., 2018) and included NKX2-2 and GSTM4 gene regions in</p>
<p>Supplementary Figure 7-8 in A-673 cells. We also investigated the same gene regions of FCGRT, CCND1, NKX2-2, GSTM4 in TTC466 cells and report them in Supplementary Figures 14-17. For the purpose brevity, we decided to include the above examples. We may need to develop different tools to conduct further analysis to understand the gene regulatory networks driven by DBD and DBD+ in relation to hub formation. Although it is a great suggestion to map such network, this may be outside the scope of this manuscript. We thank the reviewer for bringing such a good point to our attention.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Table 1 is a bit hard to read. In my opinion, it is not necessary to display P-values with up to 8 decimal positions. The gene symbols should be displayed in italic font.</p>

<p>Suggestions are adapted, thanks!</p>

<p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>We would draw the authors' attention to the following issues that would best benefit from additional revision.</p>
<p>As indicated by Referee 1, an important issue concerns the apparent poor reproducibility of Micro-C data. In Figure 1B, the clustering of the DBD1, DBD2, DBD+1, and DBD+2 is poor.</p>
<p>It appears that the distances/clustering observed between replicates are typically similar or even larger than between biological conditions. Lines 80-83: &quot;KD replicates clustered together with DBD replicate 1 on both axes and with DBD replicate 2 on the y-axis. DBD+ replicates, on the other hand, clustered away from both KD and DBD replicates. If one replaced DBD replicate 1 with DBD replicate 2, this statement would no longer be true. The referees believe that it is important to fully account for these potential discrepancies. Most of the study is based on analyses of these data sets, so if there are issues with them it has repercussions on the entire study. We note however that in Figure 4A the clustering of the H3K27ac data is much more convincing. The referees also feel that it is important to show immunoblots of the expression of DBD and DBD+ levels in the experiments performed here. While this was previously shown in the Boone et al publication in 2021, it could be illustrated again here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the editors for concisely summarizing the main weaknesses of the paper and underscoring the importance of the Micro-C data in the rest of the paper. While the Editors note tighter clustering of the H3K27ac (Figure 4A), we would like to note that the replicates cluster much closely on PCA plot of RNA-seq data (Supplementary Figure 1C). Notably, the RNA-seq result has now reproduced when performed with different sets of hands across multiple studies (Boone, et. al., 2021 and this report), as well as in a second cell line (as reported in this manuscript revision). Though not as tight, the H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag also reproduces in TTC466 cells. Thus, we interpret these findings to indicate that our replicates are functionally similar to each other. As discussed above in the response to Reviewer 1 in more detail, there are several factors that could affect how these functional similarities are represented in Micro-C data. Micro-C is ultimately a readout of the chromatin organization in a heterogeneous population of cells (Misteli et al., 2020). Additionally, sequencing depth limitations in conventional Micro-C experiments limit the ability to faithfully assess the enhancer-promoter interactions that may be relevant for our model system (Goel, et. al., 2023). Thus, both the strength of the biologically relevant signal and the heterogeneous chromatin state present in bulk samples could affect the average signal and lead to poorly clustering replicates (Hafner and Boettiger, 2022).</p>
<p>To address these important concerns about rigor and reproducibility of the analyses, we repeated our study in an additional cell line, TTC466, and largely reproduced our high-level findings for transcription, enhancer formation, and 3D chromatin. These additional studies were not without their own limitations and these are addressed in the Discussion section (392-420). The reproduction of weak/moderate clustering in the MDS plot in both A673 and TTC466 cell lines suggests the α4 helix of EWSR1::ETS fusions are important for reshaping 3D chromatin. However, additional genomic analyses geared toward higher resolution at specific EWSR1::ETS-bound loci are likely an important area of future study required to fully understand the role of the α4 helix in chromatin regulation in Ewing sarcoma. Live cell imaging, as performed by Chong, et. al., 2018 and additional biochemical techniques may also be informative and are beyond the scope of this report.</p>
<p>With regards to concerns about construct expression, we have included immunoblots of the rescue constructs in both cell lines (Supplementary Figure 1B and 9A) and discussed Reviewer 1’s specific concerns in detail above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The referees also raise the issue of using an additional cell line to make a more general message. Although it would perhaps be asking too much to repeat the MicroC experiments, consolidation of the observations could be performed by focusing on specific loci such as FCGRT and CCND1 that were analyzed in this study. Could the authors use 4C-type experiments to reproduce the conclusions in an additional cell line? It would also be pertinent to consolidate the findings at these loci by 4C-type approaches even in the cell line used here. For the moment, all conclusions are based on the same set of data and a single technical approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We repeated the experiments in TTC466 cells and analyzed the data using same cut-offs used in A-673 cells. This allows us to compare between the two cell lines. We hope this new set of experiments and analyses address the reviewers’ concerns.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>All the data are performed in A673 cells. Knowing the transcriptomic and epigenetic heterogeneity of Ewing sarcoma cells, some of the experiments supporting their findings should be replicated in at least another Ewing sarcoma model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Per our discussion above, we have replicated our experiments in an additional cell line model of Ewing sarcoma. Importantly, the TTC466 cell line used expresses the EWSR1::ERG fusion found in 10-15% of Ewing sarcoma cases.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Supplementary Figure 2B. Proportion of TAD boundaries bound by FLAG (i.e., EWS-FLI1) and CTCF. The number/proportion of FLAG (i.e., EWS-FLI) peaks observed at CTCF peak/TAD boundaries seems unexpectedly high. How do they explain this result since EWS-FLI peaks are rather intra-TAD to mediate their enhancer function?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our previous study, we showed that EWSR1::FLI1 binding can be detected at boundaries of TADs (Showpnil, et. al., 2022). We think therefore it is likely that EWSR1::FLI1 binding is able to mediate enhancer function both inside TADs as well as at the borders of TADs and may, in some cases, function as an insulator between TADs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the &gt;50kb loop analysis, what was the low-range threshold? Up to 15-20 kp, contact frequency interactions may be caused by PFA crosslink (did they use a 5kb threshold ?). Were those excluded from that analysis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that we did not use a lower threshold to exclude those short-range loop interactions. In our previous study, we observed that EWSR1::FLI1 binding reduces long-range interactions in favor of short-range interactions (Showpnil, et. al., 2022) and wanted to be able to capture short-range loops in our analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 2D, they observed that within TADs containing FLAG peaks at GGAA microsatellites, the intensity of the DBD+ FLAG peaks was higher compared to DBD FLAG peaks. How would this analysis look when considering the ETS FLAG peaks (i.e., EWS-FLI rather repressive peaks)? Could they compare TAD with GGAA msat vs TAD with ETS peaks?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this is an interesting observation. In our prior analyses we found no discernible relationship between EWSR1::FLI1 binding and changes in 3D chromatin associated with repression (Showpnil, et. al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2022). In contrast, EWSR1::FLI1-bound superenhancers had greater H3K27ac deposition when overlapping both a bound GGAA repeat and a non-microsatellite site. While there have been several additional reports about the relevance of EWSR1::FLI1 binding at nonmicrosatellite peaks, motifs at these loci have not yet been rigorously defined as GGAA repeats were by Johnson, et. al. in PLoS One, 2017. Each ETS factor binds different motifs containing the core 5’-GGAA-3’ with varying affinities depending on the flanking residues. There may be &gt;100-fold difference in sequence-specific binding affinity for “high” vs. “low” affinity motifs. Better defining the types of ETS motifs bound by EWSR1::FLI1 and the functional changes associated with them thus represents an interesting area of future study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 1F: What is the biological meaning of these results (29.7, 39.5, and 54Mbp)? These distances are typically the size of a chromosome arm and clearly beyond classical chromatin loop/TAD structures in which EWS-FLI mediates its cis-activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with referee here. This panel is now removed in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How do DBD, KD, and DBD+ conditions compare with WT parental cells in the omics data? (Figures 1B, 4A). Do DBD+ conditions overlap with WT conditions? It would be nice to have these analyses also for Micro-C and Cut&amp;Tag data. To be acknowledged here, the transcriptome data showing this aspect in Figure S1C are very convincing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a fair point. We were not able to obtain similar sequencing depth of wtEF Micro-C libraries to that of KD, DBD and DBD+ due to disproportional use of wtEF libraries in troubleshooting. Therefore, we decided to exclude wtEF condition from these analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>EWS-FLI cis-regulation at CCND1 also occurs through a much closer EWS-FLI peak (~-20kb msat upstream of CCND1 TSS) which was not taken into consideration. EWS-FLI peak intensity in both DBD and DBD+ at this msta seems similar. How would this fit into their model?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The referee is correct. The closest peak upstream of CCND1 TSS is about ~19kb away. We highlighted this peak with the dashed boxes near the CCND1 TSS (Supplementary Figure 6). Peak intensity of DBD+ FLAG is slightly higher compared to DBD. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the difference is small. We suspect that the DBD-α4 helix is affecting binding dynamics at GGAA repeats, but these genomics approaches are not well suited to detect small, but significant, changes in binding affinity or dynamics. In this case a more biochemical approach may be needed. Even though, both protein can still bind the same microsatellites, it is possible that they might differ in their stability of binding or in the recruitment of additional proteins. These possibilities are discussed in the Discussion section (444-463).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the Micro-C, they sequenced only 7 to 8 million reads per condition. This coverage seems particularly low, especially for their analyses using 1-5kb bins. How does this compare with other published Micro-C data? Can this explain the variability observed between replicates?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the inconsistent verbiage of sequencing coverage that may have caused confusion. 7 to 8 million reads were used for shallow sequencing and QC analysis. Once a sample passed QC, we then sequenced 300 million reads per sample. 300M is now changed to 300 million to prevent a misunderstanding at line 598.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>They mention:</p>
<p>&quot;In our recent studies of EWS::FLI, we found a small alpha helix in the DNA binding domain DBD-𝛼𝛼4, to</p>
<p>be required for transcription and regulation by the fusion protein (Boone et al., 2021). Interestingly, this study did not find any change in chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) and genome localization of EWS::FLI constructs (CUT&amp;RUN) when DBD-𝛼𝛼4 helix was deleted leaving the mechanistic basis for the requirement of DBD-𝛼𝛼4 in transcription regulation unclear. &quot;</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>&quot;To assay the enhancer landscape, we collected H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag data from KD, DBD, and DBD+ cells. Principal component analysis of H3K27ac localization shows that the DBD replicates were clustered closer to the KD replicates while being in between the KD and the DBD+ replicates (Figure 4A), suggesting that DBD-𝛼𝛼4 helix is required to reshape the enhancer landscape.&quot;</p>
<p>But now H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag show strong differences which were not observed in ATAC seq. How to explain this discrepancy?</p>

<p>Though both H3K27ac and ATAC signal are associated with enhancers and promoters in euchromatin, they are not exactly measurements of the same thing. H3K4me2 is a mark more closely associated with ATAC signal than H3K27ac (Henikoff, et. al., 2020). Nonetheless, there are clear differences between the prior publication (Boone, et. al., 2021) and this work with regards to similar ATAC signal for each replicate and differences in H3K27ac. We suspect this may be related to a tighter association between H3K27ac and EWSR1::FLI1-mediated genome regulation and ATAC. Notably, there were very few differentially accessible regions between EWSR1::FLI1-depleted cells and conditions with EWSR1::FLI1 expression (either endogenous or wildtype rescue) using the A673 KD/Rescue system in Boone, et. al., 2021. In contrast, other A673 KD-rescue studies have reported differences in H3K27ac in EWSR1::FLI1 expressing conditions relative to EWSR1::FLI1-depleted conditions (Theisen, et. al., 2021). .</p>

<p>The authors mention:</p>
<p>&quot;Our study thus uncovered a surprising role for FLI DBD in the process of hub formation which is usually attributed to the EWS low complexity domain.&quot;</p>
<p>Not sure this can be claimed, hubs are composed of many other factors that are not investigated here. Furthermore, promoter enhancer hubs/loops often include combined ETS and mSat chains to generate transcriptional hubs which have not been considered here. None of these points were discussed here.</p>

<p>What are the barcode patterns in Supp 5, are those frequently observed in their Micro-C data, likely mapping artifacts, do they have any impact on their analyses?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The barcode patterns in now Supplementary Figure 6 are blind spots in the hg19 genome assembly. Since they are few in numbers, we don’t expect these blind spots to impact our analysis.</p>
