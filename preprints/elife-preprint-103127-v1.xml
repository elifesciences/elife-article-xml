<title>Abstract</title><p>Protein N-α-acetylation is widespread in eukaryotes, yet its neuronal role remains unclear. Mutations in human N-α-acetyltransferase 10 (NAA10) lead to developmental defects affecting brain function, such as intellectual disability and autism. We found that hippocampal CA1-specific <italic>Naa10</italic>-knockout mice exhibit anxiety and reduced hippocampal dendritic complexity. Mechanistically, Naa10 promotes neurite outgrowth by acetylating BTB/POZ domain-containing protein 3 (Btbd3), crucial for the interaction of Btbd3 with filamentous actin (F-actin)-capping protein subunit beta (CapZb). Disrupting the Btbd3/CapZb interaction, either through <italic>Naa10</italic> knockout or by expressing an N-α-acetylation-defective Btbd3 mutant, diminishes CapZb binding to F-actin and reduces neurite outgrowth. Moreover, cytochalasin D, a compound like CapZb in capping the barbed end of F-actin, rescues the <italic>Naa10</italic> knockout-induced neurite reduction in hippocampal primary neurons. These findings unveil the role of Naa10 in enhancing hippocampal neurite outgrowth through the Btbd3-CapZb-F-actin axis, shedding light on potential mechanisms underlying X-linked Ogden syndrome resulting from human <italic>NAA10</italic> mutations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein N-α-acetylation is catalyzed by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs), which, in most cases, co-translationally transfer the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the N-terminal α-amino group of most eukaryotic proteins. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Despite its prevalence, its function is largely unknown. Among the NAT family members, Naa10, encoded by the X-linked gene <italic>Naa10</italic>, forms a ribosome-associated NatA complex with the auxiliary subunit Naa15 and the huntingtin-interacting protein HYPK. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Naa10 substrates include proteins starting with N-terminal small amino acids such as Ser, Ala, Val, Gly, Cys, and Thr. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Both catalytic-dependent and -independent roles of Naa10 have been reported. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> For example, we have previously reported that NAA10 promotes tumor suppressor gene methylation and genomic imprinting in a DNA binding-dependent, but acetylase activity-independent, manner. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> We have also demonstrated that the acetylase activity of Naa10 controls fat metabolism by promoting obesity <italic>via</italic> inhibiting beige adipogenesis and thermogenesis. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Human NAA10 and the major mouse Naa10 variant (Variant 1) are highly conserved, sharing over 96% identity in amino acid sequences; both consist of 235 amino acids in length. This suggests that Naa10 in the two species has similar physiological functions.</p>
<p>Mutations in human NAA10 cause NAA10-related neurodevelopmental syndrome. The NAA10 mutation S37P was first reported to cause familial X-linked Ogden syndrome. Male infants with the syndrome exhibit mental retardation, premature aging, cerebral atrophy, immature corpus callosum, enlarged ventricles, neurogenic scoliosis, etc, and do not survive beyond one and a half years old. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Subsequent studies revealed that other mutations in NAA10 are also associated with intellectual disability, autistic features and brain anatomy defects. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Among these patients, most NAA10 mutations disrupt the enzymatic activity of NAA10. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> However, the relevant substrates remain elusive. Thus, how NAA10 mutations cause the Ogden syndrome remains largely unknown, and it is also unclear whether NAA10 regulates the function of the hippocampus, which controls learning, memory, and emotion. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The high conservation between human and mouse Naa10 prompted us to understand the role of human NAA10 in hippocampal neuron functions using <italic>Naa10</italic>-KO mouse models. By characterizing hippocampal CA1-specific <italic>Naa10</italic>-KO models, we report that <italic>Naa10</italic> KO causes anxiety and reduces neurite complexity in the hippocampus. Furthermore, by using primary neurons derived from mouse brain tissue and hippocampal HT-22 neurons, we reveal that Btbd3 is a direct substrate of Naa10. At least one mechanism by which Naa10 enhances hippocampal neurite outgrowth and function involves the Naa10-Btbd3-CapZb-F-actin axis.</p>

<title>Hippocampal CA1-specific <italic>Naa10</italic> KO causes anxiety and reduces dendritic complexity in the hippocampus</title>
<p>To understand the function of Naa10 in neurons, we first investigated its expression in the mouse brain. A previous report indicated that mouse <italic>Naa10</italic> mRNA is highly expressed in the brain from the embryonic to adult stage, particularly in areas of cell division and migration such as the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, before neuronal differentiation. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Consistently, our analysis of the Allen Brain ATLAS showed that, in the adult mouse brain, <italic>Naa10</italic> and its associated partners <italic>Naa15</italic> and <italic>Hypk</italic> in the NatA complex are relatively enriched in the hippocampus (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a specific Naa10 Ab confirmed the enrichment of Naa10 protein in the cornu ammonis (CA) and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampi of two adult mice (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1B and S1C</xref>). Importantly, in another mouse, almost all Naa10 signals co-localized with NeuN, a nuclear antigen of mature neurons, but not with the neural stem cell marker Nestin (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>), indicating that Naa10 is primarily expressed in mature neurons within the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Since Naa10 is highly enriched in hippocampal neurons, and mutations in <italic>NAA10</italic> in humans cause brain disorders with autism-like syndromes, we investigated whether Naa10 depletion in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, a region involved in emotion control, causes a similar phenotype as observed in human patients. To address this, we generated conditional <italic>Naa10</italic>-KO mice (cKO) by crossing <italic>Naa10</italic><sup>flox</sup> mice with mice expressing Cre under the control of the <italic>calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit alpha (Camk2a)</italic> promoter (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref>). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Immunostaining revealed that Naa10 almost completely disappeared in CA1 but was only partially depleted from DG in a <italic>Naa10</italic>-cKO mouse (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1F</xref>). Although hippocampal CA1-specific <italic>Naa10</italic> cKO did not globally alter brain structure (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1G-H</xref>), it induced anxiety-like behavior. This was evidenced by the decreased time the mice spent on the open arms and reduced entries of the mice into the open arms in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Naa10</italic> cKO did not exhibit significant difference in spatial memory, depression, and exploration tests such as Y maze (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1I</xref>), tail suspension (TST) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1J</xref>), and open field (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1K</xref>), respectively. These results suggest that complete depletion of Naa10 in the hippocampal CA1 likely contributes to anxiety behavior.</p>

</fig>
<p>Given that Naa10 is enriched in neurons, and a reduction in dendritic complexity has been correlated with anxiety in different mouse models, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> we suspected that the anxiety induced upon <italic>Naa10</italic> cKO was likely due to a defect in hippocampal neuron function. Indeed, <italic>Naa10</italic> cKO suppressed dendrite formation, as evidenced by the decrease in microtubule-associated protein 2 (Map2) staining, a neuronal dendritic marker, in the CA1 region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The reduction in Map2 intensity was accompanied by an increase in the staining of glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting astrocyte hypertrophy, which often occurs in neuronal defects. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Additionally, silver staining of the hippocampus showed that Naa10 depletion in the CA1 reduced the branching of dendrites of the pyramidal neurons, compared to the neurons in the control mouse (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, high-resolution images from high-speed light-sheet fluorescent microscopy confirmed that hippocampus-specific <italic>Naa10</italic> KO in a different mouse reduced dendritic complexity in the CA1 region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Hence, these findings demonstrate that the specific knockout of Naa10 in the hippocampal CA1 region leads to anxiety, concomitant with a reduction in dendritic complexity in the hippocampus.</p>

<title>Naa10 promotes neurite outgrowth by N-acetylating Btbd3</title>
<p>To understand the underlying mechanism by which Naa10 promotes dendritic complexity, we analyzed the effect of Naa10 on neurite formation in mouse hippocampal HT-22 neurons, a commonly used cell model for neuronal studies. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> HT-22 cells can be differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> into neurons with extended neurites and the expression of the neuronal marker genes Map2 and NeuN (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2A and S2B</xref>). Naa10-KO HT-22 neurons were generated using the CRISPR-Cas9n system. Subsequently, we re-expressed mouse Naa10<sup>WT</sup>-V5, N-acetylase-dead Naa10<sup>R82A</sup>-V5, DNA-binding-dead Naa10<sup>K165A</sup>-V5, human NAA10<sup>WT</sup>-V5, as well as clinical mutants NAA10<sup>S37P</sup>-V5 and NAA10<sup>R83C</sup>-V5 in Naa10-KO HT-22 cells by a lentiviral strategy (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). We then examined the neurite length. In agreement with the <italic>in vivo</italic> data above, Naa10 KO in HT-22 also reduced neurite length upon differentiation into neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2C</xref>, lanes 1 and 2), and this defect could only be rescued by adding back the WT but not the N-acetylase-dead R82A mutant of Naa10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2C</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that the acetyltransferase activity of Naa10 is crucial for neurite outgrowth during neuronal differentiation. Importantly, the clinical NAA10 mutants with amino acid substitutions found in patients, such as S37P and R83C, that severely impair the enzymatic activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> failed to recover the neurite outgrowth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, adding back the DNA-binding-dead K165A mutant of NAA10 that still maintains 95% of acetyltransferase activity (data not shown) regained the neurite length (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). These results not only indicate that the N-acetylase activity of Naa10 is required for neurite formation but also link NAA10-mediated protein N-terminal acetylation to human disease.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> WT but not acetyltransferase-dead Naa10 enhances neurite outgrowth. HT-22 cells, either wild-type (WT) or Naa10 knockout (Naa10-KO), were subjected to lentiviral infection with constructs expressing WT or mutant Naa10. Following differentiation into neurons, western blotting (upper left) confirmed protein expression. Representative images of Map2 staining (right) and neurite length quantification (lower left) were performed. Neurite length was measured using Olympus cellSens software from nine randomly selected fields across three independent experiments, totaling a cell count of ≥ 400. Data points represent individual measurements, and mean ± SD values are displayed. Statistical significance was determined by two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s post-hoc test (P-values indicated).</p>
<p><bold>(B)</bold> Clinically relevant NAA10 mutants fail to rescue neurite outgrowth. Similarly, HT-22 cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing either WT or the specified mutant NAA10 constructs, followed by neuronal differentiation. Western blotting (upper left) confirmed protein expression, while representative images of F-actin staining (right) were obtained using phalloidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488. Neurite length was quantified (lower left) using the same method described in <bold>(A)</bold>. Data presentation and statistical analysis were performed as described for <bold>(A)</bold>.</p>
<p><bold>(C)</bold> Naa10 acetylates Btbd3 N-terminus <italic>in vitro</italic>. Btbd3 N-terminal peptides were incubated with acetyl-CoA with or without recombinant Naa10. Acetylated Btbd3 was quantified by mass spectrometry after the acetyltransferase assay. Data points represent individual measurements, and mean ± SD values are shown. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired two-tailed t test (p-values indicated in the figure).</p>
<p><bold>(D)</bold> Btbd3 N-acetylation promotes neurite outgrowth. Btbd3-KO HT-22 cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing GFP, WT, or V1P mutant Btbd3 and differentiated into neurons. Map2 immunostaining (top), western blot analysis (lower left), and neurite length quantification based on Map2 staining (lower right) were performed. Data points represent individual measurements, and mean ± SD values are shown (N=3).

<p>Given that the enzymatic activity of Naa10 promotes neurite outgrowth, we attempted to identify the substrate that mediates Naa10 function in this regard. To this, we performed an unbiased subtiligase-mediated protein N-terminal biotinylation assay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> in which only N-terminal free peptides can be ligated with a biotin-labeled peptide and pulled down by streptavidin beads for mass spectrometry analysis. By searching for the biotin-labeled proteins in Naa10-KO, but not WT HT-22 cells, we identified 29 candidates of Naa10 substrates (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Among the candidates, BTB/POZ domain-containing protein 3 (Btbd3) was considered a promising Naa10 substrate involved in neurite outgrowth for the following four reasons. First, the Btbd3 protein begins with the first amino acid valine, which is a known preferential substrate for Naa10. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Second, Btbd3 is enriched in the hippocampal DG and CA regions (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>, analyzed from Allen Brain Atlas). Third, Btbd3 is a risk gene of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Fourth, it has been reported that Btbd3 regulates dendritic orientation in the mouse cortex at the embryonic stage. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>To confirm whether Btbd3 is directly N-acetylated by Naa10, we conducted an <italic>in vitro</italic> acetyltransferase assay. The assay included the N-terminal Btbd3 peptide (1-21 aa) and acetyl-CoA with or without recombinantly purified NAA10. We then performed mass analysis of Btbd3 N-acetylation. The mass spectrometry analysis revealed a notable increase in the ratio of N-acetylated to total Btbd3 peptides. This ratio rose to 34% in the presence of NAA10 (1.5 μg), compared to the control group’s ratio of 0.96% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast to the group without NAA10, which exhibited a peak solely at 2628.33 m/z corresponding to the Btbd3 peptide, the introduction of NAA10 (1.5 μg) induced an additional peak at 2670.34 m/z (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>). This increases in mass by 42.01 Da (acetyl group) in the Btbd3 peptide. Additionally, MS/MS analysis revealed that NAA10 specifically added an acetyl group to the N-terminus of the Btbd3 peptide (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref>). Together, these results unequivocally indicate that NAA10 directly catalyzes the acetylation of the N-terminal peptide of Btbd3.</p>
<p>Next, the impact of Btbd3 N-acetylation on neurite outgrowth was investigated. We initiated this by generating Btbd3-KO HT-22 neurons through the CRISPR-Cas9n system. Following this, we reintroduced GFP, Btbd3<sup>WT</sup> or a mutant version, Btbd3<sup>V1P</sup>, lacking N-α-acetylation due to substituting the first Val with Pro (XPX rule) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> into Naa10-KO HT-22 cells using lentiviral delivery (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref>). Subsequently, we evaluated the length of neurites. Consistently, the absence of Btbd3 significantly impeded neurite outgrowth in HT-22 neurons, and only reintroducing Btbd3<sup>WT</sup>, not Btbd3<sup>V1P</sup>, restored neurite length (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). This observation strongly suggests that N-α-acetylation of Btbd3 promotes neurite outgrowth in HT-22 neurons. Taken together, these results underscore Btbd3 as a substrate of Naa10 crucial for promoting neurite outgrowth.</p>

<title>Naa10-mediated Btbd3 N-<bold>α</bold>-acetylation promotes F-actin capping protein beta (CapZb) binding to F-actin</title>
<p>How does Naa10-mediated Btbd3 N-α-acetylation promote neurite outgrowth? Since the BTB domain is known for homo- or hetero-protein dimerization, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> first, we tried to see if any of Btbd3-interacting proteins might play a role in neurite outgrowth. To this end, we performed Flag immunoprecipitation (IP) using total cell lysates from HT-22 cells with or without Btbd3-Flag expression (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>, left). We identified 58 Btbd3-interacting proteins exclusively present in HT-22 cells expressing Btbd3-Flag (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Interestingly, the GO term analysis of the 58 candidates indicates that proteins relating to cytoskeleton structure and function, particularly actin filament binding, were pulled down with Btbd3-Flag (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>, right), suggesting that Btbd3 might regulate actin dynamics and function.</p>
<p>Next, we aimed to identify which cytoskeleton protein from the list binds to Btbd3 in a Btbd3 N-acetylation-dependent manner. To achieve this, we applied Flag-bead IP in HT-22 cells expressing Btbd3<sup>WT</sup>-Flag or Btbd3<sup>V1P</sup>-Flag, as well as in Naa10-KO HT-22 cells expressing Btbd3<sup>WT</sup>-Flag, followed by mass spectrometry analysis. The results revealed that 13 proteins (with unique significant peptides &gt; 3) were exclusively identified in HT-22 cells expressing Btbd3<sup>WT</sup>-Flag, but not in cells expressing Btbd3<sup>V1P</sup>-Flag or in Naa10-KO HT-22 neurons expressing Btbd3<sup>WT</sup>-Flag (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref> and <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>). This suggests that these 13 proteins bind to Btbd3 depending on Naa10-mediated Btbd3 N-acetylation. These 13 proteins are Arp2 (Actin-related protein 2), Calm1 (Calmodulin-1), CapZb (F-actin-capping protein subunit beta), Col1a1 [Collagen alpha-1(I) chain], Lap2a (Lamina-associated polypeptide 2, isoform alpha), Lap2b (Lamina-associated polypeptide 2, isoform beta), Lrrf1 (Leucine-rich repeat flightless-interacting protein 1), Myo1b (Unconventional myosin-Ib), Myo6 (Unconventional myosin-VI), Rps14 (Small ribosomal subunit protein uS11), Rps18 (Small ribosomal subunit protein uS13), Stk38 (Serine/threonine-protein kinase 38), and Thoc4 (THO complex subunit 4). Among these proteins, CapZb, Myo1b, Myo6, and Arp2 are highly associated with actin filament binding, as determined through Gene Ontology analysis, with CapZb exhibiting the highest mass score. Actin filament dynamics is pivotal in axon elongation, primarily through the intricate formation of filopodia (F-actin bundle) and lamellipodia (F-actin meshwork). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> Therefore, we used CapZb as an example to demonstrate the importance of Naa10-mediated protein N-acetylation in neurite outgrowth.</p>
<p>First, we analyzed the interactions among Btbd3, CapZb and β-actin in HT-22 cells with or without Naa10. Total cell lysates of WT or Naa10-KO HT-22 cells expressing WT or V1P mutant of Btbd3-Flag were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using Flag Ab, followed by western blotting. The results showed that Btbd3 bound to CapZb and β-actin in a Naa10- and Btbd3 N-acetylation-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and one repeat in <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>, lanes 4-6). To further analyze which form of actin that CapZb binds to in cells with or without Naa10, total lysates from WT or Naa10-KO HT-22 cells were separated into the globular actin fraction (G-actin, monomer form of actin) and F-actin fractions, followed by western blotting. We found that Naa10 KO reduced the amount of CapZb in the F-actin fraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and two repeats in <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref>, lanes 3-4). Naa10 KO-mediated reduction of CapZb association with F-actin could only be rescued by adding back WT but not the acetylase-dead Naa10 R82A mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and two repeats in <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4E</xref>, lanes 4-6). Finally, Btbd3 KO-reduced binding of CapZb to F-actin could only be recovered by WT but not the N-α-acetylation-defective Btbd3 V1P mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and two repeats in <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4F</xref>, lanes 5-8). Together, these results indicate that Naa10-mediated Btbd3 N-α-acetylation promotes the binding of CapZb to F-actin in HT-22 cells.</p>

<title>The Naa10-Btbd3-CapZb-F-actin axis regulates neurite outgrowth in the primary hippocampal neurons</title>
<p>Finally, we examined whether what we observed in HT-22 neurons could be recapitulated in primary neurons derived from mouse hippocampus.

<p>To double-confirm if Btbd3 N-acetylation controls neurite outgrowth, the hippocampal primary neurons were depleted of Btbd3 by shRNA against Btbd3, followed by re-expression of Btbd3<sup>WT</sup> or Btbd3<sup>V1P</sup> using a lentiviral strategy, accompanied by the utilization of GFP as a marker for infected neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Findings obtained from Sholl analysis indicated a substantial decrease in total neurite intersections within a 200 μm radius from the soma of hippocampal neurons at Day 12 <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV12) following Btbd3 knockdown, compared to the scramble group. In agreement with our observations in HT-22 neurons, co-expression of Btbd3<sup>WT</sup>, but not Btbd3<sup>V1P</sup>, rescued the dendritic complexity defect caused by Btbd3 knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings so far indicate that Naa10 KO abolishes Btbd3 N-acetylation and prevents Btbd3 from recruiting CapZb to cap F-actin, thus likely reducing actin dynamics for neurite outgrowth. To validate whether dysregulation of CapZb contributes to the diminished neurite outgrowth observed upon Naa10 KO, we employed cytochalasin D (CytoD), a compound known to cap the barbed end of actin filaments, similar to CapZb. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> In theory, CytoD should rescue the Naa10 KO-induced reduction in neurite extension. Remarkably, Sholl analysis results demonstrated that the administration of 20 pM CytoD effectively restored dendritic development in conventional Naa10 KO mice-derived hippocampal neurons, while exhibiting no discernible effects on the wild-type neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). These findings collectively underscore the critical role of Naa10 in regulating hippocampal neurite outgrowth, highlighting the pivotal involvement of Btbd3 N-α-acetylation-mediated actin dynamics.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study suggests that a potential mechanism by which Naa10 facilitates hippocampal neurite outgrowth involves the Naa10-Btbd3-CapZb-F-actin axis. Naa10 N-acetylates Btbd3, promoting Btbd3 interaction with CapZb and facilitating the binding of CapZb to F-actin. This may maintain the homeostasis of F-actin dynamics for hippocampal neurite outgrowth and neuronal network formation.</p>

<title>Naa10 and stress-induced anxiety</title>
<p>Our investigations revealed that hippocampal CA1-KO of Naa10 did not exhibit significant difference in the open field test (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1K</xref>) but led to anxiety-like behavior in mice in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This disparity might be attributed to the specific design of the EPM test, tailored to elicit a conflict between an animal’s inclination to explore and its fear of open spaces and elevated areas. This distinction implies that Naa10 might play a role in stress response within the emotional regulation circuitry, particularly in navigating potentially threatening and anxiety-provoking environments.</p>

<title>Btbd3 is a direct Naa10 substrate</title>
<p>Our finding that Btbd3 is a direct Naa10 substrate, mediating the capability of Naa10 to regulate hippocampal neurite formation, is particularly intriguing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). As mentioned, Btbd3 is known to be a risk gene for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, it is unknown how Btbd3 deficiency causes compulsive-like behaviors. This can potentially be explained by our findings that Btbd3, through its N-α-acetylation, regulates neurite complexity by associating with cytoskeleton-related proteins such as CapZb (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Interestingly, Btbd3 has been previously reported to control dendritic orientation in the developing mouse neocortex by acting as a transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus of sensory neurons upon receiving stimuli. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Nevertheless, we did not observe the nuclear translocation property of Btbd3 in our study. The majority of Btbd3 is in the cytoplasm (data not shown). The discrepancy might be explained by the two different experimental systems used or by the possibility that Btbd3 plays different roles in neurons in the embryonic cortex and adult hippocampus. Additionally, it cannot be excluded that substrates other than Btbd3 may mediate Naa10 function in neurons. Indeed, an early report described a role of Naa10 in the neurite arborization of cerebellar Purkinje cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and suggested that α-tubulin is likely acetylated by the Naa10-Naa15 complex post-translationally. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> However, the study lacks <italic>in vivo</italic> animal evidence and does not prove that α-tubulin is a direct substrate for Naa10. Furthermore, whether the Naa10-Naa15 complex exerts post-translational acetylation activity is still controversial. Hence, further examination is needed to determine whether Naa10 regulates neurite formation through acetylating microtubules.</p>

<title>CapZb bridges the effects of Naa10-Btbd3 on actin dynamics</title>
<p>CapZb regulates actin filament dynamics by forming a heterodimer with CapZa.

<p>Given that Ogden syndrome-relevant NAA10 mutations disrupt the capability of Naa10 to maintain neurite outgrowth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) and that cytochalasin D successfully rescues neurite outgrowth defects in conventional Naa10 KO mice-derived hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), our study not only reveals a potential mechanism by which Naa10 sustains hippocampal neuron function but also sheds light on the pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic value of brain disorders associated with loss-of-function mutations of human NAA10.</p>

The brains were then extracted and incubated in a mixture of PFA and epoxy (ERYSIS GE-38) at 4 °C for 48 hr, as described previously. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> Next, the samples were transferred to an epoxy crosslink activation solution at 37 °C for 24 hr to complete the fixation process. The epoxy-processed brains were delipidated using the stochastic electrophoresis method, as described. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> Subsequently, the brains were cleared at 45 °C for 5 days until they became translucent. Delipidated mouse brains were then washed in PBST for 3 days to remove the remaining SDS. Volumetric labeling was performed using a proprietary small molecule delivery approach developed by Nebulum Technologies Co., Ltd., Taiwan. An antibody cocktail was prepared by premixing the primary antibody (MAP2, CST 8707S) and secondary antibody (Alexa Flour 647 AffiniPure Fab fragment, Jackson ImmunoResearch 711-607-003) at room temperature for 30 min. The mouse brains were then incubated in the premixed antibody cocktail and processed inside the proprietary device for 36 hr to ensure complete penetration of antibodies throughout the samples. Next, the brains were washed in PBST at room temperature for 24 hr to remove any unbound antibodies. Immunolabeled brain samples were further incubated with a refractive index matching solution (NebClear, Nebulum Technologies, Taiwan) at room temperature with gentle shaking until they became transparent. Subsequently, the cleared brains were mounted in agarose for imaging. Rapid volumetric imaging was performed using an axially swept light-sheet microscope equipped with three lasers (488 nm, 561 nm, 642 nm). The scanning was fine-tuned for each sample by adjusting the position of the illumination objectives to ensure optimal optical sectioning. Focus compensation was programmed as a function of depth for each laser line to account for slight focal variations throughout the imaging depth. All light-sheet imaging was performed using either of the following objective lenses: 4X objective (0.2 NA, lateral resolution 1.8 μm in XY) and 15X objective (0.6 NA, lateral resolution 0.41 μm in XY). Light sheet images were reconstructed in 3D and visualized with Imaris software.</p>

<title>Plasmids</title>
<p>The plasmids pLKO-AS3w-Gfp-V5 and pLKO-AS3w-mNaa10-V5 express C-terminally V5-tagged Gfp and mouse Naa10, respectively. These plasmids were constructed by inserting the corresponding cDNA into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector using TOPO-TA cloning (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Subsequently, they were cloned into the NheI and EcoRI sites of pLKO-AS3w.puro, obtained from the National RNAi Core Facility at Academia Sinica. The pLKO-AS3w-mNaa10-V5 series, which express mutant mNaa10 containing R82A or K165A, were generated by introducing point mutations into pLKO-AS3w-mNaa10-V5 using the Q5 site-direct mutagenesis kit (NEB). To generate an all-in-one mouse <italic>Naa10</italic> targeting CRISPR/Cas9n construct, a pair of sgRNAs corresponding to mouse <italic>Naa10</italic> exon 2 were PCR-amplified and cloned into the MfeI sites of pST1374-N-NLS-Flag-linker-Cas9-D10A (Addgene plasmid # 51130).

<p>The manuscript examines the role of Naa10 in cKO animals, in immortalized neurons, and in primary neurons. Given that Naa10 mutations in humans produce defects in nervous system function, the authors used various strategies to try to find a relevant neuronal phenotype and its potential molecular mechanism.</p>
<p>This work contains valuable findings that suggest that the depletion of Naa10 from CA1 neurons in mice exacerbates anxiety-like behaviors. Using neuronal-derived cell lines authors establish a link between N-acetylase activity, Btbd3 binding to CapZb, and F-actin, ultimately impinging on neurite extension. The evidence demonstrating this is in most cases incomplete, since some key controls are missing and clearly described or simply because claims are not supported by the data. The manuscript also contains biochemical, co-immunoprecipitation, and proteomic data that will certainly be of value to our knowledge of the effects of protein N--acetylation in neuronal development and function.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors sought to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the role of Naa10 in neurodevelopmental disruptions with a focus on its role in the hippocampus. The authors use an impressive array of techniques to identify a chain of events that occurs in the signaling pathway starting from Naa10 acetylating Btbd3 to regulation of F-actin dynamics that are fundamental to neurite outgrowth. They provide convincing evidence that Naa10 acetylates Btbd3, that Btbd3 facilitates CapZb binding to F-actin in a Naa10 acetylation-dependent manner, and that this CapZb binding to F-actin is key to neurite outgrowth. Besides establishing this signaling pathway, the authors contribute novel lists of Naa10 and Btbd3 interacting partners, which will be useful for future investigations into other mechanisms of action of Naa10 or Btbd3 through alternative cell signaling pathways. The evidence presented for an anxiety-like behavioral phenotype as a result of Naa10 dysfunction is mixed and tenuous, and assays for the primary behaviors known to be altered by Naa10 mutations in humans were not tested. As such, behavioral findings and their translational implications should be interpreted with caution. Finally, while not central to the main cell signaling pathway delineated, the characterization of brain region-specific and cell maturity of Naa10 expression patterns was presented in few to single animals and not quantified, and as such should also be interpreted with caution. On a broader level, these findings have implications for neurodevelopment and potentially, although not tested here, synaptic plasticity in adulthood, which means this novel pathway may be fundamental for brain health.</p>
<p>Summarized list of minor concerns</p>
<p>(1) The early claims of the manuscript are supported by very small sample sizes (often 1-3) and/or lack of quantification, particularly in Figures S1 and 1.</p>
<p>(2) Evidence is insufficient for CA1-specific knockdown of Naa10.</p>
<p>(3) The relationship between the behaviors measured, which centered around mood, and Ogden syndrome, was not clear, and likely other behavioral measures would be more translationally relevant for this study. Furthermore, the evidence for an anxiety-like phenotype was mixed.</p>
<p>(4) Btbd3 is characterized by the authors as an OCD risk gene, but its status as such is not well supported by the most recent, better-powered genome-wide association studies than the one that originally implicated Btbd3. However, there is evidence that Btbd3 expression, including selectively in the hippocampus, is implicated in OCD-relevant behaviors in mice.</p>
<p>(5) The reporting of the statistics lacks sufficient detail for the reader to deduce how experimental replicates were defined.</p>

The manuscript also contains biochemical, co-immunoprecipitation, and proteomic data that will certainly be of value to our knowledge of the effects of protein N--acetylation in neuronal development and function.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, the authors sought to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the role of Naa10 in neurodevelopmental disruptions with a focus on its role in the hippocampus. The authors use an impressive array of techniques to identify a chain of events that occurs in the signaling pathway starting from Naa10 acetylating Btbd3 to regulation of F-actin dynamics that are fundamental to neurite outgrowth. They provide convincing evidence that Naa10 acetylates Btbd3, that Btbd3 facilitates CapZb binding to F-actin in a Naa10 acetylation-dependent manner, and that this CapZb binding to F-actin is key to neurite outgrowth. Besides establishing this signaling pathway, the authors contribute novel lists of Naa10 and Btbd3 interacting partners, which will be useful for future investigations into other mechanisms of action of Naa10 or Btbd3 through alternative cell signaling pathways.</p>

<p>The evidence presented for an anxiety-like behavioral phenotype as a result of Naa10 dysfunction is mixed and tenuous, and assays for the primary behaviors known to be altered by Naa10 mutations in humans were not tested. As such, behavioral findings and their translational implications should be interpreted with caution.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) For the anxiety-like behavioral phenotype, we provided a paragraph titled “Naa10 and stress-induced anxiety” in the Discussion section of the text: “Our investigations revealed that hippocampal CA1-KO of Naa10 did not exhibit significant differences in the open field test (Figure S1K) but led to anxiety-like behavior in mice in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test (Figure 1A). This disparity might be attributed to the specific design of the EPM test, which is tailored to elicit a conflict between an animal's inclination to explore and its fear of open spaces and elevated areas. This distinction implies that Naa10 might play a role in stress responses within the emotional regulation circuitry, particularly in navigating potentially threatening and anxiety-provoking environments.” The open field test offers a less challenging, open environment that primarily promotes exploratory behavior. We agree that additional assays, such as the light-dark box test, would be helpful in clarifying the issue.</p>
<p>(2) We agree that the behavioral findings and their translational implications should be interpreted with caution. The primary neurological behaviors known to be altered by Naa10 mutations in humans include intellectual disability and autism-like syndrome with defective emotional control. These behaviors are influenced by many factors, including defects in the hippocampal CA1. Thus, we tested hippocampal CA1 Naa10-KO mice using the Y-maze, tail suspension test, open field test, and elevated plus maze (EPM). However, only the EPM results were affected, while the other tests showed no significant changes. It should be noted that our study employed a postnatal, CA1-specific Naa10 conditional knockout (cKO) model driven by Camk2a-Cre, which selectively depletes Naa10 from hippocampal CA1 neurons after birth. In contrast, Naa10 mutations in human patients involve global effects and impact multiple brain regions from the embryonic stage, leading to a broader spectrum of phenotypes. The limited disruption in our model likely explains the absence of learning and memory deficits and the incomplete recapitulation of the full range of patient phenotypes. Furthermore, Naa10 knockout may not produce the same effects as Naa10 mutations. Our current study is primarily intended to explore the physiological function of Naa10 in hippocampal function.</p>

<p>Finally, while not central to the main cell signaling pathway delineated, the characterization of brain region-specific and cell maturity of Naa10 expression patterns was presented in few to single animals and not quantified, and as such should also be interpreted with caution.</p>

<p>We agree that we should provide additional Naa10 immunostaining data from more than three WT and hippocampal CA1 Naa10-KO mouse brains, as well as quantify data such as the silver staining and Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy results presented in Figures 1C and 1D, respectively. Nevertheless, the current report presents consistent results across different mice used for various assays. For example, Figures 1B-D, with three different assays, each demonstrate that Naa10-cKO reduces neurite complexity in vivo.</p>

<p>On a broader level, these findings have implications for neurodevelopment and potentially, although not tested here, synaptic plasticity in adulthood, which means this novel pathway may be fundamental for brain health.</p>

<p>The Camk2a-Cre mice used in this study were derived from Dr. Susumu Tonegawa’s laboratory. According to the referenced paper, this strain restricts Cre/loxP recombination to the forebrain, with particularly high efficiency in the hippocampal CA1. Consistently, our data show that Naa10 was almost completely absent in the CA1 but partially depleted in the DG of the Naa10-cKO mice (Figure S1F in the text).

<p>(4) Btbd3 is characterized by the authors as an OCD risk gene, but its status as such is not well supported by the most recent, better-powered genome-wide association studies than the one that originally implicated Btbd3. However, there is evidence that Btbd3 expression, including selectively in the hippocampus, is implicated in OCD-relevant behaviors in mice.</p>
