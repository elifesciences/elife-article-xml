<title>Abstract</title><p>The cell wall of human fungal pathogens plays critical roles as an architectural scaffold and as a target and modulator of the host immune response. Although the cell wall of the pathogenic yeast <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is intensively studied, one of the major fibrillar components in its cell wall, β-1,6-glucan, has been largely neglected. Here, we show that β-1,6-glucan is essential for bilayered cell wall organization, cell wall integrity and filamentous growth. For the first time, we show that β-1,6-glucan production compensates the defect in mannan elongation in the outer layer of the cell wall. In addition, β-1,6-glucan dynamics are also coordinated by host environmental stimuli and stresses with wall remodeling, where the regulation of β-1,6-glucan structure and chain length is a crucial process. As we point out that β-1,6-glucan is exposed at the yeast surface and modulate immune response, β-1,6-glucan must be considered a key factor in host-pathogen interactions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pathogenic fungi are a significant burden to public health, recently estimated to cause 2.5 million annually attributable deaths worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Among these, <italic>Candida</italic> species are responsible for more than 100 million mucosal infections and 1.5 million systemic infections, representing the fourth most frequent cause of bloodstream infection in hospitalized patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is the most common opportunistic species, which in healthy individuals often colonizes mucosal surfaces (oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, as well as genital tract)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, but leads to invasive infection, post trauma or when immune system of the host is compromised. <italic>C. albicans</italic> is classified in the critical priority group of the WHO list of fungal pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Fungal cells are enveloped by a cell wall, which is essential for protection, integrity, and to maintain cell morphology. During commensalism with human hosts, the cell wall enables fungi to survive host defenses, whereas during pathogenic interactions, the cell wall also plays a central role in the polarized growth of invasive hyphae, thereby facilitating host tissue invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The cell wall architecture is dynamic and therefore critical in modulating the host immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, which are driven by host immune receptors (pattern recognition receptors [PRRs])<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Recognition of fungal pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by host PRRs triggers an array of antifungal responses, including phagocytosis, the production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), neutrophil extracellular traps, and the release of cytokines and chemokines that recruit immune cells to the site of infection and activate adaptive immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Being extracellular, thereby first to interact with the host immune system, fungal cell wall components function as the major PAMPs.</p>
<p>The cell wall of <italic>C. albicans</italic> is a complex structure with a fibrillar outer layer of mannoproteins and an inner polysaccharide layer composed of chitin, β-1,3-glucan and β-1,6-glucan, which are not present in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Dectin-1, a C-type lectin receptor that recognizes fungal cell wall β-1,3-glucan, has been demonstrated to play a dominant pro-inflammatory role in antifungal immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Chitin particles derived from the <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall lead to the selective secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Mannans from <italic>C. albicans</italic> are recognized by multiple receptors expressed on different immune cells (Mannose receptor, DC-SIGN, TLR4, Dectin-2, Dectin-3), which are involved in yeast phagocytosis and appear to play a critical role in the induction of Th17 responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. <italic>C. albicans</italic> has developed strategies to sense environmental signals encountered within the host and to regulate the exposure of its cell wall PAMPs. For example, low levels of β-1,3-glucan exposure by <italic>C. albicans</italic> correlate with enhanced colonization of the gastrointestinal tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and β-1,3-glucan is mainly hidden from immune recognition by the outer layer of mannan fibrils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Although these <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall polysaccharide PAMPs have been investigated in the context of host-fungal interaction, the immunomodulatory potentials of β-1,6-glucan, another major constituent of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall, remains under-investigated.</p>
<p>The composition and organization of the fungal cell wall result from an equilibrium between syntheses and remodeling of the constituent polysaccharides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. β-glucan and chitin, which account for about 60% and 2-10% (depending on the morphotype), respectively, are cross-linked to form the skeletal armor of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Mannoproteins, which are predominantly glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-modified and covalently linked to the skeletal polysaccharides via β-1,6-glucan bridges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, account for 30%–40% of the cell wall. β-1,6-glucan is composed of a linear chain of β-1,6-linked glucose residues with few short side-chains of β-1,3-glucoside or laminaribioside residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. According to analytical methods, the β-1,6-glucan content is highly variable, from 15 to 50%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Although β-1,6-glucan plays a crucial structural role in the <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall, the dynamics of this cell wall polysaccharide as a function of growth or stress conditions remains underexplored.</p>
<p>Genes required for the full β-1,6-glucan production have been identified in model yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Among them, <italic>KRE5</italic> codes a putative α-glucosyltransferase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> (GT-24) localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); its deletion results in the absence of β-1,6-glucan in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and about 80% reduction of cell wall β-1,6-glucan content in <italic>C. albicans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Functions of Kre1, Kre6, Kre9 and the related homologs are unclear. Their localization in the ER, Golgi, plasma membrane or extracellular culture medium, suggests an intracellularly initiating biosynthetic pathway of β-1,6-glucan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. <italic>KRE6</italic> and its functional homolog <italic>SKN1</italic> share 66% identity and both encode transmembrane proteins containing a glycosyl-hydrolase domain (GH-16). <italic>KRE6</italic> deletion in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> results in a 70% decrease in the cell wall β-1,6-glucan content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In <italic>C. albicans</italic> the double deletion of <italic>KRE6</italic> and <italic>SKN1</italic> leads to a slow growth, cell wall abnormalities, cell separation failure, and reduced virulence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Two more <italic>KRE6</italic> homologs (<italic>KRE62</italic> and <italic>SKN2</italic>) have been identified in <italic>C. albicans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> but their function has not yet been investigated, and the <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall β-1,6-glucan biosynthetic pathway, namely the β-1,6-glucosyltransferase involved in β-1,6-glucan polymerization and other enzymes involved in β-1,6-glucan remodeling (elongation, branching or cross-linking with β-1,3-glucan) remains to be identified.</p>
<p>We standardized biochemical approaches to quantify as well as to characterize β-1,6-glucan of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, which allowed us to perform comparative analysis and to study the dynamic of this cell wall polysaccharide in response to stress conditions and to antifungal treatments. β-1,6-glucan biosynthesis appears to be a compensatory reaction when mannan elongation is defective, whereas the absence of β-1,6-glucan results in a significantly sick growth phenotype and complete cell wall reorganization. Moreover, β-1,6-glucan showed a distinct immunomodulatory response compared to other cell wall polysaccharides. Together, our study establishes overarching and critical roles for β-1,6-glucans in the organization, structure, biosynthesis and immunomodulatory properties of the cell wall.</p>

<title>β-1,6-glucan – a critical polysaccharide of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall</title>
<p>Despite numerous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, the composition and organization of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall β-1,6-glucan remain unclear. To better understand the composition and organization of the cell wall β-1,6-glucan, we have fractionated cell wall and applied new biochemical strategies to quantify and characterize them. The <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall was separated into three fractions according to polymer properties and reticulations, namely: sodium-dodecyl-sulphate-β-mercaptoethanol (SDS-β-ME) extract, alkali-insoluble (AI) and alkali-soluble (AS) fractions (see methods). In Synthetic Dextrose (SD) medium at 37°C, the SDS-β-ME fraction was the smallest (18% of total cell wall) and mainly composed of mannoproteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The AI fraction was the major one (46%) and was exclusively composed of glucose and glucosamine, the monosaccharide building blocks of β-glucans and chitin, respectively. The AS fraction (36% of total cell wall) was characterized by a high amount of mannose residues (54% of the fraction) resulting from the release of covalently cell wall-anchored mannoproteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), and this fraction also contained glucose residues originating from β-glucans. Overall, we found that the <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall is composed of 3% of chitin, 43% of proteins/mannoproteins (27% of mannans) and 54% of β-glucans, which was in agreement with earlier studies and validated our analytic approach (Fig.1a, 1b)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>To differentiate β-1,3-glucans and β-1,6-glucans, we developed two methods, one for the AI fraction and other for the AS fraction (see methods, and Fig. S8) as β-glucan was found in both fractions. β-1,6-glucan corresponded to 23% of the total cell wall, was mainly found in the AI fraction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, 1b). β-1,6-glucan in the AI fraction could be solubilised by digesting β-1,3-glucan using an endo-β-1,3-glucanase, confirming that it is covalently linked to the cell wall β-1,3-glucan as previously shown in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Further, gel filtration chromatography showed that the solubilised β-1,6-glucan was eluted in a single symmetric peak with Gaussian shape showing a homogeneous polymer with an apparent molecular weight range of 18-112 kDa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), and the average molecular weight was estimated to be 58 kDa. The structure of purified β-1,6-glucan was analysed by <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR (Table S2) and by HPAEC after endo-β-1,6-glucanase digestion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). The NMR chemical shifts and coupling constants as well as the HPAEC profile of the digested products were highly comparable to those we described for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, showing a similar structure: a main chain of β-1,6-glucosyl residues with side chains of β-1,3-glucosyl or β-1,3-laminaribiosyl residues. The relative intensity of the anomeric proton in NMR and HPAEC analysis after endo-β-1,6-glucanase digestion, indicated that an average of 6.4% of glucose units of the main chain is substituted and that 88-90% of the side chains is composed of a single glucose residue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, 1e, Table S2). Altogether, our data showed that β-1,6-glucan is a major cell wall polymer in <italic>C. albicans,</italic> representing 40% of the cell wall β-glucans.</p>

<title>Environmental regulation of β-1,6-glucan synthesis</title>
<p>The composition and surface exposure of fungal cell wall polymers is dependent on environmental growth conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. We applied chemical assays and our biochemical approaches to enable comparative analyses of cell wall robustness in relation to β-1,6-glucan dynamics in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p>
<p>First, we analysed the cell wall composition in relation to cell morphotype and growth phase (exponential vs. stationary phase, yeast vs. hyphae, planktonic vs. biofilm). No significant difference was observed between cell wall β-1,6-glucan and other polymers produced during the exponential (control) and stationary phases in yeast cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In biofilms, only a slight increase of mannan content (26% vs. 20%), but no change in relative β-glucan content was observed. In contrast, the cell wall isolated from <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae was characterized by an increase in chitin content (10% vs. 3%) as previously shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, as well as a reduction of β-1,6-glucan (18% vs. 23%) and mannan contents (13% vs. 20%) compared to the yeast form. The decrease in β-1,6-glucan content was reflected in a reduction of the β-1,6-glucan size (43 vs. 58 kDa), demonstrating that both content and structure of β-1,6-glucan are regulated during growth and cellular morphogenesis. In addition, a higher branching rate of β-1,3-glucan of the hyphal cell wall was also observed in the AI fraction (7.3% vs. 5.3%) (Fig. S3).</p>

<p>We further investigated the effect on cell wall composition of environmental growth conditions, such as temperature, pH, carbon source and hypoxia, on cell wall composition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Hypoxic condition (1% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) resulted in a slow growth but did not lead to a significant alteration of the cell wall composition. In contrast, all other tested conditions led to a modification of cell wall composition including the proportion of β-1,6-glucan. For example, growth at 30°C or in 1M NaCl led to a decrease in the cell wall β-1,6-glucan content and a decrease of β-1,6-glucan chain length. However, these decreases at low temperature were compensated by a higher content of less-branched β-1,3-glucan, whereas high salt led to an increased branching rate of both β-1,6-glucan and β-1,3-glucan (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Fig.S3). Buffered culture medium at pH 4 or 7.5 led to a slight decrease in the β-1,6-glucan molecular size and an increase in its branching frequency in comparison to buffered medium at pH 5.4. However, the most pronounced alteration of the cell wall was observed in lactate containing medium, with a steep reduction of polysaccharides from the structural core, chitin (–43%), β-1,3-glucan (–48%) and mainly β-1,6-glucan (–72%), in agreement with the decrease in thickness of the inner cell wall layer previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Lactate medium also led to a strong reduction in the average β-1,6-glucan molecular size (19 vs. 58 kDa), a decrease of β-1,6-glucan branching (4.9 vs. 6.4%) and an increase of β-1,3-glucan branching (7.4 vs. 5.3%, Fig. S3).</p>
<p>The presence in the medium of short chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate, or butyrate) at physiological gut concentrations resulted in a growth defect but did not alter the global cell wall composition. The main difference was an increase of β-1,6-glucan molecular size (64-68 kDa vs. 58 kDa) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Oxidative stress and drugs targeting the cell wall did not induce any major alterations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Cell wall chitin content was reduced in the presence of nikkomycin and increased in the presence of the cell wall damaging agents Congo Red or caspofungin, as previously observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, but with no impact on β-1,3-glucan and β-1,6-glucan contents. The major stress effect we observed was in presence of caspofungin, which caused an increase of the average molecular size of β-1,6-glucan (70 vs. 58 kDa).</p>
<p>These data demonstrate that the content, size, and branching of β-1,6-glucan in the <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall is regulated by numerous environmental growth and stress conditions.</p>

<title>β-1,6-glucan dynamics responds to alterations in inner cell wall synthesis</title>
<p>We investigated the dynamics of β-1,6-glucan in <italic>C. albicans</italic> mutants in which the genes involved in the biosynthesis or remodelling of chitin and β-1,3-glucan were deleted. Four chitin synthases, located at the plasma membrane, have been described in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and we have analysed three deletion mutants. Chs1 is involved in primary septum formation and is essential for vegetative growth. We therefore analyzed the conditional P<italic><sub>MRP1</sub>-CHS1/chs1</italic>Δ mutant under repressive condition. Chs2 is a non-essential class II enzyme and represents the major chitin synthase activity measured in cell membrane preparations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Chitin synthase 3 (Chs3) is responsible for most of the cell wall chitin production and chitin ring formation at sites of cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> but it is not essential for growth and viability. Our comparative analyses did not show any alteration in the chitin content in the P<italic><sub>MRP1</sub>-CHS1/chs1</italic>Δ and <italic>chs2</italic>Δ/Δ mutants, but a strong reduction was observed in the <italic>chs3</italic>Δ/Δ mutant (–92.3%) (Fig. S2) in accordance with previous data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. In the P<italic><sub>MRP1</sub>-CHS1/chs1</italic>Δ mutant, the cell wall had a 45.7% decrease in mannan content in the AS fraction and a 50% increase in β-1,6-glucan in the AI fraction (Fig. S2, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). In the <italic>chs3</italic>Δ/Δ mutant, the low proportion of chitin led to an increase of both β-1,3-glucan (x1.6) and β-1,6-glucan (x1.6) in the AS fraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, Fig. S2), suggesting a defect in β-glucans cross-linking in the cell wall polysaccharide core. No significant change in β-1,6-glucan structure was noticed for these two mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, 3c). Strikingly, no significant effect of the <italic>CHS2</italic> deletion was observed on cell wall chitin content or overall wall composition.</p>

As <italic>FKS1</italic> is essential for vegetative growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, we used the heterozygous <italic>fks1</italic>Δ mutant, which displays a haplo-insufficiency phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Only a decrease (–58.7%) in β-1,3-glucan content in the AS fraction (Fig. S2) was observed, without any other significant changes. Moreover, essentiality of <italic>FKS1</italic> prevented analysis of β-1,6-glucan dynamics in a β-1,3-glucan-deficient mutant. <italic>PHR1</italic> and <italic>PHR2</italic> encode β-1,3-glucanosyltransferases of the GH-72 family involved in β-1,3-glucan elongation and branching at the extracellular cell wall level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. In <italic>C. albicans</italic> their expression is strongly pH dependent: <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>PHR1</italic> is expressed above pH 5.5, while <italic>PHR2 is</italic> expressed below pH 5.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. The <italic>phr1</italic>Δ/Δ mutant was thus grown at pH 7.5 and <italic>phr2</italic>Δ/Δ at pH 5.5. As expected for both mutants, defects in GH-72 β-1,3-glucan remodelase led to a decrease in β-1,3-glucan branching (–67.3% for <italic>phr1</italic>Δ/Δ, –31.5% for <italic>phr2</italic>Δ/Δ) (Fig. S4) and a compensatory increase in the cell wall chitin content (1.5x for <italic>phr1</italic>Δ/Δ, and 3.7x for <italic>phr2</italic>Δ/Δ) (Fig. S2). No change in the cell wall β-1,3-glucan content was observed in the <italic>phr1</italic>Δ/Δ mutant (Fig. S2). In contrast, deletion of <italic>PHR2</italic> led to an increase of β-1,3-glucan content and a cross-linking defect (–31.5% estimated on the ratio β-1,3-glucan content in AS and AI fractions). Concomitantly, deletion of <italic>PHR2</italic> led to a reduction of cell wall β-1,6-glucan content in both AI (–58.7%) and AS (–51.3%) fractions and to a reduction of molecular size and branching of the β-1,6-glucan chains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). In the <italic>phr1</italic>Δ/Δ mutant, only a significant increase of the molecular size of β-1,6-glucan chain was observed (60 vs. 50 kDa) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these data showed that mutational disruption of chitin-synthase or β-1,3-glucan-synthase genes did not significantly alter the cell wall β-1,6-glucan structure. However, defects in chitin content led to a decrease in the cross-linking of β-glucans in the inner wall (i.e. AI Fraction) that corresponds to the effect of nikkomycin treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> phenotype (Fig. S1); conversely, an increase in chitin content led to more cross-linking of β-glucans as observed in the <italic>FKS1</italic> mutant or in the presence of caspofungin (Fig. S1 and S2). In contrast, disruption of cell wall β-1,3-glucan remodelling had a pH-dependent effect on β-1,6-glucan structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p>

<title>A β-1,6-glucan mannan compensatory pathway links the regulation of the inner and outer cell wall layers</title>
<p>In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, mannosylation of cell wall proteins is required for the organization of the fibrillar outer layer of the cell wall that is composed of <italic>N</italic>-linked mannans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. This fibrillar layer is anchored to the polysaccharide core composed of β-1,3-glucan and chitin, via β-1,6-glucan bridges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. We analyzed mutants deficient in Golgi α-mannosyltransferases involved in <italic>O</italic>– and <italic>N</italic>-mannosylation. Mnt1 and Mnt2 are α-1,2-mannosyltransferases involved in catalyzing consecutive reactions in <italic>O</italic>-mannan elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. As predicted, the cell wall of the <italic>mnt1/mnt2</italic>Δ/Δ mutant showed minor changes in overall mannan content (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, Fig. S2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. However, deletion of <italic>MNT1</italic> and <italic>MNT2</italic> genes led to a strong reduction of β-1,6-glucan molecular size (18 vs. 43 kDa) and an increased branching of β-1,6-glucan chains (8.6 vs. 5.3%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, 3f). A slight increase in the β-1,3-glucan branching was also observed in the <italic>mnt1/mnt2</italic>Δ/Δ double mutant (Fig. S4), suggesting that β-1,6-glucan and mannan synthesis may be coupled.</p>
<p><italic>N</italic>-mannan elongation requires the activity of a set α-1,6-mannosyltransferases in the Mannan Polymerase I and II complexes for the formation of α-1,6-mannan backbone that is subsequently modified with α-1,2– and α-1,3-mannosyltransferases that assemble the <italic>N</italic>-mannan side chains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Och1 activity is responsible for the initial addition of α-1,6-mannose onto the relatively well conserved <italic>N</italic>-glycan triantennary complex of glycoproteins, and Mnn9 activity is essential for the polymerization of the α-1,6-mannose backbone. Mnn2, Mnn21, Mnn22, Mnn23, Mnn24 and Mnn26 activities are essential to the synthesis of side chains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Single <italic>och1</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>mnn9</italic>Δ/Δ mutants and the sextuple <italic>mnn2/21/22/23/24/26</italic>Δ/Δ mutant resulted in a major decrease in mannan content in the AS fraction (–90.4% for <italic>och1</italic>Δ/Δ, –88.9% for <italic>mnn9</italic>Δ/Δ and –87.1% for <italic>mnn2/21/22/23/24/26</italic>Δ/Δ) and a compensatory increase in chitin content (x3.1 for <italic>och1</italic>Δ/Δ, x2.5 for <italic>mnn9</italic>Δ/Δ and x2.5 for <italic>mnn2/21/22/23/24/26</italic>Δ/Δ) in the AI fraction (Fig. S2), as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. A significant increase of cell wall β-1,3-glucan content was observed in the <italic>mnn9</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>mnn2/21/22/23/24/26</italic>Δ/Δ mutants. There was also a significant increase in the β-1,6-glucan content (x3.2 for <italic>och1</italic>Δ/Δ, x2.4 for <italic>mnn9</italic>Δ/Δ and x2.4 for <italic>mnn2/21/22/23/24/26</italic>Δ/Δ respectively) concomitant with the elongation of β-1,6-glucan chains, and consequential increase in its molecular size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, 3e).</p>
<p>Overall, these data suggest that the β-1,6-glucan biosynthesis is stimulated via a compensatory pathway when there is a defect in <italic>O</italic>– and <italic>N</italic>-linked cell wall mannan biosynthesis. This novel compensatory response occurs by increasing the β-1,6-glucan content in <italic>N</italic>-mannan elongation-deficient mutants and increasing branching of shorter β-1,6-glucan chains in <italic>O</italic>-mannan-deficient mutants.</p>

These three calnexin cycle proteins are involved in glucosylation/deglucosylation of <italic>N</italic>-glycan in the ER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> had a reduced amount of cell wall mannan (Fig. S2). Strong cell wall phenotypes were observed for <italic>kre5</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>rot2</italic>Δ/Δ mutants which exhibited significant increases in the highly branched β-1,3-glucan (x1.8 for <italic>rot2</italic>Δ/Δ, x2.2 for <italic>kre5</italic>Δ/Δ) (Fig. S4), chitin (x4.2 for <italic>rot2</italic>Δ/Δ, x5.2 for <italic>kre5</italic>Δ/Δ) and a strong decrease in β-1,6-glucan in the <italic>rot2</italic>Δ/Δ (–68.7%) and <italic>kre5</italic>Δ/Δ mutants (–81.5%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref> and Fig. S2). In addition, the β-1,6-glucan structure was also altered in both mutants, with a decrease in the average molecular size (15-16 kDa instead of 43 kDa for the parental strain) and a reduction in the side chain branching (–54.2% for <italic>rot2</italic>Δ/Δ, and –76.5% for <italic>kre5</italic>Δ/Δ) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>, 3i). <italic>KRE1</italic> encodes a plasma membrane protein whose function is not yet clear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>.

<p>In <italic>C. albicans,</italic> the <italic>KRE6</italic> family is composed of four homologs: <italic>KRE6</italic>, <italic>SKN1</italic>, <italic>KRE62</italic> and <italic>SKN2</italic>. These genes encode putative trans-β-glycosylases of the GH-16 family for which no biochemical activity has been described to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. To analyze the function of these four proteins in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we used a transient CRISPR/Cas9 protocol to build the four single knockout mutants, the double <italic>kre6/skn1</italic>Δ/Δ and the quadruple <italic>kre6</italic>Δ/Δ<italic>/kre62/skn2/skn1</italic>Δ/Δ mutants. Among the single mutants, only <italic>kre6</italic>Δ/Δ exhibited a marked alteration in the cell wall composition (Fig. S2), with significantly lower β-1,6-glucan (–46.8%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>) and mannan content (–42.8%) (Fig. S2), and higher β-1,3-glucan (x1.9) and chitin (x3.9) content. In addition, the β-1,6-glucan chain length was shorter (–50.5%) and more branched (x1.7) than in the parental strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>, 3i) and β-1,3-glucan was also hyperbranched (x1.8) (Fig. S4). The <italic>kre6/skn1</italic>Δ/Δ mutant phenotype, β-1,6-glucan content and structure was similar to the single <italic>kre6</italic>Δ/Δ mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). The quadruple <italic>kre6/kre62/skn2/skn1</italic>Δ/Δ mutant did not produce any measurable β-1,6-glucan (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>, Fig. S2), which was confirmed by endo-β-1,6-glucanase digestion of the AI and AS fractions (Fig. S6). The absence of β-1,6-glucan was associated with an increased chitin content (9.5% vs. 2.5%), and highly branched β-1,3-glucan (48% vs. 20% in the parental strain) (Fig. S2, Fig. S4). Reintegration of <italic>KRE6</italic> under the control of the <italic>ACT1</italic> promoter restored the production of β-1,6-glucan with a structure similar to that of the parental strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, in <italic>C. albicans,</italic> deletion of all <italic>KRE6</italic> homologous genes led to the absence of β-1,6-glucan production and structural alterations of the cell wall, showing that the β-1,6-glucan biosynthetic pathway is critical to the regulation of cell wall homeostasis.</p>

<title>β-1,6-glucan stimulates human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>The major cell wall polysaccharides of <italic>C. albicans,</italic> β-1,3-glucan, mannan, and chitin function as PAMPs, and their recognition by host PRRs trigger immune responses. Although β-1,6-glucan is one of the major constituent polysaccharide in the cell wall of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, its immunomodulatory potential has been understudied. We extracted β-1,6-glucan from the cell wall of the parental strain and used this to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and neutrophils isolated from the whole blood samples of healthy human donors. As controls, PBMCs were stimulated with the AI fraction (composed of β-1,3-glucan, β-1,6-glucan and chitin) as well as with the periodate-oxidized AI fraction (AI-OxP) devoid of β-1,6-glucan. A protein profiler was used to identify cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins differentially released by PBMCs and neutrophils stimulated with the three different cell wall fractions (AI, AI-OxP and β-1,6-glucan) (Fig. S12, S13). Then, differentially stimulated cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins were quantified by ELISA. Fractions containing β-1,3-glucan (AI and AI-OxP fractions) induced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α, chemokines such as IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1β and RANTES, and the complement factor C5a (an acute phase protein), but anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was released in a relatively small amount (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). However, removal of β-1,6-glucan by periodate oxidation (AI-OxP) led to a significant decrease in the IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, C5a and IL-10 released, suggesting that their stimulation was in part β-1,6-glucan dependent. Although the response was much lower than that induced by the AI fraction and AI-OxP, β-1,6-glucan activated PBMCs and induced secretion of most cytokines and chemokines (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Both AI and AI-OxP fractions stimulated neutrophils secreted IL-8 at a similar level (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>) but purified β-1,6-glucan did not, suggesting that β-1,6-glucan and β-1,3-glucan stimulate innate immune cells in distinct ways. Because the structure of cell wall β-1,6-glucan is dependent on stress as well as environmental conditions of growth, we investigated the structure-function immune response of β-1,6-glucan from <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Shorter β-1,6-glucan chains (19 kDa) were purified from the cell wall of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall grown with lactate as carbon source and larger β-1,6-glucan chains (70 kDa) were purified from cell wall produced in the presence of caspofungin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Both fractions stimulated PBMCs and led to cytokine/chemokine secretion at a level similar to the control β-1,6-glucan, suggesting that β-1,6-glucan size was not a significant factor influencing the stimulation of PBMCs (Fig. S5).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cell wall β-1,6-glucan is a conserved constituent in most of the major human fungal pathogens including <italic>Candida</italic>, <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>, <italic>Histoplasma</italic> and <italic>Malassezia</italic> species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. The cell wall of fungal pathogens is the target of several classes of antifungal drugs and is critical for immune recognition and activation, therefore has been the subject of numerous investigations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. However, this polysaccharide has been neglected, perhaps because its analysis requires bespoke methodologies. Here, we established new biochemical tools for quantitative and comparative analysis of cell wall β-1,6-glucan dynamics and structure in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and used them to demonstrate that this polysaccharide is instrumental in determining the gross architecture of the fungal wall and its immune reactivity.</p>
<p>In SD medium at 37°C, β-1,6-glucan represents 23% of the total cell wall, with an average size of 58 kDa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). From our analytical data on <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall, we proposed an updated model underlining the true role of β-1,6-glucan as a major cell wall component (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). NMR has demonstrated that the structure of β-1,6-glucan in the yeast cell wall is similar between species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, but there are variations in β-1,6-glucan content, chain length and branching. <italic>Malassezia restricta</italic> contains long β-1,6-glucan chains, averaging 80 kDa, whilst in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> they are moderate in size (30-60 kDa). We showed here that modulating environmental conditions induce significant changes in both cell wall structure and content. As described previously, lactate used as the sole carbon source led to a thinner inner cell wall layer and greater exposure of β-1,3-glucan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. We observe here that lactate medium also led to a marked reduction in cell wall β-1,6-glucan content and chain length (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). Our data showed that several factors related to host niches (morphology, temperature, salinity, pH and presence of organic acids) and the presence of antifungals had a significant impact on the structure, size and branching of β-1,6-glucan (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). This dynamic nature of the β-1,6-glucan component of the wall (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Fig. S1 and Fig. S2) is as important that the regulation and structural diversity of chitin, mannan and β-1,3-glucan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>The dynamic regulation of mannan biosynthesis leading to structural changes in the outer mannoprotein layer of <italic>C. albicans</italic> is also under-investigated. <italic>C. albicans</italic> evolves in different environments as a commensal or pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, mainly in the gut, oral cavity, genital tract and blood. How fungal cell walls adapt to changing environments was recently been listed as one of the top five unanswered question in fungal cell surface research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Our data demonstrate that in response to several environmental factors β-1,6-glucan and mannan productions are coupled. The <italic>in vivo</italic> importance of this novel dynamic process remains to be addressed but it could be critical in the articulation of host inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Immunolabelling with an anti-β-1,6-glucan serum demonstrated that this polymer is exposed at the cell surface and is therefore accessible to receptors that stimulate human immune cells (Fig. S11 and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Similarly in <italic>Pneumocystis carinii</italic>, β-1,6-glucans are exposed to the cell surface and stimulate mouse macrophages leading to the release of TNF-α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Our immunological data indicate that β-1,6-glucan is a <italic>bona fide</italic> fungal cell wall PAMP that activates the human immune system (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). Beads coated with pustulan (an insoluble linear form of β-1,6-glucan) activate neutrophils and induce massive ROS production and phagocytosis in a dectin-1-independent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. In agreement with Rubin-Bejerano <italic>et al</italic>. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, we found that soluble purified β-1,6-glucan and insoluble β-1,3-glucan-chitin fractions activate the complement system (Fig. S14). We observed that the size of soluble β-1,6-glucan did not alter immune stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. S5) whereas, despite its ability to bind soluble and particulate β-1,3-glucan polymers, Dectin-1 signaling is only activated by particulate β-1,3-glucans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. The relevance of fungal β-1,6-glucan to the global host immune response and mechanism of recognition remain to be investigated.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, β-1,3-glucan exposure is regulated by external signals such as hypoxia, carbon source or iron deprivation via the up-regulation of β-1,3-glucanase activities that lead to β-1,3-glucan masking and immune evasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. Regulation of the mechanisms determining β-1,6-glucan exposure and the expression of secreted glucanases remains also unknown in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The absence of β-1,6-glucan in the AI fraction led to a reduced inflammatory response (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting that an endo-β-1,3-glucanase, such as Eng1, may enable the release of cross-linked β-1,6-glucan from the cell surface, which could attenuate the host response by pruning β-1,6-glucans that are covalently bound to β-1,3-glucans from the surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Cell wall organization in <italic>C. albicans</italic> depends on the cross-linking of all polymers that function as a dynamic flexible network <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Their interconnectedness means that alteration in the synthesis of one polymer can lead to a compensatory change and active cell wall remodelling. Our data provides one new example of this phenomenon – namely decrease in cell wall chitin content results in an increase of both β-1,3-glucans and β-1,6-glucans in the AS fraction of the wall. Interestingly, defects in the expression of <italic>CHS1</italic> that encodes an essential chitin synthase required to construct the primary septum, was also compensated by an increased content of cell wall β-1,6-glucan but not of β-1,3-glucan (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This suggests that Chs1 has other functions beyond septum construction, that had previously been suggested by loss of cell integrity and swelling of cells upon <italic>CHS1</italic> repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, deletion of <italic>GAS1</italic>, the ortholog of <italic>PHR1</italic> and <italic>PHR2</italic>, led to a strong decrease of cross-linked β-1,6-glucan to β-1,3-glucan-chitin cell wall core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Deletions of <italic>PHR1</italic> and <italic>PHR2</italic>, holding a β-1,3-glucan remodelling activity, led to an increased chitin content (Fig. S2) and to a reduction of β-1,3-glucan branching (Fig. S4). However, a decrease in β-1,6-glucan content and β-1,6-glucan size was only observed in the <italic>PHR2</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). As <italic>PHR1</italic> and <italic>PHR2</italic> genes are strongly regulated by external pH, the compensatory differences we described may be explained by pH dependent regulation of β-1,6-glucan synthesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the mannan moieties of glycoproteins are covalently cross-linked to the β-glucan-chitin core. Mutants defective in <italic>N</italic>-mannan elongation led to a marked increase in β-1,6-glucan content and size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In yeast, Och1 and Mnn9 are α-1,6-mannosyltransferases that are involved in initial steps of α-1,6-mannan polymerization in the Golgi. Members of the Mnn2 α-1,2 mannosyltransferases are required for the addition of the side chains of the α-1,6-mannan backbone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Mutants in these genes led to defects in the outer fibrillar layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> and increased β-1,3-glucan exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. The quantification of β-1,6-glucan content in these <italic>N</italic>-mannan deficient mutants had not been described previously in <italic>C. albicans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> and underline the new finding that the regulation of mannan, β-glucans and chitin synthesis is coordinated and coupled. Screening with K1 toxin killer revealed a hypersensitivity of the Sc<italic>mnn9</italic> mutant and an increase in β-1,6-glucan cell wall content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup> reinforcing the hypothesis that β-1,6-glucans play a compensatory role when <italic>N</italic>-mannosylation is compromised (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). Defects in <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation also affected β-1,6-glucan synthesis leading to shortened highly branched β-1,6-glucan chains but without significant changes in overall cell wall composition. This suggests that size and branching of β-1,6-glucan can be regulated independently (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>).</p>
<p>Fine details of the biosynthetic pathway of yeast β-1,6-glucans are not clear. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, deletion of <italic>KRE5</italic> and <italic>ROT2</italic> led to a reduction in cell wall β-1,6-glucans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, this reduction is characterized by the presence of short seldom-branched β-1,6-glucan chains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Although no difference was observed in the <italic>CWH41</italic> mutant, our data imply that canonical <italic>N</italic>-glycan processing in the ER is required for complete β-1,6-glucan synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>, and that Kre5p is not the β-1,6-glucan polymerase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our results confirm that the β-1,6-glucan biosynthetic pathway is similar in these phylogenetically distant yeasts, and that the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation pathway is critical for β-1,6-glucan synthesis. Defects in early <italic>N</italic>-glycan synthesis at the ER level led to concomitant defects in β-1,6-glucan synthesis while defects in <italic>N</italic>-mannan elongation led to increased β-1,6-glucan synthesis. Among the <italic>KRE</italic> genes, only <italic>KRE6</italic> may be directly involved in β-1,6-glucan synthesis. Kre6 and its homologs contain a β-glycosyl-hydrolase domain of the GH-16 family, which includes a large number of fungal enzymes such as Crh1 homologs that are involved in the cross-linking of chitin and β-1,3-glucan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the quadruple deletion of <italic>KRE6</italic>, <italic>SKN1</italic>, <italic>SKN2</italic> and <italic>KRE62</italic>, led to the complete absence of β-1,6-glucan in the cell wall (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>) but also in culture supernatants and in intracellular extracts (not shown), demonstrating a stop of β-1,6-glucan synthesis rather than miss-localization. The absence of β-1,6-glucan in the quadruple mutant led to global cell wall remodeling and the absence of the outer fibrillar <italic>N</italic>-mannan layer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>). Kre6 had the dominant role and its absence led to a hypersensitivity to cell wall-targeting antifungal drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. One exception was observed for caspofungin which enhanced the growth of all <italic>KRE6</italic> deleted mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Growth above the MIC (paradoxical growth) has been described at high caspofungin concentrations and is associated with high chitin content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup> as observed in these mutants. Our data show that Kre6 is required for production of normal amounts of β-1,6-glucan and that the remaining β-1,6-glucans present in <italic>kre6</italic>Δ/Δ was composed of short and highly branched chains. This suggests that the Kre6 family is required for the polymerization and/or elongation of β-1,6-glucan, but not glucan branching.</p>
<p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, only two <italic>KRE6</italic> family members have been identified, Kre6 and Skn1, and their absence led to strong growth defects and hypersensitivity to cell wall perturbing agents –similar to what we observed here in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. In <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, among the six <italic>KRE6</italic> homologs, <italic>KRE6</italic> and <italic>SKN1</italic> are required for the production of cell wall β-1,6-glucan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> and although the <italic>KRE6</italic> family is essential for β-1,6-glucan synthesis, its biochemical function remains unknown. Kre6 homologs are type II membrane proteins with a GH-16 domain at the luminal C-terminus and an unfolded cytosolic <italic>N</italic>-terminal tail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. Yeast Kre6 and Skn1 proteins have moderate similarity with diatom TGS (1,6-β-transglycosylase) proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup> and can synthesize glucan from UDP-Glc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>. Kre6 homologs share structural similarities with β-glucanases and β-transglycosylases, arguing for a possible cell wall remodeling function. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Kre6p has been localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, the plasma membrane and secretory vesicle-like compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>, and the cytosol tail was shown to be essential for the correct cellular localization and β-1,6-glucan synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, in <italic>C. albicans</italic> the cytosol tail is not essential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, suggesting some functional differences of this protein in these yeasts. In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the double <italic>KRE6/SKN1</italic> mutant is avirulent in a mice model of candidiasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, showing that the β-1,6-glucan biosynthetic pathway is a potential antifungal target. However, the drugs Jervine (steroidal alkaloid) and a pyridobenzimidazole derivate (D75-4590), that may target Kre6 and inhibit <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>, had no effect on <italic>C. albicans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>, presumably representing species-specific differences in drug profiles. Kre6 family members are present in all fungal pathogens producing cell wall β-1,6-glucans and further investigations are required to understand the enzyme activities and the diversity of structures related to the potential drug-targeting of these proteins.</p>
<p>Overall, this work highlights the central role that β-1,6-glucan plays in orchestrating cell wall synthesis during growth and in response to stress and sets the focus for further work that can exploit this central role in mitigating fungal infections.</p>

<p>The <italic>Candida albicans</italic> strains used in this study are listed in Table S1. The reference strain SC5314, used for all stress conditions, was grown overnight in 25 mL flasks, at 37°C, 180 rpm, in SD medium (2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base with amino acids (YNB) (BD), pH 5.4). Overnight cultures were diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub>= 0.001, in 50 mL fresh SD medium, incubated at 37°C, 180 rpm, and then harvested either when reaching mid-exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> ∼ 3-5) or at stationary phase (OD<sub>600</sub> ∼ 11-12 after 30h). The following growth conditions were selected: hypha induction (SD containing 2% GlcNAc instead of 2% glucose, pH 7.2), temperature (30°C), osmolarity (1M NaCl), carbon source (SD containing 2% lactate (ChemCruz) instead of 2% glucose), oxygen limitation (hypoxia: 1% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, anaerobic chamber (Baker Ruskinn, I-CONIC, Bugbox M)) and oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 1.5 mM, Prolabo). For studies of the effect of medium pH, SD medium was buffered with 100 mM MES (Sigma) at pH 4 or 5.4 or with MOPS (Sigma) at pH 7.5. For experiments on the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), SD medium was supplemented with 100 mM MES and 50 mM acetate (Sigma) or 20 mM propionate (Sigma) or 15 mM butyrate (Sigma) and buffered to pH 5.4. Drugs were tested at sub-lethal concentrations: Calcofluor White (CFW, 400 µg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich), Congo Red (CR, 50 µg/mL, Sigma), tunicamycin (0.125 µg/mL, Sigma), nikkomycin (16 µg/mL, Sigma) and caspofungin (0.015 µg/mL, Sigma).

The plates were incubated at 37°C, 60 min at 110 rpm for initial cell adhesion. Then, the plates were washed with 2 mL of fresh medium, and 4 mL of fresh medium was added. Plates were then sealed with Breathseal sealing membranes (Greiner Bio-one) and incubated at 37°C, 110 rpm.

<title>Quantification of β-1,6-glucan in alkali-insoluble (AI) and alkali-soluble (AS) fractions</title>
<p>To quantify β-1,6-glucan in the AI fraction, a colorimetric assay was used. Oxidation with periodate allows specific degradation of vicinal carbons bearing hydroxyl groups. In the AI fraction, only β-1,6-glucans were sensitive to this treatment, leading to the formation of aldehyde functions, which were quantified in the presence of 4-hydroxybenzhydrazide (PAHBAH) (Sigma) (Fig. S8). Oxidation was carried out at 50°C for 6 h on 100 µL of AI fraction (0.5 mg/mL) with 100 µL of 25 mM <italic>m</italic>-IO<sub>4</sub>Na (Sigma-Aldrich). Excess of reagent was quenched with 100 µL sodium sulfite 200 mM (Sigma). Then, 100 µL of reaction mixture were added to 900 µL of PAHBAH reagent (0.63 g sodium sulfite, 5 mL NaOH 5 M, 5 mL sodium citrate 0.5 M, 5 mL NaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.2 M qsp 100 mL milliQ water, 1 g PAHBAH) and placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min. The quantification of produced aldehyde was measured by the absorbance at 405 nm. Pustulan (linear β-1,6-glucan, Elicityl OligoTech) was used as a standard. The β-1,3-glucan content of the AI fraction was calculated as the total glucose content after subtraction of the amount of β-1,6-glucan.</p>
<p>The presence of mannan in the AS fraction prevents to use the colorimetric assay of β-1,6-glucan after periodate oxidation. β-1,3-glucan and β-1,6-glucan of the AS fraction were therefore quantified by enzyme digestion. The AS fraction was digested with the endo-β-1,3-glucanase, LamA (from <italic>Thermotoga neapolitana</italic> expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup> or with an endo-β-1,6-glucanase (from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> expressed in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup>. Digestions were carried out at 37°C during 24 h by treating 0.2 mg of AS fraction with 20 µL of LamA (specific activity: 10 µmol eq/min/µL) or 60 µL of the endo-β-1,6-glucanase (specific activity: 3.03×10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> µmol eq/min/µL), in 50 mM NaOAc, pH 6, in a final volume of 200 µL.

Soluble and purified β-1,6-glucans from <italic>C. albicans</italic> and a commercial source of laminarin (Sigma) were used as standards. Products from enzymatic digestion were eluted under the following gradient: isocratic step of 98% of eluent A (50 mM NaOH) and 2% of eluent B (500 mM AcONa in 50 mM NaOH) for 2 min, 2–15 min of a linear gradient of AcONa in 50 mM NaOH (2% B to 20% B), 15–20 min of a linear gradient (20% B to 43% B), 20–22 min of a linear gradient (43% B to 100% B), 22–25 min under isocratic conditions with 100% B.

To observe macroscopic filamentation, 5 µL (OD<sub>600 nm</sub>=1) were spotted on YNB 2%GlcNAc, buffered at pH 7.2 with 100 mM MOPS agar, at 37°C, for 6 days. Pictures were taken using an I-phone camera.</p>
<p>To observe hyphal growth, cells were grown overnight in SD liquid 30°C, then diluted to OD<sub>600 nm</sub>=0.2 in 1 mL of 24 well plate (TPP) and growth for 6 h either in SD, 30°C (control, no-filamentation) or in YNB 2%GlcNAc, buffed at pH 7.2 with 100 mM MOPS, at 37°C (inducing filamentation). Cells were then observed with an Olympus IX 83 microscope and images were captured with a Hamamatsu ORCA Flash cooled CCD camera, using the cellSens imaging software.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>GraphPad Prism 10 software was used for statistical analyses. Data were generated from at least three independent biological replicates and then expressed as means ± standard deviation. Specific tests are indicated in the figure legends. Normally-distributed datasets (QQ plot or Shapiro-Wilk test), were compared with ordinary one-way ANOVA (Dunnett’s or Tukey’s multiple comparisons test) or two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test. For immunology data, measurements were paired/dependant as the same donors were exposed to different cell wall fractions, thus we applied the nonparametric test for non-normally distributed data: Friedman test (with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test). P-values (P) &lt; 0.05 were considered as significant and represented on graphs as followed: *, P &lt; 0,05; **, P &lt; 0,01; ***, P &lt; 0,001; ****, P &lt; 0,0001; ns: non-significant.</p>

<p>The paper will be of broad interest to fungal biologists and fungal immunologists seeking to understand the biosynthesis of the fungal cell wall, in particular of ß-1,6-glucan synthesis and the importance of this so far understudied constituent of the cell wall for cell wall integrity and immune response. The study is of <bold>fundamental</bold> significance and adds structural clarity to the presence, genetic, and biochemical basis of this difficult-to-analyze carbohydrate. It opens the potential for understanding its role in immune recognition and potentially as a drug target. Overall, the data is <bold>compelling</bold>, properly controlled and analyzed, but a few aspects need to be reconsidered.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The fungal cell wall is a very important structure for the physiology of a fungus but also for the interaction of pathogenic fungi with the host. Although a lot of knowledge on the fungal cell wall has been gained, there is a lack of understanding of the meaning of ß-1,6-glucan in the cell wall. In the current manuscript, the authors studied in particular this carbohydrate in the important human-pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. The authors provide a comprehensive characterization of cell wall constituents under different environmental and physiological conditions, in particular of ß-1,6-glucan. Also, β-1,6-glucan biosynthesis was found to be likely a compensatory reaction when mannan elongation was defective. The absence of β-1,6-glucan resulted in a significantly sick growth phenotype and complete cell wall reorganization. The manuscript contains a detailed analysis of the genetic and biochemical basis of ß-1,6-glucan biosynthesis which is apparently in many aspects similar to yeast. Finally, the authors provide some initial studies on the immune modulatory effects of ß-1,6-glucan.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings are very well documented, and the data are clear and obtained by sophisticated biochemical methods. It is impressive that the authors successfully optimized methods for the analyses and quantification of ß-1-6-glucan under different environmental conditions and in different mutant strains.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, although already very interesting, at this stage there are some loose ends that need to be combined to strengthen the manuscript. For example, the immunological studies are rather preliminary and need at least some substantiation. Also, at this stage, the manuscript in some places remains a bit too descriptive and needs the elucidation of potential causalities.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors provide the first (to my knowledge) detailed characterization of cell wall b-1,6 glucan in the pathogen Candida albicans. The approaches range from biochemistry to genetics to immunology. The study provides fundamental information and will be a resource of exceptional value to the field going forward. Highlights include the construction of a mutant that lacks all b-1,6 glucan and the characterization of its cell wall composition and structure. Figure 5a is a feast for the eyes, showing that b-1,6 glucan is vital for the outer fibrillar layer of the cell wall. Also much appreciated was the summary figure, Figure 7, which presents the main findings in digestible form.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is highly significant for the fungal pathogen field especially, and more broadly for anyone studying fungi, antifungal drugs, or antifungal immune responses.</p>
<p>The manuscript is very readable, which is important because most readers will be cell wall nonspecialists.</p>
<p>The authors construct a key quadruple mutant, which is not trivial even with CRISPR methods, and validate it with a complemented strain. This aspect of the study sets the bar high.</p>
<p>The authors develop new and transferable methods for b-1,6 glucan analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The one &quot;famous&quot; cell type that would have been interesting to include is the opaque cell. This could be included in a future paper.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The cell wall of human fungal pathogens, such as Candida albicans, is crucial for structural support and modulating the host immune response. Although extensively studied in yeasts and molds, the structural composition has largely focused on the structural glucan b,1,3-glucan and the surface exposed mannans, while the fibrillar component β-1,6-glucan, a significant component of the well wall, has been largely overlooked. This comprehensive biochemical and immunological study by a highly experienced cell wall group provides a strong case for the importance of β-1,6-glucan contributing critically to cell wall integrity, filamentous growth, and cell wall stability resulting from defects in mannan elongation. Additionally, β-1,6-glucan responds to environmental stimuli and stresses, playing a key role in wall remodeling and immune response modulation, making it a potential critical factor for host-pathogen interactions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this study is well-designed and executed. It provides the first comprehensive assessment of β-1,6-glucan as a dynamic, albeit underappreciated, molecule. The role of β-1,6-glucan genetics and biochemistry has been explored in molds like Aspergillus fumigatus, but this work shines an important light on its role in Candida albicans. This is important work that is of value to Medical Mycology, since β-1,6-glucan plays more than just a structural role in the wall. It may serve as a PAMP and a potential modulator of host-pathogen interactions. In keeping with this important role, the manuscript rigor would benefit from a more physiological evaluation ex vivo and preferably in vivo, assessment on stimulating the immune system within in the cell wall and not just as a purified component. This is a critical outcome measure for this study and gets squarely at its importance for host-pathogen interactions, especially in response to environmental stimuli and drug exposure.</p>

<p>Response to reviewers (Public review):</p>
<p>We thank all the three reviewers for their opinion on our work on <italic>Candida albicans</italic> β-1,6-glucan, which highlights the importance of this cell wall component in the biology of fungi. Here are our responses to their comments for public reviews:</p>
<p>(1) Indeed, the data presented for immunological studies is preliminary. It has been acknowledged by the reviewers that our analysis providing insights into the biosynthetic pathways involved in comprehensive in dealing with organization and dynamics of the β-1,6-glucan polymer in relation with other cell wall components and environmental conditions (temperature, stress, nutrient availability, etc.). However, we anticipated that there would be immediate curiosity as to what the immunological contribution of β-1,6 glucan and we therefore felt we needed to initiative these studies and include them. We therefore performed immunological studies to assess whether β-1,6-glucans act as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), and if so, what its immunostimulatory potential is. Our data clearly suggest that β-1,6-glucan is a PAMP, and consequently lead to several questions: (a) what are the host immune receptors involved in the recognition of this polysaccharide, and thereby the downstream signaling pathways, (b) how is β-1,6-glucan differentially recognized by the host when <italic>C. albicans</italic> switches from a commensal to an opportunistic pathogen, and (c) how does the host environment impact the exposure of this polysaccharide on the fungal surface. We believe addressing these questions is beyond the scope of the present manuscript and aim to present new data in future manuscript. Nonetheless, in the revised manuscript, suggest approaches that we can take to identify the receptor that could be involved in the recognition of β-1,6-glucan. Moreover, we have modified the discussion presenting it based on the data rather than being descriptive.</p>
<p>(2) It will be interesting to assess the organization of β-1,6-glucan and other cell wall components in the opaque cells. It is documented that the opaque cells are induced at acidic pH and in the presence of <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine and CO2. Our data shows that pH has an impact on β-1,6-glucan, which suggests that there will be differential organization of this polysaccharide in the cell wall of opaque cells. As suggested by the reviewer, we will include analysis of opaque cells (and other <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell types) in future studies.</p>
<p>With the exception of these major new avenues for this research, our revision can address each of the comments provided by the reviewers.</p>
