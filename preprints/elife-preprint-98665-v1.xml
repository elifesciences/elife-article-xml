<title>Summary</title>
<p>The bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts plays a critical role in the life-long remodeling of our bones that is perturbed in many bone loss diseases. Multinucleated osteoclasts are formed by the fusion of precursor cells, and larger cells - generated by an increased number of cell fusion events - have higher resorptive activity. We find that osteoclast fusion and bone-resorption are promoted by reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling and by an unconventional low molecular weight species of La protein, located at the osteoclast surface. Here, we develop the hypothesis that La’s unique regulatory role in osteoclast multinucleation and function is controlled by a ROS switch in La trafficking. Using antibodies that recognize reduced or oxidized species of La, we find that differentiating osteoclasts enrich an oxidized species of La at the cell surface, which is distinct from the reduced La species conventionally localized within cell nuclei. ROS signaling triggers the shift from reduced to oxidized La species, its dephosphorylation and delivery to the surface of osteoclasts, where La promotes multinucleation and resorptive activity. Moreover, intracellular ROS signaling in differentiating osteoclasts oxidizes critical cysteine residues in the C-terminal half of La, producing this unconventional La species that promotes osteoclast fusion. Our findings suggest that redox signaling induces changes in the location and function of La and may represent a promising target for novel skeletal therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The integrity of our bones throughout life depends on tightly regulated coordination between the bone-forming activity of osteoblasts and the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. A variety of genetic and age-related skeletal disorders are linked to a disbalance in osteoblast-osteoclast functional coupling that commonly results in excessive bone resorption and/or insufficient synthesis and mineralization of bone.</p>
<p>Multinucleated osteoclasts are formed by the fusion of mononucleated precursor cells, and, in most cases, cells with more nuclei (i.e., generated by a larger number of fusion events) have higher resorptive activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. We recently demonstrated that both osteoclast fusion and bone-resorption are controlled by an unconventional, low molecular weight form of La protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. La, an abundant, ubiquitous protein in eukaryotes, exists primarily as a phosphorylated, nuclear species that plays essential functions in the maturation of RNA polymerase III transcripts, particularly tRNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. However, we discovered that La is dephosphorylated, proteolytically cleaved, and delivered to the surface of osteoclasts during multinucleation. Surface-associated La promotes cell-cell fusion and increased resorptive capacity in osteoclasts. When osteoclasts reach a mature size appropriate for their biological activity, fusion stops. Completion of the fusion process coincides with the removal of surface-associated La, suggesting that the changes in the surface La amounts effectively set the size and biological activity of osteoclasts. The mechanisms that trigger the radical switch in the location and function of La from nucleus to cell surface; and from ubiquitous RNA chaperone to an osteoclast-specific fusion regulator - remain to be understood.</p>
<p>Intracellular ROS represent a common biological switch for proteins with multiple functions in eukaryotes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Excessive levels of ROS during oxidative stress eventually lead to irreversible damage of biological systems and tissues and have been linked to diverse diseases in many physiological systems, including the skeleton <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, transient, moderate increases in ROS levels, referred to as redox signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> or a mild oxidative stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, play important roles in diverse cellular differentiation processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Intracellular ROS signaling commonly induces the formation of disulfide bonds, drives structural and oligomeric transitions, and promotes the unconventional secretion of some proteins lacking a signal peptide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Alternatively, a transition in the redox state of cysteine residues can also be triggered merely by protein trafficking changes that shifts the localization of a protein from the cytosol (typically reducing) to the extracellular environment (typically oxidizing) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Like many other physiological processes, bone remodeling and, more specifically, osteoclast formation depend on ROS signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. RANKL-induced differentiation of osteoclast precursors quickly generates transient ROS signaling in differentiating osteoclasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, and many bone diseases, including osteoporosis, have been linked to perturbations in ROS signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, application of oxidizing reagents, such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, promotes osteoclast formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In contrast, cell-permeable antioxidants block RANKL-induced ROS production and inhibit osteoclast formation and bone resorption <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent biochemical studies demonstrate that oxidizing conditions and intracellular redox signaling elicit conformational transitions and oligomerization of La protein and promote its nucleus-to-cytoplasm shuttling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Here, we tested the hypothesis that La’s unique regulatory role in osteoclast multinucleation and function is controlled by a ROS switch in La trafficking and function. Using antibodies that recognize reduced vs oxidized species of La, we found that nuclear La and cell surface La in differentiating osteoclasts to represent reduced and oxidized species of the protein, respectively. Oxidized La species at the surface of osteoclasts promoted their fusion and increased multinucleation. Suppressing ROS signaling in osteoclast precursors inhibited the appearance of La in the cytoplasm and at the surface of osteoclasts and suppressed fusion during osteoclast formation. Addition of the C-terminal half of La – the region required for promoting osteoclast fusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> – to the extracellular surface of osteoclasts rescued this inhibition but only if critical La cysteine residues were available for oxidation. Our data suggest that transient ROS signaling induces a shift from reduced to oxidized La species and plays a critical role in directing the delivery of La to the surface of osteoclasts and promoting multinucleation and subsequent resorptive function of these syncytial bone remodelers. Our findings suggest that redox transition and, more specifically, La cysteine oxidation may represent promising targets for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating osteoclast-dependent bone resorption in skeletal pathologies.</p>

<title>Osteoclast fusion depends on an oxidized form of surface La</title>
<p>To mechanistically evaluate the transition from osteoclast precursors to multinucleated osteoclasts, we incubated primary human monocytes with recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and then with M-CSF and recombinant receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. While the time course and efficiency of multinucleated osteoclast formation varies from donor to donor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, on average, we observed the appearance of small, multinucleated syncytia two days after RANKL application and fusion rapidly increased over the next two days, resulting in mature, resorption competent osteoclasts at 4 to 5 days post-RANKL addition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Previously, we demonstrated that the cell fusion stage of multinucleated osteoclast formation depends on La trafficking to the surface of the osteoclasts at days 2 to 4 post RANKL application <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, however the mechanisms that trigger La’s trip to the osteoclast surface and what molecular requirements must be met for its unconventional fusion role there remained open questions.</p>
<p>To address open questions concerning La’s surface trafficking and molecular function in osteoclast multinucleation, we evaluated the redox state of La in fusing osteoclasts using recently validated monoclonal α-La antibodies that recognize oxidized La or reduced La, or do not distinguish between these La species (Pan) (7B6, 312B and 5B9, respectively) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. At the time of fusion, immunofluorescence analysis of La’s localization in permeabilized osteoclasts with pan α-La antibody demonstrated that La is present in both the cytoplasm and nuclei (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). In stark contrast, the cytoplasmic/plasma membrane associated pool was recognized by the α-La antibody that recognizes oxidized La species, while the α-La antibody that recognizes reduced La species recognized the nuclear protein pool (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>). Under non-permeabilizing conditions – focusing on the exofacial surface of the plasma membrane - we readily observed La at the surface of fusing osteoclasts (see also <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>). We find that this surface pool of La is dramatically enriched in oxidized, rather than reduced, La species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). In further support of this conclusion, we found that the application of the membrane-impermeable reducing reagent Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) dramatically decreased the recognition of surface La by the α-La antibody that recognizes the oxidized species and increased the recognition of surface La by the α-La antibody that recognizes the reduced species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b-c</xref>). In contrast, TCEP had no effect on the ability of the pan α-La antibody to recognize surface La (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b-c</xref>) or on the surface detection of La with another α-La antibody (Abcam #75927) that we have used previously to evaluate La at the surface of fusing osteoclasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and now found to recognize both reduced and oxidized species of La (data not shown). These findings indicate that the surface pool of La that manages osteoclast size and resorptive function is primarily composed of an oxidized La molecular species. Interestingly, TCEP treatment did not dissociate cell surface La from plasma membrane, suggesting that the reduced species of La retains its ability to associate with the plasma membrane.</p>

<p>We further assessed the functional importance of surface La’s redox status in synchronized osteoclast fusion. As in earlier studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, we uncoupled the cell fusion stage of osteoclast formation from pre-fusion differentiation processes using lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a reversible inhibitor of an early stage of membrane rearrangement required for osteoclast fusion. LPC was applied for 16h following 2 days of RANKL elicited osteoclastogenesis. Ready-to-fuse cells, which could not fuse in the presence of LPC, rapidly fused after LPC wash out (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). As we demonstrated previously with another pan α-La antibody <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, pan α-La antibody 5B9 applied at the time of LPC removal inhibited synchronized osteoclast fusion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Similarly, α-La antibodies that recognize the oxidized species inhibited fusion, while antibodies that recognize the reduced La species had no effect on fusion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). These data strongly support the conclusion that the functional La species that promotes osteoclast fusion and function is an unconventional, cell surface-associated, oxidized species. In further support of the functional importance of surface La oxidation, and possibly other surface proteins, we find that reducing the surface of human osteoclasts via TCEP treatment — which reduces surface La but does not alter its membrane association (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) — inhibits synchronized osteoclast fusion in a dose dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>

<p>To further validate the role of La’s redox status in osteoclast multinucleation and resorptive function, we chose to assess the functional impact of perturbing the oxidation status of recombinant La. Previously, we showed that the C-terminal half of La produced recombinantly and added to the medium bathing differentiating osteoclast precursors binds the surface of these cells and is sufficient to promote osteoclast fusion and resorptive function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. We produced La 194-408 recombinantly and reduced a portion of the protein with TCEP followed by the application of iodoacetamide to block the free thiols in La 194-408, preventing their subsequent oxidation. When we compared the effects of La 194-408 vs reduced La 194-408 on primary human osteoclast multinucleation, we found that the reduction of recombinant La greatly diminished its ability to promote osteoclast multinucleation and resorption (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-c</xref>).</p>

<p>Many of the effects of redox signaling are mediated by the oxidation of cysteine residues within proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Human La has 3 cysteine residues. However, we have previously demonstrated that the N-terminal half of La (La 1-187), containing one of La’s cysteines, is dispensable for La’s role in promoting osteoclast fusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, we focused on the two cysteines in the C-terminal half of La: Cys 232 and Cys 245. We recombinantly produced a La 194-408 mutant where cysteines 232 and 245 were mutated to alanine residues (La Cys Mut.) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>; <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 4a</xref>). Interestingly, we find that a fraction of La 194-408 migrates as a band ∼twice the predicted size of La 194-408 despite separation via denaturing gel electrophoresis, suggesting the presence of La 194-408 dimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In contrast, we observe no dimer band in La Cys Mut (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 4 b,c</xref>) . In addition, we find that the loss of Cys 232 and Cys 245 greatly diminishes the affinity of the α-La antibody that recognizes the oxidized La species, whereas both species are recognized by an α-6xHis monoclonal antibody via their N-terminal His tags (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Finally, we found that the loss of Cys 232 and Cys 245 strongly abrogates the ability of La 194-408 to promote osteoclast fusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). From these data, we conclude that Cys 232 and Cys 245 – previously highlighted for their roles in redox-dependent structural changes in La <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> – are vital for La’s function in osteoclast multinucleation.</p>

<p>To summarize, La promotes osteoclast fusion as an unconventional, cell surface associated, oxidized species. Moreover, our data suggest that the conformational transition from reduced to oxidized La species that is critical for the protein’s role in osteoclast formation and function depends on cysteine residues within its C-terminal half.</p>

Finding that the surface La pool, which promotes multinucleation in osteoclasts, is an oxidized species raised the question of where La becomes oxidized? Is La oxidation in osteoclasts a consequence of surface delivery or does La oxidation precede surface trafficking?</p>
<p>Finding that La in permeabilized differentiating osteoclasts is recognized by the α-La antibody that recognizes oxidized rather than reduced La species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. 1</xref>) suggested that the oxidation of La takes place in the cytoplasm of forming osteoclasts prior to delivery to the oxidizing environment of their surface. To further address this question, we utilized a cell-permeable reducing reagent N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) that has been widely used to inhibit intracellular ROS generation and suppress cytosolic redox signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Since under some conditions complex indirect effects of NAC raise rather than lower ROS levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, we verified the ROS-lowering effects of NAC in osteoclast precursors using a previously validated, cell-permeable ROS probe CellROX Deep Red <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We found that NAC treatment suppresses ROS elevation stimulated by RANKL-initiated differentiation of human osteoclasts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). While early treatment with NAC has been reported to disrupt the pre-fusion stages of osteoclast differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we found that NAC treatment 24 hours after RANKL application (i.e., after early osteoclast precursor commitment), did not lower the steady state levels of osteoclastogenic differentiation factors (NFATc1, cFOS) or the transcripts of two fusion-related proteins (La or AnxA5) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). We then explored the effects of suppressing ROS signaling on osteoclast formation and the trafficking of La, as in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, we found that NAC mediated inhibition of ROS signaling suppresses osteoclast multinucleation in a dose dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Suppressing ROS signaling with NAC also inhibited the transition from reduced to oxidized, cytoplasmic La species, as evidenced by decrease in staining of permeabilized osteoclasts with α-oxidized La antibody and a complementary increase in staining of permeabilized osteoclasts with α-reduced La antibody (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. 5a-d</xref>). Most importantly, NAC application inhibited the cell-surface delivery of La in human osteoclasts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). These findings suggest that NAC inhibits La function in osteoclasts by suppressing ROS-induced oxidation of La and its delivery to the surface of osteoclasts. Moreover, our findings also indicate that the transition from reduced to oxidized La species occurs inside the osteoclast cytoplasm during their commitment program rather than being a consequence of La arriving at the oxidizing environment of the extracellular milieu.</p>

<p>While most of La in human cells is phosphorylated at Ser 366 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, at the time of fusion, La is mostly dephosphorylated, as evidenced by a loss of the cell staining with antibodies specific for La phosphorylated at Ser366 (α-p366 La Ab) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. We find that while little phosphorylated La is typically observed in the nuclei of differentiating osteoclasts during fusion timepoints, that NAC suppression of transient ROS signaling greatly increases phosphorylated La in osteoclasts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). These data indicate that inhibition of intracellular ROS generation prevents La dephosphorylation and the loss of nuclear localization in differentiating osteoclast precursors. These findings substantiate the hypothesis that the redox signaling, which triggers a shift in La functional properties, is important for osteoclast fusion and takes place inside the cell.</p>

<p>We found that NAC application both inhibits osteoclast multinucleation and suppresses delivery of oxidized La species to the cell surface of fusing osteoclasts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d,e</xref>). These findings motivated us to explore whether the suppressed osteoclast multinucleation caused by NAC treatment could be the result of deficient La delivery to the cell surface. If the suppressed fusion observed following NAC treatment is a consequence of suppressing a ROS triggered “La trafficking switch”, then perhaps simply adding La to the medium bathing NAC-treated cells can rescue La surface pools and fusion? Indeed, we found that application of La 194-408 to NAC-treated cells rescued osteoclast fusion inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). However, the ability of La 194-408 to rescue NAC-inhibited osteoclast fusion is at least partially dependent on Cys 232 and Cys 245, as mutation of these residues to Ala greatly diminished the ability of La 194-408 to rescue NAC effects on fusion. Finding that the NAC-mediated ROS suppression of surface trafficking and fusion can be compensated for by the application of exogenous La strongly supports the conclusion that ROS signaling plays a vital role in triggering La’s delivery to the surface of osteoclasts and the promotion of their multinucleation. Moreover, the loss of La’s ability to rescue NAC suppression of osteoclast multinucleation when Cys 232 and Cys 245 are mutated to Ala also suggests that these residues are vital for oxidized La’s ability to promote osteoclast multinucleation and resorptive function.</p>
<p>In summary, ROS signaling downstream of osteoclast commitment contributes to the cell fusion stage of osteoclast formation by promoting intracellular oxidation of La and its delivery to the surface of fusion-committed cells, where La promotes multinucleation and subsequent resorptive activity in human osteoclasts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The reversible shift of redox homeostasis in cells to a moderately oxidized state, referred to as redox signaling, regulates the function and localization of many proteins and favors differentiation vs. proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Our findings confirm earlier reports emphasizing the importance of redox signaling in osteoclastogenic differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. ROS signaling and its inhibition by NAC likely influence osteoclast formation in many ways and at many points in the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. However, our finding that exogenous La rescues the NAC-mediated suppression of osteoclast fusion supports the hypothesis that ROS signaling promotes cell fusion stage of osteoclastogenesis by triggering La’s delivery to the surface of osteoclasts. This mechanism enriches our recent identification of La protein as a regulator of the cell-cell fusion stage of osteoclast formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and highlights the role of osteoclast ROS signaling in directing fusion machinery to the surface of osteoclast progenitors. While the reduced species of La functions as an essential nuclear RNA chaperone, oxidized La shifts to the cytoplasm and shuttles to the surface of the osteoclasts. It is this specialized oxidize species of cell-surface associated La that promotes osteoclast fusion and bone resorption.</p>
<p>The transition from reduced to oxidized species of La is accompanied by many changes in the protein structure, including an oxidation-induced oligomerization of the protein, a loss of almost half of its helical content, and a change in accessibility of epitopes recognized by conformation</p>
<p>specific antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Our data show that La belongs to a category of fold switching proteins that change functions in response to the cellular environment, more specifically, oxidizing and reducing intracellular conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. In addition to direct changes in the structure of La caused by its oxidation, ROS can influence La function in osteoclast fusion by indirect effects. Formation of multinucleated osteoclasts involves the caspase 3-cleaved, non-phosphorylated species of La <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and ROS can influence La properties by activation of both caspase 3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> and PP2A-like phosphatase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, previously reported to dephosphorylate La Ser366 before La cleavage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Indeed, while our finding that NAC inhibits dephosphorylation of La can indicate that redox-dependent changes in La’s conformation are required for the dephosphorylation of the protein, it can also be explained by the ROS dependence of PP2A activity. In both scenarios, redox signaling promotes intracellular La modifications and trafficking that delivers the fusion promoting species of La to the surface of cells.</p>
<p>We still do not know how cell-surface La promotes osteoclast fusion and why the oxidized species of La is functional in this unique cellular context. For many viral and intracellular fusion processes, remodeling of membrane bilayers in fusion is thought to be driven by the conformational energy released at the time and place of fusion in the restructuring of fusion-promoting proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Finding that La acquires an oxidized conformation already in cytoplasm rather than at the cell surface at the time of fusion argues against the hypothesis that redox restructuring of La directly contributes to membrane remodeling. Furthermore, our finding that La association with the cell surface does not change after reducing oxidized La with TCEP argues against the hypothesis that La oxidation is merely required for its association with the surface of osteoclasts.</p>
<p>Our data, which indicate that fusion competence in osteoclast precursors depends on ROS signaling, can be, at least partially, explained by the oxidation-dependent changes in the structure of La protein and its nucleo-cytoplasmic-cell surface shuttling. Formation of disulfide bonds; re-localization of normally nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm, extracellular medium, and cell surface; and dramatic changes in function in response to transient increases in ROS concentrations have been well described for other nuclear chaperones, in particular, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Like La, HMGB1 has three cysteines and mild HMGB1 oxidation generates disulfide bonds that stabilize homodimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Homodimerization by formation of disulfide bonds is also a pre-requisite for the unconventional secretion of Fibroblast Growth Factor 1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The specific pathway(s), by which RANKL-induced increases in ROS levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> shift the redox state of La and facilitate its unconventional secretion, remain to be clarified. Moreover, we hope to explore the contributions of related pathways like the production of nitric oxide (NO) and other reactive nitrogen species. In the case of HMGB1, the secretion of the protein, allowing it to act as a signaling molecule outside the cell, in addition to ROS, depends on NO signaling mediated by NO binding of one of a cysteine thiol in protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Interestingly, like redox signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, NO signaling promotes osteoclastogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> and the translocation of La protein to the cytoplasm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. More work is needed to explore the contributions of NO signaling to La function in osteoclasts and to compare the molecular mechanisms that deliver these two redox-, fold-, and function-shifting proteins, La and HMGB1, to the cell surface and extracellular medium.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in this study, we identified redox signaling as a molecular switch that redirects La protein away from the nucleus, where it protects precursor tRNAs from exonuclease digestion, and towards its osteoclast-specific function at the cell surface, where La regulates the multinucleation and resorptive functions of these managers of the skeleton.</p>
<p>Proteins involved in osteoclastogenesis represent potential therapeutic targets for treating bone loss diseases. Finding that osteoclast La promotes bone-resorption by acting not only at a different location but also in a different conformation from in comparison to the species of La that carries out its essential and ubiquitous RNA chaperoning functions (cell surface vs. nucleus and oxidized vs. reduced form), may help in minimizing off target effects of La targeting treatments.</p>

<title>Cell Fusion Quantitation</title>
<p>Osteoclast fusion efficiency was evaluated as the number of fusion events between cells in 10 images. In brief, since regardless of the sequence of fusion events, the number of cell-to-cell fusion events required to generate syncytium with N nuclei is always equal to N-1, we calculated the fusion number index as Σ (Ni − 1) = Ntotal − Nsyn, where Ni = the number of nuclei in individual syncytia and Nsyn = the total number of syncytia. We normalized the number of fusion events to the total number of nuclei (including unfused cells) to control for small variations in cell density from dish to dish and image to image. In contrast to traditional fusion index measurements, this approach gives equal consideration to fusion between two mononucleated cells, one mononucleated cell and one multinucleated cell and two multinucleated cells. In traditional fusion index calculations, fusion between two multinucleated cells does not change the percentage of nuclei in syncytia. If instead one counts the number of syncytia, a fusion event between two multinucleated is not just missed but decreases the number of syncytia. In contrast, the fusion number index is inclusive of all fusion events.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Leikina et al. investigate the role of redox changes in the ubiquitous protein La in the promotion of osteoclast fusion. In a recently published manuscript, the investigators found that osteoclast multinucleation and resorptive activity are regulated by a de-phosphorylated and proteolytically cleaved form of the La protein that is present on the cell surface of differentiating osteoclasts. In the present work, the authors build upon these findings to determine the physiologic signals that regulate La trafficking to the cell membrane and ultimately, the ability of this protein to promote fusion. Building upon other published studies that show (1) that intracellular redox signaling can elicit changes in the confirmation and localization of La, and (2) that osteoclast formation is dependent on ROS signaling, the authors hypothesize that oxidation of La in response to intracellular ROS underlies the re-localization of La to the cell membrane and that this is necessary for its pro-fusion activity. The authors test this hypothesis in a rigorous manner using antioxidant treatments, recombinant La protein, and modification of cysteine residues predicted to be key sites of oxidation. Osteoclast fusion is then monitored in each condition using fluorescence microscopy. These data strongly support the conclusion that oxidized La is de-phosphorylated, increases in abundance at the cell surface of differentiating osteoclasts, and promotes cell-cell fusion. A strength of this manuscript is the use of multiple complementary approaches to test the hypothesis, especially the use of Cys mutant forms of La to directly tie the observed phenotypes to changes in residues that are key targets for oxidation. The manuscript is also well-written and describes a clearly articulated hypothesis based on a precise summation of the existing literature. The findings of this manuscript will be of interest to researchers in the field of bone biology, but also more generally to cell biologists. The data in this manuscript may also lead to future studies that target La for bone diseases in which there is increased osteoclast activity. The weaknesses of the manuscript are minor and predominantly relate to data presentation choices. These weaknesses do not detract from the overall conclusions of the study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Bone resorption by osteoclasts plays an important role in bone modeling and homeostasis. The multinucleated mature osteoclasts have higher bone-resorbing capacity than their mononuclear precursors. The previous work by authors has identified that increased cell-surface level of La protein promotes the fusion of mononuclear osteoclast precursor cells to form fully active multinucleated osteoclasts. In the present study, the authors further provided convincing data obtained from cellular and biochemical experiments to demonstrate that the nuclear-localized La protein where it regulates RNA metabolism was oxidized by redox signaling during osteoclast differentiation and the modified La protein was translocated to the osteoclast surface where it associated with other proteins and phospholipids to trigger cell-cell fusion process. The work provides novel mechanistic insights into osteoclast biology and provides a potential therapeutic target to suppress excessive bone resorption in metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis and arthritis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Increased intracellular ROS induced by osteoclast differentiation cytokine RANKL has been widely studied in enhancing RANKL signaling during osteoclast differentiation. The work provides novel evidence that redox signaling can post-translationally modify proteins to alter the translocation and functions of critical regulators in the late stage of osteoclastogenesis. The results and conclusions are mostly supported by the convincing cellular and biochemical assays,</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The lack of in vivo studies in animal models of bone diseases such as postmenopausal osteoporosis, inflammatory arthritis, and osteoarthritis reduces the translational potential of this work.</p>
