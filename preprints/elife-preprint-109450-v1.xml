<abstract>
<p>In <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, a prevalent and deadly pathogen, resistance to antibiotics evolves primarily through non-synonymous mutations in proteins. Sequence-based analyses are currently used to understand the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance, either via genotype-phenotype association, or via signals of convergent evolution. These methods focus on primary sequence and usually neglect other biological signals such as protein structural information. We hypothesize that integrating the structural context of mutations improves the prediction of effects on function and phenotype. We curate high confidence structural annotations for the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> proteome from 1,371 crystallography and 2,316 AlphaFold predictions, and combine the structures with mutations from over 31,000 clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates. We demonstrate that mutations in proteins known to cause resistance are clustered in 3D space, even in proteins where inactivating mutations at any position are thought to cause resistance. We develop a statistic to search the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> proteome for signal of clustered non-synonymous mutations, finding over 450 proteins that display this signal, many of which have a known relationship with antibiotic resistance. Innovatively, we show that a supervised classifier trained on structure features alone has an F1 score of 94.6% at classifying mutations as resistance-conferring. This work demonstrates that protein structure provides useful information for categorizing which variants may cause antibiotic resistance, even when the majority of structures are AI-predicted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is challenging control of tuberculosis (TB), a disease responsible for the highest number of infectious disease related deaths globally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Currently, diagnosis of antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis relies on the detection of resistance-conferring mutations in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genome through molecular assays or genetic sequencing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Although the sensitivity and specificity of these assays is high for several first and some second-line TB drugs, prediction is less accurate for other second-line antibiotics or novel agents like bedaquiline and pretomanid, which have recently become cornerstones of multi-drug resistant TB treatment. Improving the accuracy of resistance diagnosis relies on new computational approaches that can better link mutations with their functional impact on the resistance phenotype.</p>
<p>Two major computational strategies exist for identifying resistance-conferring variants: supervised approaches which associate genetic variation with resistance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and unsupervised approaches that search for signal of evolutionary adaptation, which can indicate resistance development. Supervised statistical methods such as genome-wide association studies and random forest classifiers have identified mutations associated with antibiotic resistance in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and machine learning approaches have built on this success to identify additional resistance-conferring variants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> But, these approaches require a large number of phenotyped isolates (both resistant and susceptible) to make accurate predictions, which presents a major limitation, especially for recently evolved mutations. Evolution-based approaches are an alternative for finding variants associated with antibiotic resistance without requiring resistance phenotype data: by searching for convergent positive selection in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, studies have found mutations in the <italic>ald</italic> gene associated with D-cycloserine resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, phase variation associated with virulence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and mutations involved in host-pathogen interactions that potentiate the evolution of antibiotic resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both evolution-based and supervised approaches consider only the DNA or protein sequence as input. They generally assume that all sites are equally likely to affect the phenotype, and consequently many examples of a mutation are needed to infer significant effects. This assumption is not true: proteins have three-dimensional shapes and functional regions, and not every mutation is equally likely to impact function. Analyzing mutations in their three-dimensional context has uncovered hotspots of mutation in cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and provided post-hoc rationale for resistance-conferring variants in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. While past work has sought to reannotate parts of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> proteome with computationally predicted protein structures using older structure prediction methods,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> we can now infer a protein structure for nearly every protein in the proteome using AlphaFold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this paper, we use an unsupervised method to discover clustering of mutations in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> proteins, by integrating a proteome wide-structural database with mutations from over 31,000 clinical isolates. We show that mutations display statistically significant clustering in resistance-conferring genes, even in non-essential proteins such as PncA where individually rare inactivating mutations are thought to cause resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> We identify over 450 proteins in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> proteome that have significant clustering of mutations in their structures. Finally, we show that protein structural information provides a useful feature to predict whether variants are associated with antibiotic resistance.</p>

    <title>Characterization of protein-modifying mutations in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></title>
<p>We aimed to study how acquired missense variation in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> proteome distributes in the structure of each protein. To do this, we compiled a dataset of genomes of 31,428 isolates from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). We performed ancestral sequence reconstruction to determine the number of independent arisals of each mutation (homoplasy) (Supplementary Data 1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> The dataset represents a diversity of MTBC isolates: with 2,815 isolates from lineage 1; 8,090 from Lineage 2; 3,398 from Lineage 3; 16,931 from Lineage 4; 98 from Lineage 5; and 96 from Lineage 6.</p>
<p>We filtered the 782,565 unique SNVs and 47,425 insertion/deletion mutations (INDELs) found in the original dataset to focus only non-synonymous mutations in protein coding genes, or INDELS that preserve the original translation frame. We count the number of independent arisals (homoplasy score) for each SNV and INDEL. As we are looking for positive selection that alters but does not completely ablate protein function, we do not consider frameshift mutations. After excluding mutations occurring in regions where variant calling is computationally challenging with short-read sequencing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> we observe a total of 469,942 total unique non-synonymous SNVs and 5,104 total inframe indels (Methods, Supplementary Data 2). On a per-protein basis, a mean of 32.0% of sites have at least one mutation across the dataset of 31,428 isolates, with a mean of 1.4 mutations per mutated site. We observe that proteins with the highest total number of mutations are those known to be involved in resistance to first line antibiotics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

We used a sensitive pipeline to search the RCSB Protein structure databank (Methods) for structures homologous to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> proteins. We find a protein structure that represents at least 90% of the protein sequence for 34% of proteins (N = 1,371).

<title>Antibiotic resistance proteins demonstrate mutational clustering</title>
<p>To calculate clustering of mutations, we use an approach from geographic analysis that calculates spatial autocorrelation between statistics, called the Getis-Ord G-statistic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> Briefly, for each residue <italic>i</italic> in the protein, it calculates a <italic>z-</italic>score that computes if residue <italic>i</italic> is more proximal to highly mutated residues than would be expected by chance. This approach was previously applied to three-dimensional structure data by PIVOTAL to prioritize mutations associated with human disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>We examine the raw Getis-Ord score, which can be interpreted as a z-score, on the structures of 9 proteins in which mutations are known to confer antibiotic resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> – RpoB, EmbB, KatG, InhA, PncA, GyrA, RsmG (GidB), EthA, and Rs12 (Methods). For each protein, we observe a region with residue G-scores greater than 5 that are clustered in a single location (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). This finding is expected for essential drug target proteins where resistance-conferring mutations preserve protein function while occluding antibiotic binding, <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. RpoB, EmbB, InhA, GyrA, as mutations will tend to cluster in the antibiotic binding sites of those proteins. Notably we also identify significant clustering for proteins that are not essential to the cell, where any mutation that disrupts the protein can be resistance-conferring, <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. PncA. We observe that the residue G-score distribution demonstrates a periodic pattern across the gene length in which higher scores alternate with lower scores even when the high G-score residues cluster in a single protein location (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), a signal which emerges due to the 3D structure of the protein.</p>

<title>A protein-level statistic to test for mutational clustering</title>
<p>The G-score provides a residue-level z-score measuring three-dimensional proximity to other residues with high numbers of amino acid substitutions. We postulate that neutral amino-acid substitutions are more evenly distributed in 3-D space than functional substitutions that indicate selection, due to neutral substitutions being more likely to occur at the protein surface or flexible regions of the protein (e.g. loops and termini)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, whereas amino acid substitutions that indicate selection on the protein are more likely to cluster in protein-protein interaction interfaces or protein cores.</p>
<p>From these postulates, we evaluated five candidate protein-level statistics to quantify clustering of mutations possibly indicative of positive selection (Methods, Supplementary Data 4). We selected as a positive control set of proteins the nine above proteins known to be under selection for antibiotic resistance, with demonstrated residue-level clustering– RpoB, EmbB, KatG, InhA, PncA, GyrA, RsmG (GidB), EthA, and Rs12. Because each of these proteins in an outlier in terms of the overall number of mutations observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), we reasoned that downsampling the number of mutations would produce controls that were more similar to the average protein in the proteome. Hence for each of the nine proteins, we generate 100 positive control examples by downsampling the number of mutations observed while keeping the same relative probabilities of mutations at each site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Methods), thus preserving the signal for clustering while forcing their total number of mutations to be similar to that observed across all proteins in the proteome. We generated negative controls for the same nine proteins by simulating mutations from a uniform distribution across all residues, setting the mutation rate to the mean per-site mutation rate across the proteome, and generating 100 negative controls per protein. We find the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to have the highest discrimination between positive and negative controls (95% precision, 68% recall, at significance level <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).</p>

</fig>
<p>We assay whether all proteins known to cause antibiotic resistance demonstrate mutational clustering, using the WHO catalog of resistance-conferring mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The majority of proteins with Tier-1 resistance conferring mutations (8 of 12, 67%) demonstrate significant clustering. The four proteins without clustering include TlyA and RplC, in which there is only one non-synonymous substitution known to confer resistance, and MmpR5 a transcriptional regular protein involved in resistance to the newly administered drug bedaquiline. The fourth protein is RpsL (RS12_MYCTU), whose G-score is driven by just two highly mutated residue positions, K43 and K88 (Supplementary Figure S1). In a small protein such as RpsL (124 amino acids), having two highly mutated residues close in 3D structure occurs with some frequency in the negative control examples.</p>
<p>For 90.6% (452 of 499) of the significant hits, the top G-score pair of residues are within 15 Ångstroms in 3-D space, confirming that the identified clusters are in a single location within the protein. Proteins with a high number of mutations that are not spatially clustered are not significant hits. This includes Cas10, which has 1861 independent mutation events, 1489 of which occur in the same amino acid position.</p>
<p>We perform a Gene Ontology Enrichment analysis on the 452 hits with a close proximity top pair to understand their possible functional implications (Methods). After removing the less specific gene categories (with &gt;20 genes), 54 GO categories are significantly enriched (FDR &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The most enriched categories by fold change (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Data 6) are regulation of fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis; UDP-N-acetylglucosamine/amino sugar metabolic processes; entry of bacterium into host; protein maturation; DNA topological change; and energy-coupled proton transport. We find clustering in the DNA topological change proteins GyrA and GyrB, both known to confer resistance to fluoroquinolones, and Top1, DNA topoisomerase I, which is not known to be associated with resistance.</p>
<p>A second notable GO category is composed primarily of the Pkn family of protein kinases – PknA, PknB, PknD, PknE, and PknH – thought to negatively regulate fatty acid biosynthesis. Data supports that PknA, PknB, and PknH have a role in intrinsic drug resistance, potentially through post-translational modification of proteins involved in cell wall synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> For all of the Pkn proteins found by our clustering score, the region of significant clustering is not the protein kinase domain but instead in other functional domains of the protein.

<title>Structure supports the prediction of resistance-conferring variants</title>
<p>Given that most drug resistance genes demonstrate 3-D mutational clustering, as detailed above, we tested if structural proximity to known mutations carries information on the functional impact of new mutations on phenotype. We use a previously compiled catalogue of resistance-associated mutations from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> consisting of 583 unique non-synonymous protein-coding variants annotated as associated with resistance (R-assoc) and 58 as not associated and isolates carrying only these mutation are antibiotic susceptible (S-assoc) (Methods, Supplementary Data 7)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We ask whether protein structure information is useful at distinguishing resistance-conferring variants. In addition to the G-score computed using the homoplasy data from the ∼31,000 isolate dataset, we compute the distance in 3D between any variant and the nearest resistance-conferring variant in that protein from the catalogue. We benchmark both metrics against distance in 1D (on the protein sequence). We trained a logistic regression classifier to predict whether a mutation is resistance associated (R-assoc, <italic>vs</italic>. S-assoc, susceptibility associated), using a 70-30 train-test split of the cataloged mutations. 3D structural proximity alone best predicted resistance association (F1 score of 94.6%, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Methods). Prediction from 1D proximity alone is less accurate at F1 of 92.8%, and prediction from G-score had the lowest F1 at 80.8%. The relatively strong performance of 1D proximity prediction is due to the fact that most, but not all, mutations in our dataset that have close 3D proximity to a mutated residue also have close 1D proximity.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>While the G-sore prediction has the lowest F1 score and sensitivity, it has the highest precision (98.3%). This may be because the G-score is a combination of structural information and mutational information, as a residue will only have a high G-score if it is proximal to at least one residue with a high number of mutations (presumably due to being causal of resistance).</p>
<p>This means that the G-score model is more conservative at calling R-assoc variants as truly R-assoc.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper, we demonstrate that mutations cluster in three dimensions in the structure of proteins known to confer antibiotic resistance, through a novel application of the Getis-Ord statistic to evolutionary sequence data from clinical tuberculosis isolates. We apply our method to all proteins in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv proteome, using homoplasy data generated from a dataset of over 30,000 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> complex isolates. We find significant clustering of mutations in over 450 proteins, including eight known resistance-conferring proteins, and in pathways thought to be important for pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>We observe spatial clustering of mutations in known resistance-conferring proteins. For proteins like RpoB, where mutations are known to cluster in the rifampicin binding site, this serves as an internal control for our method. However, for proteins where mutations that lead to loss of function are known to cause resistance, such as PncA and RsmG (GidB), it is not expected to find clustering of mutations. We suspect that the observed clustering is due to mutations in a certain region of the protein being more likely to cause loss of function.</p>
<p>When running our analysis on the entire proteome, we find a significant enrichment for hits in proteins involved in regulation of fatty acid biosynthetic processes, and in amino sugar metabolism. Both of these pathways are related to cell envelope synthesis, which may be a response to antibiotic pressure or an adaptation to host environments. We also find hits to the proteins MycP1, P2, and P3, which are secreted from the cell and thought to be involved in host cell entry. We chose to apply our approach to homoplasy data, not allele frequency data, to ensure that we were not biased to overweight more ancient mutations in our analysis. Thus, we believe significant Getis-Ord score clustering indicates protein hotspots of positive and/or diversifying selection, where <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is adapting to antibiotic pressure and host environments.</p>
<p>Our variant effect prediction results support that structural information is a meaningful feature for predicting whether specific genetic variants confer antibiotic resistance. This is a promising result, as recent efforts in machine learning on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> sequence data have suggested that our ability to predict antibiotic resistance from sequence alone may be reaching a plateau, and that more data and different data modalities, not more innovative model architectures, are needed in order to further improve predictions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> While we do not suggest that our current model be used in clinical settings, we envision structure being added as an additional feature in future work to predict resistance phenotypes from sequences.</p>
<p>One drawback of our approach is that our random shuffling procedure implicitly assumes that all sites in a protein are equally likely to mutate. This may pose a problem for proteins with conserved hydrophobic cores, or multidomain proteins where one domain is more conserved than the other, which could manifest in apparent higher or lower rates of mutation in one region of the protein. We account for this bias when we compute the distance between the top-scoring pair of residues in each protein, finding that for over 90% of the proteomic hits, those two residues are within 15 Ångstroms of one another, indicating that the patch of high scoring residues are in a single location on the protein, not spread throughout a surface or domain. However, we cannot entirely rule out the effects of differing mutation rates throughout a protein.</p>
<p>The research community has long sought to determine the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, using both supervised methods that rely on labelled data, and unsupervised methods that seek to find patterns of positive selection indicative of antibiotic resistance. The availability of predicted protein structures has opened a new avenue for understanding the effects of mutations in microbial genomes, and in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> specifically. We hypothesize that protein structural proximity is a useful feature because it captures how likely any given pair of mutations are to have a similar phenotypic effect – mutations in the same functional regions of proteins are more likely to cause the same effect. We show that protein 3D structure can be used to improve classification of resistance-conferring variants in a supervised framework, and used in an unsupervised fashion to discover targets of positive selection in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genome.</p>

<title>Computing the Getis-Ord score for clustering of homoplastic mutations</title>

<title>Preparing GeO score calibration data</title>
<p>We sought to generate a dataset of positive controls – proteins known to have clustering of mutations – with a frequency of mutation similar to the average protein in our dataset (mean of 1.4 mutations per site). For this, we used the nine proteins known to be involved in antibiotic resistance with demonstrated clustering of mutations (RpoB, EmbB, KatG, InhA, PncA, GyrA, RsmG (GidB), EthA, and Rs12). For each of these nine proteins, we generate 100 positive control examples.</p>
<p>Because the total number of mutations in a site, as well as the 3D configuration of sites, contributes to the G-score, we chose to downsample these proteins to generate positive controls that are more similar to other proteins in the total number of mutations. To generate positive control examples, we build an empirical distribution based on the observed number of mutations per site in the protein, divided by the total mutations. We add a pseudocount of one to all residues with zero mutations. We then sample M mutations from the empirical mutation distribution, where M = 0.42 times the number of residues in the protein with structure data, because each site is mutated on average 0.42 times. This sampling strategy preserves the relative frequencies of each mutation, and their 3D location, while greatly reducing the number of total mutations observed in a protein. We generate the negative controls by sampling from a uniform distribution over all residues in a protein with structure data.</p>
<p>Then, we build a heuristic based on the Getis-Ord score to determine if we observe significant clustering in a protein. For each control example, we perform 10,000 random permutations of the mutations, shuffling their configuration in space but keeping the number of mutation events the same. For positive controls, we expect the real configuration of mutations to produce a significantly different configuration of G scores than random permutations. For negative controls, we do not expect the real configuration of mutations to produce a significantly different configuration of G scores than random permutations.</p>
<p>Next, for each generated control, we test the ability of various scores to distinguish between the real example and a random reshuffling. By comparing the true distribution with the empirical random distribution, we compute a p-value for whether the overall distribution of Getis-Ord statistics for residues in the protein is different than the one expected by chance. We compare six scores on the basis of their precision recall curves for recovering the positive controls. The first three scores are based on comparing the p-value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test when comparing the real distribution to 10,000 random shuffles: the number of significant p-values (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), the smallest p-value, and the mean p-value. The other two features are based on the raw G-score for the real distribution vs. the 10,000 random shuffles: how often the max G-score is greater for the real distribution, and how often the median G-score is greater for the real distribution.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study leverages a large global dataset of tens of thousands of tuberculosis samples to place recurrent protein-coding mutations into their three-dimensional structural context, offering an expanded view of how antibiotic resistance emerges compared to traditional genetic analyses alone. The strength of evidence is <bold>convincing</bold>, supported by the scale and breadth of the dataset and the systematic structural analysis, although some of the assumptions made in the the modeling approach are only partially supported. Overall, the work will be of broad interest to researchers studying microbial evolution, antibiotic resistance, and structure-function relationships in pathogens.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Green et al. attempt to use large-scale protein structure analysis to find signals of selection and clustering related to antibiotic resistance. This was applied to the whole proteome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with a specific focus on the smaller set of known antibiotic-resistance-related proteins.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of geospatial analysis to detect signals of selection and clustering on the structural level is really intriguing. This could have a wider use beyond the AMR-focussed work here and could be applied to a more general evolutionary analysis context. Much of the strength of this work lies in breaking ground into this structural evolution space, something rarely seen in such pathogen data. Additional further research can be done to build on this foundation, and the work presented here will be important for the field.</p>
<p>The size of the dataset and use of protein structure prediction via AlphaFold, giving such a consistent signal within the dataset, is also of great interest and shows the power of these approaches to allow us to integrate protein structure more confidently into evolution and selection analyses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several issues with the evolutionary analysis and assumptions made in the paper, which perhaps overstate the findings, or require refining to take into account other factors that may be at play.</p>
<p>(1) The focus on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) throughout the paper contains the findings within that lens. This results in a few different weaknesses:</p>
<p>(a) While the large size of the analysis is highlighted in the abstract and elsewhere, in reality, only a few proteins are studied in depth. These are proteins already associated with AMR by many other studies, somewhat retreading old ground and reducing the novelty.</p>
<p>(b) Beyond the AMR-associated proteins, the proteome work is of great interest, but only casually interrogated and only in the context of AMR. There appears to be an assumption that all signals of positive selection detected are related to AMR, whereas something like cas10 is part of the CRISPR machinery, a set of proteins often under positive selection, and thus unlikely to be AMR-related.</p>
<p>(2) The strength of the signal from the structural information and the novelty of the structural incorporation into prediction are perhaps overstated.</p>
<p>(a) A drop of 13% in F1 for a gain of 2% in PPV is quite the trade-off. This is not as indicative of a strong predictor that could be used as the abstract claims. While the approach is novel and this is a good finding for a first attempt at such complex analysis, this is perhaps not as significant as the authors claim</p>
<p>(b) In relation to this, there is a lack of situating these findings within the wider research landscape. For instance, the use of structure for predicting resistance has been done, for example, in PncA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/jacamr/article/6/2/dlae037/7630603">https://academic.oup.com/jacamr/article/6/2/dlae037/7630603</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476927125003664">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476927125003664</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-58635-x">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-58635-x</ext-link>) and in RpoB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74648-y">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74648-y</ext-link>). These, and other such works, should be acknowledged as the novelty of this work is perhaps not as stark as the authors present it to be.</p>
<p>(3) The authors postulate that neutral AA substitutions would be randomly distributed in the protein structure and thus use random mutations as a negative control to simulate this neutral evolution. However, I am unsure if this is a true negative control for neutral evolution. The vast majority of residues would be under purifying selection, not neutral selection, especially in core proteins like rpoB and gyrA. Therefore, most of these residues would never be mutated in a real-world dataset. Therefore, you are not testing positive selection against neutral selection; you are testing positive against purifying, which will have a much stronger signal. This is likely to, in turn, overestimate the signal of positive selection. This would be better accounted for using a model of neutral evolution, although this is complex and perhaps outside the scope. Still, it needs to be made clear that these negative controls are not representative of neutral evolution.</p>
<p>(4) In a similar vein, the use of 15 Å as a cut-off for stating co-localisation feels quite arbitrary. The average radius of a globular protein is about 20 Å, so this could be quite a large patch of a protein. I think it may be good to situate the cut-off for a 'single location' within a size estimator of the entire protein, as 15 Å could be a neighbourhood in a large protein, but be the whole protein for smaller ones.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an important study that, for the first time, systematically places the homoplastic genetic variation observed in the coding regions in a large collection of &gt;31,000 M. tuberculosis samples into the protein structural context. This should be much more informative when, e.g. predicting antimicrobial resistance. The authors imaginatively apply the Getis-Ord score, which originated in geographical spatial analysis but has also been used in human disease to demonstrate that missense mutations in M. tuberculosis known to be associated with antimicrobial resistance are clustered in space. That they are able to consider almost all of the proteome using a large dataset of 31,000 M. tuberculosis complex clinical samples, which makes the evidence convincing.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>To my knowledge, this is the first study to place the homoplastic missense mutations from a large clinical dataset into their protein structural context and attempt to look for clustering in space, which could be indicative of a recent evolutionary pressure, such as the use of antibiotics. The field usually only views resistance through the genetic paradigm, so it is delightful to see a structural paradigm being brought to bear, as this should, in theory, be much more informative, as protein structure is much closer to function. In addition, the dataset used is large (&gt;31,000 clinical M. tuberculosis samples), and the authors are able to consider almost all of the ORFs (3,687/3,996) in the M. tuberculosis reference, and hence the analysis is comprehensive.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is not apparent at the time of this review if the study could be reproduced by other researchers as e.g. whilst the authors state that the raw sequencing files (FASTQ) underpinning the dataset of 31,428 M. tuberculosis isolates can be downloaded the table in the Supplement containing the sample and accession identifiers contains rows that do not contain NCBI accessions e.g. '01R0685' or 'IDR 1600023875' or '1479144813357T181715lib5022nextseqn0035151bp' instead of the expected form e.g. 'SAMEA1016138'. I have searched the NCBI SRA using these terms and got no results, so they cannot be used to download any FASTQ files. There is also no information in the preprint on how the reads were processed (which is a complex process) and the dataset of SNPs subsequently built. One can trace back through the references, but I cannot find anywhere where one can download the SNP dataset, which would permit researchers to reproduce at least the latter stages of the work -- one obvious option would be to make the SNP dataset available. Likewise, the authors have constructed a &quot;M. tuberculosis structureome&quot;, which would be very useful for the community but does not appear to be publicly available. At the time of the review, not all the GitHub repositories were public, so these points may have been rectified when that was corrected.</p>
<p>The authors correctly point out in the Introduction that supervised methods like GWAS or ML need datasets with matching genetic and phenotypic drug susceptibility data, which are much difficult/expensive to obtain, but don't then close the loop by comparing their results back to such supervised methods. They pick out RnJ as having previously been identified by a GWAS, but it would have provided a useful validation of their method to e.g. demonstrating that X% of the genes they identify were also identified by GWAS/ML studies, and therefore their method can achieve similar results but without having to collect pDST data.</p>
<p>Whilst the authors acknowledge that assuming all sites are equally likely to mutate in their random shuffling procedure is a shortcoming, a bigger weakness is, I suspect, that one should also only consider which amino acids could arise at each codon due to a SNP. Shuffling assumes any amino acid can arise at any codon which is only possible with multiple nucleotide changes, which is possible but highly unlikely.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors implicitly assume that the mutations do not perturb the structure of the proteins, which is likely to be generally true for essential genes but less likely to be true for non-essential genes. This assumption underpins their entire approach and should be borne in mind when evaluating the results.</p>
