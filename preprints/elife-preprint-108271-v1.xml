<title>Abstract</title><p>Ciliogenesis is a highly ordered process that requires membrane trafficking, fusion, and maturation. In this study, we investigated EXOC6A, a component of the exocyst complex known for secretory vesicle trafficking and fusion, and found that it interacts with myosin-Va (Myo-Va) during ciliogenesis. EXOC6A colocalizes with Myo-Va at various stages of ciliogenesis, including preciliary vesicles, ciliary vesicles (CVs), and ciliary sheath membrane during ciliogenesis. We found that EXOC6A vesicles are actively recruited, integrated, and exit from the CVs and the ciliary sheath, implying that EXOC6A vesicles may facilitate continuous cilia membrane remodeling during ciliogenesis. Importantly, EXOC6A knockout impairs ciliogenesis, arresting most cells at the CV stage and preventing recruitment of NPHP and MKS module components to the transition zone. Furthermore, EXOC6A vesicles are transported to the mother centriole via a dynein-, microtubule-, and actin-dependent mechanism. Our results suggest that EXOC6A functions in both early and late stages of ciliogenesis and is involved in orchestrating vesicle dynamics, cilia membrane remodeling, and formation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most mammalian cells build primary cilia, which act as chemosensors or mechanosensors and as transducers that regulate key developmental signaling pathways. Primary cilia are composed of nine doublet microtubules arranged in a ring and surrounded by a ciliary membrane that is continuous with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dawe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>). Primary cilia protrude from the cell surface to perform a wide range of biological functions. Defects in ciliogenesis can lead to a number of genetic disorders known as ciliopathies, which are characterized by loss of vision, disturbed kidney function, obesity, and defects in brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sattar and Gleeson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Valente et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Ciliogenesis is a highly ordered and complex process. Currently, two distinct pathways have been reported, with different cell types involved: intracellular and extracellular. Polarized epithelial cells use the extracellular pathway, whereas fibroblasts and mesenchymal cells use the intracellular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Breslow and Holland, 2019</xref>). In the intracellular pathway, myosin-Va (Myo-Va) facilitates the transportation of preciliary vesicles (PCVs) to the distal appendages (DAs) of the M-centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). These PCVs may be derived from the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>) and subsequently fuse with a ciliary vesicle (CV) through the action of membrane fusion regulators EHD1 and EHD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lu et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>This step is critical for the conversion of the mother centriole into a basal body, which is responsible for removing the centriole cap protein, CP110, and recruiting ciliary transition zone (TZ) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). As a result, an axoneme extends within the larger CV, which gradually stretches out to form the double membranes of the ciliary shaft and sheath that surround the extending axoneme. Finally, the ciliary sheath (the outer membrane) fuses with the plasma membrane and the axoneme, enveloped by the ciliary shaft membrane, extends from the cell membrane, and makes contact with the extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ghossoub et al., 2011</xref>). A signaling cascade including RAB11, RABIN8, and RAB8 has also been reported to regulate the ciliary membrane assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chiba et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Knödler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yoshimura et al., 2007</xref>). However, the processes of formation of the ciliary sheath and ciliary shaft membrane during ciliogenesis remain unclear.</p>
<p>The exocyst is a multi-subunit protein complex that was first identified in yeast, which mediates the tethering of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mei and Guo, 2018</xref>). The complex is composed of eight subunits, named Sec (for secretion; Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84) in yeast or Exoc (for exocyst-related; EXOC1 to 8) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">TerBush et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">TerBush and Novick, 1995</xref>). The exocyst complex is implicated in various cellular processes, including exocytosis, ciliogenesis, cytokinesis, autophagy, cell polarity, migration, tumorigenesis, and fusion of secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mei and Guo, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutations in genes encoding components of the exocyst complex have been associated with various human genetic disorders. For example, a mutation in <italic>EXOC8</italic> has been identified in Joubert syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dixon-Salazar et al., 2012</xref>), while a mutation in <italic>EXOC4</italic> has been reported in Meckel–Gruber syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>). Both of these disorders involve clinically and genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy. Additionally, mutations in <italic>EXOC2</italic> cause severe defects in human brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Van Bergen et al., 2020</xref>), while mutations in <italic>EXOC7</italic> and <italic>EXOC8</italic> result in a novel disorder of cerebral cortex development, characterized by brain atrophy, seizures, developmental delay, and microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Coulter et al., 2020</xref>). However, the essential roles of these genes in ciliogenesis and their correlation with human genetic disorders are currently unknown.</p>
<p>It has been reported that some components of the exocyst complex are involved in ciliogenesis. For example, Sec10 (EXOC5) was shown to be required for ciliogenesis and cyst formation in vitro, and Sec10 knockdown leads to reduce ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zuo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zuo et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, other subunits such as EXOC3 and EXOC4 have been detected at the cilium with unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Seixas et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, depletion of Sec8, Exo70, or Sec10 does not impair ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rivera-Molina et al., 2021</xref>), whereas knockdown of Sec15a (EXOC6A) significantly perturbs ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rivera-Molina et al., 2021</xref>). These findings imply that different exocyst subunits may have distinct, non-redundant functions during ciliogenesis. However, the precise localization of EXOC6A within cilia and its specific role in regulating ciliary membrane formation or trafficking events remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>Previously, we demonstrated that the earliest event in ciliogenesis is the transportation of PCVs by Myo-Va to the distal appendages of the M-centriole, and we showed that Myo-Va is released from the ciliary membrane upon fusion of the ciliary sheath with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). However, the mechanism of the assembly of double ciliary membranes (ciliary sheath and shaft) during intracellular ciliogenesis was left unknown. In this study, we provide evidence that the exocyst component EXOC6A interacts with Myo-Va and plays an essential role in ciliary membrane assembly at different stages during ciliogenesis.</p>

<title>Colocalization patterns of EXOC6A and Myo-Va at preciliary vesicles, ciliary vesicles, and ciliary sheath during intracellular ciliogenesis</title>
<p>To investigate the localization of EXOC6A during ciliogenesis, we treated retinal pigment epithelial (RPE1)-based mCherry-tagged Myo-Va cargo binding domain (Myo-Va-GTD)-inducible cells with doxycycline (Dox) for 24 h and then serum starved them for 2h to induce ciliogenesis. We used antibodies against endogenous EXOC6A and glutamylated tubulin (Glu-tub), a marker of centrioles and ciliary axoneme, for confocal immunofluorescence analysis. Our results showed that the EXOC6A signal was mainly detected as a dot-shaped structure resembling a ciliary vesicle (CV) at the distal end of the M-centriole (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, left), while some EXOC6A signals appeared to be colocalized with mCherry-tagged Myo-Va-GTD at the ciliary membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. right). To determine the subcellular localization of EXOC6A, we performed immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against CEP164 (a distal appendage marker, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Graser et al., 2007</xref>)) and CEP120 (a centriole marker, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lin et al., 2013</xref>)). The PCV/CV/ciliary sheath can be visualized with mCherry-tagged Myo-Va-GTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). The cells were then analyzed using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) or ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Our results showed that EXOC6A signals colocalized with mCherry-Myo-Va-GTD at CV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B and C</xref>). To further define the position of the EXOC6A signal, we performed correlative fluorescence light and electron microscopy (CFLEM) in RPE1-based GFP-EXOC6A-inducible cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Our CFLEM results showed that the GFP-EXOC6A signals appeared to localize at PCVs (or vesicles), CVs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-i-ii</xref>), and the elongating ciliary membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-iii-iv</xref>).</p>

<p>To precisely analyze the subcellular localization of EXOC6A and Myo-Va during the formation of the ciliary sheath and the shaft membrane, we used 3D-SIM to analyze the RPE1 cells that exogenously express inducible GFP-EXOC6A using known markers combined for the ciliary sheath (Myo-Va-GTD; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>)), the ciliary shaft (ARL13B, INPP5E; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), and the axoneme (Glu-tub). EXOC6A signals were commonly detected at the Myo-Va-GTD-labeled ciliary sheath (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-i</xref>, ii), which surrounds the ciliary shaft membrane (labeled ARL13B and INPP5E, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-i</xref>, iii) and the axoneme (Glu-tub, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-ii, iii</xref>). Since our 3D-SIM analysis could not distinguish the spatial distances between INPP5E and the Glu-tub-labeled axoneme due to the limits of its resolution power (100–130 nm), we thus conclude that EXOC6A localizes at the ciliary sheath membrane surrounding the ciliary shaft. Altogether, our data show that EXOC6A, like Myo-Va, localizes at the PCVs, the CVs, and the ciliary sheath membrane.</p>

<title>Spatial and temporal localization of Myo-Va and EXOC6A during ciliogenesis</title>
<p>To investigate the temporal and spatial correlation between the ciliary localization of EXOC6A and Myo-Va during ciliogenesis, we used RPE1-based mCherry-Myo-Va-GTD-inducible cells that were serum starved, released at different time points, and analyzed using 3D-SIM with antibodies against endogenous EXOC6A and Glu-tub (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We identified five different phenotypes based on the immunostaining patterns of Myo-Va and EXOC6A during cilium assembly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), which are quantified in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>. Before serum starvation, a number of EXOC6A-associated vesicles were detected close to the M-centriole (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 0 min, type 1). During the progression of serum starvation, EXOC6A-associated vesicles appeared to gradually accumulate near the M-centriole (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 15 min, type 2) in a process we called “clustering-to-centriole,” and subsequently, EXOC6A signals were mainly detected at the Myo-Va-labeled CVs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 30 min–1 h, type 3) and the ciliary sheath membrane, surrounding the Glu-tub-labeled axoneme (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 2 h, type 4). In some cells, a tubule-like structure (EXOC6A<sup>+</sup>/Myo-Va<sup>+</sup>) linked to the ciliary sheath membrane was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 4 h, white arrow). Finally, both EXOC6A and Myo-Va were released from the ciliary sheath membrane when it fused to the plasma membrane, while the Glu-tub-labeled axoneme continued to protrude into the extracellular milieu (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 24 h, type 5). Interestingly, we observed that only a portion, but not all of the EXOC6A-labeled vesicles colocalized with Myo-Va-labeled PCVs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 0 and 15 min). However, once the CVs formed, both EXOC6A and Myo-Va-GTD signals were detected at the CVs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 30 min, 45 min, and 1 h). We present a schematic model in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> that shows the localization of EXOC6A (green) and mCherry-Myo-Va-GTD (red) during ciliogenesis and the types of immunostaining patterns.</p>

<p>To further understand the relationship between the clustering-to-centriole progression of EXOC6A and Myo-Va during the early stage of ciliogenesis, we analyzed the intensity of both proteins clustering to the centrioles and calculated their overlapping co-efficiency correlation R (Pearson correlation coefficient) using Zeiss Zen software (Fig. S1). We observed a gradual increase in the mean intensity of EXOC6A and Myo-Va clustering to the centrioles from 0 to 30 min (Fig. S1A–C). Additionally, the correlation R between EXOC6A and Myo-Va significantly increased from 0 to 30 min (Fig. S1D). These results suggest a high correlation between Myo-Va-labeled vesicles and EXOC6A-labeled vesicles during the progression of clustering-to-centriole.</p>

<title>FRAP analysis of the dynamic localization of Myo-Va- and EXOC6A-labeled vesicles during ciliogenesis</title>
<p>We found that some EXOC6A labels had a tubule-like structure extending from the ciliary sheath (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 4 h, type 4), suggesting the dynamic assembly of the ciliary membrane during ciliogenesis. To gain further insights into the dynamic relationship between Myo-Va- and EXOC6A-labeled vesicles during early CV formation and the later sheath membrane assembly stage, we performed live cell imaging with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). FRAP is a widely used technique to measure the dynamics of ciliary membrane protein localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>). After photobleaching at CVs or the ciliary sheath region, the EXOC6A signals were recurrently recruited to the CVs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, Movie 1) and the ciliary sheath membrane immediately (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, Movie 2). Together, our data indicated that the EXOC6A-labeled vesicles are continuously recruited to and fused with the ciliary membrane not only at the CVs but also at the ciliary sheath. To further investigate the dynamic properties of the ciliary membrane, we performed live-cell super-resolution imaging using the ELYRA 7 SIM system. We used SiR-tubulin, a fluorescent probe derived from the microtubule-stabilizing drug docetaxel, to label endogenous microtubules. This allowed us to visualize the structure of centrioles and axonemes during ciliogenesis in live imaging experiments (Fig. S2). Our results show that EXOC6A co-localizes with Myo-Va-GTD on the ciliary membrane and surrounds the SiR-tubulin-labeled axoneme (Fig. S2A and S2B). In addition, we detected a dynamic tubule-like structure that extended and retracted from the ciliary membrane (Fig. S2A, S2C, and Movie 3). To better observe vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics, we used the single-channel and burst modes of the ELYRA 7 SIM system to achieve higher temporal resolution in live imaging. Our results showed that GFP-EXOC6A-labeled vesicles gradually moved to and fused with CVs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, white arrow; Movie 4) and the ciliary pocket, a membrane domain found at the base of primary cilia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, white arrow, Movie 5). Interestingly, almost at the same time, some GFP-EXOC6A-labeled vesicles were fused with or secreted from the ciliary pocket (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, red arrow, Movie 5). Unexpectedly, we observed that some GFP-EXOC6A-associated tubular structures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, yellow arrow) or GFP-EXOC6A-labeled vesicles were released directly from the ciliary membrane rather than from the ciliary pocket (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, orange arrow). Together, our results indicate that GFP-EXOC6A-associated vesicles/membranes are highly dynamic and continuously recruited to and/or released from CVs during the early stages of ciliogenesis, and that they are also fused with or excreted from the ciliary membrane during later stages of ciliogenesis. We, therefore, propose that EXOC6A vesicles are responsible for the exchange of materials within existing CVs and the ciliary sheath during ciliogenesis, facilitating the addition or removal of membranes or membrane proteins.</p>

<p>EHD1 was reported to be essential for the fusion of PCVs to form larger CVs during the early stage of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). To investigate the sequential order of EHD1- and EXOC6A-mediated ciliary membrane assembly, we depleted EHD1 expression using siRNA in RPE1 cells. Our results showed that EHD1 depletion led to a reduction in the formation of EXOC6A-labeled CVs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO did not appear to affect EHD1-mediated fusion of PCVs to form a large EHD1-labeled CV at the M-centriole (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Together, our findings suggest that EHD1 is required for EXOC6A-labeled CV formation, while EXOC6A is not essential for the formation of EHD1-labeled CVs</p>
<p>Additionally, previous studies reported that Myo2p, the yeast homolog of human Myo-Va, interacts with sec15, the yeast homolog of human EXOC6A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jin et al., 2011</xref>). The present study showed that some, but not all of the EXOC6A-labeled PCVs colocalized with Myo-Va-labeled PCVs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 0 and 15 min). We speculate that Myo-Va may transport some EXOC6A-labeled vesicles to the CVs for ciliary membrane assembly. Our co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that endogenous EXOC6A can co-immunoprecipitate with Myo-Va, supporting this hypothesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, previous studies have indicated that the removal of centriolar protein CP110 from the distal end of the M-centriole is necessary for axoneme growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>). It has been proposed that CP110 removal occurs after the docking of CV to the DA of the M-centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate the impact of EXOC6A loss on CP110 removal, we examined CP110 localization in <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells. Our results showed that CP110 is appropriately removed from the distal end of the M-centriole in <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells, indicating that EXOC6A is not required for this process (Fig. S3), which further support that EXOC6A is not essential for CV formation. Taken together, our findings suggest that Myo-Va transports a subset of EXOC6A-labeled vesicles to the existing CVs of the M-centriole for ciliary membrane assembly. However, EXOC6A is not essential for CV formation.</p>

<title>Transportation of EXOC6A-labeled vesicles to the M-centriole is via a dynein-, MT-, and Arp2/3-dependent pathway</title>
<p>Our previous study showed that the transportation of PCVs to the distal appendages of the M-centriole is mediated by Myo-Va, dynein, microtubules (MTs), and the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). In the current study, we found that Myo-Va and EHD1 are required for EXOC6A-labeled CV formation and that Myo-Va co-immunoprecipitates with EXOC6A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). It has been reported that dynein is necessary for the correct positioning of the Golgi complex near the centrosome upon serum starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Palmer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), and that the inhibition of dynein activity with ciliobrevin D suppresses ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether the transport of EXOC6A-associated vesicles to the DA of the M-centriole also requires dynein, MTs, and the Arp2/3 complex.</p>
<p>RPE1 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting Golgin160, a protein required for the recruitment of dynein to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yadav et al., 2012</xref>), or treated with ciliobrevin D, a known cytoplasmic motor dynein inhibitor that suppresses ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>), following the protocol described in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>. Our findings showed that depletion of Golgin160 led to a decrease in EXOC6A-labeled CV signals at or near the M-centriole (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, D</xref>) and resulted in the dispersion of Golgi matrix protein 130 (GM-130)-labeled Golgi complexes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, E</xref>), ultimately leading to a reduction in the total number of cilia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Similar results were also observed in RPE1 cells treated with ciliobrevin D (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-i</xref>, D–F). We next treated RPE1 cells with nocodazole (NZ, an MT-depolymerizing drug) and examined its effect on ciliogenesis. Our results showed that the EXOC6A-labeled CVs and the cilia number are greatly reduced in NZ-treated cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-ii, D, and F</xref>). These data suggest that some EXOC6A-labeled vesicles originate from Golgi, and the transportation of EXOC6A-associated vesicles to the M-centriole requires dynein and microtubules.</p>

<p>Since Myo-Va-mediated transport of PCVs to the M-centrioles relies on an Arp2/3-dependent branched actin network surrounding M-centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), we next treated RPE1 cells with siARP2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). A reduced cilia number (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G and H</xref>) and reduced EXOC-6A-labeled CVs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G and I</xref>) were observed in siARP2-treated cells. A similar result was also found in cells treated with CK666 (a known specific Arp2/3 inhibitor) or high-dose (10 μM) cytochalasin D (CytoD), which has been reported to reduce the association of ARP2 with the branched actin network (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H–J</xref>). It has been reported that low concentrations (100 nM-1 μM) of CytoD can promote ciliogenesis and increase cilia length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), while high concentrations (10 μm) lead to a significant inhibition of cilia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). To further investigate the dose-dependent effects of actin cytoskeleton rearrangement on ciliogenesis, we treated RPE1 cells with CytoD at concentrations ranging from 200 nM to 10 μM. Immunofluorescence staining of cilia using ARL13B (green) and Glu-tubulin (red) antibodies showed that low concentrations of CytoD (200 nM–2 μM) resulted in significant cilia elongation, whereas higher doses (4 μM, 7μM and 10μM) gradually inhibited cilia formation (Fig. S4). Consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), our data showed that cilia length and cilia ratio increased at low doses of CytoD (200 nM-2 μM) but gradually decreased with increasing doses (7 μM and 10 μM, Fig. S4B, S4C).</p>
<p>Taken together, our current studies reinforce our previous view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>) that low-dose of CytoD treatment (200 nM-2 μM) can stabilize and/or enhance the formation of Arp2-associated branched actin filaments. However when cells were treated with high doses of CytoD (7 μM and 10 μM, Fig. S4) or the specific Arp2/3 inhibitor, CK-666 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), the association of Arp2 with the branched actin network was significantly reduced, thereby inhibiting ciliogenesis. In conclusion, our data suggest that Myo-Va carries EXOC6A vesicles to the DA of mother centriole via a dynein-, microtubule-, and actin-dependent pathway.</p>

<title>Loss of EXOC6A inhibits ciliogenesis, and some cells exhibit abnormal ciliary morphology when passing through the CV block</title>
<p>We found that EXOC6A signals are detected at CVs and the ciliary sheath (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Interestingly, most Myo-Va-GTD signals in <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells were present as dotted CVs after longer starvation (SS 48 h), suggesting that ciliogenesis is arrested at the CV stage (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, lower panel).</p>

<p>We next used an antibody against ARL13B (a cilia shaft marker) to label the ciliary membrane and found that most <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells exhibited no cilia (∼45%, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) or dotted ARL13B signals (∼50%) 2 h after SS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, lower panel, SS 2 h), a pattern similar to Myo-Va staining (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, lower panel). Unexpectedly, after prolonged serum starvation, we could still detect approximately ∼15% (SS 24 h) to ∼30% (SS 48 h) of <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells carrying ARL13B-labeled cilia protruding from the basal body. However, these ARL13B-labeled cilia showed a low intensity of ARL13B and Glu-tub signals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D and E</xref>) and the ARL13B-labeled cilia membrane exhibited a fragmented and punctuated staining pattern (enhanced in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, SS 48 h in lower panel). Our findings suggest that EXOC6A may play a crucial role in the further maturation of CVs into the ciliary sheath/shaft membrane during ciliogenesis.</p>
<p>To examine whether EXOC6A is required for ciliogenesis and whether its function can be rescued, we analyzed cilia formation in wild-type (WT), EXOC6A KO, and EXOC6A KO cells exogenously expressing GFP-EXOC6A. Immunofluorescence staining of cells with ARL13B and Glu-tubulin antibodies showed a significant reduction in the number of cilia in EXOC6A KO cells, while exogenous expression of GFP-EXOC6A in the KO cells can partially rescue cilia formation (Fig. S5).</p>
<p>Electron microscopy was further used to investigate the cilia morphology in the <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells after prolonged serum starvation (72 h). To examine ciliary structure in <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells in more detail, we used a 72 h-serum starvation protocol, which provided sufficient time for cilia assembly. Our results showed a perturbation in cilia assembly in <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F and G</xref>). When compared with the wild-type control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F-i</xref> and ii), cilia in <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells exhibited some ciliogenic defects, such that ciliogenesis was often arrested at the DA/PCV or CV stage (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-iii and iv</xref>), and some exhibited morphologically curved cilia bending in the TZ region (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-vi</xref>, 4/37 in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Intriguingly, a small proportion of KO cells produced an elongated large CV in the absence of an extended axoneme (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-v</xref>, 4/37 in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Consistent with this finding, curved cilia (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, SS 24 h, lower panel) and a low intensity of Glu-tub-labeled axoneme were observed in <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells via confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, SS 48 h, lower panel. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Nonetheless, we still observed 3 out of 37 morphologically normal-like cilia in <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-vii, 6G</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that depletion of EXOC6A primarily affects cells exhibiting no CV (showing only DA/PCV; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-iii</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>) and/or arrests cells at the CV stage, while once it passes through CV stage after prolonged serum starvation, it may interfere with subsequent cilia membrane formation at later stages of ciliogenesis.</p>

<title>EXOC6A is required to recruit NPHP and MKS module components, but not CEP290, to the TZ</title>
<p>Our EM study revealed both bending cilia at the TZ (4/37, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G-vi</xref>) and morphologically normal-like cilia (3/37, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G-vii</xref>). Intriguingly, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the ARL13B signal intensity was greatly reduced in the normal-like cilia membrane in <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>), suggesting a possible defect in the TZ of cilia. The TZ is a diffusion barrier at the ciliary membrane that acts as a gate to regulate the entry and exit of ciliary proteins required for signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jensen and Leroux, 2017</xref>). Previous studies have identified three conserved protein modules (MKS, NPHP, and CEP290), composed of numerous protein complexes that cooperate in the assembly and gating function of the TZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gonçalves and Pelletier, 2017</xref>). CEP290, located at a proximal position near the M-centriole, acts as a hub that interacts with the NPHP and MKS module complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Garcia-Gonzalo and Reiter, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>To verify the integrity of these abnormal cilia in <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells, we examined the recruitment of several known TZ proteins, including CEP290, NPHP, and MKS module proteins. Our results showed that the recruitment of CEP290 to the ciliary base was normal in all examined ciliated cells, indicating that EXOC6A deletion did not affect CEP290 targeting to the TZ (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). However, the recruitment of several MKS complex proteins (TCTN2, AHI1, MKS3, and MKS1) to the basal body (M-centriole) was severely impaired in <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO ciliated cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>), while NPHP8 recruitment was only partially affected (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Collectively, our findings suggest that EXOC6A is not required for CEP290 targeting to the TZ but plays an essential role in the recruitment of several NPHP and MKS module proteins to the basal body, which potentially affects the gating function of the TZ in <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cilia assembly is a complex, multistep process involving the accumulation and attachment of PCVs at the distal appendage, CV formation, and the subsequent extension of CVs into the ciliary sheath, alongside the formation of the ciliary shaft, ultimately leading to the mature cilia structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Breslow and Holland, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Long and Huang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nachury et al., 2010</xref>). Currently, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing these steps remains incomplete. Exocytosis is a process where intracellular secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, aiding in delivering integral membrane proteins to the cell surface and releasing materials into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Martin-Urdiroz et al., 2016</xref>). Human EXOC6A exhibits a high degree of similarity to the product of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae <italic>SEC15</italic> gene. In yeast, SEC15 is essential for the movement of vesicles from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bowser and Novick, 1991</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that SEC15 interacts with Myo2p (the yeast homolog of human Myo-Va) and plays a role in vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Donovan and Bretscher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Donovan and Bretscher, 2015</xref>). Recently, exocyst was found to mediate the recycling of internal cilia and depletion of EXOC6A/Sec15a, but not other exocyst components, leads to a reduction in ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rivera-Molina et al., 2021</xref>). This finding suggests that EXOC6A may have a unique function for ciliogenesis. However, the relationship and underlying mechanism between EXOC6A and Myo-Va in the context of ciliogenesis remain unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, we elucidated the role of the exocyst component EXOC6A in ciliogenesis and produced evidence for the model by which Myo-Va mediates trafficking of EXOC6A vesicles to the DA or existing CV of M-centriole in the early stages and to the ciliary membrane in the later stages of ciliogenesis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). We found that a subset of EXOC6A-positive signals colocalized with Myo-Va-labeled signals during the early phase of ciliogenesis, and that they exhibited a high correlation during clustering-to-centriole progression after initiating ciliogenesis (Fig. S1A-D). Intriguingly, not all EXOC6A-labeled signals were positive for Myo-Va (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), suggesting the presence of at least two populations of Myo-Va-labeled vesicles in cells: one that is EXOC6A+/Myo-Va+ and another that is EXOC6A-/Myo-Va+ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Ciliogenesis model and comparison between WT and <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells.</title>
<p>EXOC6A is located at the PCV/CV/ciliary sheath, and Myo-Va mediated the transportation of EXOC6A vesicles to the mother centriole via a dynein-, microtubule-, and actin-dependent pathway. EXOC6A-associated vesicles are continuously recruited and fused or excreted from the CVs or ciliary membrane. Depletion of EXOC6A impairs ciliogenesis, and most cells are arrested at the CV stage. There is a lack of MKS module proteins of the TZ in cilia with defects in <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO cells.

</fig>
<p>In this model, ciliogenesis begins shortly after serum-starvation-induced quiescence. Initially, Myo-Va mediates the transport of PCVs (EXOC6A-/Myo-Va+ and EXOC6A+/Myo-Va+ vesicles) to the DA of the mother centriole, followed by the formation of PCVs to a CV via EHD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). However, EXOC6A is not absolutely required for CV formation, as EXOC6A KO did not interfere with the formation of Myo-Va- or EHD1-labelled CV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, 4D). Once the CV is formed, the transport of EXOC6A vesicles to the existing CV in the early stages of ciliogenesis is still mediated by Myo-Va (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The above process involves a two-step transportation mechanism: initially, dynein mediates the movement of Myo-Va-associated vesicles (either EXOC6A-positive or EXOC6A-negative) towards the pericentrosomal region along microtubules (MTs) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B–F</xref>). Subsequently, Myo-Va takes over and drives these vesicles (EXOC6A-positive or -negative) from the pericentrosomal region to the DAs of the M-centriole. This process is accomplished through the utilization of the ARP2/3-associated branched actin network (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G–J</xref>). Notably, both of these Myo-Va-labeled vesicles require the function of EHD1 to form a CV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings that EHD1 depletion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) and <italic>Myo-Va</italic> KO (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) severely impaired the formation of EXOC6A-positive CVs at the M-centriole, suggest that Myo-Va and EHD1 play a role in promoting the formation of EXOC6-positive CVs during the early stages of ciliogenesis.</p>
<p>Although EXOC6A is not absolutely required for the initial CV formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, 4D), our data revealed another role of EXOC6A in the later stages of ciliogenesis. Our FRAP analysis and live cell imaging showed that a subset of EXOC6A-labeled vesicles displayed high dynamism throughout ciliogenesis, continually being recruited to, fusing into, or exited from existing CVs in the early stages and/or the ciliary membrane (or ciliary pocket) in the later stages of ciliogenesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These EXOC6A-positive vesicles, likely derived from the Golgi or recycling endocytic vesicles, are transported to the ciliary membrane (or ciliary pocket) and/or fused with/exited from the ciliary membrane in the later stages of ciliogenesis. The exocyst has been implicated in the transport of vesicles carrying ciliary proteins to the cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wu and Guo, 2015</xref>). Thus, our findings suggested a potential role of EXOC6A vesicles, which may supply or remove proteins or lipid moieties from the CVs and/or the ciliary membrane (or ciliary pocket) during ciliogenesis.</p>
<p>Additionally, our results showed that <italic>EXOC6A</italic> KO led to the majority of the cells being arrested at the CV stage or exhibiting no or few cilia (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>); only a small proportion of cilia were able to elongate, exhibiting an abnormal ciliary morphology (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, 6F). Electron microscopic analysis of these abnormal cilia revealed elongated CV (lacked axoneme, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-v</xref>,), curved cilia bending at the TZ region (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-vi</xref>), or normal-like cilia (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-vii</xref>, whose structure and membrane composition need to be further characterized). Further confocal immunofluorescence analysis revealed a curved ciliary morphology (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, SS24h) and impaired recruitment of several known TZ proteins, including TCTN2, AHI1, MKS3, and MKS1, to the basal body in EXOC6A KO cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest that EXOC6A is required for the early and the later stages of ciliogenesis as providing or removing ciliary components (proteins or membrane moieties) to the existing CV or ciliary membrane, which highlights its multifaceted involvement in the process of ciliary membrane formation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Rab11–Rabin8–Rab8 signaling pathway, which involves the recruitment of Rabin8 (a GDP–GTP exchange factor for Rab8) and subsequent activation of Rab8, has been implicated in ciliary membrane assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Knödler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yoshimura et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, RAB34, located at the ciliary sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ganga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stuck et al., 2021</xref>), was also reported to be required for ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). The relationship between EXOC6A, Rab11 signaling, and RAB34 in ciliogenesis is not clear. Future experiments dissecting the underlying mechanisms between Rab11 signaling, RAB34, and EXOC6A could provide a more complete picture of ciliary membrane assembly during ciliogenesis.</p>
<p>Finally, ciliopathy-associated genes have been demonstrated to impact various stages of mouse cortical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guo et al., 2015</xref>), and severe human ciliopathies are linked to developmental abnormalities in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andreu-Cervera et al., 2021</xref>). Mutations or deletions in genes encoding exocyst proteins, including <italic>EXOC2</italic>, <italic>EXOC4</italic>, <italic>EXOC7</italic>, and <italic>EXOC8</italic>, have been associated with ciliopathies and neural developmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Coulter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dixon-Salazar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Turkyilmaz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Van Bergen et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, deletions involving the 5’ portion of the <italic>EXOC6A</italic> gene and two adjacent cytochrome p450 genes (<italic>CYP26A1</italic> and <italic>CYP26C1</italic>) are associated with autosomal-dominant nonsyndromic optic aplasia (ONA), an extremely rare disorder that causes unilateral or bilateral blindness in the affected eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Meire et al., 2011</xref>). The molecular basis remains unclear. Further studies are needed to explore the specific roles of various types of ciliary vesicles, the underlying mechanisms of their trafficking/fusion, and their relevance to ciliopathies and neural developmental disorders.</p>
<p>In summary, we have identified a novel role for EXOC6A in ciliogenesis and determined that it is essential for both early and late stages of this process. EXOC6A vesicles may transport proteins or lipid moieties to and from the CV (early phase) and the ciliary pocket/ciliary membrane (late phase) during ciliogenesis. However, EXOC6A is not absolutely necessary for the initial CV formation; its function may be to help assemble the complete transition zone and promote the maturation of existing CVs into the ciliary sheath/shaft membrane. Furthermore, transportation of EXOC6A vesicles to the mother centriole is mediated by Myo-Va and occurs via a dynein-, MT-, and Arp2/3-dependent pathway. Our study provides new insights into the function of EXOC6A in cilia membrane assembly during ciliogenesis. Future studies are needed to explore the specific roles of different types of ciliary vesicles, the underlying mechanisms of their trafficking and fusion, and their relevance to ciliopathies and neural developmental disorders.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study elucidates the role of the exocyst component EXOC6A at distinct stages of ciliogenesis, which advances our understanding of ciliary membrane remodeling and cilium formation. The authors provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that EXOC6A interacts with myosin-Va and is dynamically recruited via dynein-, microtubule-, and actin-dependent mechanisms, to support proper formation of the ciliary membrane.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Lin et al. studies the role of EXOC6A in ciliogenesis and its relationship with the interactor myosin-Va using a range of approaches based on the RPE1 cell line model. They establish its spatio-temporal organization at centrioles, the forming ciliary vesicle and ciliary sheath using ExM, various super-resolution techniques, and EM, including correlative light and electron microscopy. They also perform live imaging analyses and functional studies using RNAi and knockout. They establish a role of EXOC6A together with myosin-Va in Golgi-derived, microtubule- and actin-based vesicle trafficking to and from the ciliary vesicle and sheath membranes. Defects in these functions impair robust ciliary shaft and axoneme formation due to defective transition zone assembly.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study provides very high-quality data that support the conclusions. In particular, the imaging data is compelling. It also integrates all findings in a model that shows how EXOC6A participates in multiple stages of ciliogenesis and how it cooperates with other factors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The precise role of EXOC6A remains somewhat unclear. While it is described as a component of the exocyst, the authors do not address its molecular functions and whether it indeed works as part of the exocyst complex during ciliogenesis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The molecular mechanisms underlying ciliogenesis are not well understood. Previously, work from the same group (Wu et al., 2018) identified myosin-Va as an important protein in transporting preciliary vesicles to the mother vesicles, allowing for initiation of ciliogenesis. The exocyst complex has previously been implicated in ciliogenesis and protein trafficking to cilia. Here, Lin et al. investigate the role of exocyst complex protein EXOC6A in cilia formation. The authors find that EXOC6A localizes to preciliary vesicles, ciliary vesicles, and the ciliary sheath. EXOC6A colocalizes with Myo-Va in the ciliary vesicle and the ciliary sheath, and both proteins are removed from fully assembled cilia. EXOC6A is not required for Myo-Va localization, but Myo-VA and EHD1 are required for EXOC6A to localize in ciliary vesicles. The authors propose that EXOC6A vesicles continually remodel the cilium: FRAP analysis demonstrates that EXOC6A is a dynamic protein, and live imaging shows that EXOC6A fuses with and buds off from the ciliary membrane. Loss of EXOC6A reduces, but does not eliminate, the number of cilia formed in cells. Any cilia that are still present are structurally abnormal, with either bent morphologies or the absence of some transition zone proteins. Overall, the analyses and imaging are well done, and the conclusions are well supported by the data. The work will be of interest to cell biologists, especially those interested in centrosomes and cilia.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The TEM micrographs are of excellent quality. The quality of the imaging overall is very good, especially considering that these are dynamic processes occurring in a small region of the cell. The data analysis is well done and the quantifications are very helpful. The manuscript is well-written and the final figure is especially helpful in understanding the model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Additional information about the functional and mechanistic roles of EXOC6A would improve the manuscript greatly.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lin et al report on the dynamic localization of EXOC6A and Myo-Va at pre-ciliary vesicles, ciliary vesicles, and ciliary sheath membrane during ciliogenesis using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy and ultrastructure expansion microscopy. The authors further confirm the interaction of EXOC6A and Myo-Va by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and demonstrated the requirement of EHD1 for the EXOC6A-labeled ciliary vesicles formation. Additional experiments using gene-silencing by siRNA and pharmacological tools identified the involvement of dynein-, microtubule-, and actin in the transport mechanism of EXOC6A-labeled vesicles to the centriole, as they have previously reported for Myo-Va. Notably, loss of EXOC6A severely disrupts ciliogenesis, with the majority of cells becoming arrested at the ciliary vesicle (CV) stage, highlighting the involvement of EXOC6A at later stages of ciliogenesis. As the authors observe dynamic EXOC6A-positive vesicle release and fusion with the ciliary sheath, this suggests a role in membrane and potentially membrane protein delivery to the growing cilium past the ciliary vesicle stage. While CEP290 localization at the forming cilium appears normal, the recruitment of other transition zone components, exemplified by several MKS and NPHP module components, was also impaired in EXOC6A-deficient cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) By applying different microscopy approaches, the study provides deeper insight into the spatial and temporal localization of EXOC6A and Myo-Va during ciliogenesis.</p>
<p>(2) The combination of complementary siRNA and pharmacological tools targeting different components strengthens the conclusions.</p>
<p>(3) This study reveals a new function of EXOC6A in delivering membrane and membrane proteins during ciliogenesis, both to the ciliary vesicle as well as to the ciliary sheath.</p>
<p>(4) The overall data quality is high. The investigation of EXOC6A at different time points during ciliogenesis is well schematized and explained.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Since many conclusions are based on EXOC6A immunostaining, it would strengthen the study to validate antibody specificity by demonstrating the absence of staining in EXOC6A-deficient cells.</p>
<p>(2) While the authors generated an EXOC6A-deficient cell line, off-target effects can be clone-specific. Validating key experiments in a second independent knockout clone or rescuing the phenotype of the existing clone by re-expressing EXOC6A would ensure that the observed phenotypes are due to EXOC6A loss rather than unintended off-target effects.</p>
<p>(3) Some experimental details are lacking from the materials and methods section. No information on how the co-immunoprecipitation experiments have been performed can be found. The concentrations of pharmacological agents should be provided to allow proper interpretation of the results, as higher or lower doses can produce nonspecific effects. For example, the concentrations of ciliobrevin and nocodazole used to treat RPE1 cells are not specified and should be included. More precise settings for the FRAP experiments would help others reproduce the presented data. Some details for the siRNA-based knockdowns, such as incubation times, can only be found in the figure legends.</p>
<p>Taken together, the authors achieved their goal of elucidating the role of EXOC6A in ciliogenesis, demonstrating its involvement in vesicle trafficking and membrane remodeling in both early and late stages of ciliogenesis. Their findings are supported by experimental evidence. This work is likely to have an impact on the field by expanding our understanding of the molecular machinery underlying cilia biogenesis, particularly the coordination between the exocyst complex and cytoskeletal transport systems. The methods and data presented offer valuable tools for dissecting vesicle dynamics and cilium formation, providing a foundation for future research into ciliary dysfunction and related diseases. By connecting vesicle trafficking to structural maturation of an organelle, the study adds important context to the broader description of cellular architecture and organelle biogenesis.</p>
