<title>Abstract</title><p>Mitotic anaphase onset is a key cellular process tightly regulated by multiple kinases. The involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in this process has been established in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. However, the detailed regulatory cascade remains elusive, and also it is unknown whether the MAPKs-dependent mitotic regulation is evolutionarily conserved in the single cell eukaryotic organism such as fission yeast (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>). Here we show that two MAPKs in <italic>S. pombe</italic> indeed act in concert to restrain anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activity upon activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). One MAPK, Pmk1, binds and phosphorylates Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, the co-activator of APC/C. Phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> by Pmk1, but not by Cdk1, promotes its subsequent ubiquitylation and degradation. Intriguingly, Pmk1-mediated phosphorylation event is also required to sustain SAC under environmental stress. Thus, our study establishes a new underlying molecular mechanism of negative regulation of APC/C by MAPK upon stress stimuli, and provides an unappreciated framework for regulation of anaphase entry in eukaryotic cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The evolutionarily conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways regulate multiple cellular functions in eukaryotic organisms in response to a wide variety of environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Plotnikov et al., 2011</xref>). However, different MAPK pathways have been evolved in an organism to integrate diverse signals and fulfill different regulations on various effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cansado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ronkina and Gaestel, 2022</xref>). This makes specifying the MAPKs and substrates involved in a specific physiological process rather complex and challenging.</p>
<p>In late mitosis, the timely polyubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of securin and cyclin B by anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) play a critical role for anaphase onset and chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Peters, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sullivan and Morgan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yamano, 2019</xref>). Given the essential role of APC/C in triggering chromosome segregation, it is not surprising that APC/C is a key molecular target of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which is an intricate surveillance mechanism that prolongs mitosis until all chromosomes achieve correct bipolar attachments to spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McAinsh and Kops, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Murray, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Musacchio, 2015</xref>). Previous studies have revealed that the active MAPK is required for spindle checkpoint activation and APC/C inhibition in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts or tadpole cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Minshull et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Takenaka et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhao and Chen, 2006</xref>). These studies suggested that phosphorylation of several components of SAC, including Cdc20, Mps1 and Bub1, by MAPK serves as regulatory signals to block APC/C activation upon SAC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhao and Chen, 2006</xref>). However, all these studies used either the anti-MAPK antibodies or small molecule inhibitor UO126 to inhibit MAPK or MAPK-specific phosphatase MKP-1 to antagonize MAPK activity, these reagents could not distinguish the contributions of different MAPKs with high specificity. Thus, those seemingly defined mechanisms might suffer the ambiguity due to potential specificity issues.</p>
<p>The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> has three MAPK-signaling cascades: the pheromone signaling pathway (PSP), the stress-activated pathway (SAP) and the cell integrity pathway (CIP), with Spk1, Sty1 or Pmk1 as MAPK respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cansado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Perez and Cansado, 2010</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, whether MAPKs play key roles in regulation of the APC/C and spindle checkpoint remains largely unexplored. Intriguingly, all genes encoding the major components of three MAPK-signaling cascades in fission yeast are non-essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kim et al., 2010</xref>), this provides the possibility for investigations on their potential functions in a genetic background with complete deletion of relevant genes.</p>

<p>In this work, we set out to directly examine the requirement of the fission yeast MAPKs in mitotic APC/C activation and anaphase entry. Our results uncovered a previously unappreciated mechanism in which Pmk1, the MAPK of CIP, phosphorylates the APC/C activator Slp1 (the Cdc20 homologue in <italic>S. pombe</italic>) upon SAC activation. Phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> results in its ubiquitylation and degradation and thus subsequently impedes APC/C activation and anaphase entry. This mechanism also operates in response to spindle defects under environmental stress. Therefore, our finding extends cell-cycle control stages linked to MAPKs from previously recognized G<sub>2</sub>/M transition and cytokinesis to anaphase entry and mitotic exit in fission yeast. It will also be interesting to address whether this MAPK-mediated Cdc20 regulation exists as a general mechanism for balancing spindle checkpoint activity in higher eukaryotes.</p>

<title>Results</title>

<title>SAP and CIP signaling components are required for spindle checkpoint activity</title>
<p>As the first step to examine the possible requirement of the fission yeast MAPKs in mitotic progression, we tested the sensitivity of deletion mutants of three fission yeast MAPKs to microtubule-destabilizing drug thiabendazole (TBZ), which has been routinely used as an indicator of defective kinetochore or spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Saitoh et al., 1997</xref>). We noticed that <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> and <italic>sty1Δ</italic> but not <italic>spk1Δ</italic> cells were extremely sensitive to TBZ, and constitutively activated CIP signaling by overexpressing Pek1<sup>DD</sup> (Pek1-S234D;T238D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sugiura et al., 1999</xref>) or activated SAP signaling by overexpressing Wis1<sup>DD</sup> (Wis1-S469D;T473D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shiozaki et al., 1998</xref>) also caused yeast cells to be sensitive to TBZ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; Supplementary Figure 1A). These observations indicated that Pmk1 and Sty1 pathways might be involved in mitosis-related processes.</p>
<p>To extend our analysis and precisely quantify whether the SAC is properly activated and maintained in MAPK mutants, we adopted one well-established assay using the cold-sensitive β-tubulin mutant <italic>nda3-KM311</italic>, which compromises the kinetochore-spindle microtubule attachment upon cold treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hiraoka et al., 1984</xref>), to analyze the ability of cells to arrest in mitosis in the absence of spindle microtubules and enter anaphase when spindle microtubules are reassembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">May et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Vanoosthuyse and Hardwick, 2009</xref>). In this assay, the SAC was first robustly activated by the <italic>nda3-KM311</italic> mutant at 18 °C and then inactivated simply by shift mitotically arrested cells back to permissive temperature (30 °C) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>). Because Cdc13 (cyclin B in <italic>S. pombe</italic>) localizes to the spindle pole bodies (SPBs) in early mitosis and should be degraded by APC/C to promote metaphase-anaphase transition, accumulation of Cdc13-GFP on SPBs after cold treatment serves as the read-out of the SAC activation, and the disappearance rate of Cdc13-GFP spot under permissive temperature reflects the SAC inactivation efficacy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>). It is noteworthy that the ATP analogue-sensitive mutant <italic>sty1-T97A</italic> (i.e. <italic>sty1-as2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zuin et al., 2010</xref>), instead of <italic>sty1Δ</italic> deletion mutant, was used in this assay. That was due to the G<sub>2</sub> delay that has been demonstrated in the <italic>sty1Δ</italic> deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Shiozaki and Russell, 1995a</xref>), which could interfere mitotic timing for further analysis in this assay. We found that inactivation of CIP or SAP signaling by <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ or <italic>sty1-T97A</italic> compromised full SAC activation, as these two mutants had only less than 60% of cells with Cdc13-GFP on SPBs after 6 hours of cold treatment, whereas the percentage in wild-type and <italic>spk1Δ</italic> cells after the same treatment was roughly 90% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; Supplementary Figure 1C). Consistently, the disappearance of Cdc13-GFP from SPBs in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> and <italic>wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> mutant cells released from metaphase-arrest was severely delayed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; Supplementary Figure 1B), suggesting delayed SAC inactivation and anaphase onset after release from spindle checkpoint arrest in these mutants.</p>
<p>All above data suggested that MAPK pathways are evolutionarily conserved in the fission yeast to participate in spindle checkpoint activation and maintenance, of which the CIP and SAP signaling pathways, but not the Spk1 pathway, are actively involved.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>CIP and SAP signaling attenuate protein levels of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> and facilitate association of MCC with APC/C respectively</title>
<p>The mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC, consisting of Mad3-Mad2-Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> in <italic>S. pombe</italic>) is the most potent inhibitor of the APC/C prior to anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kapanidou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Primorac and Musacchio, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sudakin et al., 2001</xref>). Previous study has revealed that <italic>Xenopus</italic> MAPK phosphorylates Cdc20 and facilitates its binding by Mad2, BubR1 (Mad3 in <italic>S. pombe</italic>) and Bub3 to form a tight MCC to prevent Cdc20 from activating the APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>). In fission yeast, the key SAC components Mad2 and Mad3 and one molecule of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> form MCC which binds to APC/C through another molecule of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> upon checkpoint arrest, and the recovery from mitotic arrest accompanies the loss of MCC-APC/C binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">May et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sczaniecka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sewart and Hauf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Vanoosthuyse and Hardwick, 2009</xref>). Since we found that constitutive activation of CIP or SAP signaling in fission yeast by <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>or <italic>wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> mutations caused prolonged SAC activation, we were suspicious that these two MAPK pathways might also execute their functions cooperatively through a similar mechanism to that in <italic>Xenopus</italic>.</p>
<p>To test this possibility, we analyzed the MCC occupancy on APC/C by immunoprecipitations of the APC/C subunit Lid1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yoon et al., 2002</xref>) in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>and <italic>wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells arrested by activated checkpoint. Compared to wild-type, more MCC components (Mad2 plus Mad3 and Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>) were co-immunoprecipitated in <italic>wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells, while less of them were co-immunoprecipitated in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that activation of the SAP but not the CIP pathway enhanced the association of MCC with APC/C.</p>

<p>The decrease of co-immunoprecipitated Mad2 and Mad3 in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>cells was largely out of expectation. Further analysis of the inputs of these immunoprecipitations showed that Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels were significantly reduced in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> but not <italic>wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Our immunoblotting analyses using the total lysate of <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> or <italic>wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells arrested at metaphase also confirmed these results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistently, the Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> level was significantly increased in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> and <italic>pmk1Δ sty1-T79A</italic> cells but not in <italic>sty1-T79A</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The elevated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> level in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> cells is similar to that we observed in cells harboring two copies of <italic>slp1<sup>+</sup></italic>, which leads to artificially increased Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> level and also causes a SAC strength defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2022</xref>). It is noteworthy that attenuated levels of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells was not due to decreased transcription of <italic>slp1<sup>+</sup></italic> gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These results collectively revealed a negative effect of CIP but not SAP signaling on Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels, which potentially results in the weakened MCC-APC/C interaction detected in CIP mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, our above data suggested a new mechanism involves division of labor between the two fission yeast MAPK pathways CIP (Pek1-Pmk1) and SAP (Wis1-Sty1) upon SAC activation, which is required in concert to lower Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels and enhance MCC affinity for APC/C to strongly inhibit APC/C activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In this study, we only focused on characterizing the role of the CIP/Pmk1 in regulating SAC inactivation and anaphase onset hereafter.</p>

<p>In previous reports, MAPK-docking sites, which are important for interaction with MAPKs, have been identified at the N termini of different MAPKKs from yeast to humans with a notable feature of a cluster of at least two basic residues (mainly Lys/K and Arg/R) separated by a spacer of 2-6 residues from a hydrophobic-X-hydrophobic sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bardwell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bardwell and Thorner, 1996</xref>). Thus, we attempted to identify the potential key residues in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> that mediate the Pmk1-Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> interaction. By visual scanning of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> sequence, we noticed five basic-residue patches which are also present in several fungal species and loosely resemble the consensus sequence of the known MAPK-docking sites, and four of them are within N-terminal portion of the protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2). However, only mutating either of the two most N-terminal basic-residue patches (19-KKR-21 and 47-KR-48) to glutamates (Glu, E) or alanines (Ala, A) in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> resulted in decreased amount of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> pulled down by Pmk1-GST <italic>in vitro</italic> using the bacterially expressed recombinant proteins, and mutating both patches or mutating only two arginine residues (R21 and R48) in those patches was sufficient to completely disrupt their interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and Supplementary Figure 3). Importantly, mutations of these Pmk1-docking sequences in Slp1 (PDSS for short) to alanines mimicked <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> mutant in both elevated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) and defective activation and maintenance of the SAC upon <italic>nda3</italic>-mediated checkpoint arrest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and Supplementary Figure 4). Also, similar to removal of Pek1 downstream MAPK Pmk1, the lowered Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels and delayed SAC inactivation in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> mutant could be relieved by <italic>slp1(DS-5A)</italic> mutant, which is deficient in Pmk1-docking (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref> and Supplementary Figure 4).</p>
<p>Previously, one conserved non-canonical Pmk1-docking sequence which bears positively charged residues and IYT motif has been identified in MAPK phosphatase Pmp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sacristan-Reviriego et al., 2014</xref>). Very strikingly, insertion of a 15 amino acid sequence containing the Pmk1-docking sequence in Pmp1 (or PDSP for short) right in front of the first basic-residue patch in Slp1(DS-5A) mutant protein restored its interaction with Pmk1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). And this artificially forced Pmk1-Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> interaction via PDSP was able to lower Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels and restore higher percentage of metaphase arrest upon SAC activation in <italic>slp1(DS-5A)</italic> mutant, which is Pmk1-docking-deficient, although the rescuing effect was less efficient than the presence of genuine PDSS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref> and Supplementary Figure 4). These data firmly supported the idea that Pmk1 binds Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> to downregulate its levels upon SAC activation.</p>
<p>Collectively, these results demonstrated that Pmk1 directly binds to Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> through two short N-terminal basic patches serving as the major docking sites for Pmk1, and the physical interaction of Pmk1-Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> is involved in attenuation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> abundance upon SAC activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To identify potential phosphorylation sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, we purified Apc15-GFP from wild type, <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> and <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells arrested by activated checkpoint with intention that the Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>-containing APC/C complexes could be captured (Supplementary Figure 5A and 5B). Purifications were performed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors to enrich for phosphopeptides. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the phosphorylation of Thr480 residue at the most C-terminus of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> was dependent on the presence of Pmk1, and this modification was present in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> but not in wild type cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, Supplementary Figure 5C-E and Supplementary Figure 6), indicating that phosphorylation of Thr480 is very likely triggered by CIP signaling. We raised phospho-specific antibodies against pT480, it could recognize Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> fragment phosphorylated by Pmk1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and mutation of Thr480 to alanine (T480A) abolished site-specific phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). We also confirmed that endogenous Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> was indeed phosphorylated at Thr480 in metaphase-arrested <italic>mts3-1</italic> cells, which was enhanced in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> mutant and diminished in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, our results established Thr480 as a major Pmk1 phosphorylation site <italic>in vivo</italic> upon SAC activation.</p>
<p>In addition to pT480, our mass spectrometry analysis also identified Ser28, Thr31 and Ser59 as Pmk1-independent and Ser76 as Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, Supplementary Figure 5C-E and Supplementary Figure 6). All these four residues are located within the N-terminal unstructured region, fit with the Cdk1 core motif (SP or TP), and more importantly, they are conserved not only in four <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> species but also in several other fungal species (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2B). Interestingly, they were also proposed as Cdk1 phosphorylation sites based on quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Swaffer et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). By using the phospho-specific antibodies against both pS28 and pT31, we could detect the phosphorylation of Ser28 and Thr31 <italic>in vitro</italic> by Cdc13 (cyclin B)-containing Cdk1 complexes purified from metaphase-arrested yeast cells, which was diminished when the kinase activity of ATP analogue-sensitive Cdk1 [cdc2-as1(F84G)] was inhibited by 1-NM-PP1 or when Slp1<sup>(S28A;T31A)</sup> was added as the substrate in <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase reactions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Next, we examined whether Ser28 and Thr31 were phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> using immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies to directly detect Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, which was co-immunoprecipitated with Apc15 from <italic>nda3</italic>-arrested yeast cells. We observed phosphorylation of Ser28/Thr31 in wild type cells, but it disappeared following phosphatase treatment of wild type samples after immunoprecipitation, 1-NM-PP1 treatment of <italic>cdc2-as1</italic> cells before being collected for immunoprecipitation, or when cells expressing Slp1<sup>(S28A;T31A)</sup> were used (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> is also phosphorylated by Cdk1 at least at Ser28 and Thr31 in fission yeast mitotic cells.</p>
<p>We wondered whether Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation by Pmk1 affects its stability and APC/C activation. Indeed, phospho-deficient Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> mutant showed elevated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels in both metaphase-arrested and asynchronously grown cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and Supplementary Figure 7) and compromised SAC activation compared to wild type cells, likely due to more efficient APC/C activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref> and Supplementary Figure 8). Furthermore, Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> mutant also reversed the inhibitory effect of <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> on Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> stability and APC/C activation after release from SAC-mediated arrest (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>).</p>
<p>Ser76 was identified as a Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation residue in our mass spectrometry analysis, but it was considered as a Cdk1 targeting site in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Swaffer et al., 2018</xref>). It is fairly possible that phosphorylation of Ser76 is promoted by both Cdk1 and Pmk1, which is conceivable as CDKs and MAPKs recognize the same core motif (SP/TP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pinna and Ruzzene, 1996</xref>), and crosstalk between CDK and MAPK has recently been reported for pheromone signaling in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Repetto et al., 2018</xref>). We tested how the double phosphorylation sites (S76A;T480A) mutant affects Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels or APC/C activity, and observed that the protein levels of Slp1<sup>S76A;T480A</sup> were further elevated and SAC activation efficiency in this mutant was further lowered compared to Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). Of note, Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> and Slp1<sup>S76A;T480A</sup> mutant proteins became easily detected in interphase cells (Supplementary Figure 7), this is very different from wild type Slp1 which normally accumulates exclusively in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yamada et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>We further tested whether replacement of other identified phospho-serine/threonine residues with alanines affects Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels and APC/C activity. We constructed strains carrying combinations of mutations of S28A, T31A and S59A with S76A, and also with confirmed Pmk1 phosphorylation-deficient T480A, and found that mutations of S28A, T31A and S59A did not affect Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels, though they could also profoundly compromise SAC activation efficiency similarly to S76A;T480A mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, 4H and Supplementary Figure 7). We noticed that the presence of mutations of S28A, T31A and S59A also abolished the elevated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels conferred by S76A;T480A mutations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and Supplementary Figure 8). Thus, phosphorylation of S28, T31 and S59 targeted by Cdk1 most likely influences APC/C activation through distinct mechanism from Pmk1-mediated S76/T480 phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data suggested that activated Pmk1 phosphorylates Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> <italic>in vivo</italic>, which leads to lowered Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels, delayed SAC inactivation and APC/C activation as we observed in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>cells. Also, Pmk1 can join Cdk1 to enhance the multi-site phosphorylation of their shared substrate Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> and collaboratively dampen APC/C activity.</p>

<title>Pmk1-but not Cdk1-mediated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation promotes its ubiquitylation</title>
<p>Our above data support the notion that the direct binding of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> by Pmk1 mediates its phosphorylation, which possibly results its subsequent rapid turnover. It has been shown in both human and fission yeast cells that Apc15, one of the conserved components of APC/C, promotes Cdc20/Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> autoubiquitylation and its turnover by APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">May et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sewart and Hauf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Uzunova et al., 2012</xref>).

These results suggested that K479 is likely Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> ubiquitylation-relevant. Furthermore, <italic>nda3-KM311 slp1<sup>K479R</sup></italic> cells also demonstrated lowered metaphase arrest rate after cold treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and Supplementary Figure 9B), indicating defective SAC activation. Previous studies have identified two neighbouring lysine residues close to the carboxy terminus of human Cdc20, Lys485 and Lys490, as ubiquitylation sites in prometaphase cells, and mutating these two lysines to arginine completely prevented Cdc20 ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Danielsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>). Very interestingly, a second lysine residue, K472, is also present in fission yeast Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> adjacent to K479 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and Supplementary Figure 11). Although K472 was not identified as an ubiquitin-modifying residue in our mass spectrometry analysis, replacement of K472 with arginine also efficiently stabilized Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, similar to K479R mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and Supplementary Figure 10). More strikingly, simultaneously mutating both K472 and K479 caused additive effects in elevating Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels and lowering SAC activation rate in both wild type and <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> strain backgrounds (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref> and Supplementary Figure 10), suggesting that likely both these two lysine residues at the C-terminal tail of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> contribute to its turnover via ubiquitylation, which is very similar to the mechanism in human Cdc20. Consistently, using TUBEs (tandem ubiquitin-binding entities) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hjerpe et al., 2009</xref>) to enrich for ubiquitinated proteins in metaphase-arrested <italic>mts3-1</italic> cells expressing sfGFP-Slp1, we were able to demonstrate that mutating both K472 and K479 largely removed higher molecular weight bands detected by immunoblotting, which were corresponding to ubiquitylated species of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E, F</xref>). We also noticed that Slp1<sup>K472R;</sup> <sup>K479R</sup> rendered more severely compromised viability than either single mutants (Supplementary Figure 12), indicating blocking Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> ubiquitylation could bring about detrimental consequence to the cells.</p>
<p>Our observation that Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels were lowered in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) suggested that attenuation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels upon constitutive activation of CIP signaling is very likely through facilitating its autoubiquitylation. To test this possibility, we examined and compared the ubiquitylation levels of sfGFP-Slp1 in wild type, <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> and <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>cells by affinity pull-down assays using TUBEs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Indeed, we observed a much weaker or stronger discrete laddering pattern of sfGFP-Slp1 in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> and <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells than that of wild type cells, indicating abated or enhanced ubiquitylation respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, mutations of T480A, S76A/T480A and Pmk1-docing site, but not S28A/T31A- or S28A/T31A/S59A-containing mutants, also reduced polyubiquitylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). All these results confirmed that Pmk1-but not Cdk1-mediated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation promotes its ubiquitylation.</p>
<p>Together, these findings lent further support to the idea that the CIP signaling pathway restrain APC/C activity through a cascade mechanism, in which Pmk1 directly binds and phosphorylates Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> to facilitate its autoubiquitylation, and eventually lowers its levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>

<title>Osmotic stress and cell wall damage trigger rapid Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> downregulation and mitotic exit delay</title>
<p>It has been well established that two MAPKs Sty1 and Pmk1 can be activated by environmental perturbations including osmotic stress, cell wall damage, thermal stress, oxidative stress, and glucose limitation, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cansado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Madrid et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shiozaki and Russell, 1995b</xref>). We wondered whether the phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> by Pmk1 could tune the strength of SAC activation and APC/C activity in response to extracellular stress. To investigate this possibility, we performed arrest-and-release experiments with <italic>nda3-KM311</italic> mutants and added 0.6 M KCl or 2 µg/mL of caspofungin 1 hr before release from metaphase arrest to elicit strong osmotic saline stress (KCl) or cell wall damage stress (caspofungin) response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Madrid et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Madrid et al., 2016</xref>), respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). As previously reported, treatment with KCl or caspofungin resulted in full activation of both Pmk1 and Sty1 (for KCl treatment) or only Pmk1 (for caspofungin treatment) as determined using anti-phospho p42/44 and anti-phospho p38 antibodies, which serve as indicative of respective Pmk1 and Sty1 activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Intriguingly, treatment with KCl or caspofungin also correlated with a marked and rapid decrease in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>Surprisingly, we did not see any alteration of APC/C-MCC interaction accompanying Pmk1 activation when cells were treated by caspofungin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), which was different from what we observed in <italic>P<sub>adh11</sub>-pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Also, we failed to detect enhanced APC/C-MCC association like we observed in <italic>P<sub>adh11</sub>-wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic>cells when cells were treated by KCl, where Sty1 was activated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). The latter observation was most likely due to the disruptive effect of high concentration of KCl on protein-protein interactions, because we observed similar effect when we immunoprecipitated APC/C in the presence of 0.6 M KCl in the lysis buffer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, right panel). With this data, we could not exclude the possibility that activated Sty1 transiently enhanced APC/C-MCC association in yeast cells, which was soon counteracted by the disruptive effect of saline. Nevertheless, the high SAC activation efficiency in mitotis-arrested cells exposed to osmotic stress (KCl) or cell wall damage stress (caspofungin) was largely lowered by <italic>pmk1</italic> deletion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), indicating that at least activated Pmk1 exerts regulation of the spindle checkpoint and APC/C activation under environmental stimuli.

<title>Involvement of MAPKs in cell cycle regulation</title>
<p>So far, the only known cell-cycle control stages linked to MAPKs in fission yeast are at G<sub>2</sub>/M transition and during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gomez-Gil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Petersen and Hagan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Petersen and Nurse, 2007</xref>). The p38 MAPK family member Sty1 either arrests or promotes mitotic commitment in unperturbed, stressed or resumed cell cycles after stress depending on the downstream kinases it associates with. Sty1 can phosphorylate kinase Srk1 at threonine 463 (T463), which further phosphorylates and inhibits Cdc25 phosphatase to negatively regulate the onset of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lopez-Aviles et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lopez-Aviles et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Sty1 also mediates phosphorylation of Polo kinase Plo1 at serine 402 (S402), which then promotes its recruitment to the spindle pole bodies (SPBs), where it positively modulates Cdc25 control of Cdc2 (fission yeast Cdk1) activity for mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Petersen and Hagan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Petersen and Nurse, 2007</xref>). During cytokinesis, two fission yeast formins For3 and Cdc12 cooperate to nucleate actin filaments for assembly of contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Coffman et al., 2013</xref>). It has been shown that Sty1 activity negatively regulates protein levels of For3 in response to actin cytoskeleton damage to downregulate CAR assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gomez-Gil et al., 2020</xref>). Very recently, Pmk1 has also been proposed to act as a negative regulator of cytokinesis, which delays CAR constriction upon cell wall stress (e.g. treatment with blankophor, caspofungin and caffeine) through a novel checkpoint mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Edreira et al., 2020</xref>). However, the detailed mechanisms how Sty1 and Pmk1 pose negative effect on cytokinesis have not been elucidated.</p>
<p>In the current study, we have expanded MAPK signaling-controlled cell-cycle stage to metaphase-anaphase transition in fission yeast. In response to unattached or tensionless kinetochores, the SAC generates the MCC, which inhibits the APC/C and block anaphase onset by suppressing APC/C-catalyzed ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of securin and cyclin B. As a critical APC/C inhibitor, MCC fulfills its function through the physical binding of BubR1/Mad3 and Mad2 to two molecules of Cdc20/Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> (<italic>i.e.</italic> Cdc20<sup>MCC</sup> and Cdc20<sup>APC/C</sup>), and this mechanism has been confirmed at least in both humans and fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alfieri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Izawa and Pines, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sewart and Hauf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yamaguchi et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we have uncovered a dual mechanism, in which two fission yeast MAPKs Pmk1 and Sty1 restrain APC/C activity through distinct manners, either by phosphorylating Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> to lower its levels or by phosphorylating unknown substrate(s) to promote MCC-APC/C association and thus SAC signaling strength, respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, our study has established another critical APC/C-inhibitory mechanism in the spindle checkpoint, though it will be important for future studies to identify the phosphorylation target(s) posed by SAP signaling pathway. Nevertheless, our current study together with earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Edreira et al., 2020</xref>) have implicated fission yeast Pmk1 in both the mitotic and cytokinesis surveillance mechanisms in response to unfavorable environmental stimuli.</p>

<p>The regulation of mitotic entry by MAPK in fission yeast is triggered by many environmental insults, including high osmolarity, oxidative stress, heat shock, centrifugation, nutrient starvation and rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hartmuth and Petersen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Petersen and Hagan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Petersen and Nurse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Shiozaki and Russell, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shiozaki et al., 1998</xref>). In this study, we found that treatment of fission yeast cells with KCl or caspofungin, which provokes a strong osmotic stress or cell wall damage response and quick Pmk1 activation, correlated with an attenuated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels and delayed APC/C activation. Deletion of <italic>pmk1<sup>+</sup></italic> largely overrides the negative effects of KCl or caspofungin treatment on APC/C activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), confirming that activated Pmk1 is responsible for prolonged metaphase arrest under environmental stress. Thus, our finding implicates MAPK Pmk1 as an important regulator for anaphase entry in response to adverse extracellular conditions. Intriguingly, one previous study showed that treatment of human cells with the carcinogen cadmium activates MAPK p38 (fission yeast Sty1 homologue) and triggers accelerated ubiquitination and proteolysis of Cdc20, which is essential for prometaphase arrest under SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yen and Yang, 2010</xref>). Therefore, although different MAPKs might be employed to fulfil the task in yeast and higher eukaryotes, it is still possible that phosphorylation and regulation of Cdc20 levels by MAPKs is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to adjust mitotic exit to extracellular or environmental stimuli.</p>

<title>Negative phospho-regulation of Cdc20 by MAPK as a spindle assembly checkpoint-dependent APC/C-inhibitory mechanism</title>
<p>APC/C activity can be regulated at multiple levels, Cdk1-dependent APC/C phosphorylation is one of the major prerequisites for APC/C activation and anaphase onset, in which Apc3 and Apc1 are key subunits for positive phospho-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fujimitsu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kraft et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Qiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Steen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). However, it has been shown that Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of APC/C co-activator Cdc20 lessens its interaction with APC/C, thus serves as a negative phospho-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Labit et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to its phosphorylation by Cdk1, phosphorylation of Cdc20 by multiple other kinases, such as Bub1, PKA, MAPK and Plk1, has also been demonstrated or suggested in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, humans or budding yeast to be inhibitory to APC/C activation and improper anaphase onset upon SAC activation ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jia et al., 2016</xref>) and reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yu, 2007</xref>)). Therefore, Cdc20 generally serves as an integrator of multiple intracellular signaling cascades that regulate progression through mitosis. In this work, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> by Pmk1 but not Cdk1 promotes its autoubiquitylation, this mechanism is distinct from that reported in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts and tadpole cells, in which phosphorylation of Cdc20 by MAPK is instead responsible for facilitated Cdc20 binding by MCC to prevent it from activating the APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although multiple kinases have been proposed to be directly involved in phosphorylation of Cdc20 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yu, 2007</xref>), precisely identifying the <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation sites in Cdc20 has turned out to be challenging, most likely due to its protein scarcity and instability. Based on known Cdk1 core consensus (SP/TP), 9 residues in human Cdc20 were originally suggested as putative Cdk1 sites, but among them only Ser41 has been proven to be phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> by mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kramer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yudkovsky et al., 2000</xref>). However, subsequent mass spectrometry analyses identified Ser41 as one of the Bub1 phosphorylation sites both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and another putative Cdk1 site Thr106 as one of the Plk1 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tang et al., 2004</xref>). It is very likely that there are not as many genuine Cdk1 sites in Cdc20 as originally assumed. One supporting evidence is that mutation of only one (Thr32) of the three putative Cdk sites to alanine in N terminus of <italic>C. elegans</italic> CDC-20 is sufficient to phenocopy 3A mutant for accelerated APC/C activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, Thr32 of <italic>C. elegans</italic> CDC-20 is conserved as Thr 59 and Thr68 in human and <italic>Xenopus</italic> Cdc20, respectively (see Supplementary Figure 14). Based on two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide analysis, Thr68 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> Cdc20 has also been regarded as a MAPK target site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>). These studies in diverse organisms raised an issue that whether multiple kinases share the same phosphorylation sites in Cdc20? It would not be so surprising if it turns out to be the case eventually, at least for Cdk1 and MAPKs, because CDKs and MAPKs recognize the same core motif (SP/TP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pinna and Ruzzene, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>By purifying Apc15-aasociated fission yeast Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> proteins from checkpoint-arrested <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>and <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> cells, we were able to identify Thr480 and Ser76 as <italic>in vivo</italic> Pmk1-relevant phosphorylation sites and 3 Pmk1-independent phosphorylation sites (S28, T31, S59) based on mass spectrometry analyses. All our identified sites except Thr480 are located in the N terminal disordered portion of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> sequence, this is similar to the phosphorylation residues identified by biochemical and functional analyses in other organisms, in which the major phosphorylation sites all fall within the N-terminus of Cdc20 homologues. We further provided evidence that S28/T31 are phosphorylated by Cdk1 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and T480 phosphorylated by Pmk1 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We noticed that there is a tendency for reported phosphorylation residues to be concentrated in the N terminus of Cdc20 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yu, 2007</xref>). However, due to the lack of clear sequence homology in their N-terminal and C-terminal tails between Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> and its Cdc20 homologues in higher eukaryotes (see Supplementary Figure 14), it is impossible to certainly assign any identified sites from different organisms as homologous sites. But it is possible that multiple kinases modify shared sites in Cdc20, this collaborative effect may be especially helpful under adverse environmental stress. Nevertheless, all reported Cdc20 phosphorylation events constitute an APC/C-inhibitory mechanism, no matter what kinases are responsible for the modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">D’Angiolella et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kramer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Labit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yudkovsky et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The current model of inhibitory signaling from Cdc20 posits that its phosphorylation either promotes the formation of MCC or inhibits APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> catalytically, both are required for proper spindle checkpoint signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Labit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yamano, 2019</xref>). Interestingly, our current study suggests Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation by fission yeast MAPK Pmk1 may represent another critical APC/C-inhibitory mechanism in the spindle checkpoint through reducing the protein levels of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, which is achieved via autoubiquitylation-mediated degradation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Actually, previous studies in fission and budding yeast have underlined the importance of accurate relative abundance between checkpoint proteins and Cdc20/Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, which sets an important determinant of checkpoint robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Heinrich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pan and Chen, 2004</xref>). A benefit of allowing the association of MCC-bound Cdc20 with APC/C is to provide an opportunity for Cdc20 autoubiquitylation by APC/C, a process aided by APC/C subunit Apc15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">May et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sewart and Hauf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Uzunova et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, the depletion of <italic>apc15<sup>+</sup></italic> restores Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), consistent with the idea that Pmk1-mediated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation very likely facilitates its autoubiquitylation. Indeed, our biochemical and functional analyses further establish K479 and K472 in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> as two key residues directly involved in its ubiquitylation, which likely follows its phosphorylation, particularly at adjacent Thr480. Although K485 and K490 are similarly located at C terminus of human Cdc20 and can be ubiquitylated and responsible for Cdc20 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Danielsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>), there has been no reports on phosphorylation-modified residues in this region. However, although the sequence homology within N- and C-terminal regions between Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> and Cdc20 homologues in higher eukaryotes is extremely low, we do notice that there are several lysine-flanking serine or threonine residues within Cdc20 C-terminal tails of higher eukaryotes (see Supplementary Figure 11), this raises a possibility that this region may be involved in phosphorylation-coupled ubiquitylation. Currently, we do not know how T480 phosphorylation accelerate ubiquitylation of K479 and K472 in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>. It is possible that phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> might alter the mode of Cdc20 binding to APC/C which becomes conducive to catalyze Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> ubiquitylation.</p>
<p>In summary, our studies revealed a distinct dual mechanism of MAPK-dependent anaphase onset delay imposed directly on APC/C co-activator Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> and an unidentified substrate, which may emerge as an important regulatory layer to fine tune APC/C and MCC activity upon SAC activation. Importantly, although this mechanism of APC/C regulation by two MAPKs has not been examined in other organisms, it is very likely widespread across eukaryotes including humans, given the involvement of MAPKs in general response to wide range of adverse environmental situations and similar regulations of APC/C and SAC in eukaryotes characterized so far. It is also plausible to assume that the MAPK-mediated APC/C inhibition pathway may also contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple cancers. Indeed, Cdc20 upregulation has been demonstrated in several types of cancers, including breast and colon cancer, and it contributes to aggressive tumor progression and poor prognosis in gastric cancer and primary non-small cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chi et al., 2019</xref>). It would be interesting to address whether the altered levels of Cdc20 in these cancers are MAPK relevant. Nevertheless, inhibition of APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> activity or induction of Cdc20 degradation have already been listed as alternative therapeutic strategies to control cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Greil et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, although the detailed molecular mechanisms may vary, further studies on MAPK-mediated APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition mechanism in human would lead to better understanding of its oncogenic role in tumor progression.</p>

<title>Fission yeast strains, media and genetic methods</title>
<p>Fission yeast cells were grown in either YE (yeast extract) rich medium or EMM (Edinburgh minimal medium) containing the necessary supplements. G418 disulfate (Sigma-Aldrich; A1720), hygromycin B (Sangon Biotech; A600230) or nourseothiricin (clonNAT; Werner BioAgents; CAS#96736-11-7) was used at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and thiabendazole (TBZ) (Sigma-Aldrich; T8904) at 5-15 μg/ml in YE media where appropriate.

<p>The mechanisms that ensure accurate chromosome segregation are key for genome integrity and defects therein can cause human disease. Although the involvement of MAP kinases in modulating mitosis is known, this manuscript makes a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution by going to some lengths to reveal links between Spindle Assembly Checkpoint dynamics and stress-responsive MAP-kinase pathways. The strength of the evidence is <bold>solid</bold> but there are minor weaknesses, which need to be addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript addresses two main issues:</p>
<p>
(i) do MAPKs play an important role in SAC regulation in single-cell organism such as S pombe?</p>
<p>
(ii) what is the nature of their involvement and what are their molecular targets?</p>
<p>The authors have extensively used the cold-sensitive β-tubulin mutant to activate or inactivate SAC employing an arrest-release protocol. Localization of Cdc13 (cyclin B) to the SPBs is used as a readout for the SAC activation or inactivation. The roles of two major MAPK pathways i.e. stress-activated pathway (SAP) and cell integrity pathway (CIP), have been explored in this context (with CIP more extensively than SAP). Sty1Δ or pmk1Δ mutants were used to inactivate the SAP or CIP pathways and wis1DD or pek1DD expression was utilized to constitutively activate these pathways, respectively. Lowering of Slp1Cdc20 abundance (by phosphorylation of Slp1-Thr 480) is revealed as the main function of MAPK to augment the robustness of the spindle assembly checkpoint.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are generally well-conducted, and the results support the interpretations in various sections. The experimental data clearly supports some of the key conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) While inactivation of SAP and CIP compromises SAC-imposed arrest, their constitutive activation delays the release from the SAC-imposed arrest.</p>
<p>
(2) CIP signaling, but not SAP signaling, attenuates Slp1Cdc20 levels.</p>
<p>
(3) Pmk1 and Cdc20 physically interact and Pmk1-docking sequences in Slp1 (PDSS) are identified and confirmed by mutational/substitution experiments.</p>
<p>
(4) Thr480 (and also S76) is identified as the residue phosphorylated by Pmk1. S28 and T31 are identified as Cdk1 phosphorylation sites. These are confirmed by mutational and other related analyses.</p>
<p>
(5) Functional aspects of the phosphorylation sites have been elucidated to some extent: (a) Phosphorylation of Slp1-T480 by Pmk1 reduces its abundance thereby augmenting the SAC-induced arrest (b) S28, T31 (also S59) are phosphorylated by Cdk1(c) K472 and K479 residues are involved in ubiquitylation of Slp.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Cdc13 localization to SPBs has been used as a readout for SAC activation/inactivation throughout the manuscript. However, the only image showing such localization (Figure 1C) is of poor quality where the Cdc13 localization to SPBs is barely visible. This should be replaced by a better image.</p>
<p>(2) The overlapping error bars in Cdc13-localization data in some figures (for instance Figure 3E and 4H) make the effect of various mutations on SAC activation/inactivation rather marginal. In some of these cases, Western-blotting data support the authors' conclusions better.</p>
<p>(3) This specific point is not really a weakness but rather a loose end:</p>
<p>
One of the conclusions of this study is that MAPK (PMK1) contributes to the robustness of SAC-induced arrest by lowering the abundance of Slp1Cdc20. The authors have used pmk1Δ or constitutively activating the MAPK pathways (Pek1DD) and documented their effect on SAC activation/inactivation dynamics. It is not clear if SAC activation also leads to activation of MAPK pathways for them to contribute to the SAC robustness. To tie this loose end, the author could have checked if the MAPK pathway is also activated under the conditions when SAC is activated. Unless this is shown, one must assume that the authors are attributing the effect they observe to the basal activity of MAPKs.</p>
<p>(4) This is also a loose end:</p>
<p>
The authors show that activation of stress pathways (by addition of KCl for instance) causes phosphorylation-dependent Slp1Cdc20 downregulation (Figure 6) under the SAC-activating condition. Does activation of the stress pathway cause phosphorylation-dependent Slp1Cdc20 downregulation under the non-SAC-activation condition or does it occur only under the SAC-activating condition?</p>
<p>(5) Although the authors have gone to some length to identify S28 and T31 (also S59) as phosphorylation sites for Cdk1, their functional significance in the context of MAPK involvement is not yet clear. Perhaps it is outside the scope of this study to dig deeper into this aspect more than the authors have.</p>
<p>(6) In its current state, the Discussion section is quite disjointed. The first section &quot;Involvement of MAPKs in cell cycle regulation&quot; should be in the Introduction section (very briefly, if at all). It certainly does not belong to the Discussion section. In any case, the Discussion section should be more organized with a better flow of arguments/interpretations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Sun et al. presents a role for the S. pombe MAP kinase Pmk1 in the activation of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) via controlling the protein levels of APC/C activator Cdc20 (Slp1 in S. pombe). The data presented in the manuscript is thorough and convincing. The authors have shown that Pmk1 binds and phosphorylates Slp1, promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Since Cdc20 is an activator of APC/C, which promotes anaphase entry, constitutive Pmk1 activation leads to an increased percentage of metaphase-arrested cells. The authors have used genetic and environmental stress conditions to modulate MAP kinase signalling and demonstrate their effect on APC/C activation. This work provides evidence for the role of MAP kinases in cell cycle regulation in S. pombe and opens avenues for exploration of similar regulation in other eukaryotes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have done a very comprehensive experimental analysis to support their hypothesis. The data is well represented, and including a model in every figure summarizes the data well.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As mentioned in the comments, the manuscript does not establish that MAP kinase activity leads to genome stability when cells are subjected to genotoxic stressors. That would establish the importance of this pathway for checkpoint activation.</p>
