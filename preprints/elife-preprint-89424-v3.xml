<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Here, we investigated mechanisms by which aging-related reductions of the levels of Numb in skeletal muscle fibers contribute to loss of muscle strength and power, two critical features of sarcopenia. Numb is an adaptor protein best known for its critical roles in development including asymmetric cell division, cell-type specification and termination of intracellular signaling. Numb expression is reduced in old humans and mice. We previously showed that, in mouse skeletal muscle fibers, Numb is localized to sarcomeres where it is concentrated near triads; conditional inactivation of Numb and a closely related protein Numb-like (NumbL) in mouse myofibers caused weakness, disorganization of sarcomeres and smaller mitochondria with impaired function. Here, we found that a single knockout of Numb in myofibers causes reduction in tetanic force comparable to a double Numb, NumbL knockout. We found by proteomics analysis of protein complexes isolated from C2C12 myotubes by immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Numb, that Septin 7 is a potential Numb binding partner. Septin 7 is a member of the family of GTP-binding proteins that organize into filaments, sheets and rings, and is considered part of the cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence evaluation revealed a partial overlap of staining for Numb and Septin 7 in myofibers. Conditional, inducible knockouts of Numb led to disorganization of Septin 7 staining in myofibers. These findings indicate that Septin 7 is a Numb binding partner and suggest that interactions between Numb and Septin 7 are critical for structural organization of the sarcomere and muscle contractile function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A common consequence of aging is sarcopenia, which is characterized by declining skeletal muscle mass, muscle contractile force, muscle power and overall physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The causes of reduced contractile function and power of skeletal muscle in individuals who have sarcopenia remain incompletely understood. One candidate mechanism is the reduced expression of the adaptor protein Numb in muscle of older organisms. Numb mRNA expression is reduced in muscle biopsy samples during normal aging in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] and Numb protein levels are diminished in skeletal muscle of 24 month old mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Numb is an adaptor protein that is highly conserved from Drosophila to humans. Numb contributes to asymmetric cell division, specification of cell fate, trafficking of cell surface proteins such as integrins, and turnover of signaling molecules such as Notch, Hedgehog and p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. A role in mitochondrial fission and fusion has also been suggested in certain contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. In mammals, the Numb gene contains 10 exons and is expressed as one of four splice variants. The three shorter variants lack exons 3, 9 or both. Removal of exon 3 shortens the phosphotyrosine binding domain while removal of exon 9 truncates a proline-rich domain (Supplementary Figure 1).</p>
<p>Within skeletal muscle, Numb has dual roles. Its expression in satellite cells is critical for their proliferation and for tissue repair after muscle injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In skeletal muscle fibers, a conditional knockout (cKO) from myofibers of Numb and the closely related protein Numb-like (NumbL) reduced muscle contractility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Examination of muscle from mice with a double-knockout of Numb and NumbL by transmission electron microscope revealed perturbed muscle ultrastructure and altered mitochondrial morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Ultrastructural changes included increased spacing of Z-lines, staircasing of Z-lines, altered mitochondrial morphology and loss of the regular spacing of sarcoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. <italic>In-vitro</italic> experiments using mouse primary myotube cultures found that knockdown (KD) of Numb reduced myoblast fusion and mitochondrial function, and delayed caffeine-induced calcium release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. A subsequent study found that knockout (KO) of Numb in the heart led to cardiac dilation and altered cardiac and skeletal muscle sarcomere structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Since NumbL protein levels are very low or undetectable in adult skeletal muscle, we have posited that the effects of KD of Numb and NumbL on skeletal muscle ultrastructure and function are likely attributable to loss of Numb expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Molecular mechanisms by which Numb and NumbL organize the sarcomere and assure optimal calcium release during excitation-contraction coupling remain poorly understood. The interactome of Numb includes p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], Mdm2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], the LNX family of proteins which target Numb for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], and proteins involved in internalization and trafficking of membrane proteins, Eps 15 and α-Adaptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co- IP) experiments have shown that Numb binds sarcomeric α-actin and actinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and Numb has been proposed to participate in sarcomere assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The possibility that Numb binds other proteins present in myofibers has not been tested.</p>
<p>The goal of the current study was to better understand the molecular mechanisms by which the cKO of Numb in skeletal muscle myofibers perturbed muscle weakness. We began by comparing effects of a single knockout (sKO) of Numb or a double knockout (dKO) of Numb and NumbL on <italic>ex-vivo</italic> physiological properties of the <italic>extensor digitorium longus</italic> (EDL) muscle. We then examined Numb protein binding partners in C2C12 myotubes using a combination of immunoprecipitation (IP) and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) approaches. Our results identify Septins as Numb binding partners and provide evidence that loss of Numb perturbs the organization of Septin 7 within myofibers.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the James J. Peters Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and were conducted in accordance with requirements of the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Guide and all other applicable regulations. C57BL/6NCrl mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (strain # 027). Transgenic mice in which Numb and NumbL can be conditionally ablated in skeletal muscle by injection of tamoxifen were previously described and are referred to as HSA-MCM/Numb(f/f)/NumbL(f/f) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. To generate mice in which a conditional, inducible KO of Numb in myofibers could be achieved, these mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6NCrl mice and bred until mice heterozygous for the HSA-MCM cassette and homozygous for the floxed-Numb allele were obtained. KD of Numb/NumbL or Numb was done by intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen 2 mg/day for 5 days with one additional injection at day 10. The animals were sacrificed 14 days after the beginning of the induction. Controls were injected with vehicle (peanut oil). All mice were genotyped using genomic DNA isolated from ear snips as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Numb Protein Detection by Western Blot</title>
<p>Numb expression was evaluated by western blotting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. <italic>Tibialis anterior</italic> (TA) and EDL were homogenized using an MP homogenizer in RIPA buffer (#9806, Cell Signaling Technologies Inc., Danvers, MA) supplemented with a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Halt, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000rpm for 15 minutes and the supernatant saved. Protein concentration was determined with BCA reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fifty micrograms of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the Trans-Blot Turbo transfer pack (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris buffer saline 1% Tween-20 (TBS-T), 5% low-fat dry milk (blocking solution) and incubated overnight at 4°C with a rabbit monoclonal anti-Numb antibody (#2756, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA) at 1:1000 dilution in 5% BSA in TBS-T. Membranes were washed in TBST and incubated with HRP - conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at 1:2000 dilution in blocking solution (#7074, Cell Signaling Technology). Bands were revealed with ECL Prime reagent (Cytiva, Lifesciences, Piscataway, NJ) and imaged using the Amersham ImageQuant 800 imaging system (Cytiva). The blots were stripped and incubated with a rabbit monoclonal anti-GAPDH (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling #5174) as loading control. Western blots were quantified using ImageQuant TL software (Cytiva)</p>

<title>Tissue Harvest and Ex-vivo Physiology</title>
<p>Animals were weighed then anesthetized using inhaled 3% isoflurane. Hindlimb muscles were excised after careful blunt dissection. Measurement of whole-muscle contractile and mechanical properties was performed using an Aurora Scientific <italic>ex-vivo</italic> physiology system for mice (Aurora, Ontario, Canada). A 4-0 silk suture was tied to the proximal and distal tendons of intact right EDL, immediately distal to the aponeuroses, the muscles were dissected and immediately placed in a bath containing a Krebs mammalian Ringer solution at pH 7.4, supplemented with tubocurarine chloride (0.03 mM) and glucose (11 mM) for 10 min. The bath was maintained at 25°C and bubbled constantly with a mixture of O2 (95%) and CO2 (5%). The distal tendon of the muscle was then tied to a dual-mode servomotor/force transducer (Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Ontario, Canada) and the proximal tendon tied to a fixed hook. Using wave pulses delivered from platinum electrodes connected to a high-power bi-phasic current stimulator (Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Ontario, Canada) each EDL was stimulated to contract. The 610A Dynamic Muscle Control v5.5 software (Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Ontario, Canada) was used to control pulse properties and servomotor activity, and record data from the force transducer. Optimal length (Lo) was established for each EDL to develop an isometric twitch force. EDL muscles were stimulated with a single electrical pulse to produce a twitch response. Stimulation produced a maximal twitch response by adjusting small increments (or decrements) to longer (or shorter) lengths. Muscle was left resting at least 45 s between twitch responses. Lo was achieved when twitch force was maximal. A frequency-force relationship was established once Lo was achieved. Here, EDL muscles were stimulated at increasing frequencies (i.e. 10, 25, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 150 Hz). Stimulation was delivered for 300 msec, and muscles were left to rest for 1 min between successive stimuli. Maximum absolute isometric tetanic force (Po) was determined from the plateau of the frequency-force relationship. Muscle fatigue resistance during repetitive stimulation at 60Hz every second for a total of 100 stimuli (fatigue index; FI) was also evaluated. Muscles were then removed from the bath solution and weighed. All data collected were analyzed using the Dynamic Muscle Analysis v5.3 software (Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Ontario, Canada).</p>

<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>C2C12 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (Penicillin-Streptomycin (10,000 U/ml, ThermoFisher) until confluency was reached then switched to DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum and antibiotics to induce differentiation and formation of myotubes. Cells were differentiated for five days, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) and harvested with a cell scraper. At harvesting time, the cells had fused to form myotubes. The pellets were kept at -80 °C until used.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Numb Co-Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>Cell pellets were lysed in 25 mM Tris HCl pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100 supplemented with Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher) (IP buffer) for 30 minutes at 4 °C with occasional mixing. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 minutes and the supernatant saved. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA reagent as per the manufacturer instructions (ThermoFisher).</p>
<p>The extracts (1 mg protein) were pre-cleared with control 4%-Agarose resin (ThermoFisher) for 1h at 4 °C with constant rotation. The samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of a goat polyclonal anti-Numb (Abcam, Ab4147) which has been previously used in IP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] or with 1 μg of goat IgG (R&amp;D Systems, Ab108-e) as IP specificity control for 1.5 hrs at 4 °C under constant rotation. To capture the complexes, 25 μl of Protein A/G Plus (Santa Cruz, sc-2003) were added and the samples incubated as above for 75 minutes. The samples were centrifuged and the beads washed twice with IP buffer, 3 times with 25 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl (TBS) and once with 4 mM HEPES in 10 mM HCl. Elution of the immunoprecipitated proteins was performed by heating the samples at 37 °C for 1h with 0.3% SDS. The samples were centrifuged and supernatants were stored at -80°C.</p>
<p>Seven independent C2C12 samples were immunoprecipitated for the MS analysis, each pair (control IgG and anti-Numb) prepared on a different day from different cell culture samples. The Numb immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and gels stained with silver stain kit (Bio-Rad)</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Verification of Numb Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>Small scale immunoprecipitations were performed in parallel with the main IP to verify Numb IP. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 hr at 4 °C in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Tween-20 (TBS) supplemented with 0.5% non-fat dry milk (blocking solution), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit monoclonal anti-Numb antibody (Cell Signaling #2756) diluted 1:1000 in TBS/5% BSA. After washing with TBS, the blot was incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:8,000 dilution in blocking solution, Cytiva), the blot developed with ECL Prime reagent (Cytiva) and imaged with an Amersham ImageQuant 800 imager (Cytiva).</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Preparation of Immunoprecipitated Samples for LC/MS/MS Analysis</title>
<p>The volume of the immunoprecipitated samples was adjusted to 400 μl with MS grade water and 400 μl of methanol and 100 μl of chloroform were added. The samples were mixed with a vortex mixer for 1 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. The upper phase was removed without disturbing the proteins at the interphase and 400 μl of methanol were added. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes to pellet the proteins. The pellet was washed 3 times with ice-cold methanol, dried for 10 min at room temperature, resuspended in 30 μl of freshly made 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 8 M urea, 0.1M DTT and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen until analyzed. Cysteines were reduced and alkylated, and samples were loaded onto an S-trap micro column (Profiti C02-micro-80) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Proteins were digested in the trap with trypsin, eluted and lyophilized.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>LC/MS/MS Analysis</title>
<p>The analysis was performed using Q Exactive HF (Orbitrap) mass spectrometer coupled to an UltiMate 3000 ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (ThermoFisher). The peptides were separated with reversed-phase chromatography using a 75 μm ID x 50 cm Acclaim PepMap reversed phase C18, 2 µm particle size column and eluted from the Nano column with a multi- step acetonitrile/formic acid gradient.

<p>To obtain independent confirmation of Numb association with Septin 7, Numb IP was performed with anti-Numb antibody as described above. For this analysis we used three independently obtained samples of C2C12 myotubes different from those used for LC/MS/MS. The immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by Western blot using anti-rabbit polyclonal anti- Septin 7 (Proteintech, 13818-1-AP, 1:1000 dilution).

<title>Effect of Numb and Numb/NumbL cKO on Force Generation</title>
<p>To begin, we compared properties of EDL muscle during <italic>ex-vivo</italic> testing between mice with a single cKO of Numb or a double cKO of Numb and NumbL. As expected, Numb protein levels in muscle lysates were significantly lower in tamoxifen-treated HSA-MCM/Numb(<sup>f/f)</sup>) mice and HSA- MCM/Numb<sup>(f/f</sup>/NumbL<sup>(f/f)</sup>) mice at fourteen days after starting tamoxifen, as compared to vehicle- treated mice of the same genotype (Supplementary Figure 2). Next, <italic>ex-vivo</italic> contractile properties of the EDL muscle were compared for HSA-MCM/Numb(<sup>f/f)</sup>) mice and HSA- MCM/Numb<sup>(f/f</sup>/NumbL<sup>(f/f)</sup> mice at 14 days after starting induction with tamoxifen. A single cKO of Numb (HSA-MCM/Numb(<sup>f/f)</sup>) mice) markedly reduced tetanic force and twitch force generation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>). There was a genotype effect of single Numb cKO for fatigue index (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 A</xref>) while time to peak tension and half relaxation time were not changed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 B, C</xref>). As expected, EDL muscle from mice with a double Numb-NumbL cKO (HSA-MCM/Numb<sup>(f/f</sup>/NumbL<sup>(f/f)</sup> mice) demonstrated reductions in tetanic specific tension and maximum twitch force (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 A, B</xref>) without any change in time to peak tension, half-relaxation time or fatigue index (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 A-C</xref>). There was no apparent difference for either specific tetanic tension or maximum twitch force when comparing single HSA-MCM/Numb(<sup>f/f)</sup>) and double (HSA-MCM/Numb<sup>(f/f</sup>/NumbL<sup>(f/f)</sup> mice) cKO mice. These data indicate that most if not all of the reduction of force generating capacity observed in the Numb/NumbL double cKO line is attributable to inactivation of the Numb gene.</p>

<title>Analysis of Numb Splice Variants in the Myogenic Lineage</title>
<p>Given that Numb RNA can undergo alternative splicing to generate 4 different variants, and that alternative splicing shortens or removes protein-protein interaction domains, we sought to understand which splice variants of Numb were present in cells of the myogenic lineage in mice. Total RNA was extracted from mouse gastrocnemius muscle or from mouse C2C12 myoblasts then amplified using primers to sites flanking either exon 3 or exon 9 of mouse Numb mRNA (Supplementary Figure 1). No transcripts containing exon 9 were observed, and the majority of transcripts lacked exon 3, indicating that in skeletal muscle the primary form of Numb is that encoded by the shortest mRNA which lacks both exons 3 and 9. To gain some insight as to whether disease might alter Numb splice variants, this analysis was repeated for muscle at 7 days after sciatic nerve transection. No effect of denervation on splice variants present in muscle was observed (Supplementary Figure 1).</p>

<title>Numb Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>Having confirmed that Numb is responsible for most, if not all of the decrease in force production of muscle of our Numb/NumbL cKO mice, we sought to understand better how Numb participates in muscle force generating capacity. We determined the binding partners for Numb in cells of the myogenic lineage by proteomics analysis of protein complexes isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-Numb antibodies. For these experiments, we used C2C12 myotubes which are multinucleated cell syncitia that express actin, myosin and acetyl choline receptors and can be induced to contract by electrical stimulation. Using the methods described above, we were able to precipitate almost quantitatively Numb proteins when detergent was included in the cell lysis buffer. Yields were low when detergent was removed which we infer indicates that in C2C12 myotubes, Numb is localized to membranes or is bound to membrane-bound proteins. Due to the incompatibility of LC/MS/MS analysis with most detergents commonly used in protein chemistry, choices of detergent that could be used were limited. After much optimization, we used a buffer containing a reduced amount of Triton-X100 (0.1%) for immunoprecipitation and washed the IP with TBS to remove as much Triton-X100 as possible. We also found that heating the samples at 37 °C for 1 h in 0.3% SDS was a mild yet effective elution method.</p>
<p>As shown in Supplemental Figure 4A, using this method, we were able to immunoprecipitate Numb from 5-day differentiated C2C12 myotubes. Numb IP was verified by Western blot using a rabbit monoclonal anti-Numb antibody whose specificity was previously validated by showing loss of Numb expression in C2C12 lysates treated with a specific vivo morpholino oligonucleotide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study aimed to understand the molecular basis for the marked alterations in skeletal muscle ultrastructure, mitochondrial function, calcium release kinetics and force production caused by cKO of Numb and NumbL. Findings that a single, conditional and inducible KO of Numb in skeletal muscle fibers resulted in marked reductions of peak twitch and peak tetanic force that were similar, if not identical to those observed in a Numb/NumbL cKO confirm our conclusion that it was loss of Numb, rather than NumbL, that explained reduced muscle force production during <italic>in-situ</italic> physiologic testing in mice with a double Numb/NumbL KO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The loss in force generating capacity of EDL was observed by <italic>ex-</italic>vivo physiological testing as soon as 14 days after the first injection of tamoxifen indicating that deterioration of muscle in response to depletion of Numb occurs rapidly. These findings do not, formally, test if NumbL contributes to homeostasis of adult skeletal muscle fibers although the very low-level expression of NumbL in adult skeletal muscle suggests that a role for this gene is unlikely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Our approach to understanding how Numb contributed to the molecular physiology of skeletal muscle contractility relied on LC/MS/MS analysis of tryptic peptides of proteins immunoprecipitated from C2C12 myotubes using an anti-Numb antibody. By applying stringent criteria for identifying putative Numb binding partners, a total of 11 high-probability Numb binding proteins representing at least 6 different proteins or protein complexes was identified. None of these proteins were listed among the 209 known Numb-interacting proteins listed on the NCBI webpage for human Numb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8650#interactions">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8650#interactions</ext-link>). We believe these to be new, high-probability interactions, some of which may have muscle-specific roles.</p>
<p>The results support that conclusion that Septin 7 is an authentic binding partner of Numb within skeletal muscle fibers based on evidence that Numb pulls down Septin 7 from lysates of C2C12 myotubes, that Numb and Septin 7 colocalize within skeletal muscle fibers and that cKO of Numb and NumbL perturbs the distribution of Septin 7 immunostaining. The identification of three other septins as Numb binding partners is consistent with findings that septins form hetero-oligomers that self-organize into fibrils that can polymerize into sheets, filaments or rings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. The colocalization of Numb with Septin 7 is constrained to specific regions of the myofiber suggesting overlapping but distinct functions of each protein in organization of the sarcomere. For example, Septin 7 was detected without Numb immunostaining in several locations, including around the nuclear envelope, and in longitudinal streaks that traverse several sarcomeres. Why these proteins interact at some locations but not others is unclear. Possibilities are that splice variants of Septin 7 vary in their distribution based on proteins they interact with and that only some splice variants bind Numb. It may also be that interaction of Numb and Septin 7 is through a third yet to be identified protein that is localized near the triad, our proposed localization for Numb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Further study is needed to determine the explanation for the distribution of these two critical proteins.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that Numb may also interact with other septins such as septins 2, 9 and 10, which were also identified with a high level of confidence as Numb interacting proteins by our LC/MS/MS analysis. Our data do not allow us to determine if Numb binds directly to these septins. Septins contain highly conserved regions, and, consequently, if one such region of septin 7 interacts with Numb, then many septins would be expected to directly bind Numb through the same domain. However, because septins self-oligomerize, is possible that when Numb binds to one septin, antibodies against Numb could also pull down other septins present in the septin oligomer to which Numb is bound regardless of whether or not they are also bound by Numb.</p>
<p>Roles in muscle physiology of Homer3, RUVBL1, Wnk1 and TRAF7 remain uncertain. Homer1, a protein closely related to Homer3, has been implicated in interactions between the Cav1.2 subunit of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] and is expressed in skeletal muscle. Its expression levels also correlate with serum alkaline phosphatase levels (Supplemental Table 2 and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]). TRAF7 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase regulated by MyoD that ubiquitinates NF-kB targeting it for proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] to facilitate myogenic differentiation. Zc3hc1is another E3 ubiquitin ligase highly expressed in skeletal muscle known for its ability to target Cyclin B for proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.</p>
<p>Our interest in the role(s) of Numb in skeletal myofibers was stimulated in part by findings that its expression at the level of mRNA was reduced in older individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], a finding we confirmed at the protein level in muscles from C57B6 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The disorganization of Septin 7 immunostaining observed by day 14 after inducing Numb KD suggests that aging-related reduction of Numb expression may perturb organization of Septin 7 in a similar way though this prediction must be tested experimentally.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Numb binds Septin 7, a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in forming septin- based filaments, sheets and cages that serve as the ‘fourth component of the cytoskeleton’. The localization of these two proteins near the triad, together with binding of Homer 3 to Numb, strongly suggests that Numb and Septin 7 participate in organizing the triad though specific molecular interactions whose nature remains unclear. The interaction of Numb with septins have direct implications for understanding molecular physiology of skeletal muscle and broader implications for understanding roles of Numb and septins in biology.</p>

<p>The authors investigate the function of the PTB domain containing adaptor protein Numb in skeletal muscle structure and function. In particular, the effects of reduced Numb expression in aging muscle is proposed as a mechanism for reduced contractile function associated with sarcopenia. Using ex-vivo analysis of conditional Numb and Numblike knockout muscle the authors demonstrate that loss of Numb but not the related Numblike gene expression perturbs muscle force generation. In order to explore the molecular mechanisms involved, Numb interacting proteins were identified in C2C12 cell cultured myotubes by immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS. The authors identify Septin 7 as well as Septin 2, 9 and 10 as a Numb binding proteins and demonstrate that loss of Numb/Numblike in myofibers causes changes in Septin 7 subcellular localization. Of note, whether additional septins form a complex or are also disrupted by Numb/Numblike loss remains an interesting area for further investigation. Additional investigation of the specificity and mapping of the Numb-Septin 7 (or another Septin) interaction would be of interest and provide an approach for future studies to demonstrate the biological relevance and specificity of the Numb-Septin 7 interaction in skeletal muscle</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The main purpose of this investigation was to 1) compare the effects of a single knockout (sKO) of Numb or a double knockout (dKO) of Numb and NumbL on ex-vivo physiological properties of the extensor digitorium longus (EDL) muscle in C57BL/6NCrl mice; and 2) analyze protein complexes isolated from C2C12 myotubes via immunoprecipitation and LC/MS/MS for potential Numb binding partners. The main findings are 1) the muscles from sKO and dKO were significantly weaker with little difference between the sKO and dKO lines, indicating the reduced force is mainly due to the inactivation of the Numb gene; and 2) there were 11 potential Numb binding proteins that were identified and cytoskeletal specific proteins including Septin 7.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Straight-forward yet elegant design to help determine the important role the Numb has in skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There were a limited number of samples (3-6) that were used for the physiological experiments; however, there was a very large effect size in terms of differences in muscle tension development between the induced KO models and the controls.</p>

<p>1. While the specificity of the observed muscle phenotypes seems clear, the subsequent molecular analysis of Numb protein interactors does not seem to consider the potential involvement of Numb-like. The authors should demonstrate the relative expression levels of Numb and Numb-like in the models used, and establish the specificity of the antibodies used in IP, western and staining experiments.</p>

<p>Response: Perhaps the most convincing evidence that the anti-Numb antibody did not pull down Numb-like is that this protein was not detected among immunoprecipitated protein complexes pulled down by the anti-Numb antibody used. The antibody used in the immunoprecipitation was validated by the supplier and was previously reported to immunoprecipitate Numb [1, 2]. We previously demonstrated that a morpholino against Numb mRNA almost completely eliminated the band detected by this antibody and that this band was at the expected molecular weight [ref]. In our hands, mRNA levels for Numb-like in skeletal muscle are 5-10-fold lower than those for Numb [3]. We have been unable to detect Numb-like protein in healthy adult skeletal muscle by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence staining. Taking all of these findings together, it seems unlikely that the antibodies used for immunoprecipitating Numb-protein complexes pulls down Numb-like.</p>

<p>1. The authors use PCR to investigate Numb isoform expression and conclude that p65 is likely the dominant protein isoform expressed. While this agrees with the single band observed in Supp Figure 4A, a positive control for exon 9 excluded and included isoforms in the PCR reactions would strengthen this conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  The amplicons shown in Supplemental 4 were sequenced. The clones corresponded to the isoforms with the exon 3 present or removed. No amplicons containing exon 9 were detected. The following sentence was added to the Analysis of Splice Variants section of Methods to address this point: “PCR products were cloned using the TOPO TA cloning system (ThermoFisher) and multiple resulting clones were sequenced to confirm that the expected products were generated.”</p>

<p>1. PCR analysis of total Numb and Numb-like expression levels are not shown. This is important given the specificity of the Numb antibodies used for AP-MS experiments are not described and some Numb antibodies are well known to also recognize Numb-like. Two different Numb antibodies were used for Western and immunoprecipitation but the specificity for Numb and Numb-like is not described. In particular, does the antibody used in the AP-MS experiment recognize both Numb and Numb-like? Supplementary Table 1 does not list Numb or Numb-like, but presumably peptides were identified?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: As noted above, the specificity of anti-Numb antibodies was confirmed in previous studies [3]. Importantly, Numb-like mRNA levels are 5-10-fold lower than Numb mRNA, and NumbL protein is undetectable in healthy adult skeletal muscle by Western. The physiology data reported in this manuscript supports the conclusion that a single KO of Numb is sufficient to recapitulate the physiological phenotype of Numb/Numb-like KO . We therefore reason that the majority, if not all, of the physiological contribution of these proteins to muscle contractility due to Numb (Fig. 1).</p>

<p>1. The validation experiment used the same Numb antibody for immunoprecipitation, immunoblotted with Septin 7. A reciprocal IP of Septin 7 and blotted with Numb should be performed. In addition, a Numb-like IP or immunoblot would also be useful to demonstrate the specificity of the interaction. Efforts to map the interaction between Numb and Septin 7 would be useful to demonstrate specificity of the interaction and strategies to establish the biological relevance of the interaction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree with the reviewer and attempted several IPs with anti-Septin7 antibodies. These were unsuccessful. In a new collaboration, Dr. Italo Cavini (University of Sao Paulo)  has used machine-learning-based approaches to model binding between Numb and several septins, including Septin 7. The analysis suggests that binding of Numb with septins involves a domain of Numb that has not yet been ascribed a function in protein-protein interactions. These computational predictions require experimental validation but provide rational starting point for experiments to define the domains responsible for these interactions. Such experiments were included in our recent NIH R01 renewal application. We hope to be able to report on results of confirmatory experiments of these computational models in the future.</p>

<p>1. Other septins were identified in the AP-MS experiment and might have been anticipated to also be disrupted by Numb/Numb-like deletion. Are these septins known to interact in a complex?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: This is an excellent question. Septins have conserved motifs providing a clear reason to imagine that many different mammalian septins could directly interact with Numb. Septins form heterooligomers consisting of complexes formed by 3, 6 or 8 septins [4]. It is likely that when Numb binds to one septin, antibodies against Numb pull down other septins present in the septin oligomer to which Numb is bound. The following paragraph was added to the discussion: “Our findings suggest that Numb may also interact with other septins such as septins 2, 9 and 10, which were also identified with a high level of confidence as Numb interacting proteins by our LC/MS/MS analysis. Our data to not allow us to determine if Numb binds directly to these septins. Septins contain highly conserved regions, and, consequently, if one such region of septin 7 interacts with Numb, then many septins would be expected to directly bind Numb through the same domain. However, because septins self-oligomerize, is possible that when Numb binds to one septin, antibodies against Numb could also pull down other septins present in the septin oligomer to which Numb is bound regardless of whether or not they are also bound by Numb. “</p>
