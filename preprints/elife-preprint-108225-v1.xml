<title>Abstract</title><p>The essential outcome of a successful mating is the transfer of genetic material from males to females in sexually reproducing animals from insects to mammals. In males, this culminates in ejaculation, a precisely timed sequence of organ contractions driven by the concerted activity of interneurons, sensory neurons, and motor neurons. Although central command circuits that trigger copulation have been mapped, the motor architecture and the chemical logic that couple specific neuronal subclasses to organ specific contractility, seminal fluid secretion, and sperm emission remain largely uncharted. This gap in knowledge limits our ability to explain how neural circuits adapt to varying contexts and how their failure contributes to infertility. Here we present an in-depth anatomical and functional analysis of the motor neurons that innervate the internal male reproductive tract of Drosophila melanogaster. We identify two classes of multi-transmitter motor neurons based on neurotransmitter usage, namely octopamine and glutamate neurons (OGNs) and serotonin and glutamate neurons (SGNs), each with a biased pattern of innervation: SGNs predominate in the accessory glands, OGNs in the ejaculatory duct, with equal contributions of each to the seminal vesicles. Both classes co-express vesicular transporters for glutamate (vGlut) and amines (vMAT), confirming their dual chemical identity. Their target organs differentially express receptors for glutamate, octopamine, and serotonin, suggesting combinatorial neuromodulation of contractility. Functional manipulations show that SGNs are essential for male fertility but OGNs are dispensable. Glutamatergic transmission from both classes is also dispensable for fertility. These findings provide the first high-resolution map linking multi-transmitter motor neurons to specific reproductive organs, reveal an unexpected division of labor between serotonergic and octopaminergic signaling pathways, and establish a framework for dissecting conserved neural principles that govern ejaculation and male fertility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reproduction is a biological imperative of all species. For most sexually reproducing animal species, this involves locating a mate, courtship, and most essentially, the transfer of genetic material via copulation. The endpoint of copulation, ejaculation, consists of two coordinated phases, emission and expulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alwaal et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Soni et al. 2022</xref>). During the emission phase, sperm and seminal fluid are relocated from their site of origin to a central canal for transfer to the female during the subsequent expulsion phase. The series of events that culminate in ejaculation are regulated by a spinal ejaculation generator located in the lumbar L3-L4 region of the spinal cord of mammals that executes a motor program coordinating a series of muscle contractions and relaxations of the internal and external male genitalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Truitt and Coolen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Carro-Juarez et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Chehensse et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>While male external genitalia exhibit remarkable evolutionary variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Eberhard 1985</xref>), internal male reproductive organs exhibit remarkable evolutionary conservation over the last 600 million years since the last common ancestor of insects and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Guerrero et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Gomes et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Beguelini et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Tomas et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Fromme et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Oliveira et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yartsev and Evseeva 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Maciel et al. 2024</xref>). These evolutionarily conserved structures of the male reproductive system include paired testes, seminal vesicles (SVs), and semen producing organs (prostate glands in humans, accessory glands (AGs) in insects), as well as a singular duct (urethra in humans, ejaculatory duct (ED) in insects) through which sperm and seminal fluid flow during mating.</p>
<p>Drosophila melanogaster has been instrumental in revealing fundamental principles of male reproductive behavior and physiology that extend beyond insects, including how neural circuits control mating drive, courtship, and the mechanics and duration of copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acebes et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Billeter et al. 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Villella and Hall 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Tayler et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Crickmore and Vosshall 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Pavlou et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jois et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baker et al. 2024</xref>). Among the findings of these studies is the existence of neural circuitry in the ventral nerve cord that regulates ejaculation similar to the spinal ejaculation generator circuitry of mammals, suggesting an ancient evolutionary origin. How the motor neurons directly innervating the internal male reproductive organs control the events leading to ejaculation is less well understood. It is also known in Drosophila and other species, including humans, that male ejaculate quality is plastic and can be adapted to environmental conditions, especially the level of male-male competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Gage and Baker 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Wedell and Cook 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Pizzari et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Pound and Gage 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bretman et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Garbaczewska et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Hopkins et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Delecce et al. 2025</xref>), but the neural mechanisms underlying these adaptations remain to be identified.</p>
<p>Previous studies have determined there are at least three types of motor neurons innervating the Drosophila internal male reproductive system distinguished by neurotransmitter usage including serotonergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Lee and Hall 2001</xref>), octopaminergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Pauls et al. 2018</xref>), and glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Pavlou et al. 2016</xref>) motor neurons, although there may be at least some overlap in neurotransmitter usage as serotonin/glutamate multi-transmitter motor neurons have been reported in the seminal vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Castellanos et al. 2013</xref>). How these neurons coordinate the motor program to elicit ejaculation is an open question, as is their anatomical organization relative to each other. Clarifying the targets and anatomy of these motor neuron classes will uncover critical principles for how neuronal coordination of internal male reproductive organ function contributes to male fertility. To address these questions, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the neurons innervating each internal organ, defined their neurotransmitter complements and receptor profiles, and tested their necessity for successful sperm transfer and fecundity.</p>

<title>Drosophila male reproductive system anatomy</title>
<p>The Drosophila male reproductive system consists of paired testes, SVs, and AGs, as well as a singular ED and ejaculatory bulb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Demerec 1950</xref>). The testes are surrounded by smooth muscle with no neuronal innervation, while the SVs, AGs, and ED are ensheathed by neuronally innervated skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Lee and Hall 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Billeter <italic>et al</italic>. 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Susic-Jung <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). The ejaculatory bulb also possesses neuronally innervated skeletal muscle for pumping sperm out of the ED to the female. The SVs fuse just prior to termination in the ED where they form a narrow sphincter that opens during mating to allow sperm to flow. The AGs, insect equivalent of mammalian prostate glands, produce the bulk of seminal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Wolfner 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Majane et al. 2022</xref>) and remain separate before terminating in the ED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bairati 1968</xref>). Underlying the muscles of the internal male reproductive system organs are a layer of secretory epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bairati 1968</xref>) that are the cellular source of the seminal fluid components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Sepil et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Wigby et al. 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Neurotransmitter identity of neurons innervating internal male reproductive organs</title>
<p>To confirm previous reports of innervation of the Drosophila male reproductive system by octopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic neurons, GAL4 drivers for the octopamine (OA) neurotransmitter synthesis enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (Tdc2), the serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurotransmitter synthesis enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TRH) and the vesicular glutamate transporter (vGlut) were used to drive expression of a <italic>UAS-CD8-mCherry</italic> plasma membrane reporter.

<title>OA/glutamate neurons are distinct from 5-HT/glutamate neurons</title>
<p>To determine if the observed neuronal expression of the GAL4 drivers for Tdc2, TRH, and vGlut are coincident or exclusive, two separate approaches were implemented. In the first approach, split-GAL4 drivers specific for each neurotransmitter were tested in pairwise combinations. Both <italic>Tdc2-AD</italic> paired with <italic>vGlut-GAL4-DBD</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, D</xref>) and <italic>vGlut-AD</italic> paired with <italic>Tdc2-GAL4-DBD</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, E</xref>) exhibited expression patterns very similar to <italic>Tdc2-GAL4</italic> with dense innervation of the SV and ED, and sparse innervation of the AGs. These results suggest that all the Tdc2 neurons innervating the male reproductive system are OA/glutamate dual neurotransmitter neurons (OGNs).</p>
<p>Similarly, both <italic>TRH-AD</italic> paired with <italic>vGlut-GAL4-DBD</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, F</xref>) and <italic>vGlut-AD</italic> paired with <italic>TRH-GAL4-DBD</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, G</xref>) exhibited expression patterns very similar to <italic>TRH-GAL4</italic> with dense innervation of the SVs and AGs with modest innervation of the ED. These results suggest that all the serotonergic neurons innervating the male reproductive system are 5-HT/glutamate dual neurotransmitter neurons (SGNs). To determine if there is overlap between the OGNs and SGNs, <italic>Tdc2-AD</italic> was paired with <italic>TRH-GAL4-DBD</italic> with the result that no neuronal expression was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, H</xref>). This result suggests the OGNs and SGNs are exclusive and non-overlapping.</p>
<p>A second approach to assess overlap between octopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic neurons of the male reproductive system utilized pairwise combinations of GAL4 and LexA drivers specific for each neurotransmitter. Pairing <italic>TRH-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Tdc2-LexA</italic> together with <italic>UAS-6XGFP</italic> and <italic>LexAop-6XmCherry</italic> reporters revealed no overlap in either the SVs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, A-F</xref>), ED (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, G-L</xref>), or AGs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, M-R</xref>). These results are consistent with the split-GAL4 result above of no intersection between octopaminergic and serotonergic neurons of the male reproductive system, although both neuron types are often tightly fasciculated, especially in the SVs. Pairing <italic>vGlut-LexA</italic> with <italic>TRH-GAL4</italic> revealed a high degree of overlap in the SVs (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figures 3S1, A-F</xref>), partial overlap in the ED (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figures 3S1, G-L</xref>), and near complete overlap in the AGs (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figures 3S1, M-R</xref>). Pairing <italic>vGlut-LexA</italic> with <italic>Tdc2-GAL4</italic> revealed significant overlap in the SVs (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figures 3S2, A-F)</xref>, majority overlap in the ED (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3S2, G-L</xref>), and limited overlap in the AGs (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figures 3S2, M-R</xref>). The results of the split-GAL4 intersectional strategy and the GAL4/LexA overlap strategy are entirely consistent with each other.</p>

<p>Taken together, they demonstrate that the Drosophila internal male reproductive system receives input from two distinct and nonoverlapping motor-neuron populations, one population that co-expresses octopamine and glutamate (OGNs) and another distinct population that co-expresses serotonin and glutamate (SGNs). The SV receives roughly equal innervation from both classes, the AG is innervated more extensively by SGNs, and the ED is innervated more extensively by OGNs.</p>

<p>Neurons that innervate the male reproductive tract are expected to be sexually dimorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Billeter and Goodwin 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Yamamoto 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Siwicki and Kravitz 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Verhulst and Van de Zande 2015</xref>).

To examine <italic>dsx</italic> expression, the octopaminergic driver <italic>Tdc2-AD</italic> was combined with <italic>dsx-GAL4-DBD</italic>. The resulting pattern (dense terminals in the SVs and ED, sparse arbors in the AGs; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3S3, D</xref>) matched that of <italic>Tdc2-GAL4</italic> alone, indicating that all OGNs are <italic>dsx</italic>-positive. In contrast, pairing the serotonergic <italic>TRH-AD</italic> with <italic>dsx-GAL4-DBD</italic> produced no signal in the reproductive tract (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3S3, E</xref>), showing that SGNs are <italic>dsx</italic>-negative. Together, these experiments establish that OGNs are <italic>fru</italic>+/<italic>dsx</italic>+, whereas SGNs are <italic>fru</italic>+/<italic>dsx</italic>–, underscoring a molecular distinction between the two neuromodulatory inputs to the male reproductive system.</p>

<title>Non-overlapping expression of TβH and Tdc2 with 5-HT confirms exclusivity of OGNs and SGNs</title>
<p>Several predictions follow from the finding that non-overlapping sets of OGNs and SGNs innervate the male reproductive system. Among these are that the neurotransmitter synthesis enzymes for OA, Tyramine-β-hydroxylase (TβH), and Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (Tdc2) should be exclusively expressed in the OGNs along with the sole Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter (vGlut), while 5-HT should be exclusively expressed in the SGNs along with vGlut-40XV5. To test these predictions, vGlut-40XV5 expression was separately assessed in combination with TβH or Tdc2. 5-HT expression, visualized with an anti-5-HT antibody, was also included in this analysis to distinguish SGNs. As predicted, extensive vGlut-40XV5 expression was observed throughout the male reproductive system except for the testes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4, A</xref> and G) with a sharp boundary of neuronal innervation at the testicular duct (arrows, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, A</xref>).</p>

<p>Also as predicted, TβH-GFP and Tdc2 were observed in the male reproductive system with expression patterns similar to that of <italic>Tdc2-GAL4</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4, B</xref> and H, respectively). Pairwise combinations of overlapping expression of vGlut-40XV5, 5-HT, and either TβH (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4, D-F</xref>) or Tdc2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4, J-L</xref>) are also shown.</p>
<p>Higher resolution images of vGlut-40XV5, TβH-GFP, Tdc2, and 5-HT in the male reproductive system allow an assessment of overlapping expression. In the SV, broad robust expression was observed for vGlut-40XV5 (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figures 4S1, A, G, M, and S</xref>) and 5-HT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4S1, C, I, O, and U</xref>), with somewhat more restricted expression for TβH-GFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S1, B and H</xref>) and Tdc2 (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S1, N, T</xref>). Pairwise overlapping expression is also shown for vGlut-40XV5 and 5-HT with TβH-GFP (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figures 4S1, D-F and J-L</xref>) and Tdc2 (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figures 4S1, P-R and V-X</xref>). In the highest resolution images, coincident expression is evident between vGlut-40XV5 with TβH-GFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S1, J</xref>) and vGlut-40XV5 with Tdc2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4W</xref> S1, V). Consistent with results above, exclusivity of expression is apparent between TβH-GFP and 5-HT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S1, L</xref>) and between Tdc2 and 5-HT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S1, X</xref>), although the tight fasciculation of OGNs and SGNs is evident.</p>
<p>Similar results were obtained in higher resolution images of the ED and AGs although the extent of innervation of the different amines varies between these tissues with more OGNs than SGNs in the ED and the reciprocal in the AGs. In higher resolution images of the ED, strong extensive expression was observed for vGlut-40XV5 (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figures 4S2, A, G, M, and S</xref>) with moderately less expression for TβH-GFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S2, B and H</xref>) and Tdc2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S2, N, T</xref>), with significantly less expression of 5-HT (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figures 4S2, C, I, O, and U</xref>. Pairwise overlapping expression is also shown for vGlut-40XV5 and 5-HT with TβH-GFP (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figures 4S2, D-F and J-L</xref>) and Tdc2 (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figures 4S2, P-R and V-X</xref>). In the highest resolution images, coincident expression is evident between vGlut-40XV5 with TβH-GFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S2, J</xref>) and vGlut-40XV5 with Tdc2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S2, V</xref>). As in the SV, exclusivity of expression is apparent between TβH-GFP and 5-HT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S2, L</xref>) and between Tdc2 and 5-HT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S2, X</xref>), also with tight fasciculation of the OGNs and SGNs.</p>
<p>In higher resolution images of the AGs, robust widespread expression was observed for vGlut-40XV5 (<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Figures 4S3, A, G, M, and S</xref>) and 5-HT (<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Figures 4S3, C, I, O, and U</xref>, with no expression of TβH-GFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S3, B and H</xref>), and sparse expression of Tdc2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S3, N, T</xref>). Pairwise overlapping expression is also shown for vGlut-40XV5 and 5-HT with TβH-GFP (<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Figures 4S3, D-F and J-L</xref>) and Tdc2 (<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Figures 4S3, P-R and V-X</xref>). In the highest resolution images, coincident expression is evident between vGlut-40XV5 and Tdc2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S3, V</xref>). As in the SV and ED, exclusivity of expression is apparent between Tdc2 and 5-HT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S3, X</xref>).</p>
<p>The expression of vGlut-40XV5, TβH-GFP, and 5-HT was also assessed at the junction of the SVs and AGs with the ED. vGlut-40XV5 innervation of both the SV and AG is particularly dense (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S4, A</xref>). Significant expression of TβH-GFP and 5-HT was also observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S, B and C</xref>, respectively). Pairwise overlapping expression for vGlut-40XV5, TβH-GFP, and 5-HT is also shown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S4, D-F</xref>).</p>
<p>These experiments showing no overlap in expression of TβH-GFP and Tdc2 with 5-HT provide additional support to the exclusivity of OGNs and SGNs. Collectively, these findings confirm that octopaminergic vGlut-positive and serotonergic vGlut-positive motor neurons form distinct, nonoverlapping populations that differentially innervate the Drosophila male reproductive tract, underscoring strict transmitter exclusivity within this circuit.</p>

<p>Co-labeling of vGlut-40XV5 with TβH / Tdc2 in OGNs and with 5-HT in SGNs implies both neuron types are multi-transmitter and predicts they will express not only vGlut but also the sole Drosophila monoamine vesicular transporter vMAT known to package both OA and 5-HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Deshpande <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>).

<p>In a reciprocal experiment in the SV using the <italic>Tdc2-GAL4</italic> driver and 5-HT immunostaining, both vGlut-40XMYC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, M</xref> and Q) and 6XV5-vMAT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, N</xref> and R) were detected with a mostly overlapping distribution (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, U</xref>). 5-HT immunostaining was in close proximity but did not overlap with any of the other markers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, V-X</xref>). It is also notable that the morphology of the SGNs is distinct from the OGNs with the SGNs being larger and more extensively branched compared to the OGNs (SGNs-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5, D</xref> and H; OGNs-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5, P</xref> and T), suggesting SGNs may assert more regulatory control of SV muscle activity than OGNs.</p>
<p>Similar results were obtained in these co-conditional experiments for the ED and AGs.

<p>Since OGNs and SGNs are intermingled in tightly fasciculated neuron bundles, we used intersectional labeling to visualize the glutamate transporter vGlut-40XV5 and the monoamine transporter 6XV5-vMAT in each class separately. Together, the results show that both vesicular transporters are expressed in OGNs and SGNs in an overlapping distribution while the OGNs and SGNs remain anatomically distinct throughout the male reproductive tract.</p>

<title>Expansion microscopy reveals prominent co-occurrence of vGlut and vMAT on ED synaptic vesicles of both OGNs and SGNs</title>
<p>Although there is apparent overlap between vGlut-40XMYC and 6XV5-vMAT in both SGNs and OGNs it is not possible to resolve whether they reside on the same or different synaptic vesicles using standard microscopy methods. This constraint is due to the ∼250nm diffraction limit of light at visible wavelengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbe 1873</xref>). To overcome this limitation, expansion microscopy was performed on EDs using co-conditional expression of vGlut-40XMYC and 6XV5-vMAT separately in SGNs and OGNs as above. The protocol utilized in these experiments reported 10X expansion in a single round (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Damstra et al. 2023</xref>) and this agreed well with our empirically determined expansion factor of 10.47X based on the size comparison of nuclei area in muscles of the unexpanded and expanded EDs (<xref rid="fig5s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5S5, A</xref> and B, respectively). In a representative example of expanded SGNs, 6XV5-vMAT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5S3, A</xref>) and vGlut-40XMYC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5S3, B</xref>) revealed a significantly overlapping distribution (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5S3, C</xref>). To quantify the co-occurrence of vGlut-40XMYC and 6XV5-vMAT the BIOP JACop ImageJ plug-in was used to calculate a Mander’s co-efficient, a metric that calculates the fraction of one signal that co-occurs with another. The output of the BIOP JACop plug-in revealed substantial co-occurrence of 6XV5-vMAT and vGlut-40XMYC (<xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figures 5S3, D-I</xref>) including a graphical representation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5S3, J</xref>). For the SGNs, the numerical Mander’s coefficients for 6XV5-vMAT co-occurrence with vGlut-40XMYC were 67.9% and vGlut-40XMYC co-occurrence with 6XV5-vMAT were 57.2% (<xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5S3, K</xref>).</p>
<p>Expanded OGNs yielded similar results. In a representative example, 6XV5-vMAT (<xref rid="fig5s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 5S4, A</xref>) and vGlut-40XMYC (<xref rid="fig5s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 5S4, B</xref>) exhibited substantial overlap (<xref rid="fig5s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 5S4, C</xref>). The output of the BIOP JACop plug-in also revealed majority co-occurrence in image (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5S4, D-I</xref>) and graphical form (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5S4, J</xref>). For the OGNs, the numerical values of the Mander’s coefficients were 67.4% for 6XV5-vMAT co-occurrence with vGlut-40XMYC and 75.6% for vGlut-40XMYC co-occurrence with 6XV5vMAT (<xref rid="fig5s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 5S4, K</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of the expansion microscopy experiments indicate that in both SGNs and OGNs the majority of ED synaptic vesicles are positive for both vGlut-40XMYC and 6XV5-vMAT and thereby they co-release glutamate and either OA (OGNs) or 5-HT (SGNs). This demonstration of a neurotransmitter co-release mechanism may be a conserved strategy for synchronizing rapid gland and muscle activity during copulation that has general implications across species for how co-transmitter neurons mediate complex motor behaviors.</p>

<title>OGNs and SGNs express synaptic markers common to other neuromuscular junctions</title>
<p>In addition to providing information on whether a given synapse is primarily excitatory or modulatory, identifying vesicular transporters and synaptic markers allows mapping of active release sites to determine how pre- and post-synaptic specializations align. Such information is essential for (i) elucidating how each neurotransmitter influences muscle contractility and secretory function, and (ii) predicting how synaptic efficacy might change during prolonged copulation or in response to neuromodulatory feedback. To further characterize the synapses of the neurons innervating the male reproductive system immunostaining was performed with vGlut-40XMYC, 6XV5-vMAT, and either of three well-established Drosophila synaptic markers including Synapsin (Syn)-synaptic vesicles, Bruchpilot (Brp)-active zones, and Discs-large (Dlg-Drosophila homolog of mammalian PSD-95)-post-synaptic density. In the SV, strong Syn staining was observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6, C</xref> and F) that exhibited extensive co-localization with vGlut-40XMYC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, H</xref>) and 6XV5-vMAT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, I</xref>).

<p>The active zone marker Brp exhibited strong expression in the SV (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6S1, C and G</xref>) that overlapped almost entirely with 6XV5-vMAT. Brp expression in the ED and AG was noticeably sparser as compared to the SV. The sparse Brp expression in the ED (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6S1, K and O</xref>) overlapped with 6XV5-vMAT. Similarly, in the AGs, Brp expression was sparse and overlapped with 6XV5-vMAT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6S1, S and W</xref>.</p>
<p>The post-synaptic density marker Dlg was expressed broadly throughout the male reproductive system (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6S2, C</xref>). In the SV, the bulk of Dlg expression is predominantly in the epithelial cells with lower levels of expression in the muscles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6S2, G and K</xref>) and no preferential post-synaptic accumulation (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figures 6S2, H and L</xref>. Similar results were observed in the ED and AGs. In the ED at the level of the muscle Dlg expression is diffuse (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6S2, O</xref> and does not accumulate post-synaptically opposite synapses in the muscles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6S2, P</xref>. In the AGs, Dlg expression is also diffuse in the muscles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6S2, T</xref> and does not accumulate post-synaptically opposite synapses in the muscle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C, U</xref>). Images of Dlg expression in the epithelial layer of the ED (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C, Q</xref>) and AG (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C, V</xref>) reveal apparent membrane localization in a honeycomb pattern. The lack of post-synaptic accumulation of Dlg opposite the synapses of SGNs and OGNs in the male reproductive system is reminiscent of larval type II OGNs and distinct from larval type I glutamatergic neurons that exhibit prominent post-synaptic concentration of Dlg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Parnas et al. 2001</xref>). It is also notable that there is no vGlut-40XMYC that does not co-localize with 6XV5-vMAT, indicating there are no neurons innervating the SVs, AGs, or ED that uses glutamate as their sole small molecule neurotransmitter. The absence of synapses with post-synaptic Dlg accumulation, a characteristic of type I glutamate-only larval neurons, also supports this assertion. Defining the molecular architecture of these synapses is critical for understanding how they package, release, and receive neurotransmitters to shape the strength and specificity of communication between motor neurons and target organs.</p>

<p>In addition to synaptic transmission via synaptic vesicles, neurons are also known to communicate using neuropeptides released via Large Dense Core Vesicles (LDCVs).</p>

In the ED, prominent IA2-GFP expression was evident (<xref rid="fig6s4" ref-type="fig">Figures 6S4, C and I</xref> that partially co-localized with vGlut-40XMYC (<xref rid="fig6s4" ref-type="fig">Figures 6S4, E and K</xref> and 6XV5-vMAT (<xref rid="fig6s4" ref-type="fig">Figures 6S4, F and L</xref>. Considerable IA2-GFP expression was also apparent in the AGs (<xref rid="fig6s4" ref-type="fig">Figures 6S4, O and U</xref> that partially overlapped with vGlut-40XMYC (<xref rid="fig6s4" ref-type="fig">Figures 6S4, Q and W</xref> and 6XV5-vMAT (<xref rid="fig6s4" ref-type="fig">Figures 6S4, R and X</xref>. This finding of pronounced expression of IA2-GFP throughout the pre-synaptic terminals of neurons innervating the male reproductive system suggest substantial LDCVs are present in both SGNs and OGNs, and that these neurons are thus communicating not just via small molecule neurotransmitters inside synaptic vesicles but also by neuropeptides contained within LDCVs.</p>

<title>No cholinergic or GABAergic transmission at OGN or SGN synapses</title>
<p>Although to our knowledge there have been no motor neurons reported in Drosophila that use acetylcholine or GABA as a neurotransmitter, to rule out these possibilities for the male reproductive system, Drosophila containing genome-edited 7XMYC-vAChT and 9XV5-vGAT were immunostained for their corresponding epitope tags. Not unexpectedly, no expression of 7XMYC-vAChT was observed in the SVs, ED, or AGs (<xref rid="fig6s5" ref-type="fig">Figures 6S5, C, G, and K</xref>, respectively. Similarly, no expression of 9XV5-vGAT was observed in the SVs, ED, or AGs (<xref rid="fig6s5" ref-type="fig">Figures 6S5, D, H, and L</xref>, respectively), indicating that neither acetylcholine nor GABA are used as neurotransmitters in the OGNs and SGNs of the Drosophila internal male reproductive system.</p>

<title>GAL4 drivers for OA, 5-HT, and glutamate receptors express in the muscles of male reproductive organs</title>
<p>Given that OGNs and SGNs innervate the male reproductive system, an obvious prediction that follows is that neurotransmitter receptors for glutamate, OA, and 5-HT should be expressed in the muscles of the male reproductive system. As a first step in testing this prediction, GAL4 drivers for each of these neurotransmitters were paired with the <italic>UAS-CD8-mCherry</italic> reporter and assessed for expression. As it is well established that the GluRIIA-E/kainate type glutamate receptors mediate synaptic transmission at Drosophila NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Diantonio 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">He and Dickman 2025</xref>), GAL4 drivers for all five were assessed. GAL4 drivers for GluRIIA, GluRIID, and GluRIIE showed no expression in the male reproductive system, but they also exhibited no expression in other adult or larval muscles where they are known to be expressed. These results suggest that the GAL4 drivers for these three GluRII receptors are simply non-functional and are therefore non-informative. However, GluRIIB-GAL4 and GluRIIC-GAL4 exhibited broad expression in the musculature of the male reproductive system (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7, A</xref> and B, respectively). This suggests glutamate is used for signaling throughout the male reproductive system, consistent with the widespread expression of vGlut in pre-synaptic terminals.</p>

<p>OA receptor GAL4 drivers for OAMB, OAα2R, Oct-TyrR, OAβ1R, OAβ2R, and OAβ3R were assessed for expression in the male reproductive system. OAMB-GAL4 exhibited expression in the muscles of the SVs and ED, as well as epithelial cells of the AGs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7S1, A</xref>. OAα2R-GAL4 displayed strong expression in the muscles of the SVs, weak expression in the muscles of the AGs, and no expression in the ED (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7S1, B</xref>. Oct-TyrR-GAL4 showed strong expression in non-muscle cells of the distal AG, muscle expression in the AGs, ED, and ejaculatory bulb, expression in the testes, but no expression in the muscles of the SVs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7S1, C</xref>. OAβ2R-GAL4 exhibited strong expression in the epithelial cells of the ED, muscle expression in the SVs, ED, and ejaculatory bulb, expression in the testes, but no muscle expression in the AGs (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7S1, E</xref>. OAβ1R-GAL4 and OAβ3R-GAL4 exhibited broad expression in the neurons innervating the male reproductive system (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figures 7S1, D and F</xref>, respectively but no muscle expression, suggesting they are not mediating OA signaling in the muscles. OAβ3R-GAL4 also displayed expression in the testes. These results suggest OA receptors play a prominent role in the functioning of the male reproductive system and differentially mediate OA signaling in specific parts of the male reproductive system based on their restricted, non-uniform expression patterns.</p>
<p>5-HT receptor GAL4 drivers for 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT-1B, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT7 were also assessed for expression in the male reproductive system. 5-HT1A-GAL4, 5-HT1B-GAL4, and 5-HT2B-GAL4 exhibited broad expression in the neurons innervating the male reproductive system, but no muscle expression (<xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figures 7S2, A, C, and D</xref>, respectively, suggesting these receptors are not mediating 5-HT signaling in the muscles. 5-HT2A exhibited expression specifically in the epithelial cells of the SVs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7S2, B</xref>. 5-HT7 showed substantial expression in neurons, but most strikingly, strong expression in the muscles of the distal SVs, including the sphincter region, with a discrete boundary of expression (arrows, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7S2, E</xref>.</p>

<title>GluRIIA is expressed in the SVs and AGs, but not the ED</title>
<p>While informative for determining cellular expression, GAL4 driven reporters for genes of interest do not provide critical mechanistic information about the subcellular distribution of the corresponding proteins. To gain further insight into the role of OA, 5-HT, and glutamate receptors in the function of the male reproductive system the expression patterns of several receptors were assessed using epitope-tagging. To determine the subcellular distribution of the ionotropic GluRII/kainate-type glutamate receptors known to mediate fast excitatory glutamatergic transmission at other Drosophila NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Diantonio 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">He and Dickman 2025</xref>), the expression of a previously characterized genome-edited GluRIIA-GFP fly strain in which GFP has been inserted near the carboxy-terminus of GluRIIA at its endogenous genomic location was evaluated in the male reproductive system. In the SV, GluRIIA-GFP (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8, B</xref> and E) exhibited punctate expression that paralleled, but was complementary to, that of the glutamatergic synaptic vesicle marker vGlut-40XV5 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8, A</xref> and D). This distribution of GluRIIA-GFP is not unlike its distribution at the NMJ of third instar larva, optimally localized post-synaptically to bind glutamate released from pre-synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Beckers <italic>et al</italic>. 2024</xref>). Surprisingly, no GluRIIA-GFP was observed in the ED (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8, H</xref> and K) despite abundant expression of vGlut-40XV5 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8, G</xref> and J). Expression of GluRIIA-GFP in the AGs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8, N</xref> and Q) was similar to that in the SVs in that it closely paralleled vGlut-40XV5 expression (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8, M</xref> and P) but was complementary to it. Finding GluRIIA-GFP expression in the SVs and AGs, but not the ED, and the expression of GluRIIB in all three tissues based on the <italic>GluRIIB-GAL4</italic> expression pattern, suggest the SVs and AGs use a mixture of glutamate receptors containing one or the other of the mutually exclusive GluRIIA or GluRIIB subunits in combination with the common GluRIIC, D, and E subunits, while all glutamate receptors in the ED solely utilize GluRIIB. As GluRII receptors containing GluRIIA generate higher currents than those that contain GluRIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Diantonio et al. 1999</xref>), the lower GluRIIB currents are apparently sufficient for a functional ED.</p>

<title>OA receptors exhibit distinct expression patterns in the muscles, neurons, and epithelial cells of the male reproductive system</title>
<p>OA receptors are modulatory G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate slower-acting but longer-lasting effects than ionotropic receptors. To visualize expression of the OA receptors OAMB, OAα2R, and OAβ2R, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was used to create conditional alleles of each receptor fused at their carboxy termini to a multimerized epitope tag for enhanced detection sensitivity. These genome edits are at the endogenous genomic location of each gene and their expression is thus under the control of their complete endogenous regulatory regions. For visualizing expression in the male reproductive system, germline inversion or excision variants were generated that converted conditional expression to constitutive expression.</p>
<p>OAMB-10XV5 exhibited strong expression in the epithelial cells of the ED and AGs with limited expression in muscles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S1, A</xref>. Co-immunostaining with the synaptic vesicle marker Synapsin was conducted to visualize pre-synaptic terminals (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S1, B</xref>. In the SVs, higher resolution images revealed low level expression of OAMB-10XV5 in muscles as well as obvious expression in pre-synaptic neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S1, D and G</xref> that largely overlapped with Syn (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S1, F and I</xref>. OAMB-10XV5 was similarly distributed in the ED with low-level expression in muscle and clearly discernible expression in pre-synaptic neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S1, J</xref> based on substantial overlap with Syn (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S1, L</xref>.</p>
<p>Strong OAMB-10XV5 expression was also observed in the epithelial cells of the ED in a honeycomb pattern (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S1, M and P</xref> reminiscent of Dlg and presumably associated with the plasma membrane. OAMB-10XV5 expression in the epithelial cells of the AGs was similar to its expression in the epithelial cells of the ED with prominent signal in a honeycomb pattern (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S2, A and D</xref>. OAMB-10XV5 also exhibited low-level expression in the muscles of the AG and expression in the pre-synaptic neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S2, G</xref> by virtue of significant overlap with Syn (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S2, I</xref>. Prominent OAMB-10XV5 expression was also observed in the ejaculatory bulb. Low-level expression of OAMB-10XV5 was detected in the muscles of the ejaculatory bulb as was expression in the pre-synaptic neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S2, J and M</xref> as evidenced by mostly overlapping expression with Syn (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S2, L and O</xref>. In the non-muscular portion of the ejaculatory bulb, OAMB-10XV5 expression was readily discernable in the epithelial cells in a honeycomb pattern (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S2, J and P</xref>.</p>
<p>OAα2R-20XV5 exhibited strong expression in the muscles of both the SVs and more distal regions of the proximal ED near where it connects with the ejaculatory bulb, as well as lower-level expression in the AGs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S3, A</xref>. Higher resolution images of OAα2R-20XV5 in the SV indicate expression is restricted to the muscle (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S3, G</xref> as there is no apparent overlap with Syn (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S3, I</xref>. A cross-section of the SV muscle reveals OAα2R-20XV5 is localized to the membrane of the muscle (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S3, J</xref>, as would be expected for a GPCR. In the AGs, OAα2R-20XV5 is expressed in the muscles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S3, M and P</xref> as well as in the pre-synaptic neurons as evidenced by co-localization with Syn (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S3, O and R</xref>. OAα2R-20XV5 expression ends abruptly just after the SVs fuse into the sphincter that regulates the movement of sperm into the ED (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S4, A and D</xref>. OAα2R is expressed in the pre-synaptic neurons innervating the sphincter with little to no expression in the sphincter muscles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S4, C and F</xref>. In the proximal region of the anterior ED prominent OAα2R-20XV5 expression is observed throughout the innervating neurons with little to no OAα2R-20XV5 in the muscles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S4, G, I, J, and L</xref>. In contrast, in the distal region of the anterior ED, robust expression of OAα2R-20XV5 is detected in the muscles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S4, M, P, and S</xref> but not in the pre-synaptic neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8E, O, R, and U</xref>. This complementary pattern of OAα2R-20XV5 in neurons but not muscles in the proximal ED and muscles but not neurons in the distal ED suggests these different regions of the ED are exhibiting a differential response to OA. As in the SV, OAα2R-20XV5 localizes to the membrane of the muscles as evident in a cross-sectional image (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E, S</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly in this region, Syn expression is inside the muscles of the ED (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E, T</xref>), potentially suggesting the muscles are being stimulated from the inside, or alternatively, that the neurons are stimulating the underlying epithelial cells. As pre-synaptic neuronal expression of adrenoreceptors in mammals has been shown to be release-inhibiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Brown and Gillespie 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Starke 1972</xref>), including in the urinary bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Somogyi and De Groat 1990</xref>) and vas deferens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">O’Connor et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Scheibner et al. 2001</xref>), OAα2R expression in the pre-synaptic neurons of the internal male reproductive system may also function via inhibitory auto-reception.</p>
<p>OAβ2R-40XV5 exhibits strong expression in the epithelial cells of the ED, the muscles of the ejaculatory bulb, the muscles of the SVs near the point of fusion, the testes, with lower-level muscle expression in the SVs, ED, and AGs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S5, A</xref>. Higher resolution images of the SV reveal obvious expression in the muscle (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S5, D and G</xref> but not in the pre-synaptic neurons as there is no apparent overlap with Syn (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S5, F and I</xref>. A cross-sectional image of the SV reveals OAβ2R-40XV5 is localized to the plasma membrane of muscle cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S5, J</xref>. In higher resolution images of the ED, moderate levels of OAβ2R-40XV5 are present in the muscles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S5, M and P</xref> but not in the innervating pre-synaptic neurons as there is no obvious overlap with Syn (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S5, O and R</xref>. At the junction where the SVs fuse into a single duct, OAβ2R-40XV5 expression is strong prior to fusion but drops off abruptly at the point of full fusion (arrow, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S6, A</xref>. The strongest levels of OAβ2R-40XV5 expression throughout the entire male reproductive system is in what appears to be the epithelial cells that line the ED (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S6, A</xref>. A cross-section of the ED reveals the distribution of OAβ2R-40XV5 in epithelial cells is exclusively at the apical surface (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S6, D</xref>. Also notable, there is another boundary of OAβ2R-40XV5 expression in the SVs somewhat prior to fusion (solid arrow, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S6, G</xref>.</p>
<p>Higher resolution images of OAβ2R-40XV5 expression at the point of SV fusion shows the sharp dip in expression at the point of full fusion (arrow, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S6, J</xref>. A cross-sectional image also reveals the drop in expression and membrane localization of OAβ2R-40XV5 in the muscle (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S6, M</xref>. Similar to the proximal anterior ED, the more distal region of the anterior ED exhibits strong expression in the muscles, and especially the underlying epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S7, A and D</xref>, In the AGs, OAβ2R-40XV5 expression is manifest in the muscles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S7, G and J</xref> but does not overlap with the pre-synaptic neurons as evidenced by the lack of overlap with Syn (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S7, I and L</xref>. Prominent OAβ2R-40XV5 expression was also observed in the ejaculatory bulb (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S7, M and P</xref>. As β2 adrenoreceptors relax bladder muscles in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">WUEST et al. 2009</xref>), OAβ2R may relax muscles in the male reproductive system.</p>
<p>Octopamine receptor expression in the internal organs of the male reproductive tract was predicted based on the dense OGN innervation of these tissues. Although OA receptor presence in these muscles aligns with their role in modulating contractile strength and rhythm, the organ-specific differences in receptor subtype abundance could only be established empirically. Epithelial expression implies that octopamine influences non-neuronal functions such as protein secretion or barrier permeability, but the precise cellular responses remain to be defined. Mapping OAMB, OAα2R, and OAβ2R to discrete muscle, neuronal, and epithelial compartments provides mechanistic information about how octopamine fine-tunes contraction, secretion, and presynaptic feedback across the male reproductive tract, offering an evolutionary framework for adrenergic control of fertility and pinpointing cell-specific targets for modulating reproductive output.</p>

<title>5-HT7 is widely expressed in the male reproductive system but most prominently in the sphincter region</title>
<p>Since the <italic>5-HT7-GAL4</italic> reporter delineates a sharp posterior boundary in the SV, endogenous 5-HT7 receptor expression was evaluated to pinpoint where 5-HT may directly modulate reproductive tract motility. To assess the expression pattern of the 5-HT7 receptor, a 20XV5 tag was added to the carboxy-terminus by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing at its endogenous genomic location. 5-HT7-20XV5 localizes to the muscles of the SV just before and after the junction, the epithelial cells of the AGs, and the ejaculatory bulb (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S8, A</xref>.

In the ED, 5-HT7-20XV5 is expressed in the muscles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S8, J and M</xref>, but unlike the SV, it is not expressed the pre-synaptic neurons as it does not appear to co-localize with Syn (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S8, L and O</xref>.

This boundary of increasing expression at this same region of the SV is highly reminiscent of OAβ2R-40XV5 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S6, G</xref>. A higher resolution image of the sphincter region of the SV post-fusion reveals high levels of 5-HT7-20XV5 expression (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S9, G</xref> but not in the innervating pre-synaptic neurons based on the absence of co-localization with Syn (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S9, I</xref>. A cross-section of this same region reveals the 5-HT7-20XV5 protein localizes to muscle membranes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S9, J</xref>. A high-resolution image of the terminus of the sphincter confirms 5-HT7-20XV5 expression extends all the way to the end (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S9, M</xref>. This observation of 5-HT7-20XV5 expression throughout the fused sphincter region of the SV contrasts with that of OAα2R-20XV5 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S4, D</xref> and OAβ2R-40XV5 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S6, A</xref>, both of which end at the point of full SV fusion and suggests 5-HT plays a more important role than OA in sphincter regulation. 5-HT7-20XV5 expression is also elevated in the muscles at the terminus of the AGs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S9, P</xref>. In the AGs, 5-HT7-20XV5 is most prominently expressed in the underlying epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S10, A and D</xref>.

Nearer the surface of the AGs, low-level expression of 5-HT7-20XV5 is detected in the muscle (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S10, J</xref> and obvious expression is observed in the innervating pre-synaptic neurons based on overlapping expression with Syn (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S10, L</xref>. 5-HT7-20XV5 expression was also observed in the ejaculatory bulb (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8S10, M</xref>. Interestingly, none of the OA or serotonin receptors exhibited preferential accumulation in the post-synaptic muscle opposite the pre-synaptic terminals, as observed for GluRIIA.

<title>SGNs are essential for male fertility but OGNs are dispensable</title>
<p>Having established that both OGNs and SGNs innervate the male reproductive system an obvious question follows: what are their roles in male fertility? It has previously been reported that OA-deficient flies are male fertile and female sterile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Monastirioti et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">COLE et al. 2005</xref>). However, in Tβh and Tdc2 mutant flies that fail to synthesize OA, glutamate signaling in the OGNs innervating the male reproductive system is still intact. To determine if simultaneously silencing the OGNs innervating the male reproductive system for both glutamate and OA signaling causes sterility, <italic>Tdc2-GAL4-DBD</italic> was combined with <italic>AbdB-AD</italic> and <italic>UAS-BONT-C</italic> to block all synaptic transmission in these neurons. This intersectional combination results in the silencing of only the Tdc2 neurons in the posterior VNC by virtue of the restricted expression of the AbdB-AD hemidriver to the posterior few segments of the VNC. The result was the same as eliminating OA signaling alone, males were fertile, and females were sterile (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), thus establishing that neither OA nor glutamate signaling is required for fertility in the OGNs innervating the male reproductive system. The observed female sterility validates the silencing function of the UAS-BONT-C transgene.</p>

<p>To assess the requirement of the SGNs innervating the male reproductive system for fertility, flies containing TRH-DBD, AbdB-AD, and UAS-BONT-C were generated. Both males and females of this genotype were sterile (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The observation that females were also sterile, while no serotonergic innervation of the female reproductive system has been reported, suggests the male sterility is due to 5-HT neurons common to both males and females, and thus the male sterility cannot be unambiguously attributed to the SGNs innervating the male reproductive system.</p>
<p>In an attempt to identify a split-GAL4 combination that more specifically targets SGNs innervating the male reproductive system, several dozen hemi-drivers that express in neurons whose cell bodies are located in the most posterior region of the VNC were screened for male sterility in combination with UAS-BONT-C and either <italic>TRH-AD</italic> or <italic>TRH-GAL4-DBD</italic>, as appropriate. One line, <italic>VT019028-GAL4-DBD</italic> was identified that resulted in male sterility and female fertility, suggesting silencing of male-specific sexually dimorphic neurons, and not neurons common to both males and females, were responsible for the male sterility. The <italic>TRH-AD</italic>/<italic>VT019028-GAL4-DBD</italic> driver in combination with a <italic>UAS-His2A-GFP</italic> nuclear reporter results in expression in sparse neurons in the brain and VNC as well as around two dozen neurons at the posterior tip of the VNC (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9, A</xref>). Female flies of the same genotype exhibited a similar sparse pattern of expression in the brain and VNC with the exception that there were noticeably fewer His2A-GFP expressing neurons at the tip of the VNC (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9, B</xref>).

<p>To determine if any of the <italic>VT019028-GAL4-DBD</italic> neurons intersecting with <italic>TRH-AD</italic> or <italic>AbdB-AD</italic> are serotonergic or octopaminergic, higher resolution images of the tip of the VNC were examined. In the full confocal stack image, Three His2A-GFP neurons are clearly visible that overlap with 5-HT (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9S1, D</xref>. However, it has previously been shown that there are both dorsal (∼10 neurons) and ventral (∼9 neurons) clusters of serotonergic neurons innervating the male reproductive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Billeter et al. 2006b</xref>) and some neurons may thus be obscured from a dorsal perspective. A partial stack containing the dorsal cluster reveals the same three neurons (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9S1, I</xref>.</p>
<p>However, a ventral view of these neurons shows a fourth neuron overlapping with 5-HT (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9S1, K</xref>. A partial stack of the ventral cluster reveals three His2A-GFP neurons overlapping with 5-HT (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9S1, O</xref>. There also appears to be one or two Tdc2 neurons overlapping with His2A-GFP. However, examination of three-dimensional images revealed they are only in close proximity but not overlapping.</p>
<p>Similar results were obtained with <italic>VT019028-GAL4-DBD</italic> neurons intersecting with <italic>AbdB-AD</italic>. Four His2A-GFP neurons overlap with 5-HT in a full confocal stack view (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9S2, D</xref>. These four neurons are visible in the dorsal serotonergic cluster (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9S2, I</xref>, while three additional His2A-GFP neurons overlapping with 5-HT are apparent in the ventral serotonergic neuron cluster (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9S2, N</xref>. One His2A-GFP neuron appears to overlap with Tdc2 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9S2, E</xref>, but this apparent overlap is not reproduced in the dorsal (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9S2, J</xref> or ventral (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9S2</xref>.

The innervation of <italic>VT019028-GAL4-DBD</italic> neurons with <italic>TRH-AD</italic> and <italic>AbdB-AD</italic> visualized with the <italic>UAS-CD8-mCherry</italic> reporter is similarly broad in the SVs, ED, and AGs (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9S3, A and B</xref>, respectively). Taken together, these results strongly suggest synaptic transmission in the SGNs included in the <italic>VT019028-GAL4-DBD</italic> intersections with <italic>TRH-AD</italic> and <italic>AbdB-AD</italic> that innervate the male reproductive organs are required for male fertility, although a role for the small number of other interneurons at the tip of the VNC in common between both combinations cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>To rule out the possibility that the male sterility observed in the <italic>VT019028-GAL4-DBD</italic> intersections with <italic>UAS-BONT-C</italic> and either <italic>TRH-AD</italic> and <italic>AbdB-AD</italic> is due to failure to mate, mating assays were performed where single males and single females of the different genotypes were placed together in a well of a 12-well plate and videotaped.</p>
<p>The mating success rates of <italic>VT019028-GAL4-DBD</italic>/<italic>TRH-AD</italic> and <italic>VT019028-GAL4-DBD</italic>/<italic>AbdB-AD</italic> were 81.25% (n=16) and 57.9% (n=28), respectively. These results demonstrate the observed male sterility is not due to failure to copulate.</p>
<p>In these mating assays, mating duration was also assessed along with several control genotypes. Mean mating durations for <italic>VT019028-GAL4-DBD</italic>/<italic>TRH-AD</italic> and <italic>VT019028-GAL4-DBD</italic>/<italic>AbdB-AD</italic> were 28.74 and 24.75 minutes, respectively (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10, A</xref>).

<p>These results are in line with previously reported mating durations for Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Crickmore and Vosshall 2013</xref>). Interestingly, silencing all 5-HT neurons (<italic>TRH-GAL4-DBD</italic> ∩ <italic>AbdB-AD</italic>) or all OA neurons (<italic>TRH-GAL4-DBD</italic> ∩ <italic>AbdB-AD</italic>) innervating the male reproductive system resulted in statistically significant reductions in mating duration, 19.11 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B, D</xref>) and 21.8 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B, E</xref>), respectively.</p>

For this experiment, control and experimental males were placed in petri dishes with virgin females, separated 10 minutes after the initiation of mating, immediately dissected, and the isolated male reproductive systems video recorded using a stereofluorescent microscope. In the control males, ProtB-GFP sperm were readily visible in the ED (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10S1, A</xref>, Video 1). In contrast, in the experimental males, no ProtB-GFP sperm were observed (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10S1, B</xref>, Video 2). These results demonstrate that the male sterility is due to a failure of the sphincter that regulates the flow of sperm between the SV and ED to open and thus the defect is with the emission phase of ejaculation.</p>

<title>Glutamate signaling in OGNs and SGNs is dispensable for male fertility</title>
<p>In the <italic>VT019028-GAL4-DBD</italic>/<italic>TRH-AD</italic> &gt; <italic>UAS-BONT-C</italic> sterile males, 5-HT and glutamate signaling are both abolished due to the BONT-C blockade of synaptic transmission. To determine if glutamate signaling alone is required in these neurons, a conditional allele of vGlut was incorporated into this genotype such that specifically glutamate signaling was eliminated while serotonergic signaling remained intact. These males were determined to be fertile. To ascertain whether there were changes in the level of fertility, fertility assays were conducted on 5-day post-eclosion males. No changes in fertility as compared to controls were observed (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10S2, A</xref>.</p>
<p>Immunostaining the AGs of control and experimental flies confirmed the effectiveness of the conditional vGlut allele by the presence of vGlut in control flies and its absence in experimental flies (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10S3, A and D</xref>, respectively). As glutamate has been shown to promote neuron survival as neurons age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">SHEN et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">BUCK et al. 2023</xref>), to determine if fertility might be altered in older males, the same 5-day old males used in the previous fertility experiment were held in isolation from females until they were 30 days post-eclosion and the experiment was repeated. While there was not unexpectedly a modest decrease in fertility with age, no differences in fertility were apparent between the control and experimental genotypes (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10S2, B</xref>. These results establish that glutamatergic signaling is not required in <italic>VT019028-GAL4-DBD</italic>/<italic>TRH-AD</italic> neurons for fertility. To determine if more extensive elimination of glutamate signaling in the OGNs and SGNs would alter fertility, glutamate was specifically eliminated in both classes of neurons. No reductions in fertility were observed in 5-day post-eclosion males (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10S2, A</xref>.

<title>The sphincter region of the SV initiates ED peristaltic waves</title>
<p>Neuron-independent peristaltic waves are known to occur spontaneously in the male ED of Drosophila that persist even when all nerves innervating the male reproductive system have been severed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Norville et al. 2010</xref>). To gain a better understanding of the muscle activity occurring during these waves in both the ED and throughout the rest of the male reproductive system, a fly strain was generated that expressed the Ca++ sensor GCAMP8m specifically in muscles under control of the myosin heavy chain promoter (<italic>MHC-GCAMP8m</italic>). This fly strain allows visualization of the changes in Ca++ levels that occur in the muscles during these peristaltic waves. As expected, waves of fluorescence are visualizable coincident with peristaltic waves of muscle contractions in the ED (video 3). These peristaltic waves originate not in the ED but in the sphincter region of the SV just prior to and after the point of SV fusion (video 4), although the region of the SV prior to the fusion point that is involved in initiation varies (video 5).</p>
<p>Muscle contractions in other regions of the male reproductive system are also apparent. These contractions are weak and seemingly random in the SV (video 6), AG (video 7), and testes (video 8), but occasionally in the AG strong coordinated contractions are observed (video 9). Together, these imaging data reveal that the seminal-vesicle sphincter acts as an autonomous pacemaker, launching neuron-independent peristaltic waves that drive ejaculatory-duct motility.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The male reproductive tract of flies and mammals have obvious morphological differences, yet they share many essential anatomical features and a common organizational logic. During copulation Drosophila males deliver seminal fluid and ∼4000-6000 sperm to females during a tightly choreographed ∼20-minute window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Kaufman 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Gilbert 1981</xref>). This involves the emission of sperm and seminal fluid from their sites of origin into the ED where they mix and are subsequently expelled into the female reproductive tract. Despite the critical importance of ejaculation, its neuronal mechanisms have remained poorly defined, hindering broader insights into the neural logic of male fertility. Here we close this gap by demonstrating that two distinct yet intermingled classes of amine/glutamate neurons, OGNs and SGNs, coordinate the ejaculatory sequence that ensures successful reproduction. Their transmitter pairs confer the capacity to co-release both fast excitatory and slower acting aminergic modulatory neurotransmitters. Differential expression of ionotropic glutamate receptors and aminergic metabotropic neurotransmitter receptors combine in post-synaptic muscle across the male reproductive system to confer an additional level of complexity to coordinately regulate fluid secretion, organ contractility, and directional sperm movement, to the end of optimizing male fertility.</p>
<p>This system can serve as a genetically tractable model to gain general insights into how multi-transmitter neurons coordinate and modulate interrelated action sequences critical for complex organ function. Lessons learned from this system may have implications for understanding how males of Drosophila and other species adapt their reproductive strategies to a dynamic environment. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms by which this system operates has the potential to identify neuromodulation strategies for male infertility and prostate cancer as multi-transmitter sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons innervating human male reproductive organs have been implicated in these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Burnstock 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Magnon <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Burnstock 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Drobnis and Nangia 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Dwivedi <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Mechanisms of multi-transmitter neuron-mediated transfer of sperm and seminal fluid</title>
<p>Movement of sperm and seminal fluid through the male reproductive tract requires an alternating series of coordinated muscle contractions and relaxations. Based on the observed co-packaging of vMAT and vGlut in the majority of synaptic vesicles in the ED of both the OGNs and SGNs, combined with the observed non-uniform distribution of neurotransmitter receptors for OA, 5-HT, and glutamate in neurons and muscles, potential pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms for regulating the activity of the muscles of the internal male reproductive system are possible.</p>
<p>Pre-synaptic expression of the α-type OA receptors OAMB and OAα2R may facilitate alternating bursts of action potential-dependent neurotransmitter release by diminishing pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release via an auto-receptive mechanism. As α-type adrenergic and noradrenergic receptors have been consistently shown to inhibit neurotransmitter release in multiple rodent species in both the peripheral and central nervous system including the vas deferens, heart, and brain when expressed in pre-synaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Starke 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Trendelenburg et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Miyazaki et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Scheibner et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Trendelenburg et al. 2003</xref>), the presence of OAMB and OAα2R in the pre-synaptic terminals of neurons innervating the internal male reproductive organs may have the effect of suppressing neurotransmitter output from pre-synaptic terminals and shortening the duration of muscle contractions. Thus, pre-synaptic expression of OAMB and OAα2R may have the effect of increasing the cycling frequency of muscle contractions and relaxations.</p>
<p>As glutamate is acting via post-synaptic GluRII-type receptors, its effect will almost certainly be excitatory with the result of eliciting fast muscle contractions. In contrast, the functional consequences of OA and 5-HT are not so clear cut. Either of these amines could enhance muscle contractions or facilitate muscle relaxation, depending on the neurotransmitter receptor(s) receiving the signal. In muscles of the mammalian prostate and lower urinary tract, α-type adrenergic and noradrenergic receptors have been demonstrated to augment muscle contractions while β-type receptors have been found to facilitate muscle relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Honda et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Michel and Vrydag 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Wuest et al. 2009</xref>). In contrast, OAMB and OAβ2R have been shown to enhance muscle relaxation and contraction, respectively in the Drosophila female reproductive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Deshpande et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>5-HT7 receptors are known to promote smooth muscle relaxation in the urinary tract, gut, oviduct, and blood vessels of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Carter et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Leung et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Prins et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Inoue et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Recio et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chang Chien et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Matsumoto-Miyai et al. 2015</xref>). Although muscle contraction receives preferential focus, muscle relaxation is also critically important for the execution of motor programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Goulding et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Wong and Lange 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Gowda et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Hiramoto et al. 2021</xref>) and 5-HT7 most likely plays a role in mediating muscle relaxation in the internal male reproductive system. An additional confounding factor is that OAα2R has been shown to respond not just to OA but also to 5-HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Qi et al. 2017</xref>). The observations of the presence of both muscle contraction enhancing, and muscle relaxation promoting, OA and 5-HT receptors in the same muscles of the internal male reproductive organs indicates the mechanisms of neuronal regulation of their activity are complex and may even involve synergistic effects that can only be established empirically.</p>

<title>A potential timing mechanism mediated by multi-transmitter neurons</title>
<p>Pre-synaptic release of glutamate acting on post-synaptic ionotropic GluRII-type glutamate receptors will cause near immediate, short-term, contraction of muscles. At least in the ED, our results show that the majority of synaptic vesicles co-package either OA or 5-HT along with glutamate, and thus simultaneous co-release is being used as a mechanism of neurotransmitter signaling. The amines OA or 5-HT acting on post-synaptic metabotropic OA and 5-HT receptors will have the effect of either prolonging the length of, or augmenting the relaxation of, muscles, dependent on the specific aminergic neurotransmitter receptors involved. These latter effects will be delayed relative to the glutamate-induced fast muscle contractions due to the discrepancy in the time course of action between ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Thus, co-releasing a fast-acting excitatory neurotransmitter acting through an ionotropic receptor simultaneous with a modulatory aminergic neurotransmitter acting through slower acting GPCRs in the same multi-transmitter neuron may create a sequential timing mechanism whereby fast glutamate-mediated muscle contractions always precede either amine-mediated prolonging of muscle contraction or facilitation of muscle relaxation. A single neuron co-releasing one fast and one slow neurotransmitter may thus have the advantage over two distinct neurons separately releasing these transmitters in that the former can more effectively synchronize, and at the same time, stagger events that require precise timing.</p>

<title>Potential for adaptation to environment</title>
<p>The complexity of neuronal control of male reproductive function revealed in this investigation exposes a variety of possibilities for adaptive regulation to dynamic environmental conditions. Polygynous Drosophila males are well-established to alter the quantity and quality of their ejaculate based on environmental circumstances, especially the level of competition with other males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bretman et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Moatt et al. 2014</xref>), but also due to nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Macartney et al. 2021</xref>) and the presence of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Liao et al. 2024</xref>). The male reproductive system may adapt to environmental conditions by tuning octopamine and serotonin signaling, adjusting the levels of their biosynthetic enzymes, the vesicular monoamine transporter vMAT, or relevant receptors to alter the amount of sperm and seminal fluid released during copulation. A potential mechanism for altering OA and/or 5-HT levels is extra-synaptic volume transmission whereby the level of OA or 5-HT secreted into the hemolymph in locations anatomically distant from the male reproductive system. Thus, global levels of OA and 5-HT in the hemolymph could be adjusted based on environmental conditions and this signal could then impact the male reproductive system to optimize ejaculate quality and quantity. Finally, the presence of OAMB and 5-HT7 on epithelial cells suggest the potential for the regulation of the quality of seminal fluid as the expression of these receptors implies, they could differentially alter gene expression in the epithelial cells in response to changing levels of OA and 5-HT. The results of this study create a foundation for mechanistic investigations into the molecular basis by which male reproductive resources are adaptively modulated.</p>

<title>Potential for signaling via neuropeptides</title>
<p>The broad abundant expression of the LDCV reporter IA2 in the neurons innervating the internal organs of the male reproductive system suggests a significant role for neuropeptide signaling since neuropeptides are known to be packaged into LDCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Pelletier and Leclerc 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Kreiner et al. 1986</xref>). Bolstering the prospect of this possibility, numerous neuropeptides across evolutionary distant insect species have been shown to alter the frequency and/or amplitude of the spontaneous peristaltic waves in the ED of male insect reproductive systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Marciniak et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cizmar et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Lange et al. 2023</xref>).

<title>The SV/ED junction is a control center</title>
<p>Immediately proximal to the ED, SVs fuse into a single duct that forms the sphincter regulating sperm flow from the SV to the ED during mating. The differential expression patterns of OAα2R, OAβ2R, and 5-HT7 in this region of the SV is intriguing. The extent of OAα2R and OAβ2R expression ends very shortly after the merge, at precisely the point where full SV fusion occurs and there is no longer a partition separating the ducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bairati 1968</xref>). Only 5-HT7 expression extends into the fully fused SV that constitutes the sphincter separating the SV from the ED. This expression pattern implies a prominent role for 5-HT7 in sphincter regulation. Previous reports of 5-HT7 mediating relaxation of smooth muscle in the mammalian gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Carter et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Prins et al. 1999</xref>), urinary bladder neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Recio et al. 2009</xref>), cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Leung et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chang Chien et al. 2015</xref>), lymphatic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Chan and Von Der Weid 2003</xref>), and oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Inoue et al. 2003</xref>) raises the possibility it may function to relax the sphincter muscles during copulation to permit sperm flow. Additionally, expression of OAβ2R and the likely relaxation-promoting 5-HT7 receptors increases sharply in the SV just prior to the point of fusion. Perhaps not coincidentally, this limit of expression corresponds with the distal-most extent of sperm localization in the SV where relaxation of the SV muscles must also occur for sperm to move along the duct to the ED. It is also notable, as revealed in the Ca++ imaging experiments, that the sphincter region is the site of initiation of the peristaltic waves of muscle contractions that are promulgated through the ED. The SV/ED junction is thus a critical control center for both regulation of sperm flow into the ED during mating and initiating neuron-independent peristaltic waves in the ED.</p>

<title>Molecular continuity of neurotransmitter signaling between males and females?</title>
<p>The expression of 5-HT7 and OAβ2R on the apical surface of the epithelial cells lining the AG and ED, respectively, is surprising because it implies that levels of 5-HT and OA are fluctuating in the lumen of these organs. The origin of these neurotransmitters is not obvious but if OA and 5-HT are present in the lumen of the AG and ED, another intriguing possibility is that these neurotransmitters are transferred to the female at mating for signaling in order to modulate female behavior and/or reproductive activity. A recent study detailed the molecular continuity of proteins in the seminal fluid of males functionally interacting with proteins in the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Mccullough et al. 2022</xref>). The potential presence of OA and 5-HT in the lumen of the AG and ED raises the possibility that this molecular continuity could extend to neurotransmitters in male seminal fluid signaling to neurotransmitter receptors in the female reproductive tract to convey information such as health, internal state, or environmental conditions to regulate female reproductive output.

<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>Male reproductive systems were dissected in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes with rotation. After 2X brief washes with PBS, they were incubated in PBS containing 2% Triton-X 100 and 2% BSA (PBSTB) for at least two hours with rotation. Subsequently, they were incubated in primary antibodies PBSTB for one hour with rotation, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C without rotation to prevent tissue damage. After 3X 5-minute washes in PBSTB, male reproductive systems were incubated for 2-3 hours in PBSTB with secondary antibodies with rotation. After three 5-minute washes in PBS, they were incubated in PBS containing Phalloidin 405 for one hour. After two 5-minute washes in PBSTB and one 5-minute wash in PBS, male reproductive systems were mounted on glass slides in Vectashield Plus (Vector Laboratories, Cat. #H-1900) using a coverslip that was glued on the edges with clear nail polish.</p>

<title>Expansion microscopy</title>
<p>The Ten-fold Robust Expansion Microscopy (TREx) protocol was used to expand the male ED (ED) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Damstra et al. 2023</xref>). Briefly, Drosophila male reproductive systems were dissected and fixed for at least thirty minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde. The ED’s were then dissected out and immunostained as described above. Tissues were then incubated in Acryloyl-X solution, 1:100 dilution (Invitrogen, catalog #2604348), overnight, at room temperature and protected from light. The next day, the ED’s were rinsed in PBS and incubated in TRex solution at 4 C, for 45-60 minutes. 0.15% ammonium persulfate and 0.15% TEMED was added and the TREx mixture was quickly transferred to chamber slides. TREx mixture with ED’s were placed in wells (1 ED per well), coverslipped and allowed to polymerize at 37 C for at least 45 minutes. After gel polymerization, each gel-ED was trimmed to eliminate excess gel. Gel-ED’s were incubated in proteinase K (Biolabs, catalog #P81075, 800U/ml) 1:100 solution, overnight at room temperature. Expansion of gel-ED’s was done the following day.</p>
<p>Three washes in water were performed, at least 20 minutes per wash. DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific, catalog# D1306), 2ug/ml, was added in the first wash to aid in tissue visualization. After the third wash, hydrogel-ED’s were trimmed again and placed in chamber slides. 1 hydrogel-ED per well and coverslipped. Imaged expanded ED’s in upright confocal (Leica Stellaris 8 DIVE) equipped with a ×40 NA = 0.8 water objective. z Stack-images were deconvoluted using the Lightning confocal function and 3D images were generated for each image. ED’s typically expanded approximately tenfold.</p>

<title>Colocalization Analysis</title>
<p>Digitally deconvolved-3D images of expanded EDs were analyzed using ImageJ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Schindelin et al. 2012</xref>). To exclude background in an unbiased manner, we thresholded all images by using the Otsu threshold and calculated Manders’ coefficients by using the BIOP JACop.plugin. A scatter plot of green and red pixel intensities (associated with each of the two markers, Vmat and Vglut) was generated by using the colocalization function. Manders’ coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, indicating no or complete colocalization. Prior to doing the colocalization analysis of each image, a region of interest (ROI) was traced using the stain from the CD8 marker. This ROI corresponded to an axon terminal.</p>

<title>Mating assays</title>
<p>Mating assays involved placing single 3–7-day old virgin males with single 3-7-day old virgin females in the same well of a 12 well tissue culture plate without anesthesia. The wells of the 12 well plates were half-filled with agarose. Flies were videotaped for three hours. Mating assays were conducted at 25C and 50% humidity in a room dedicated to behavioral assays. Mating was scored by viewing the videos and scorers were blind to the genotypes.</p>

The <bold>convincing</bold> analysis reveals two distinct types of glutamatergic neurons that co-release either serotonin or octopamine. While serotonergic neurons are required for male fertility, octopaminergic neurons are dispensable, indicating a division of labour.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This very thorough anatomical study addresses the innervation of the Drosophila male reproductive tract. Two distinct glutamatergic neuron types were classified: serotonergic (SGNs) and octopaminergic (OGNs). By expansion microscopy, it was established that glutamate and serotonin /octopamine are co-released. The expression of different receptors for 5-HT and OA in muscles and epithelial cells of the innervation target organs was characterized. The pattern of neurotransmitter receptor expression in the target organs suggests that seminal fluid and sperm transport and emission are subjected to complex regulation. While silencing of abdominal SGNs leads to male infertility and prevents sperm from entering the ejaculatory duct, silencing of OGNs does not render males infertile.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The studied neurons were analysed with different transgenes and methods, as well as antibodies against neurotransmitter synthesis enzymes, building a consistent picture of their neurotransmitter identity. The careful anatomical description of innervation patterns together with receptor expression patterns of the target organs provides a solid basis for advancing the understanding of how seminal fluid and sperm transport and emission are subjected to complex regulation. The functional data showing that SGNs are required for male fertility and for the release of sperm from the seminal vesicle into the ejaculatory duct is convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The functional analysis of the characterized neurons is not as comprehensive as the anatomical description, and phenotypic characterization was limited to simple fertility assays. It is understandable that a full functional dissection is beyond the scope of the present work. The paper contains experiments showing neuron-independent peristaltic waves in the reproductive tract muscles, which are thematically not very well integrated into the paper. Although very interesting, one wonders if these experiments would not fit better into a future work that also explores these peristaltic waves and their interrelation with neuromodulation mechanistically.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cheverra et al. present a comprehensive anatomical and functional analysis of the motor neurons innervating the male reproductive tract in Drosophila melanogaster, addressing a gap in our understanding of the peripheral circuits underlying ejaculation and male fertility. They identify two classes of multi-transmitter motor neurons-OGNs (octopamine/glutamate) and SGNs (serotonin/glutamate)-with distinct innervation patterns across reproductive organs. The authors further characterize the differential expression of glutamate, octopamine, and serotonin receptors in both epithelial and muscular tissues of these organs. Behavioral assays reveal that SGNs are essential for male fertility, whereas OGNs and glutamatergic transmission are dispensable. This work provides a high-resolution map linking neuromodulatory identity to organ-specific motor control, offering a valuable framework to explore the neural basis of male reproductive function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Through the use of an extensive set of GAL4 drivers and antibodies, this work successfully and precisely defines the neurons that innervate the male reproductive tract, identifying the specific organs they target and the nature of the neurotransmitters they release. It also characterizes the expression patterns and localization of the corresponding neurotransmitter receptors across different tissues. The authors describe two distinct groups of dual-identity neurons innervating the male reproductive tract: OGNs, which co-express octopamine and glutamate, and SGNs, which co-express serotonin and glutamate. They further demonstrate that the various organs within the male reproductive system differentially express receptors for these neurotransmitters. Based on these findings, the authors propose that a single neuron capable of co-releasing a fast-acting neurotransmitter alongside a slower-acting one may more effectively synchronize and stagger events that require precise timing. This, together with the differential expression of ionotropic glutamate receptors and metabotropic aminergic receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue, adds an additional layer of complexity to the coordinated regulation of fluid secretion, organ contractility, and directional sperm movement-all contributing to the optimization of male fertility.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness of the manuscript is the lack of detail in the presentation of the results. Specifically, all microscopy image figures are missing information about the number of samples (N), and in the case of colocalization experiments, quantitative analyses are not provided. Additionally, in the first behavioral section, it would be beneficial to complement the data table with figures similar to those presented later in the manuscript for consistency and clarity.</p>
<p>Wider context:</p>
<p>This study delivers the first detailed anatomical map connecting multi-transmitter motor neurons with specific male reproductive structures. It highlights a previously unrecognized functional specialization between serotonergic and octopaminergic pathways and lays the groundwork for exploring fundamental neural mechanisms that regulate ejaculation and fertility in males. The principles uncovered here may help explain how males of Drosophila and other organisms adjust reproductive behaviors in response to environmental changes. Furthermore, by shedding light on how multi-transmitter systems operate in reproductive control, this model could provide insights into therapeutic targets for conditions such as male infertility and prostate cancer, where similar neuronal populations are involved in humans. Ultimately, this genetically accessible system serves as a powerful tool for uncovering how multi-transmitter neurons orchestrate coordinated physiological actions necessary for the functioning of complex organs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work provides an overview of the motor neuron landscape in the male reproductive system. Some work had been done to elucidate the circuits of ejaculation in the spine, as well as the cord, but this work fills a gap in knowledge at the level of the reproductive organs. Using complementary approaches, the authors show that there are two types of motor neurons that are mutually exclusive: neurons that co-express octopamine and glutamate and neurons that co-express serotonin and glutamate. They also show evidence that both types of neurons express large dense core vesicles, indicating that neuropeptides play a role in male fertility. This paper provides a thorough characterization of the expression of the different glutamate, octopamine, and serotonin receptors in the different organs and tissues of the male reproductive system. The differential expression in different tissues and organs allows building initial theories on the control of emission and expulsion. Additionally, the authors characterize the expression of synaptic proteins and the neuromuscular junction sites. On a mechanistic level, the authors show that neither octopamine/glutamate neuron transmission nor glutamate transmission in serotonin/glutamate neurons is required for male fertility. This final result is quite surprising and opens up many questions on how ejaculation is coordinated.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work fills an important gap in the characterization of innervation of the male reproductive system by providing an extensive characterization of the motor neurons and the potential receptors of motor neuron release. The authors show convincing evidence of glutamate/monoamine co-release and of mutual exclusivity of serotonin/glutamate and octopamine/glutamate neurons.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Often, it is mentioned that the expression is higher or lower or regional without quantification or an indication of the number of samples analysed.</p>
<p>(2) The experiment aimed at tracking sperm in the male reproductive system is difficult to interpret when it is not assessed whether ejaculation has occurred.</p>
<p>(3) The experiment looking at peristaltic waves in the male organs is missing labeling of the different regions and quantification of the observed waves.</p>
