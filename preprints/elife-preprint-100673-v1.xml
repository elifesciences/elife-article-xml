<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight. Early pterosaurs had long stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered during flight like a flag in the wind. Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats. Here we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. The lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system used to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Palmer 2017</xref>). The first pterosaurs, the non-pterodactyloids, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Frey, Tischlinger et al. 2003</xref>), similar to some dinosaurs like <italic>Velociraptor</italic> (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Persons IV and Currie 2012</xref>). Many of these tails end in a soft tissue ‘vane’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Marsh 1882</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Döderlein 1929</xref>, <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Frey, Tischlinger et al. 2003</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), which may have contributed to passive stability in flight.</p>

<p>A primary role in display has also been suggested (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">O’Brien, Allen et al. 2018</xref>), given ontogenetic shape changes in the vane and the fact that, unlike most aircraft, flying animals do not need vertical control surfaces to be yaw-stable during turns (Bowers, Murillo et al. 2016).</p>
<p>The vanes have been interpreted as steering aids (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Frey, Tischlinger et al. 2003</xref>). The length and stiffening of the tails suggest that they might have been important in early pterosaurs for control based on mass shifting or inertial control, as purported for terrestrial theropods with convergent tails (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Persons IV and Currie 2012</xref>). Such dynamic control could greatly improve maneuverability and/or stability. However, vane fluttering would be extremely costly and destabilising unless the vane was tensioned while under aerodynamic load. Tail vanes feature thick, evenly spaced, internal structures roughly perpendicular to the caudal series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Döderlein 1929</xref>), that are said to resemble neural spines and haemal arches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Marsh 1882</xref>). These structures are presumed to have minimised fluttering and prevented buckling in the same way that spars, ribs, stringers, and longerons do in airplane wings and tail-fins, but others have proposed that they were flexible and cartilaginous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Marsh 1882</xref>), especially since their preserved appearance varies. Here we use Laser-Simulated Fluorescence (LSF) imaging of <italic>Rhamphorhynchus</italic> specimens from the Upper Jurassic Solnhofen Limestones (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Kaye, Falk et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Pittman, Barlow et al. 2021</xref>) to investigate the vane’s structural properties, explore its usage, its evolutionary origins and the context for its disappearance in later pterodactyloids (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Frey, Tischlinger et al. 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils were examined for well-preserved tail vanes using an ultraviolet torch. Four exceptional specimens were then imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence (LSF). Three specimens exhibited tail vanes under white light but the vane of NHMUK PV OR 37003 was only visible under LSF. LSF confirmed the soft tissue extent of the vanes and revealed hidden anatomical details, especially in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G.1994.13.1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>), where vane areas fluoresced pink and white, indicating soft tissue preservation (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Pittman, Barlow et al. 2021</xref>). Tail vanes are sub-symmetrical and diamond-shaped in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G.1994.13.1 with a length of 700 mm, 750 mm and 720mm making up 21%, 22% and 21% of the total tail length of 320 mm, 362 mm and 348 mm respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). At its widest point, about two-thirds along its length, the vane is 41 mm across in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 but the widest in NMS G.1994.13.1 (55 mm), even wider than in BSP 1907 I 37 (46 mm) and almost twice as wide as YPM 1778 (30 mm). Under LSF, partial edges of the vane are visible, along with at least 17 relatively straight structures in NHMUK PV OR 37787 (10+ in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 11+ in NMS G.1994.13.1); projecting vertically, near-perpendicularly to the tail skeleton (based on position of chevron bones e.g., NHM PV OR 37787). In NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G.1994.13.1, these are relatively thick (0.6 - 1 mm) and appear to be hollow, suggesting they were rod-like, and were arranged in parallel ∼3 - 8 mm apart. In NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 they are rarely preserved dead-straight, but are straighter in NHM G.1994.13.1, especially anteriorly. In YPM 1778 and BSP 1907 I 37 the vertical structures show more pronounced undulations giving them a sigmoidal morphology. To our knowledge, in NHMUK PV OR 37003 alone, there is a second layer of thinner and more numerous fibres that run across the thick vertical structures, subparallel to the long axis of the tail and become more and more closely spaced as they reach the tail tip. Together, the vertical structures and subhorizontal fibres form a cross-linked lattice. The thick outer margin of the vane is undulated in dorsal view in both NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787, with a trough ∼0.7 mm deep where the thick vertical structures meet the margin and a convex peak roughly mid-way between each pair of vertical structures. A similarly thick outer margin is also observed anteriorly on the tail vane of NMS G.1994.13.1 and BSP 1907 I 37.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>LSF imaging demonstrates that the “problem” of vane flutter in early pterosaurs was solved using two sets of tensile-loading structures. One set are thicker, hollow, regularly-spaced, tube-like structures with a vertical long axis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The second set are thinner more numerous subhorizontal fibres that criss-cross the thick vertical structures and transfer tension into the tail tip (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The cross-linked lattice worked to prevent flutter by limiting the degree to which the tail vane could bend out of plane. Mediolateral deviations would bend the thicker vertical structures and therefore be resisted by the tensile strength of those fibres. Stretching of the vane would spread the vertical structures, and this would load the cross-linking fibres running to the tail tip - greatly limiting the degree to which the structures could bend apart and therefore limiting stretch of the vane (providing dynamic stiffness).</p>
<p>While it may be tempting to think of the thick vertical structures as compression-loading sail battens, this does not seem to be a major loading regime. If the vertical structures loaded in axial compression to maintain vane shape, we would expect the peaks of the undulating vane edge contour to be aligned with the fibre tips: in the way that battens align with the convexity on a racing sail trailing edge (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Calì, Sapienza et al. 2022</xref>). Notably, it is the concavities that align with each structure tip, indicating that, under load, the spaces between the structures stretched until the outer edge was linear (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), with the fossilised position preserving the unloaded slack condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results suggest that the tail vane maintained effective stiffness dynamically with internal tension of a cross-linked lattice that minimised excessive vane flutter and associated drag production. This structural integrity would have permitted the vane to be to be recruited in stabilisation, likely working in collaboration with uropatagium/cruropatagium and webbed feet when present, and as an effective display structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). This tensioning would also have allowed the tail, as a whole, to be used for mass-shifting-based aerodynamic control without incurring adverse effects of a fluttering vane during rapid tail motions. Tail vane shape changes through ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bennett 1995</xref>, <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">O’Brien, Allen et al. 2018</xref>) and between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Marsh 1882</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Döderlein 1929</xref>, <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Frey, Tischlinger et al. 2003</xref>), which underscores the importance of the tail vane in early pterosaur evolution. As pterodactyloid pterosaurs evolved a shorter body plan with an anterior center of mass and large heads with cranial crests as the primary display structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Jagielska and Brusatte 2021</xref>), both the control and display functions of the tail were absorbed by the wings and head.</p>
<p>The new soft tissue information also provides clues about the evolutionary origins of the tail vane itself. The cross-linked lattice recognised in this study suggests that the tail vane of early pterosaurs developed from a single contiguous structure rather than a combined structure of scales or feather-like integuments. While the undulating vane edge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) might reflect an epidermal patterning, the internal part of the tail vane was likely filled with connective tissue underneath the epidermal layer. The medial part of the tail vane, namely the periphery of the caudal vertebrae, has a different tone under fluorescence and the vertical structures lose clarity when compared to the lateral part of the tail vane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). This potentially indicates a thicker subdermal connective tissue surrounding the caudal vertebrae. Therefore, the tail vane of pterosaurs consisted of bilateral fleshy folds on the end of the tail, comparable to the cetacean fluke that envelopes dense connective tissue (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Gavazzi, Nair et al. 2024</xref>). The growth series of the tail vane shape in <italic>Rhamphorhynchus muensteri</italic> begins with an extended teardrop/oval shape, becoming diamond-shaped (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>), and eventually triangular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bennett 1995</xref>). These three shapes parallel the shape changes of the cetacean fluke during embryonic development (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Štěrba, Klima et al. 2000</xref>). It is possible that both the pterosaur tail vane and the cetacean fluke evolved through a shared developmental mechanism, perhaps a co-option of the signaling pathway that drives appendage outgrowth (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Gavazzi, Nair et al. 2024</xref>), eventually bringing about improved fluid dynamics of the limbs.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>Over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils were examined for well-preserved tail vanes using an ultraviolet torch at the Bayerische Staatssamlung für Paläontologie (Munich), Museum für Naturkunde (Berlin), Jura Museum (Eichstätt), Natural History Museum (London), National Museum of Scotland (Edinburgh) and Royal Ontario Museum (Toronto). Four exceptional specimens were imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence (LSF) (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Kaye, Falk et al. 2015</xref>) at the Natural History Museum, National Museum of Scotland, and the Royal Ontario Museum. LSF involved projecting a 405 nm violet laser diode from a line lens and scanning it over the specimens in a dark room following standard laser safety protocol. Long exposure photographs over 30 seconds were taken with a Nikon digital single-lens reflex camera fitted with a 425 nm laser blocking filter. LSF images were then postprocessed for equalisation, saturation, and colour balance across the entire images in Adobe Photoshop CS6. For more details see Extended Methods in Supplementary File 1.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper reports fossil soft-tissue structures (tail vanes) of pterosaurs, and attempts to relate this to flight performance and other proposed functions for the tail</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper presents new evidence for soft-tissue strengthening of vanes using exciting new methods.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There seems to be no discussion of bias in the sample selection method - even a simple consideration of whether discarded specimens were likely not to have had the cross-linking lattice, or if it was not visible.</p>
<p>There seems to be no supporting evidence or theory to show how the lattice could have functioned, other than a narrative description. Moreover, there is no comparison to extant organisms where a comparison of function might be drawn.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have set out to investigate and explain how early members of the Pterosauria were able to maintain stiffness in the vane of their tails. This stiffness, it is said, was crucial for flight in early members of this clade. Through the use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging, the authors have revealed that certain pterosaurs had a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system that has previously been unappreciated.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The choice of method of investigation for the key question is sound enough, and the execution of the same is excellent. Overall the paper is well written and well presented, and provides a very succinct, accessible and clear conclusion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>None</p>
