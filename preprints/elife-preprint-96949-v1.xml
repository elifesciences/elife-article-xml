<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The advent of highly multiplexed, spatially-resolved gene expression profiling technologies promises to substantially enhance our understanding of complex biological systems. By directly capturing the spatial location of molecules and cells, which is lost using single cell RNA-seq technologies, in situ profiling can provide new insights into the interplay between different cell types, the functional organization of tissues, and the influence of the microenvironment on cellular behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The ability to infer relationships across multiple scales, from molecules to cells to organ systems, represents a powerful advance and has given rise to a wide diversity of academic and commercial profiling technologies to address this need<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. These technologies can be broadly grouped into sequence-based methods which return transcriptome-wide profiles for individual voxels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and in situ imaging technologies which perform highly multiplexed hybridization-based profiling with targeted probes.</p>
<p>While both types of approaches exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses, imaging-based technologies exhibit clear advantages for high-resolution molecular profiling. The use of uniquely barcoded and fluorescent probes enables the multiplexed identification of single molecules, enabling researchers to study both cellular and sub-cellular localization patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, in contrast to sequencing based technologies that may blend the profiles of adjacent cells located within the same voxel, imaging-based technologies can, in principle, unambiguously assign molecules to single cells. Therefore, in situ techniques are uniquely suited to explore the effect of a cell’s interactions and micro environment on its molecular state, and for example, to quantify how cells of a similar type vary in their gene expression patterns at distinct anatomical sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The burgeoning interest in multiplexed in situ imaging technologies for spatially resolved gene expression profiling has spurred the development of an exciting variety of academic technologies and commercial offerings. These approaches vary not only in the size and composition of their target gene panel, but also in their approaches for signal amplification, detection, and error correction. Key downstream data processing steps, including cell segmentation can also vary across datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. These experimental and computational differences can cause substantial variation in data quality, necessitating a systematic approach to benchmark and compare in situ technologies. Comparative benchmarking has been invaluable for researchers to select among competing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, but similar efforts and benchmarking strategies are still in the process of being identified for imaging-based spatial technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we perform a comparative benchmarking analysis of six different in situ gene expression profiling technologies using publicly available datasets of the mouse brain. We find that standard metrics, such as the number of unique molecules detected per cell (i.e. sensitivity), cannot be directly compared across datasets due to substantial differences in panel composition and off-target molecular artifacts (i.e. specificity). We explore multiple possible sources of molecular artifacts, develop new metrics that control for these phenomena, and utilize these metrics to evaluate and compare in situ datasets. Finally, we demonstrate how even relatively minor decreases in molecular specificity can seriously confound spatially-aware differential expression analysis, thereby requiring caution in the interpretation of downstream results.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The rapid evolution of imaging-based in situ spatial technologies has led to the creation of a diverse set of technologies for multiplexed gene expression profiling. Similar to previous comparative benchmarking approaches for scRNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, which highlighted substantial differences in throughput and sensitivity across multiple technologies, benchmarking in situ technologies can help guide users in choosing a technology. Moreover, while many scRNA-seq technologies are often benchmarked using their performance on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), in situ spatial approaches typically demonstrate their performance using sections of the mouse brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, as this tissue has well-characterized and complex spatial organization, and exhibits highly conserved structure across animals.</p>
<p>Based on publicly available data in mid-2023, we identified datasets featuring full mouse brain sections (including coronal or sagittal sections), generated with six different technologies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, Supplementary Methods). Our selection of datasets represented publicly released datasets from three commercial technologies: Xenium (10x Genomics), MERSCOPE (Vizgen), and Molecular Cartography (Resolve Biosciences), as well as three published datasets generated in academic labs using MERFISH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, STARmap PLUS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and EEL FISH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Our intention was to enable a fair comparison after the authors had the chance to best showcase their technology. Therefore, in our initial analyses we used the outputs provided directly by the dataset generators. Output files for all technologies include gene-cell expression matrices and x-y coordinates denoting the center of each segmented cell. Molecular Cartography, MERSCOPE, Xenium, MERFISH, and EEL FISH additionally provide the exact position of each detected molecule and MERSCOPE, Xenium, and Molecular Cartography provide vertices denoting the segmentation boundary of each cell.</p>

</fig>
<p>We first computed metrics that are commonly reported for scRNA-seq, including the reproducibility across replicate experiments (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>), and the average number of counts and features identified in each cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). We obtained replicate datasets for five out of the six technologies, and reassuringly observed high reproducibility of pseudobulk values (Pearson correlation ranging from 0.894-0.999) in all cases (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). Interpreting sensitivity is more challenging, as the panel sizes range substantially across technologies, from 99 genes (Molecular Cartography) to 1,147 genes (MERFISH), with only seven genes being uniformly targeted across datasets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). We observed a range in the average number of total transcripts detected per cell (ranging from 42 for EEL FISH to 297 from Xenium), but observed no correlation between this metric and total panel size (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>). We found that the distribution of average expression levels (based on scRNA-seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>) for targeted genes was similar across technologies, though we did observe an enrichment for very lowly expressed genes (such as G coupled protein receptors) in the MERSCOPE target list (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>).</p>
<p>We annotated each imaged cell from the six in situ datasets based on an adult mouse brain scRNA-seq reference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a,d</xref>; Supplementary Methods). We found that all in situ methods were successfully able to delineate broad groups of cells (i.e. oligodendrocytes and astrocytes), and that these annotations were supported by the expression of canonical marker genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). However, we also observed non-specific expression of these marker genes in other cell types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>), particularly in comparison to scRNA-seq (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref>). We annotated higher-resolution subsets as well (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3a</xref>), but we chose not to benchmark annotations given the difference across technologies in panel size and composition. For example, the 10x Xenium dataset includes canonical markers for each of the mouse cortical inhibitory interneuron subtypes (Pvalb, Sst, Lamp5, Vip)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, but none of these markers is profiled in the receptor-focused MERSCOPE dataset.</p>

</fig>
<p>We next performed celltype-matched comparisons of molecular sensitivity between each spatial technology and scRNA-seq. This approach allowed us to assess the sensitivity of the different technologies on a common ground, despite differences in their target panels. In all cases, we found broad quantitative agreement between cell type-specific average single-cell expression profiles computed from in situ and scRNA-seq experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). In all six cases, average expression profiles from in situ methods exhibited higher molecular counts for the same gene, when compared to scRNA-seq data. While this finding is consistent with a general assumption that imaging-based technologies can achieve higher sensitivity, it may also be explained in some cases by the presence of non-specific signals which would inflate gene expression counts in imaging datasets. We observed that the relative increase in molecular counts for in situ techniques (compared to scRNA-seq) was highest for lowly expressed genes, but was diminished for highly expressed genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). This pattern is consistent with the presence of imaging-specific background that has a uniform effect on all probes, and therefore has a proportionally greater effect on probes that return a low number of bona fide molecular counts.</p>
<p>The presence of background RNA has also been observed in scRNA-seq experiments, albeit typically at low levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The gold-standard test to quantify non-specificity in scRNA-seq datasets is a ‘barnyard’ experiment (i.e. mixing of human mouse cells), where false-positive molecules can be unambiguously identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. While none of the in situ technologies provide a multi-species dataset, we performed a barnyard-style analysis by first identifying genes that exhibit mutually exclusive expression in scRNA-seq data. For example, we found that Slc17a7 and Gfap were specific markers of excitatory neurons and astrocytes respectively, and almost never co-expressed in the same cell (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2b</xref>). These genes were measured in all six datasets, and while we observed anti-correlated expression in all cases, a subset of technologies (in particular, Xenium and Molecular Cartography) exhibited widespread co-expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>
<p>To quantify this phenomenon, we calculated a ‘mutually exclusive co-expression rate’ (MECR) for each dataset. This metric aggregates pairs of mutually exclusive genes between cell types based on scRNA-seq and quantifies their rate of detected co-expression, normalized for the abundance of each individual gene (Supplementary Methods). We observe wide variation in this metric across technologies, with the Xenium dataset exhibiting the highest rate across datasets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). We note that based on standard metrics, Xenium exhibits the highest number of average molecular counts per cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>), but that a component of the Xenium molecular profiles represent false positive counts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a,c</xref>,d). More generally, these results highlight how sensitivity-based comparisons of multiple technologies may be misleading if there are also substantial differences in specificity rate.</p>
<p>We next considered possible sources of non-specific signal for the in situ datasets, starting with the possibility of off-target probe binding or false positive detection. Five of the six in situ datasets also include negative control probes in their binding. These probes represent either probes that are not expected to bind to any human RNA sequence, probes that lack the ability to be successfully converted into fluorescent signals, or both. All datasets exhibited non-specific detection of negative control probes, but typically at levels (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3b</xref>) that were far below the level of signal observed for bona fide expressed genes. We observe that the ratio of mean counts per gene divided by mean counts per negative probe ranges from approximately 0.001 to 0.1 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3c</xref>).</p>
<p>We next considered an alternative factor that can drive dataset-differences in specificity: the accurate assignment of individual molecules to the correct cell. The accuracy of molecular assignment is dependent on the quality and size of cell segmentations, which we found to vary substantially across technologies. For example, we found that the segmentations for the MERSCOPE dataset covered significantly less of the imaged area compared to the Xenium segmentations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a,b</xref>). This variability is reflective of the inherent challenges in performing cell segmentation and assigning molecules. Overly conservative segmentation maintains high molecular specificity but will discard a substantial fraction of transcripts, while aggressive segmentations may retain a higher fraction of transcripts yet suffer from non-specific assignment. We found that the fraction of molecules assigned to cells, which reflects each dataset’s position on a scale ranging from aggressive to conservative segmentation approaches, was strongly associated with MECR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). We conclude that the choice of segmentation thresholding is important in controlling the balance between sensitivity and specificity for in situ datasets.</p>

Varying this threshold enables us to calculate sensitivity (average total molecules per cell; y-axis) as a function of specificity (MECR; x-axis).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="575135v2_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We therefore reprocessed each of the six datasets with a uniform segmentation processing pipeline. For each dataset, we applied the Baysor pipeline to an approximately 1mm x 1mm area of the cortex (a region which exhibits higher molecular counts per cell), which probabilistically assigns molecules to cells based on a joint likelihood function that considers both transcriptional composition and cellular morphology using only molecule positions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. This has been found to be an effective segmentation strategy in the cortex of the mouse brain, given the visible separation of molecule ‘point clouds’ marking distinct cell bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a,b</xref>). By varying the threshold for assignment probability, we can vary the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity observed for each dataset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d,e</xref>). For example, applying a Baysor molecular assignment probability of 0.99 (most stringent) to the 10x Xenium dataset sharply reduced the degree of non-specific signal quantified by MECR, but also resulted in an approximately three-fold drop in the average number of detected molecules per cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>).</p>
<p>We leveraged this approach to generate ten sets of molecular segmentations for five of six datasets (excluding STARmap PLUS) where molecular position information was available. We used increasingly stringent molecular assignment thresholds and calculated sensitivity and specificity metrics for each set of segmentations. We emphasize that controlling for specificity enables an apples-to-apples comparison of the sensitivity of each technique that is not possible using the author-provided outputs. We find that after controlling for specificity, molecular sensitivity spans an order of magnitude between in situ technologies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). We observe the highest degree of sensitivity from MERSCOPE, with a nearly two-fold improvement compared to the closest technology, Xenium. This was followed closely by MERFISH and Molecular Cartography. Finally, the EEL FISH dataset exhibited relatively low sensitivity. We obtained similar results when analyzing multiple replicate slices from the same technology (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>), or when thresholding molecular counts for any individual gene to mitigate the effects of outliers (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4b</xref>). Additionally, we observed that MERSCOPE exhibited the highest molecular counts per cell in pairwise comparisons where we only considered genes quantified by both panels (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4c</xref>-e).</p>
<p>Lastly, we examined how spatial location drives heterogeneity within an individual cell type, which represents a biological analysis that is particularly well-suited to imaging datasets. As a simple example we separated annotated astrocytes located within the cortex from astrocytes located within the thalamus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>), and searched for differentially expressed genes between the two groups (results from the Xenium dataset shown <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>, results from the MERSCOPE dataset shown in <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5a</xref>,d). We then compared the results to scRNA-seq data, where cortical and thalamic astrocytes were separately profiled from different manually dissected samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Strikingly, when performing differential expression using the published in situ outputs, many of the top differentially expressed genes are highly expressed makers of other cell types, and are not expressed in scRNA-seq astrocytes from either the cortex or thalamus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>).</p>

Neuronal marker molecules are mis-assigned to astrocytes, confounding differential expression analysis. The segmentation background color denotes the annotated cell type; Dark pink segmentations are cortical neurons, dark orange segmentations are thalamic neurons, dark green segmentations are astrocytes, and dark grey segmentations are assigned to one of the remaining cell types.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="575135v2_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>

<p>These results are consistent with the presence of non-specific molecular expression in in situ datasets, and the potential for a biased mis-assignment of molecules in astrocytes that belong to neighboring cells. As an example, Satb2 is a neuronal marker, and is strongly up-regulated in cortical neurons compared to thalamic neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c,d</xref>). However, if a percentage of Satb2 molecules are mis-assigned to astrocytes, this gene will appear to be up-regulated in cortical astrocytes as well. Similarly, the thalamus harbors a larger population of Slc17a6+ neurons, and molecular misassignment causes Slc17a6 to be the most significantly differentially expressed gene in thalamic astrocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b,e</xref>). We identified this signal in all in situ datasets (results for MERSCOPE shown in <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, repeating analyses on the Baysor-reprocessed datasets alleviated, but did not eliminate, this non-specific signal (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). These results highlight the danger of non-specific molecular signals not only for comparative benchmarking, but also for downstream molecular analyses. We encourage users to carefully consider this factor when interpreting differential expression analyses in situ gene expression datasets.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we performed a comparative benchmarking analysis of six multiplexed in situ gene expression profiling datasets spanning both academic and commercial technologies. In each case, we utilize datasets generated by the technology’s inventors, aiming to compare datasets that demonstrate the full capacity of each method. While our initial analyses focus on author-generated outputs, we also re-analyze five of the six technologies using a common segmentation pipeline, which better enables us to compare sensitivity and specificity across datasets.</p>
<p>While all technologies generate useful datasets and faithfully recover the spatial organization of mouse brain tissue, we find that Vizgen’s MERSCOPE datasets exhibit the best performance. This is clearly reflected in our technical metrics computed on both the MERSCOPE published outputs and following re-segmentation, where MERSCOPE exhibits the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, MERSCOPE achieves this performance while also featuring a large panel size of 483 genes. Our analyses find that the Xenium technology, which featured a panel of 247 genes, also exhibited good performance, but we also find that the segmentations returned by the Xenium computational pipeline were far larger and more lenient than what we observed in other technologies. These segmentations increase the number of molecules detected per cell, at the expense of a substantial increase of incorrect molecular assignment.</p>
<p>We observed that the Resolve Molecular Cartography dataset and MERFISH datasets exhibited similar sensitivity, albeit with very different panel sizes. The Molecular Cartography dataset contained just 99 genes, demonstrating impressive sensitivity on a per-gene basis. In contrast, the MERFISH dataset featured the largest panel (1147 genes), demonstrating the ability to achieve strong performance while maintaining a high degree of plexity. The EEL FISH dataset was the least sensitive of all technologies profiled. The reduced sensitivity in EEL FISH is a well-described tradeoff of the technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, which emphasizes fast imaging time and minimized autofluorescence by electrophoretically transferring mRNA transcripts to a secondary slide.</p>
<p>Our study has a few limitations. First, our focus on mouse brain enabled us to compare a broader set of both commercial and academic technologies for which publicly available datasets are available. While this is a commonly used tissue for evaluating spatial analyses platforms, it represents only a single biological context. Moreover, our analyses focused on fresh-frozen tissue, representing a complementary evaluation to two recent studies which specifically evaluated performance on FFPE tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Finally, our Baysor analysis focused on cells in the mouse cortex, and as with all in situ benchmarking analyses, may be influenced by the specific composition of target genes and probes in the panel. More broadly however, our findings highlight the importance of considering both sensitivity and specificity when evaluating the performance of in situ technologies, and we believe this will be an important consideration across tissue types.</p>
<p>A substantial component of non-specific signal in imaging-based spatial transcriptomic datasets appears to be largely driven by misassignment of molecules from neighboring cells. We anticipate the need for two types of computational methods that can address this issue. First, methods for improved segmentation - and in particular those that use both nuclear and membrane stains as well as the position and identity of detected molecules in 3-dimensional space - will improve the overall results. However, no segmentation algorithm is perfect, and segmentation can be especially challenging when cells are densely packed or have complex morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We therefore anticipate that new computational methods, analogous to those that control for ambient RNA in scRNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, will be able to account for and correct for non-specific biases that arise in downstream analyses. As the field of spatial transcriptomics continues to develop, we hope that our analysis provides a useful and interpretable framework to assess new technologies, datasets, computational methods, and tissue preparation techniques going forward.</p>

<title>Preprocessing, clustering, and annotation</title>
<p><italic>Quality control:</italic> For each dataset, we used the author-provided gene expression matrix to select cells, and did not perform any additional quality control or filtering steps. We note that while filtering steps are common in scRNA-seq analysis, for example to remove material originating from empty droplets, filtering cells in spatial analysis would generate gaps in the tissue.</p>
<p><italic>Normalization, dimensional reduction, and cell annotation</italic>: We performed standard log-normalization for each dataset using the NormalizeData function in Seurat v4.3. We reduced the dimensionality of each dataset using principal components analysis (RunPCA), using default parameters and including all targeted genes. We further reduced dimensionality to two dimensions using the RunUMAP function, to generate the visualizations in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>.</p>
<p>We performed cell annotation using an scRNA-seq (10x Genomics Chromium system) dataset representing a comprehensive survey of 133 manually dissected anatomical regions from the adolescent mouse nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. For this dataset, we retained cells expressing between 200-3,000 unique features, and with less than 5% of molecules derived from mitochondrial transcripts. We also removed any samples from which less than 500 cells were obtained. We constructed a reference from this dataset using the standard Seurat scRNA-seq including the NormalizeData, FindVariableFeatures (with 4,000 variable features), ScaleData, and RunPCA (using 100 principal components) functions.</p>
<p>We used the Seurat label transfer workflow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, including the FindTransferAnchors (using one non-default parameter; reduction=‘cca’) and MapQuery functions, to transfer scRNA-seq derived annotations to each of the in situ datasets. We transferred both broad class labels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, d</xref>) from the “Class” metadata column, as well as the higher-resolution “Taxonomy Group” labels (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3a</xref>). For downstream analyses in this study, we use the broad ‘Class’ cell type labels, as each technology includes sufficient gene panels and data quality to confidently discriminate cells between these groups. We verified the accuracy of our transferred annotations by performing differential expression (Wilcoxon test implemented using the Presto package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>) on each in situ dataset based on the annotated labels, and visualizing the top marker genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>).</p>

<title>Specificity metrics</title>
<p>Specificity in single-cell sequencing datasets is often assessed using a ‘barnyard’ analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, where mixtures of cells from different species are profiled together in a single sample. A bona fide single cell should never co-express transcripts from multiple species, enabling the detection of doublets or non-specific molecular assignments. While the in situ datasets assessed here all contained only mouse cells, we reasoned that we could perform an analogous analysis by testing for mutual expression of markers of multiple distinct cell types (which should not be co-expressed). We found that in scRNA-seq data, marker genes of different cell types exhibited mutually exclusive expression, indicative of high levels of specificity (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2b</xref>).</p>
<p>We first identified a set of marker genes for each of 7 broad cell types from the Linnarsson scRNA-seq dataset. Cell type markers are identified for all cell types using the Linnarsson reference dataset with a Wilcoxon test implemented by Presto<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Cell type markers in the Linnarsson scRNA-seq dataset are filtered based on two criteria: they must exhibit more than 25% non-zero expression in the marker population, and less than 1% non-zero expression in all other cells. Any gene that was identified as a marker for multiple cell types was removed. From this final marker set, we generated a list of ‘mutually exclusive’ gene pairs.</p>
<p>For each in situ dataset, we considered only the mutually exclusive gene pairs where both members were present in the target gene panel. We computed the mutually exclusive co-expression rate (MECR) for each gene pair, by dividing the fraction of cells which express both markers by the fraction of cells which express at least one of the markers. Boxplots showing the range of MECR values across gene pairs are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>. We used the average MECR value across all gene pairs as an estimation of MECR for the dataset (as in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, e).</p>

<sec id="s6e">
<title>Baysor segmentation</title>
<p>We used Baysor v0.6.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>,and leveraged the ability to probabilistically assign molecules to cells using only the positions of detected molecules. Since the computational requirements for running Baysor scale with the total number of molecules, we subsetted each dataset to a roughly 1,000 by 1,000 micron region. We excluded the STARmap PLUS dataset since molecule positions were not publicly available.</p>
<p>Baysor is provided with three inputs; a CSV containing molecule positions and identities, ‘scale’ and ‘min-molecules-per-cell’. ‘Scale’ is the expected cell radius which was set for each to represent an expected cell radius of 6 microns, though the parameter value we used varied depending on the zoom level and coordinate system for the provided images: Xenium (6), MERSCOPE (6), MERFISH (6), Molecular Cartography (30), EEL FISH (60). The ‘min-molecules-per-cell’ parameter is the number of molecules required for a cell to be called. We set this to 100, but reduced it to 25 for EEL FISH based on the lower sensitivity.</p>
<p>Baysor assigns a confidence score to each molecule allocated to a cell, with the score ranging between 0 and 1. We compute multiple gene expression matrices with ten different assignment cutoffs (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 0.97, 0.98, and 0.99), in order to to vary the specificity of segmentations. We then compute specificity metrics (i.e. MECR) and sensitivity metrics (i.e. average number of detected molecules per cell) for each of these segmentations to generate the curves in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Hartman and Satija's manuscript constitutes a significant contribution to the field of imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) through their comprehensive comparative analysis of six multiplexed in situ gene expression profiling technologies. Their findings provide invaluable insights into the practical considerations and performance of these methods, offering robust evidence for researchers seeking optimal ST technologies. However, given the simultaneous availability of similar preprints, readers should exercise caution when comparing findings to ensure reliable information. Therefore, the authors should revise their manuscript to ensure consistency among all ST technologies compared, considering findings from other preprints as well if possible.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript offers a comprehensive and systematic comparison of six in situ gene expression profiling technologies, including both commercially available and academically developed methods, which is the most extensive study in this field.</p>
<p>(2) Novel metrics have been proposed by the authors to mitigate molecular artifacts and off-target signals, enhancing the accuracy of sensitivity and specificity comparisons across datasets. By emphasizing the significance of evaluating both sensitivity and specificity, the study addresses the challenge of comparing standard metrics like the number of unique molecules detected per cell, given variations in panel composition and off-target molecular artifacts. This feature is directly connected to their development of novel cell segmentation methods to improve the specificity.</p>
<p>(3) As a result of the analysis performed earlier, the authors illustrate how molecular false positives can distort spatially-aware differential expression analysis, underscoring the necessity for caution in interpreting downstream results.</p>
<p>(4) Offering guidance for the selection, processing, and interpretation of in situ spatial technologies, the study equips researchers in the field with valuable insights.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Although focusing on mouse brain datasets broadens the comparison of technologies, it confines the study to a single biological context. Discussing the potential limitations of this approach and advocating for future studies in diverse tissue types would enrich the manuscript, especially for clinical FFPE applications.</p>
<p>(2) Providing more explicit details on the criteria used to select datasets for each technology would ensure a fair and unbiased comparison. Otherwise, it may look like the Hall of Fame for champion data sets to advertise a certain commercial product.</p>
<p>(3) Improving the discussion part by discussing the origins of non-specific signals and molecular artifacts, alongside the challenges related to cell segmentation across different tissue types and cell morphologies, would enrich its content. Note that all of these experimental sets have been obtained from thin mouse brain slices, which are actually 3D although they are thin like 10-20 um. As a result, there might be a chance to have partial cell overlap in the z-axis, potentially leading to transcript mixing. Additionally, many cells are probably cut so their actual transcriptomes are inherently partial information, which makes direct comparison to scRNA-seq unfair. These aspects should be included for fair comparison issues.</p>
<p>(4) Expanding on the potential implications of the findings for developing new computational methods to address non-specific biases in downstream analyses would augment the manuscript's impact and relevance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript, Hartman et al. present a detailed comparison of 6 distinct multiplexed in situ gene expression profiling technologies, including both academic and commercial systems.</p>
<p>The main concept of the study is to evaluate publicly accessible mouse brain datasets provided by the platforms' developers, where optimal performance in showcasing their technologies is expected. The authors stress the difficulty of making a comparison with standard metrics, e.g., the count of total molecules per cell, considering the differences in gene panel sizes across platforms. To make a fair comparison, the authors conceived a metric of specificity performance, which is called &quot;MECR&quot;, an average of mutually exclusive gene co-expression rates in the sample. The authors found that the rate mainly depends on the choice of cell segmentation method, thus reanalyzed 5 of these datasets (excluding STARmap PLUS, due to the lack of molecule location information) with an independent cell segmentation algorithm (i.e., Baysor). Based on the reanalysis, the authors clearly suggest the best-performing platform at the end of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>I consider that the paper is a valuable contribution to the community, for the following two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) As the authors mentioned, I fully agree that the spatial transcriptomics community indeed needs better metrics in terms of comparison across technologies, rather than traditional metrics, e.g., molecule counts per cell. In that regard, I believe introducing a new metric, MECR, is quite valuable.</p>
<p>(2) This work highlights the differences in results based on the choice of cell segmentation used for each platform, which suggests a need for trying out different segmentation algorithms to derive the right results. I believe this is an urgent warning that should be widespread in the community as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I disagree with the conclusion of the manuscript where the authors compare the technologies and suggest the best-performing ones, because of the following major points:</p>
<p>(1) As the authors mentioned, MECR is a measure of &quot;specificity&quot; not &quot;sensitivity&quot;. Still, the comparison of sensitivity was done with the mean counts per cell (Figure 3e). However, I strongly disagree with using the mean counts per cell as a measure of sensitivity because the comparison was done with different gene panels. The counts per cell can be highly dependent on the choice of genes, especially due to optical crowding.</p>
<p>(2) The authors compared sensitivity based on the Baysor cell segmentation, but in fact, Baysor uses spatial gene expression for cell segmentation, which depends on the sensitivity of the platform. Thus, a comparison of sensitivity based on an algorithm that is based on sensitivity seems to be nonsensical.</p>

<p>We thank both reviewers for their constructive feedback. We were grateful to see that both reviewers found our work to be valuable to the field, and agreed that new metrics (including our introduced MECR) were important for dataset evaluation. We briefly respond to two main points from the reviewers.</p>
<p>(1) Key findings from our manuscript. While we do evaluate publicly available datasets in our manuscript, the focus/conclusion of our work is not to return a definitive ranking of in-situ technologies. As reviewers point out, our comparative evaluation is only in a single biological context, and we further note that many of these in situ platforms are rapidly evolving with new chemistries and gene panels.</p>
<p>Instead, the conclusion and purpose of our manuscript was to emphasize the importance and need for new metrics when evaluating spatial datasets. We propose an option, and demonstrate how cell segmentation can affect technical metrics, but also downstream biological analysis of in-situ datasets.</p>
<p>(2) Comparing technologies with different gene panels. The reviewers correctly point out that comparing technologies that use different gene panels is not a perfect benchmark. We agree that differences in molecular counts could arise due to biological differences in the abundance of targeted genes.</p>
<p>We did address this in Supplementary Figure 4, where we perform pairwise comparisons of each technology - and compute these only using overlapping genes that were measured by both technology. Our results are consistent with the analysis of full gene sets.</p>
<p>While we believe that regenerating in-situ datasets with identical gene panels is beyond the scope of this work (and is likely technically infeasible), we hope that our findings are still valuable and informative to the growing spatial community.</p>
