<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Difficulties in adapting learning to meet the challenges of uncertain and changing environments are widely thought to play a central role in internalizing psychopathology, including anxiety and depression. This view stems from findings linking trait anxiety and transdiagnostic internalizing symptoms to learning impairments in laboratory tasks often used as proxies for real-world behavioral flexibility. These tasks typically require learners to adjust learning rates dynamically in response to uncertainty, for instance, increasing learning from prediction errors in volatile environments. However, prior studies have produced inconsistent and sometimes contradictory findings regarding the nature and extent of learning impairments in populations with internalizing disorders. To address this, we conducted eight experiments (<italic>N</italic> = 820) using predictive inference and reversal learning tasks, and applied a bi-factor analysis to capture internalizing symptom variance shared across and differentiated between anxiety and depression. While we observed robust evidence for adaptive learning-rate modulation across participants, we found no convincing evidence of a systematic relationship between internalizing symptoms and either learning rates or task performance. These findings challenge prominent claims that learning difficulties are a hallmark feature of internalizing psychopathology and suggest that the relationship between these traits and adaptive behavior under uncertainty may be more subtle than previously thought.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Learning in complex and changing environments should be calibrated to inherent uncertainties, a process that is especially crucial in aversive contexts. For example, a hiker visiting a predator-rich forest must learn common predator locations to decide which areas to approach with caution. In an area in which bears have previously been sighted, some degree of variability in the exact location and the frequency with which bears appear is expected (aleatoric uncertainty or risk). Therefore, even if the hiker does not encounter a bear on some trips, they should maintain their caution in that area (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Conversely, if the hiker encounters a bear in a distant and previously safe region, it might indicate a substantial environmental change (epistemic uncertainty), prompting the hiker to update their belief about predator probability more substantially (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). The ability to calibrate learning to the degree of outcome variability and systematic changes is crucial for survival in aversive environments. Notably, this ability has been suggested to be impaired in individuals with high trait anxiety and internalizing psychopathology.</p>

<p>To ensure survival, a hiker has to take into account the probability of encountering predators in the forest. Learning the probability that, for example, a bear will suddenly appear requires the ability to regulate the learning rate dynamically, determining the extent of change occasioned by a prediction error (e.g., when the bear appears unexpectedly). <bold>a</bold>| On the one hand, this requires lower learning rates in response to risk due to random outcome variability (aleatoric uncertainty). For example, the hiker should remain cautious in a potentially dangerous area despite not encountering bears every time. <bold>b</bold>| On the other hand, beliefs should be substantially changed via a high learning rate in response to environmental changes that demand new learning (epistemic uncertainty). That is, upon encountering a bear in a previously safe area, the hiker should become more cautious around there. <bold>c-e</bold>| Hypothetical relationships between internalizing psychopathology and the modulation of learning. Green lines illustrate the learning rate simulated from one form of normative Bayesian models called the reduced Bayesian model (details in Methods Reduced Bayesian model). In the range of smaller prediction errors, mainly due to risk, the model uses a lower learning rate. For larger prediction errors related to environmental changes, the model adopts a higher learning rate. Pink lines illustrate hypothetical learning rates in individuals with internalizing psychopathology. <bold>c</bold>| H1: Higher overall learning rate, leading to overlearning from prediction errors. <bold>d</bold>| H2: Impaired learning about environmental changes, selectively concerning larger prediction errors. <bold>e</bold>| H3: No systematic relationship between learning rates and internalizing psychopathology.

<p>From a Bayesian perspective, in environments that can experience sudden and large changes, uncertainty should regulate the learning rate determining how strongly prediction errors (difference between actual outcomes and expected outcomes) are considered for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Adams &amp; MacKay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bruckner, Heekeren, &amp; Nassar, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Dayan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mathys et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Nassar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">O’Reilly, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Piray &amp; Daw, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Yu &amp; Dayan, 2005</xref>). When outcomes are corrupted by random environmental variability or risk, one should use a low learning rate to average out prediction errors occurring by chance. In contrast, surprisingly large prediction errors signaling environmental changes should be weighted more heavily by setting a high learning rate. Previous studies that used computational modeling to elucidate modulation in learning duly identified signatures of optimal adaptation to such uncertain and changing environments in healthy younger adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Franklin &amp; Frank, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Meyniel &amp; Dehaene, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nassar, Bruckner, &amp; Frank, 2019</xref>; Nassar, McGuire, et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Nassar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Payzan-LeNestour &amp; Bossaerts, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Payzan-LeNestour et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Impaired learning-rate adjustments in uncertain and changing environments have been linked to both clinical and trait anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aylward et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bishop &amp; Gagne, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lamba et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Pike &amp; Robinson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Pulcu &amp; Browning, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Zika et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, recent work provides evidence of a broader relationship between internalizing psychopathology and impaired learning abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Wise &amp; Dolan, 2020</xref>). These transdiagnostic approaches focus on internalizing symptoms shared across disorders, such as anxiety and depression, which are often correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Axelson &amp; Birmaher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kalin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Li et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the literature on the exact nature of learning impairments related to trait anxiety and internalizing psychopathology, and whether they are robust in sub-clinical samples, remains inconsistent across studies. Some studies have found that anxious individuals tend to use higher learning rates, particularly in response to negative prediction errors, which can lead to an overestimation of the probability of aversive events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aylward et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Pike &amp; Robinson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Piray &amp; Daw, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Wise &amp; Dolan, 2020</xref>). Other research suggests that individuals with high trait anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Browning et al., 2015</xref>) and internalizing psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>) exhibit less flexible adjustment of their learning rates in volatile environments, indicating a reduced ability to adapt to changing environmental contingencies. Finally, another group of studies has failed to identify any significant anxiety- or internalizing-related impairments in learning (Hitch-cock et al., 2024; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Jassim et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Schindler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Suddell et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Ting et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Torrents-Rodas et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>To address these inconsistencies across previous studies and systematically investigate the relationship between internalizing psychopathology and learning-rate adjustment, we performed a series of eight experiments with <italic>N</italic> = 820 sub-clinical participants. We tested the following three hypotheses derived from prior work. First, internalizing psychopathology might be associated with higher overall learning rates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). That is, according to this hypothesis, internalizing is related to overlearning from prediction errors. Second, internalizing psychopathology could be selectively associated with impaired adjustments to environmental changes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Accordingly, we would expect differences in learning from larger prediction errors, where internalizing would be associated with lower learning rates. The third hypothesis is that internalizing psychopathology and learning rates are not systematically related (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>
<p>To test our hypotheses, we developed an online, game-based, and aversive version of an established predictive inference task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nassar, Bruckner, &amp; Frank, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Nassar et al., 2010</xref>) called the predator task. This task allowed us to link adaptive learning abilities and internalizing psychopathology. We systematically investigated different task conditions across six online experiments (<italic>N</italic> = 751) and two in-person laboratory experiments (<italic>N</italic> = 69) with skin conductance response recordings. Additionally, to compare our results across task domains and with previous studies, three of the online experiments (<italic>N</italic> = 179, 94, and 161) featured a probabilistic reversal learning task that partially or fully replicated the task performed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Behrens et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al. (2020)</xref>. To assess internalizing psychopathology, we administered a comprehensive battery of questionnaires and conducted a bi-factor analysis to extract a general internalizing factor representing the shared variance between anxiety and depression (L. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Simms et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Watson et al., 1995</xref>). Across the eight studies, our findings corroborate the third hypothesis that internalizing psychopathology is not systematically related to learning-rate impairments. These results challenge the idea that internalizing and trait anxiety impair adaptive learning under uncertainty.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We recruited <italic>N</italic> = 930 participants via the online recruiting platform Prolific (prolific.com) and from the general population of Berlin to participate in online and in-person experiments. After excluding participants based on headphone screening, attention checks, and due to technical difficulties, the final sample consisted of <italic>N</italic> = 820 participants (age range 18 to 69, mean age 32.4, 417 female, 12 non-binary; for details, see Methods Participants).</p>
<p>Participants completed a comprehensive battery of questionnaires before starting the tasks, including the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Form Y1, Y2 (STAI-State and STAI-Trait; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Spielberger et al., 1983</xref>), State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA-Trait; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Ree et al., 2008</xref>), Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Freeston et al., 1994</xref>), Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Beck et al., 1961</xref>), Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Meyer et al., 1990</xref>), Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Watson and Clark, 2012</xref>) and Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form (IGDS9-SF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Pontes and Griffiths, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>We conducted a factor analysis to extract a transdiagnostic factor capturing commonalities of anxiety and depressive symptoms. As expected, responses to anxiety and depression items were significantly correlated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al. (2020)</xref>, we therefore adopted a “bi-factor” analysis approach with a general transdiagnostic factor G explaining shared variance across anxiety and depression, and factors related to anxiety (F1) and depression (F2) (D. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Clark et al., 1994</xref>). We applied this analysis to data from 748 participants (see Methods Factor Analysis and Supplementary Materials (SM) Factor Analysis for participant exclusion criteria and a justification for the number of factors). The results showed that all questionnaire items had moderate-to-large loadings onto the general factor. Additionally, items related to anxiety loaded on F1, while items related to depression loaded on F2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>

<p>Questionnaire measures were correlated, so we applied a bi-factor analysis to extract three distinct factors: a general internalizing factor G, an anxiety-related factor F1, and a depression-related factor F2. <bold>a</bold>| Pearson correlation matrix showing the correlation between items of each questionnaire. <bold>b</bold>| Factor loadings of each questionnaire item on the general factor G and the two sub-factors F1 (anxiety related) and F2 (depression related). <bold>c</bold>| The correlation of factor scores with questionnaire sum scores validates the hierarchical 3-factor structure. Based on Cohen’s effect size conventions, the general factor G shows moderate-to-large correlations with all questionnaires and captures variance common to both anxiety and depression, supporting the overall construct validity. F1 has moderate-to-large correlations with the anxiety-related scales MASQ-aa, STICSA-som and STICSA-cog. F2 shows moderate-to-large correlations with depression-related measures like MASQ-ad and STAI-dep.

<p>We further validated these findings by correlating each participant’s factor scores with summary scores for each questionnaire. For this analysis, the STAI-Trait and MASQ were separated into anxiety- and depression-specific subscales, while the STICSA-Trait was divided into somatic and cognitive anxiety subscales (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Using Cohen’s conventions for effect sizes (<italic>r</italic> = 0.10 small, <italic>r</italic> = 0.30 moderate, <italic>r</italic> = 0.50 large; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cohen, 1988</xref>), we found moderate-to-large correlations of the general-factor scores G with the majority of questionnaires. F1 showed moderate-to-large correlations with anxiety-related measures such as MASQ-anxious arousal (<italic>r</italic> = 0.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), STICSA-somatic (<italic>r</italic> = 0.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and STICSA-cognitive (<italic>r</italic> = 0.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).

<p>In the main study, <italic>N</italic> = 563 participants (269 females, 9 non-binary, mean age = 32.3 years, range 18 to 45 years) completed an online, game-based variant of an established predictive inference task called the predator task (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nassar, Bruckner, &amp; Frank, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Nassar et al., 2010</xref>). In this task, participants controlled a flame to defend an avatar against an attacking predator positioned at the center of the screen. The predator attack locations varied on a circle in two critically different ways. First, the attack locations were clustered around a mean position, subject to a circular Gaussian distribution whose variance represented risk.</p>

<p><bold>a</bold>| The goal of participants was to scare away as many attacking predators as possible. To do so, participants placed a flame in the predicted attack location of the predator. When the flame was placed accurately, the predator was scared away. However, when predictions were inaccurate, the predator caught the participants. In each trial, the participants first placed the flame in the expected predator position (Prediction). The predator then started the attack (Outcome), revealing a prediction error (difference between expected and actual location). Finally, participants updated the location of their flame (Update). <bold>b</bold>| The predator’s average attack location (dashed line) is mostly stable but shifts occasionally at change points. Actual attack locations (outcomes, shown by black dots) are corrupted by random variability. We used a reduced Bayesian model with near-optimal learning performance.

<p>Second, the mean occasionally shifted, without warning, inducing the sort of change points that should inspire more substantial adaptation. Since any attack would be arrested if the flame was placed between the avatar and the predator, participants had to learn the mean of the predator’s attack distribution to protect themselves most effectively. They earned 10 points for each trial in which they successfully defended themselves, and heard an aversive scream when they were caught by the predator.</p>
<p>To test the hypotheses about the relationship between internalizing psychopathology and difficulties in adapting to environmental variability (also referred to as stochasticity or risk) and volatility (the rate of environmental change), we conducted eight experiments using different variations of the predator task. Across these experiments, we systematically manipulated out-come type, variability, volatility, pre-task training, and whether the study was conducted online or in the laboratory. In experiments 1-4, the task included blocks with low and high levels of variability and changes in the mean location of the predator, to assess whether anxiety and internalizing affect task performance under different environmental conditions. Experiments 5 and 6 served as control conditions, with experiment 5 featuring a single variability and volatility level with minimal training and experiment 6 including a full training phase. Experiments 7 and 8 were conducted in the laboratory to validate the aversiveness of screams compared to electric shocks in the predator task. For brevity, we present the combined results from experiments 1 to 4 for the predator task in the Results section, along with results from the laboratory study in experiment 7. We refer to SM for the results from experiments 5,6, and 8 (SM Predator Task). Participants demonstrated a clear understanding of the task. We assessed this through a post-training quiz consisting of three questions completed before starting the main task (details in SM Training Quiz). The majority of participants (70.7%) answered all three quiz questions correctly, 24.7% answered two questions correctly, and 4.3% answered only one question correctly. Only one participant failed to answer any question correctly (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). To assess subjective anxiety and whether participants were sufficiently motivated to perform the task, we asked how much they wanted to avoid the predator and how anxious the task made them feel at the end of the task, using a scale from 0 to 100. Participants demonstrated high motivation to avoid the predators (median = 95.0, inter-quartile range (IQR) 81.0 to 100.0; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) and reported high overall subjective anxiety (median = 62.0, IQR 23.0 to 75.0; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Anxiety ratings were significantly correlated with both trait anxiety (STICSA-T, <italic>r</italic> = 0.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>) and general-factor scores (<italic>r</italic> = 0.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>), after controlling for age and gender, indicating that the task sufficiently induced anxiety for studying aversive learning behavior. Moreover, single-trial learning rates in the task exhibited qualitative signatures of adaptive learning (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Participants used lower learning rates in the range of smaller prediction errors that were primarily driven by random outcome variability, where a low learning rate helped them to average out randomness. In contrast, participants used higher learning rates for larger prediction errors, which enabled them to adjust predictions to change points. This behavioral pattern is consistent with findings from previous studies using similar tasks (Bruckner, Nassar, et al., 2025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fromm et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Jepma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nassar, Bruckner, &amp; Frank, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>, 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Piray &amp; Daw, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Vaghi et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, altogether, these results indicate that our task is well-suited to examine threat learning and internalizing psychopathology.</p>

<title>Task learning and performance are not systematically related to internalizing psychopathology</title>
<p>Across several performance measures and ways to quantify learning, we did not find a systematic relationship between internalizing psychopathology and learning impairments. To assess the strength of evidence for the null hypothesis, we calculated Bayes factors (<italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub>) based on the corresponding <italic>t</italic>-statistics. For interpretation, we adopted the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jeffreys (1961)</xref> classification scheme, where Bayes factors between 1 and 3 indicate anecdotal evidence, between 3 and 10 suggest moderate evidence, and values greater than 10 provide strong evidence for the null hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aczel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lee &amp; Wagenmakers, 2014</xref>). To assess participant performance in the task, we analyzed the average accuracy of their beliefs about the predator’s mean location, expressed as the estimation error. The estimation error represents the absolute difference between the participant’s predictions and the mean predator location, and lower estimation errors reflect higher accuracy. To examine the impact of internalizing psychopathology on performance, we divided participants into two groups based on their general-factor scores (low vs. high internalizing).</p>
<p>Subjects of the low-internalizing group had general-factor scores below the mean, and vice versa for the high-internalizing group. Comparisons of estimation errors between the low- (median = 33.43, IQR 30.55 to 36.99) and high-internalizing groups (median = 33.1, IQR 30.0 to 36.66) did not reveal a significant difference (Welch’s two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>t</italic><sub>551.55</sub> = 0.53, <italic>p</italic> = 0.59, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 9.259; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Similarly, we did not find a significant association between average estimation errors and general-factor scores across participants (<italic>r</italic>(554.0) = -0.02, <italic>p</italic> = 0.58, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 17.857; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined empirical single-trial learning rates and did not find a systematic relationship between learning behavior and internalizing psychopathology. The empirical learning rate expresses the influence of the prediction error on the belief update, which, in our task, corresponds to how much a participant updates the flame in response to a prediction error. A Welch’s two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, which accounts for unequal variances between groups, did not reveal a significant difference in the learning rate between the low-(median = 0.72, IQR 0.56 to 0.87) and high-internalizing groups (median = 0.67, IQR 0.53 to 0.85, <italic>t</italic><sub>534.6</sub> = 0.54, <italic>p</italic> = 0.59, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 9.174; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Similarly, the test did not reveal a significant association between learning rates and general-factor scores across participants (<italic>r</italic>(554.0) = -0.04, <italic>p</italic> = 0.34, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 13.158; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we examined the perseveration probability, which indicates the probability that participants repeat their predictions in subsequent trials. We did not find significant differences between the low-(median = 0.11, IQR 0.06 to 0.2) and high-internalizing groups (median = 0.11, IQR 0.05 to 0.18, <italic>t</italic><sub>540.21</sub> = 1.29, <italic>p</italic> = 0.2, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 4.695; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Similarly, initiation reaction times indicating when the flame was initially moved were not found to be significantly different between the low-(median = 455.0, IQR 369.75 to 577.25) and high-interalizing group (median = 451.5, IQR 355.25 to 575.75, <italic>t</italic><sub>516.98</sub> = 0.81, <italic>p</italic> = 0.42, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 7.692; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). Together, these analyses suggest comparable performance and learning-rate dynamics across the internalizing spectrum.</p>
<p>These analyses suggest that learning behavior and internalizing are not systematically related to each other, yet one potential concern is that the low- and high-internalizing groups might be best described by different latent phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Wise &amp; Dolan, 2020</xref>). To examine this, and to gain a finer-scale, computationally more transparent view of performance, we extracted parameters from a reduced Bayesian model using participant prediction errors – a method extensively validated in prior research (Bruckner, Nassar, et al., 2025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nassar, Bruckner, &amp; Frank, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Nassar et al., 2010</xref>). The reduced Bayesian model adjusts the learning rate on each trial in association with the prediction errors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). This model is formulated in line with the error-correcting delta rule commonly applied in reinforcement learning studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dayan &amp; Daw, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Sutton &amp; Barto, 2018</xref>). Specifically, the model forms a belief about the predator’s attack location based on the prediction error, expressing the difference between the actual and predicted outcome. The model then scales the prediction error according to a dynamically adjusted learning rate to update beliefs from trial to trial. The dynamic adjustment of the learning rate depends on two parameters, which quantify relative uncertainty and the change-point probability. Relative uncertainty reflects the model’s uncertainty about the predator’s attack location relative to its total uncertainty (sum of environmental variability and uncertainty about attack location). Relative uncertainty is high when only a few trials have been observed, and it decreases over stable trials when the mean location does not move as the model becomes more certain. The change-point probability specifies how likely it is that the mean location of the predator might move between trials. When this happens, prior beliefs are rendered obsolete, relative uncertainty increases, and re-learning is required. Larger prediction errors, signaling potential change points, increase change-point probability and drive higher learning rates for more substantial updates. In contrast, smaller prediction errors, likely resulting from risk, are given a lower weight, leading to subtle adjustments in the expected location of the predator (see Methods Reduced Bayesian model).</p>
<p>Using these extracted parameters, we applied linear regression to quantify the extent to which participants relied on fixed and adaptive learning rates (see Methods First-Level Regression Model). Adaptive learning rates are driven by change-point probability and relative uncertainty, computed by the reduced Bayesian model. In particular, the adaptive learning rate is characterized by larger updates in periods of uncertainty about the predator’s location and following larger prediction errors that are likely due to environmental changes. In contrast, the fixed learning rate reflects a constant influence of the prediction error on the belief update and corresponds to a heuristic learning strategy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). We assessed the split-half reliabilities of these parameters and found good reliabilities for all parameters, with the fixed learning rate having a Spearman <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.81 and the adaptive learning rate having <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.6 (see SM Split-Half Reliability). These split-half reliabilities indicate that the task and regression model provide a reasonable methodology for inferring the underlying differences in learning and adjustment thereof.</p>

The fixed learning rate represents a heuristic learning strategy through which the prediction error has a constant effect on the belief update, i.e., there is a linear relationship between update (difference between current and previous flame location) and prediction error.

</fig>
<p>Across participants, we found that learning behavior was characterized by a mixture of fixed (median = 0.58, IQR 0.41 to 0.8, Wilcoxon signed-rank <italic>W</italic> = 188.0, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001) and adaptive learning rates (median = 0.2, IQR 0.04 to 0.35, <italic>W</italic> = 19384.0, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001; <xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9a</xref>). To correct for multiple comparisons when statistically testing this and the following regression parameters, we applied the false discovery rate (FDR) correction (details in Methods False Discovery Rate Correction). The result that participants rely on both fixed and adaptive learning rates is consistent with previous work using similar tasks (Bruckner, Nassar, et al., 2025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nassar, Bruckner, &amp; Frank, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Nassar et al., 2016</xref>) and suggests that the task is well-suited for examining the relation between adaptive learning and internalizing.</p>
<p>Analyses examining the link between learning rates and internalizing psychopathology did not indicate any significant association (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). We first categorized participants into two groups based on their general-factor scores (low vs. high internalizing) and compared their reliance on the fixed learning rate. A Welch’s two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test did not reveal a significant difference in fixed learning rates between the low- (median = 0.58, IQR 0.41 to 0.8) and high-internalizing groups (median = 0.58, IQR 0.41 to 0.78, <italic>t</italic><sub>550.62</sub> = -0.22, <italic>p</italic> = 0.82, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 10.309; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Similarly, we did not find a significant relationship between fixed learning rates and general-factor scores across participants (<italic>r</italic>(554.0) = 0.003, <italic>p</italic> = 0.959, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 20.833; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, we did not find a significant relationship between adaptive learning rates and internalizing psychopathology in the low-(median = 0.18, IQR 0.04 to 0.36) compared to the high-internalizing group (median = 0.2, IQR 0.03 to 0.33, <italic>t</italic><sub>551.94</sub> = 0.19, <italic>p</italic> = 0.85, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 10.417; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Additionally, the test did not indicate a significant relationship between adaptive learning rates and internalizing psychopathology across participants (<italic>r</italic>(554.0) = -0.039, <italic>p</italic> = 0.744, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 13.333; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Finally, we did not find any significant association between the model parameters and the general factor G, the anxiety-related factor F1, or the depression-related factor F2 (SM <xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>, Table S2).</p>
<p>Taken together, our analysis did not provide convincing evidence for an association between learning impairments and internalizing psychopathology in both model-agnostic and model-based analyses of the predator task. Furthermore, Bayes factors supported the null hypothesis, providing evidence against a relationship between internalizing and learning.</p>
<p>One potential concern was that the extensive task training or the inclusion of multiple variability and hazard-rate conditions might mask the presence of potential impairments. To address this, we conducted an experiment (<italic>N</italic> = 76) using a predator-task version with minimal task training and a single variability and hazard-rate condition (Methods Experimental Details, Experiment 5). Consistent with our previous findings, we did not find any significant learning impairment associated with internalizing psychopathology (in fact, there was some evidence for increased adaptability in this condition; SM Minimal-Training Version <xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Fig. S12</xref>). These results were further supported by a control experiment (<italic>N</italic> = 89) in which we used a version of the predator task with a single variability and hazard-rate condition but retaining the full training protocol (Methods Experimental Details, Experiment 6; SM Control Version <xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">Fig. S13</xref>).</p>

<title>Results replicate in a laboratory study with electric shocks and screams as aversive stimuli</title>
<p>A potential concern that still remained was that impairments might only emerge with more intense aversive stimuli, such as electric shocks, as screams may not be sufficiently aversive to reveal these effects compared to shocks. Although existing literature supports the efficacy of screams as effective aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Beaurenaut et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Seow &amp; Hauser, 2022</xref>), we conducted an in-person laboratory study to address this issue more comprehensively.</p>
<p>In this study, <italic>N</italic> = 29 participants (22 females, mean age = 25.76 years, age range 20 to 41 years) completed four blocks of the predator task.

<p>We did not find a significant difference in performance, quantified by estimation errors, between screams and shocks (paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>t</italic><sub>28.0</sub> = -0.6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.55, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 3.236; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>).

<p>The analysis above suggests that behavioral responses elicited by screams are comparable to those elicited by shocks. To further validate the efficacy of screams as aversive stimuli, we analyzed skin conductance responses, correcting for multiple comparisons using cluster-based permutation testing (details in Methods Cluster-Based Permutation Testing). First, we observed a significant increase in the skin conductance response following outcome onset for failed trials (the predator caught the participant) compared to successful trials (pink curve compared to green curve, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>). Next, we compared the skin conductance response for the failed trials in shock and scream blocks.

Moreover, in line with the intuition that shocks are more aversive than screams, our comparison between the two types of stimuli revealed that the skin conductance response for screams was significantly lower than that for shocks (horizontal gray line in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.023). One potential explanation for our comparable behavioral effects despite the differences in the skin conductance response is that the perceived aversiveness that ultimately affects behavior might be similar between the conditions. These findings were further supported by an independent pilot study (Methods Experimental Details, Experiment 8 and SM <xref rid="figS14" ref-type="fig">Fig. S14</xref>), which employed a different version of the predator task while maintaining the aversive structure with screams and shocks in separate blocks.</p>
<p>In summary, we did not find significant learning impairments associated with internalizing psychopathology in either model-agnostic or model-based analyses of the predator task. These results were consistent across different task versions and aversive stimuli.</p>

<title>Binary Reversal Learning Task</title>
<p>One potential limitation is that our findings may be task-specific and not generalizable to other paradigms commonly used in the literature, most importantly, reversal learning. To address this concern and further test the three hypotheses outlined above, we next relied on three different versions of the established binary reversal learning task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Task design and model predictions</title>
<p>To examine reversal learning across the internalizing spectrum, we performed a study including a simplified version of the task in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Behrens et al. (2007)</xref> and the predator task with <italic>N</italic> = 179 participants (87 females, mean age = 31.68 years, range = 19 to 45 years). In the reversal learning task, participants were required to learn the underlying reward probabilities associated with two fractals to maximize their rewards (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). After making their choice, they received feedback indicating whether the chosen fractal resulted in a reward. Participants used this feedback to update their predictions and gradually learn the reward contingencies of both fractals as the task progressed. The task had two phases: a stable phase and a volatile phase (but with no signal for the transition). During the stable phase, the reward probabilities for both fractals remained consistent, while in the volatile phase, the reward probabilities switched every 20 trials, requiring participants to adapt to the changing contingencies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). The order of these phases was counterbalanced across participants. This version of the task did not include reward magnitudes for the fractals, focusing solely on assessing participants’ ability to learn the underlying reward probabilities and detect shifts in these probabilities. Results from this version are presented here, as including reward magnitudes can influence behavior in ways that reflect differences in decision strategies rather than differences in learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fang et al., 2024</xref>). Findings from the two task versions, which incorporated reward magnitudes for each fractal (similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>), are detailed in the SM (Task Version With Reward Magnitudes, Task Version with Outcome Magnitudes – Reward and Loss Domain).</p>

<p><bold>a</bold>| The participants’ goal in the task was to maximize rewards. They chose between two fractals on each trial, each associated with a different reward probability.

<p>Similar to the predator task, optimal learning behavior in this task can be modeled using a Bayesian inference framework, where the learning rate dynamically adjusts based on the environment’s volatility or rate of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bruckner, Heekeren, &amp; Nassar, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Piray &amp; Daw, 2020</xref>). The volatile Kalman filter (VKF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Piray and Daw, 2020</xref>) formalizes this process by continuously tracking environmental volatility and incorporating it into the learning rate in the error-correcting rule of the Kalman filter, allowing flexible adaptation to changing conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). Specifically, in the stable task phase with low volatility, the learning rate remains lower. Conversely, in the volatile phase, frequent reversals in outcome contingencies increase the model’s estimates of volatility, leading to a higher learning rate that facilitates more rapid adaptation to the changing environment.</p>

<title>No systematic learning impairments associated with internalizing psychopathology</title>
<p>There was no significant difference between the low- and high-internalizing groups in the performance on this task (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>). Similar to the above, we categorized participants into low-internalizing (<italic>N</italic> = 87) and high-internalizing groups (<italic>N</italic> = 92) based on their general-factor scores.

</fig>
<p>The results from the previous paragraph suggest comparable performance between low- and high-internalizing groups, contrary to the hypothesis that higher internalizing psychopathology is associated with impaired learning. However, as examined for the predator task, low and high internalizing might be associated with different computational phenotypes. To investigate this possibility, we fitted the VKF (see methods Binary Volatile Kalman Filter) and multiple variants of the canonical Rescorla-Wagner model inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al. (2020</xref>, see methods Model Space) to participants’ learning behavior. The results of the Rescorla-Wagner models are presented here, while qualitatively similar results from the VKF are presented in <xref rid="figS22" ref-type="fig">Fig. S22</xref>.</p>
<p>The versions of the Rescorla-Wagner model differed in how their parameters, such as the learning rate and inverse temperature, were further decomposed into components. For instance, in some models, the learning rate was divided into components based on environmental volatility (<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>V olatile</italic></sub> −<sub><italic>stable</italic></sub>), outcome valence (<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>Good</italic></sub> −<sub><italic>bad</italic></sub>), and other factors. Specifically, <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>V olatile</italic></sub> −<sub><italic>stable</italic></sub> captured the relative change in learning rate across task phases, with positive values indicating increased learning rates in the volatile phase compared to the stable phase. Meanwhile, <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>Good</italic></sub> −<sub><italic>bad</italic></sub> represented the relative difference in learning rates when learning from rewards versus no rewards. The models were fitted using hierarchical Bayesian estimation, where participants’ factor scores were incorporated in the model parameters (details in Methods Hierarchical model estimation). The population means for each model parameter were composed of an overall mean <italic>µ</italic><sub>0</sub> and the three factor-score-specific parameters <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>, <italic>B</italic><sub>1</sub>, and <italic>B</italic><sub>2</sub>. We assessed and compared models using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV), estimated through the Pareto-smoothed importance-sampling method (PSIS-LOO). The best-performing model, model 6, incorporated parameters and their interactions related to environmental volatility, outcome valence, and a choice kernel (details in Methods Model Space, SM Table S4). We assessed the reliability of model parameters using a split-half analysis, which revealed poor-to-moderate reliability for the learning-rate components (<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>Baseline</italic></sub> Spearman <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.5, <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>Good</italic>−<italic>bad</italic></sub> Spearman <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.23, <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>V olatile stable</italic></sub> Spearman <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.14, <italic>α</italic>(<italic>Good</italic>− <italic>bad</italic>)x(<italic>V olatile</italic> −<italic>stable</italic>) Spearman <italic>ρ</italic> = -0.01; for details see SM Split-Half Reliability).</p>
<p>We found that, independent of internalizing, learning rates across participants were influenced by environmental volatility and outcome valence. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref> shows the posterior distributions of the mean <italic>µ</italic><sub>0</sub> parameter for the different learning-rate components, where an effect is considered significant if the 95% highest-density interval (HDI) does not include zero. Participants learned more after good outcomes compared to bad outcomes (<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>Good</italic> − <italic>bad</italic></sub> <italic>µ</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.4, 95% HDI = [0.29, 0.52]). Additionally, learning rates were higher in the volatile phase compared to the stable phase (<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>V olatile</italic>−<italic>stable</italic></sub> <italic>µ</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.35, 95% HDI = [0.23, 0.49]). We did not find a significant interaction of outcome valence and task phase in relation to the learning rate (<italic>α</italic>(<italic>Good</italic> −<italic>bad</italic>)x(<italic>V olatile</italic>− <italic>stable</italic>) <italic>µ</italic><sub>0</sub> = -0.03, 95% HDI = [-0.12, 0.05]). These results are in line with previous research using reversal learning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>) and support its suitability to further investigate the role of internalizing psychopathology in learning impairments.</p>
<p>Therefore, we next examined group differences based on our model, but, consistent with the earlier analyses, we did not find a significant effect of internalizing on the learning rate. In particular, we investigated whether internalizing was related to the consideration of outcome valence, volatility, and their interaction. The analysis did not yield a significant impact of internalizing on the consideration of valence (<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>Good</italic>−<italic>bad</italic></sub> <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = 0.0, 95% HDI = [-0.11, 0.13]), volatility (<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>V olatile</italic>−<italic>stable</italic></sub> <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = 0.08, 95% HDI = [-0.03, 0.2]), and the interaction between the two (<italic>α</italic>(<italic>Good bad</italic>)x(<italic>V olatile</italic> − <italic>stable</italic>) <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = 0.03, 95% HDI = [-0.05, 0.1], with all 95% HDIs containing zero). Additionally, neither the anxiety-related (F1) nor depression-related (F2) factors were significantly associated with learning-rate components (SM <xref rid="figS19" ref-type="fig">Fig. S19</xref>).</p>
<p>While previous analyses did not indicate any significant differences in learning between individuals with low and high internalizing symptoms, we did observe an association between internalizing and choice stochasticity. Internalizing had a significant effect on the baseline inverse temperature parameter, with higher internalizing linked to an increase in the parameter value, leading to less choice stochasticity (<italic>B</italic><sub><italic>Baseline</italic></sub> <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = 0.19, 95% HDI = [0.05, 0.34]). Similarly, the depression-related factor (F2) was significantly associated with an increase in the baseline inverse temperature (<italic>B</italic><sub><italic>Baseline</italic></sub> <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> = 0.15, 95% HDI = [0.01, 0.28]). These results suggest that higher internalizing symptoms are associated with more deterministic choice behavior. However, this pattern appears to reflect a general decision-making heuristic, rather than differences in learning, and did not lead to statistically significant differences in task performance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Impaired learning under uncertainty has long been associated with trait anxiety and internalizing psychopathology. However, existing evidence on this relationship is inconsistent between studies. To address this, we conducted eight comprehensive online and in-person experiments, incorporating multiple tasks and physiological measurements. Our findings offer reasonably strong support for the absence of a systematic relationship between internalizing psychopathology, trait anxiety, and impaired learning abilities.</p>
<p>Prior work suggested three potential relationships between internalizing psychopathology and learning behavior. First, it might be associated with higher learning rates, specifically in response to negative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aylward et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Pike &amp; Robinson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Wise &amp; Dolan, 2020</xref>). Second, it could be linked to a selective impairment in responding to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>). Third, and ultimately corroborated by our results, internalizing and learning impairments might not be systematically related to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hammond et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hitchcock et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Suddell et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Ting et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>There are a number of potential reasons for the discrepancies in prior work that we aimed to address in our study. Inconsistencies may stem from insufficient reliability of tasks and computational assays, compromising the generalizability of findings. This is an important concern for computational psychiatry as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Enkavi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hedge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Karvelis et al., 2023</xref>). For instance, while behavioral measures in reversal learning tasks can exhibit good reliability, the reliability of model parameters varies considerably, with some evidence suggesting that hierarchical models help improve reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schaaf et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Waltmann et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, behavioral measures of predictive inference tasks generally show good reliability, but computational measures yielded mixed results in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Loosen et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, we observed moderate-to-good split-half reliabilities for all model parameters in the predator task. Moreover, to address the potential influences of practice on reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Karvelis et al., 2023</xref>), we incorporated an extensive training phase before the task and conducted a separate experiment without training to confirm that training did not bias the main results. Additionally, given the increased reliability of hierarchical models in reversal learning tasks, we used hierarchical Bayesian estimation methods to model behavior in these tasks. Nevertheless, our reliability analysis of the reversal learning task revealed mixed results, with learning-rate parameters exhibiting poor-to-moderate reliability, consistent with prior findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Suddell et al., 2024</xref>). This variability in parameter reliability raises concerns about the robustness and generalizability of previously reported effects in the literature.</p>
<p>Another potential source of the discrepancies in results reported in the literature stems from the heterogeneity of tasks and computational models employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Nair et al., 2020</xref>). Many studies rely on findings derived from bespoke learning tasks, which limits the comparability of results across studies. Additionally, the computational models used to analyze behavioral data vary widely, and researchers often employ different versions of the Rescorla-Wagner model or Bayesian frameworks to estimate learning rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Pike &amp; Robinson, 2022</xref>). Recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Eckstein et al. (2022)</xref> highlights the problems with comparing model parameters across tasks, showing that parameters – particularly those related to learning rates – are highly context-dependent and exhibit limited generalizability across tasks. This context dependence likely contributes to the inconsistent findings regarding the effects of trait anxiety and internalizing on learning. To address this issue, we investigated learning dynamics across two distinct tasks using multiple model families, including Bayesian models, hierarchical Rescorla-Wagner models, and volatile Kalman filters. These computational models were designed to be flexible, capturing variance in learning behavior driven by various factors such as fixed biases in learning, differential learning from positive versus negative outcomes, and changes in learning rates in response to environmental uncertainty. Importantly, these models were grounded in established methodologies (Bruckner, Nassar, et al., 2025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nassar, Bruckner, &amp; Frank, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Piray &amp; Daw, 2020</xref>), ensuring robust analyses while maintaining relevance and comparability to prior work. However, these models still do not encompass the entire range of possible models. Potential future work can explore the impact of different analyses and model specifications on results obtained from the same datasets (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Orben &amp; Przybylski, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, some of the previous studies on anxiety and learning relied on small to modest sample sizes ranging from 30 to 147 participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aylward et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hammond et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Huang et al., 2017</xref>), which limits statistical power and reduces the ability to detect effects reliably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Button et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Suddell et al., 2024</xref>). This is of particular importance given that recent work suggests these effects to be small and inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hammond et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, because small samples are only sufficiently powered to detect larger effects, their combination with field-wide biases, such as publication bias and the file-drawer effect, leads to selective reporting of significant findings. This inflates effect sizes, making them difficult to replicate and contributing to inconsistencies in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Button et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ioannidis, 2005</xref>). When combined with the flexibility in data collection and analysis, this increases the risk of false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Orben &amp; Przybylski, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Simmons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Simonsohn et al., 2019</xref>), ultimately adding to the inconsistencies observed in the field.</p>
<p>To ensure sufficient power to detect medium-sized effects, we recruited a large sample (<italic>N</italic> = 820) across multiple experiments, including 563 participants in the main predator task and 179 participants in the reversal learning task. This design provides at least an 80% power to detect medium effects (<italic>r</italic> ≥ 0.25), should they exist. Despite this, we did not find convincing evidence of impaired learning under internalizing – aligning with a recent high-powered study with clinical samples that similarly failed to detect such effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Suddell et al., 2024</xref>). These findings suggest that any effects, should they exist, are likely small (<italic>r</italic>≤ 0.25), a range where our study lacks sufficient power. If effects are small, then, even if they can reach statistical significance in large samples, they may not translate into meaningful behavioral differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gelman &amp; Stern, 2006</xref>). Addressing this issue in future research could take two complementary approaches. From a clinical perspective, it would be valuable to determine the magnitude of learning-rate differences that manifest as observable behavioral changes. From a computational perspective, simulations could be used to model behavior under varying parameter values, helping to identify the point at which differences in learning parameters produce meaningful shifts in decision-making. Together, these approaches could clarify what the true effect, if it exists, should look like to be considered an impairment.</p>
<p>A potential concern with online participant recruitment is data quality, which depends on participants’ attention and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Jun et al., 2017</xref>). One promising approach to improving data quality is task gamification – designing tasks to be more engaging and immersive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Long et al., 2023</xref>). Gamified tasks not only enhance participant motivation but also create decisionmaking environments that more closely resemble real-world contexts, making them intuitive and interactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Allen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Benrimoh et al., 2023</xref>). In line with this, the predator task was designed as a game in which participants had to defend themselves against attacking predators, with the environment structured to incorporate principles of predictive inference. This approach proved effective, as participants reported high task motivation. Additionally, to minimize the risk of spurious correlations arising from inattentive responses to psychological questionnaires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Zorowitz et al., 2023</xref>), we excluded participants who failed attention checks embedded in the questionnaires. We also excluded participants who failed the headphone checks, thus filtering out potentially unmotivated participants who may have disregarded instructions. These methodological considerations aimed to increase the robustness of our findings. Furthermore, our results were consistent with those obtained in a laboratory setting, both in behavior and task aversiveness, as well as with results that we obtained from a reversal learning task previously used in the literature, adding further credibility to our conclusions.</p>
<p>A recent large-scale study also did not find convincing evidence of learning impairments associated with internalizing in a clinical sample with anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Suddell et al., 2024</xref>). However, it reported poor reliability of model parameters in the reversal learning task, leaving open the question of whether inconsistencies in the literature stem from unreliable parameters or a genuine absence of an effect of internalizing on learning. In our study, the predator task yielded more reliable model parameters than the reversal learning task, alleviating concerns that our findings are merely driven by reliability issues. Additionally, to our knowledge, our study is the first to systematically examine the impact of internalizing on learning in a large subclinical sample across two distinct tasks, both online and in-person, and across multiple task variants. The consistency of our findings across tasks, coupled with their alignment with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Suddell et al. (2024)</xref>, provides further support for the hypothesis that internalizing is not systematically linked to impaired learning under uncertainty. Nonetheless, an important limitation of our study is that we did not include clinical subjects. Therefore, our results might not generalize to clinical samples, and future work could address this comprehensively. Additionally, impairments related to internalizing and social anxiety may be more pronounced in social learning contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lamba et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Müller-Pinzler et al., 2019</xref>), which were not tested in our study and remain an important direction for future work.</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite several influential studies reporting a link between internalizing psychopathology and impaired learning under uncertainty, our findings provide no convincing evidence for the existence of a systematic relationship. By leveraging two well-established tasks – spanning both continuous and discrete binary learning domains – our study offers one of the most comprehensive and large-scale investigations of this question to date. These results help clarify a previously inconsistent literature and suggest that the relationship between internalizing traits and adaptive learning may be weaker or less robust than previously assumed.</p>

<title>Psychological Questionnaires</title>
<p>Participants completed a battery of widely used psychological questionnaires before starting the tasks. These questionnaires were selected to measure symptoms related to anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and depression and included the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Form Y1, Y2 (STAI-State, STAI-Trait; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Spielberger et al., 1983</xref>), State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA-Trait; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Ree et al., 2008</xref>), Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Freeston et al., 1994</xref>), Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Beck et al., 1961</xref>) and Internet Gaming Disorder Scale - Short Form (IGDS9-SF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Pontes and Griffiths, 2015</xref>). In experiments 1-5, the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Meyer et al., 1990</xref>) and Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Watson and Clark, 2012</xref>) were also included to align more closely with the measures used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al.

<sec id="s4c1">
<title>Questionnaire Attention Checks</title>
<p>Inattentive responses to questionnaire items can result in spurious correlations between task behavior and symptom measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Meade &amp; Craig, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Zorowitz et al., 2023</xref>). To identify and control for inattentive participants, we embedded five infrequency items (e.g., “I work fourteen months in a year”) into our questionnaires. These questions were designed to have only one or two plausible correct answers. Participants who failed more than two of these infrequency items were excluded from the data analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c2">
<title>Headphone Screening</title>
<p>To ensure participants used headphones and maintained appropriate sound levels necessary to hear the aversive screams, we administered headphone screening checks at the beginning and midpoint of the predator task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Milne et al., 2021</xref>). For each headphone check, participants underwent three trials where they had to identify a beep among three consecutively presented tones. Two of these tones were white noise, while the tone containing the beep was designed to be audible only through headphones, not loudspeakers. Participants needed to correctly identify the beep in at least two out of three trials across two attempts. If they failed to meet this criterion either at the start or during the task, their data were excluded from further analysis. Exclusion rates for each experiment are detailed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c3">
<title>Performance-Based Exclusion</title>
<p>Participants who did not complete all blocks of a task were excluded from further analysis. In the probabilistic reversal learning task, participants who did not make any choice for more than 15% of the trials or who consistently selected images from only one side of the screen (either left or right) across both blocks demonstrated either a poor understanding of the task or low motivation. As a result, their data were excluded from further analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c4">
<title>Factor Analysis</title>
<p>We conducted an exploratory bi-factor analysis on item-level responses from 164 questionnaire items, belonging to STAI-S, STAI-T, STICSA-T, BDI, IUS-27, MASQ, and PSWQ. The analysis included data from <italic>N</italic> = 758 participants across experiments 1-5 who completed all questionnaires and passed the Questionnaire Attention Checks. To improve the interpretability of factor loadings, we applied reverse scoring to flip the response scale of negatively phrased items, ensuring that higher scores consistently reflect the same meaning across all questions.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al. (2020)</xref>, we determined the number of factors using a combination of methods: prior research, visual inspection of the scree plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cattell, 1966</xref>), and parallel analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Horn, 1965</xref>). Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Chorpita et al., 2000</xref>; L. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Simms et al., 2008</xref>) support a three-factor hierarchical structure for anxiety and depression, comprising a general internalizing factor that captures shared variance, and two sub-factors: an anxiety-related factor and a depression-related factor. Consistent with these findings, the scree plot indicated three eigenvalues above the elbow. Parallel analysis, which compared the eigenvalues from our dataset with those generated from a resampled version of the original dataset, further validated the three-factor structure (see SM Factor Analysis).</p>
<p>Next, we performed factor analysis using polychoric correlations, specifying the pre-determined number of factors. An oblique rotation and a Schmid-Leimann transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Schmid &amp; Leiman, 1957</xref>) were applied to extract two lower-level factors, F1 and F2, and a higher-level general factor G. G exhibited moderate-to-high loadings across all items, reflecting shared variance. F1 and F2 exhibited loadings for anxiety-related and depression-related questionnaire items, respectively. Factor scores for all participants were then calculated using the Anderson-Rubin method, ensuring orthogonality of the factor structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Anderson &amp; Rubin, 1956</xref>).</p>
<p>For experiments 6 and 7, where MASQ and PSWQ were not included in the questionnaire battery, factor scores were derived using factor loadings identified in the above analysis for common questionnaire items.</p>
<p>The factor analyses were carried out in <italic>R</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">R Core Team, 2021</xref>) using the <monospace>Psych</monospace> library, with the <monospace>fa.parallel</monospace> function used for the parallel analysis and the <monospace>omega</monospace> function used for the factor analysis.</p>

<title>Experimental Tasks</title>
<p>We first provide intuitive explanations of our two tasks (predator task and reversal learning task), and then explain the formal task models in detail.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c6">
<title>Predator Task</title>
<p>The predator task is an online, game-based variant of an established predictive inference task (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nassar, Bruckner, &amp; Frank, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Nassar et al., 2010</xref>). The participants’ aim in the task was to protect themselves from attacking predators. The task’s cover story set the scene in a jungle clearing where participants gathered gold while predators lurked among the bushes at the center of the screen. At the beginning of each trial, an audio tone alerted participants to an impending predator attack. The predators started off hidden in the forest and typically ran in a specific direction, though with some variability. Using their mouse, participants initiated and controlled a fire, which could be moved in a circle around the center of the screen and placed appropriately to attempt to fend off the predator. After the warning tone, participants needed to predict the predators’ attack direction based on previous trials, and place the fire at that location. Once placed, the fire’s position was fixed for the trial, and its size varied randomly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, first panel). The predator then revealed itself by charging in a specific direction. If the fire was correctly placed in its path, the predator was warded off and kept confined to the center, with the participants gaining 10 points. If the fire failed to align with the predator’s path, the predator attacked and caught the participants, triggering an aversive scream (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, second panel). If the participants failed to initiate the fire within the allocated time limit (5s), they additionally lost 10 points. Following this outcome, participants received feedback displayed as markers indicating the predator’s actual attack location (in red) and their own prediction (in blue). These markers remained visible while participants made their next prediction, allowing them to see the previous prediction errors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, third panel). This design aimed to reduce the influence of working memory differences on learning behavior, encouraging participants to adjust their predictions based solely on prediction errors.</p>
<p>The predator attack locations were sampled from a von Mises (circular Gaussian) distribution, with the mean representing the most probable attack direction and the standard deviation indicating the inherent variability in the attack direction. To maximize their chances of survival, participants had to learn the mean of the distribution and place the fire there, while disregarding the errors caused by the outcome variability. After participants placed the fire, the flame size varied randomly on each trial, sampled from a truncated exponential distribution. A fixed flame size could introduce performance biases – if too large, it would always deter predators, while if too small, it would never provide protection. By varying flame sizes, we eliminated this confound, decorrelating torch size from performance while also encouraging participants to make the best possible predictions on each trial. Occasionally, the predator’s attack direction shifted entirely due to a change in the mean of the Gaussian distribution, representing an environmental change point. In the instance of a change point, participants needed to quickly update their beliefs to relearn the new attack direction. Thus, on each trial, prediction errors could result either from random outcome variability or from a genuine change point. The core challenge of the task was to differentiate between prediction errors caused by systematic changes and those stemming from outcome variability and to adaptively use these errors for belief updating.</p>
<p>Before starting the predator task, participants underwent a comprehensive training session, which included a final quiz to assess their understanding of the task and to provide feedback about their understanding (details in SM Training Quiz). The task was programmed in JavaScript, mainly using the Phaser 3 game development framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://phaser.io">https://phaser.io</ext-link>). Google Firebase services were utilized for both hosting the game and managing data storage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://firebase.google.com/">https://firebase.google.com/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Task Variants</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Different variability and hazard rate</bold>: The main version of the predator task (experiments 1,2,3 and 4) employed a 2-by-2 design with 4 distinct conditions, varying in levels of variability (low standard deviation <italic>σ</italic> = 20, high <italic>σ</italic> = 30) and hazard rate (low <italic>h</italic> = 0.1, high <italic>h</italic> = 0.16), presented across 4 blocks. While variability and hazard rate differed between blocks, they remained consistent within each block. In the <bold>low-variability, low-hazard-rate condition</bold>, outcomes were weakly corrupted by variability, making it relatively easier to identify change points. Here, an ideal agent would learn more from large prediction errors, as they likely signal change points. In contrast, in the <bold>high-variability, low-hazard-rate condition</bold>, outcomes were more heavily influenced by variability, making change points harder to detect. In this scenario, an ideal observer would adopt a lower learning rate to avoid overreacting to variability. In the <bold>low-variability, high-hazard-rate condition</bold>, the mean of the predator attack distribution changed frequently. A higher learning rate is advantageous in this condition to cope with frequent changes. Finally, in the <bold>high-variability, high-hazard-rate condition</bold>, the combination of high variability and frequent changes made it difficult to distinguish random variability from true change points, necessitating a lower learning rate. The order of conditions was counterbalanced across participants to control for order effects. This experiment allowed us to analyze the impact of varying variability and hazard rates on learning, and to investigate whether trait anxiety and internalizing psychopathologies are associated with impaired adaptation to variability and environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Piray &amp; Daw, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">2024</xref>). All participants underwent task training with one condition (low variability and low hazard rate) before starting the task.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Control task - minimal instructions</bold>: To evaluate whether task training influenced learning, experiment 5 used a task version that provided participants with only minimal instructions and training before they began. In this version, participants completed 6 blocks of the predator task, with each block consisting of 80 trials. All blocks had the same levels of variability (low variability: <italic>σ</italic> = 20 degrees) and hazard rate (low hazard rate <italic>h</italic> = 0.1), but participants received minimal training beforehand. Comparing the results of this task to the main task allowed us to determine whether the lack of observed effects of internalizing psychopathology on learning could be attributed to the comprehensive training phase in the main task.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Control task - one condition</bold>: As a control for the minimal-training task version, in experiment 6 we used a task version with a similar structure but included the full training before starting the task. In this version, participants completed 6 blocks of the predator task, where each block consisted of 65 trials. All blocks had the same levels of variability (low variability: <italic>σ</italic> = 20 degrees) and hazard rate (low hazard rate <italic>h</italic> = 0.1). All participants underwent comprehensive task training before starting the task. This design acted as a control condition for the previous experiment, having minimal task training, and also allowed us to analyze learning across a substantial number of trials for a single condition</p></list-item>

<title>Binary Reversal Learning Task</title>
<p>In this study, we also used different variants of a binary reversal learning task (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>) along with the predator task. Here, we describe the basic version used in experiment 2, with modifications for experiments 3 and 4 detailed below. On each trial, participants chose between two fractals presented on either side of the computer screen, separated by a fixation cross in the center (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>, top panel). Each fractal was probabilistically associated with the receipt of a reward, and participants aimed to select the fractal most likely to yield a reward on that trial (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>, middle panel). After making their selection, participants were provided with feedback in which only the rewarding fractal remained on screen, and participants received 10 points if this was the fractal they selected (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>, bottom panel). Participants had 6 seconds to make a choice, and if they did not respond within this time, the trial was marked as ‘failed’, and 10 points were deducted from their total number of points. Feedback then indicated the rewarding fractal for that trial. To control for location-related choice biases, we randomized the fractal location on the screen. The main goal of the task was for the participants to learn the underlying reward probabilities of each fractal and maximize their points by consistently choosing the fractal with the highest probability of reward.</p>
<p>The task was divided into two distinct phases: a stable phase and a volatile phase, each consisting of 2 blocks with 80 trials per block. In the stable phase, the reward probabilities remained constant throughout; one fractal had a 75% chance of delivering a reward, while the other fractal had a 25% chance. In contrast, in the volatile phase, the highest reward probability was increased to 80%, but the fractal associated with the highest probability changed every 20 trials. This phase required participants to continually update their beliefs in response to shifts in reward contingencies. Participants were not informed about these phases or their distinct structures. To control for potential order effects, we counterbalanced the order of the stable and volatile phases across participants.</p>

<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><bold>Reversal learning task</bold>: Reversal learning task described above.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Reversal learning task with outcome magnitudes</bold>: In the reversal learning task in experiment 3, each fractal was also associated with reward magnitudes, displayed within a circle above each fractal. These magnitudes were independent of the reward probabilities but determined the number of points earned by the participants if they chose the correct fractal. Reward magnitudes varied randomly from 1 to 99 for each fractal and changed from trial to trial. Participants were instructed to consider both the reward probabilities and reward magnitudes of the fractals while making a choice on each trial. The design of the reversal learning task with reward magnitudes aligns with previously established task versions in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Reversal learning task with outcome magnitudes - reward and loss domain</bold>: In the version of the task in experiment 4, participants completed both a reward-based and a loss-based reversal learning task with outcome magnitudes. In the reward version, reward magnitudes were displayed above the fractals, and participants earned the corresponding rewards for selecting the correct fractal. Conversely, in the loss version, participants started with 10,000 points and lost the corresponding magnitude displayed above the fractal when they chose the incorrect one. While the tasks differed in their framing (reward vs. loss), the underlying structure was the same. Each task further consisted of a stable and a volatile block, with 90 trials in each block. The order of the two tasks was counterbalanced across participants, and each participant was randomly assigned to one of two schedules, which predetermined the outcomes and magnitudes. This design, consistent with prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>), enabled us to investigate whether the outcome domain (reward vs. loss) influences learning in individuals with internalizing psychopathology.</p></list-item>

<title>Reduced Bayesian model</title>
<p>The predator task can be modeled using Bayesian change-point-detection algorithms that predict future outcomes based on all previous outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Adams &amp; MacKay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>). While theoretically robust, these algorithms require tracking all possible change-point combinations, posing computational challenges that may be unrealistic for human cognition. To address this, Nassar and colleagues proposed a reduced Bayesian model that approximates the solution of the full Bayesian model while remaining computationally feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Nassar et al., 2010</xref>, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the reduced Bayesian model, the learning rate is dynamically regulated by two parameters: relative uncertainty (RU) and change-point probability (CPP). RU quantifies the estimation uncertainty in the model’s belief about the predator’s attack location relative to environmental variability and estimation uncertainty. RU is high at the start (or after a known change point) and decreases as the model observes more trials and becomes more certain about the predator’s location. When a change point occurs, previously learned estimates are no longer predictive, requiring the model to relearn the new predator attack locations. Since the occurrence of a change point is unknown to the model, it infers it based on the computed CPP parameter, which estimates the probability of a change point based on the most recent prediction error. The learning rate of the reduced Bayesian model is a weighted combination of both RU and CPP. When CPP is high, the most recent outcome primarily determines the learning rate, while earlier outcomes are forgotten. Conversely, when CPP is low, learning is primarily driven by RU, and the model considers information from multiple past outcomes to predict the next predator location. We assume the following variables:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">

<title>First-Level Regression Model</title>
<p>To understand the factors influencing trial-by-trial updates for each participant, we applied regression models incorporating both normative and non-normative parameters. This approach enabled us to assess the extent to which participants relied on an adaptive learning rate derived from the reduced Bayesian model and a fixed learning rate modeling a static influence of the prediction error on the belief update. To account for block-specific effects, the regression models also included coefficients for the variability and hazard-rate conditions, with the equation of the best-fitting model given as:

<title>Stimulus Calibration and Skin Conductance Response Measurements</title>
<p>In the in-person laboratory study, participants completed a version of the predator task that used either electrical shocks or screams as aversive stimuli. Electrical shocks were delivered as three 2-ms pulses, each separated by 15 ms, using a Digitimer DS5 (Digitimer Limited, United Kingdom) isolated bipolar constant current stimulator. The DS5 received an analog voltage input from the presentation computer via a National Instruments Data Acquisition System (National Instruments, USA), which was converted into isolated constant-current electrical shocks. These shocks were administered through a Digitimer wasp stimulation electrode attached to the participant’s lower shin, delivering a sharp and uncomfortable stimulus. Skin conductance responses (SCR) were recorded using two electrodes attached to the index and middle fingertips of the left hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gershman &amp; Hartley, 2015</xref>), a position particularly suitable for SCR recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Ojala &amp; Bach, 2020</xref>). The SCR data were recorded through a 16-channel BrainAmp ExG amplifier (Brain Products GmbH, Germany) with the BrainVision Recorder software.</p>
<p>The SCR data, along with task triggers for trial and outcome onset, were stored in the BrainVision core data format (CDF) and preprocessed in Python using the MNE-Python package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Gramfort et al., 2013</xref>). SCR preprocessing steps included applying a first-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 5 Hz, downsampling the data from 5000 Hz to 100 Hz, <italic>z</italic>-scoring, and further downsampling to 10 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bach et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Gerster et al., 2018</xref>). Task events were epoched from 2 seconds before to 9 seconds after outcome presentation, with baseline correction applied using a 0.5-second window before outcome onset. To prepare the SCR data for analysis, all participants’ data were combined and averaged across epochs for each combination of timestamps, participants, and task-relevant variables.</p>
<p>To cater to individual differences in shock perception across participants, the pulse amplitude was individualized using a staircase procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aylward et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Wise et al., 2019</xref>). The procedure began with a pulse amplitude of 100 mV, which was increased in 100 mV increments. At each step, participants rated the perceived intensity of shocks on a scale from 1 (minimal pain) to 10 (maximum tolerable pain for the task). This process continued until a rating of 10 was achieved or the maximum amplitude of 3.5 V was reached. This procedure was repeated three times, and the average amplitude corresponding to the rating of 10 across the three runs was calculated. The shock intensity for the task was set at 80% of this average. Finally, participants received seven test shocks at this chosen intensity, delivered at random intervals ranging from 3 to 7 s, to confirm that the intensity was tolerable.</p>
<p>Aversive screams were delivered using headphones, and a similar staircase procedure was used to calibrate the sound intensity for each participant in experiment 7. Here, participants rated the volume intensity of the screams from 1 (minimum sound intensity) to 10 (maximum tolerable sound intensity), while the volume level increased by 3% on each step, with the procedure repeated three times. The average sound intensity corresponding to the rating of 10 across the three runs was calculated, with the final sound intensity chosen as 80% of this maximum value. Participants then received seven test screams at this volume, delivered at random intervals, to ensure tolerability.</p>

<p>In this model, we explored the possibility that participants learn independent reward probabilities for each fractal, despite the actual reward probabilities for both fractals being yoked together.

In this model, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="653409v1_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> if fractal 2 is chosen and followed by a reward, whereas <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="653409v1_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> if fractal 1 is chosen and followed by a reward; otherwise, these variables are set to 0.

<p>Specifically, each individual-level parameter was assigned a population-level normal distribution shared across participants. The mean <italic>µ</italic> of this population distribution was specified by a linear model estimated separately for each parameter

<p>As an additional analysis, we fitted a binary volatile Kalman filter (VKF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Piray and Daw, 2020</xref>) to participant data from the reversal learning task. Kalman filters are widely used to infer hidden environmental states, especially when the environment is gradually changing. The binary VKF is specifically designed for environments with binary observations and changing volatility. It tracks environmental volatility on each trial, which directly influences the learning rate in the update rule (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Piray and Daw, 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Factor Analysis</title>
<p>We conducted a factor analysis using data from <italic>N</italic> = 748 participants. To verify the suitability of the questionnaire data for factor analysis, we employed the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Kaiser &amp; Rice, 1974</xref>) and Bartlett’s test of sphericity (BST, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Bartlett, 1951</xref>). The KMO assesses the proportion of variance that may be attributed to common variance among variables, with higher values indicating greater suitability for factor analysis. Our dataset achieved a total KMO value of 0.955, confirming its adequacy for factor analysis. This result was further supported by the BST results (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 50350.3, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001), demonstrating that the correlation matrix is not an identity matrix and is, therefore, appropriate for factor analysis.</p>
<p>We determined the number of factors by combining theoretical considerations, visual inspection of the scree plot, and parallel analysis. Parallel analysis compares the eigenvalues of the observed dataset with those derived from either a dataset generated by sampling from a Gaussian distribution or a resampled version of the original dataset with the same dimensions. This approach helps identify factors with eigenvalues that are higher than those expected from random noise, providing candidates for factor selection. However, parallel analysis using a randomly generated normal dataset can overestimate the number of factors, particularly in large samples, as the random eigenvalues tend to converge around 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Hayton et al., 2004</xref>). This can result in many eigenvalues from the observed data exceeding the threshold, suggesting an unrealistic number of factors. To mitigate this, we combined theoretical insights, the scree plot’s inflection point, and eigenvalues from the resampled dataset to refine our factor selection.</p>
<p>For our dataset, parallel analysis using the random normal dataset suggested 48 factors—an implausibly high number (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). In contrast, parallel analysis using the resampled dataset identified a three-factor structure, which aligned with theoretical expectations and previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Simms et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we adopted this three-factor model for further analysis.</p>

<caption><title>Scree plot of eigenvalues and parallel analysis results.</title>
<p>The plot shows the eigenvalues of our questionnaire data, ordered in descending magnitude. The red dotted lines represent thresholds derived from parallel analyses, with a factor considered viable if its corresponding eigenvalue lies above the threshold. Using a randomly generated normal dataset, the parallel analysis yields eigenvalue thresholds close to 1 due to the large sample size, suggesting an unrealistic number of 48 factors. In contrast, parallel analysis with resampled data provides higher thresholds, identifying only three eigenvalues above the threshold. This supports a three-factor structure consistent with prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al., 2020</xref>).</p></caption>

<title>Comparing factor structure with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al. (2020)</xref></title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al. (2020)</xref> performed factor analysis on a clinical dataset (<italic>N</italic> = 86) and validated the factor structure using an independent online sample (<italic>N</italic> = 199). We compared the factor loadings and scores from our analysis with those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al. (2020)</xref>, focusing on common questionnaire items. Our loadings were highly congruent with those from the clinical dataset for the general factor (cosine similarity = 0.97) and the depression-related factor (cosine similarity = 0.80) and showed moderate congruence for the anxiety-related factor (cosine similarity = 0.47). Comparisons with the independent online sample from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al. (2020)</xref> indicated strong congruence across all factors, with cosine similarities of 0.97 (general factor), 0.88 (depression-related factor), and 0.90 (anxiety-related factor).</p>
<p>As a control analysis, we applied the factor loadings from the clinical and online samples of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al. (2020)</xref> to our dataset to compute factor scores for all participants, and then compared these scores with our own factor scores (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). The general-factor scores showed large correlations with those derived from both the clinical loadings (<italic>r</italic> = 0.71) and the online loadings (<italic>r</italic> = 0.93). Similarly, the depression-related factor scores exhibited large correlations with scores based on the clinical loadings (<italic>r</italic> = 0.75) and the online loadings (<italic>r</italic> = 0.89). However, for the anxiety-related factor, correlations were small for the clinical dataset (<italic>r</italic> = -0.07) but large for the online dataset (<italic>r</italic> = 0.9) from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al. (2020)</xref>. These findings highlight the strong congruence between our factor structure and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al. (2020)</xref>, particularly for the general and depression-related factors. The discrepancy in the anxiety-related factor, showing alignment with the online sample but not the clinical sample, suggests that clinical populations may exhibit distinct latent anxiety-related constructs compared to the general population.</p>

<title>Training Quiz</title>
<p>After completing the initial training phase of the predator task, participants were assessed on their understanding of the task through a brief quiz consisting of three multiple-choice questions. The questions were: (1) “When should you turn the fire on?” (2) “Where should you place the fire after turning it on?” and (3) “How do you get more points in the game?” Each question offered four answer options. After submitting their answers, participants received immediate feedback on their responses, along with a concise explanation of the correct answers to reinforce their understanding of the task.</p>

<title>Task Version with Different Variability and Hazard-Rate Conditions</title>
<p>In experiments 1-4, a total of <italic>N</italic> = 563 participants (demographic details in Table S1) completed a predator-task version with different variability and hazard-rate conditions. Nine participants who identified their gender as “non-binary” were excluded due to insufficient sample size for appropriately controlling for gender, resulting in a final sample of <italic>N</italic> = 554 participants. Before starting the task, participants received training and completed a training quiz to assess their understanding. Analysis of the quiz data showed that participants demonstrated a good understanding of the task: 392 participants answered all three questions correctly, 137 answered two questions correctly, 24 answered one question correctly, and only one participant failed to answer any question correctly (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Descriptive Results</title>
<p>Next, we analyzed estimation errors across the different variability and hazard-rate conditions. Participants had higher estimation errors in the high-variability condition (median = 36.26, IQR 32.93 to 40.7) compared to the low-variability condition (median = 29.58, IQR 26.74 to 33.75, paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>t</italic><sub>553</sub> = -24.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 0). Similarly, participants had higher estimation errors in the high-hazard-rate condition (median = 35.72, IQR 32.69 to 40.32) compared to the low-hazard-rate condition (media = 30.36, IQR 27.23 to 34.21, <italic>t</italic><sub>553</sub> = -21.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 0). These results suggest an effective implementation of the variability and hazard-rate manipulations in this task version. Importantly, the results were consistent when analyzing estimation errors across conditions separately for each of the four experiments (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>), where estimation errors were consistently lower in the low-variability and the low-hazard-rate condition compared to their respective counterparts.</p>
<p>Next, we examined whether internalizing-related differences in estimation errors and empirical learning rates emerged across the different variability and hazard-rate conditions (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). We did not find any significant differences in estimation errors between the low- and high-internalizing groups in any condition (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5 a-d</xref>). Likewise, regression analyses of estimation errors against internalizing, while controlling for age and gender, did not reveal a significant association in any of these conditions (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5 e-h</xref>). Similarly, empirical learning rates were not observed to be significantly different between internalizing groups (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5 i-l</xref>) and were not found to be significantly associated with internalizing scores in any of the conditions (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5 m-p</xref>). These results suggest that while the different variability and hazard-rate conditions do have an influence on the overall performance across participants, they are not associated with any internalizing-related learning impairments.</p>

<title>In-Person Study</title>
<p>To assess the efficacy of screams as an aversive stimulus compared to electric shocks, experiments 7 and 8 incorporated versions of the predator task in which some blocks featured screams while others featured shocks.

<p>For the loss domain, we did not find any significant associations of internalizing with total scores, performance, or switching behavior (<xref rid="figS30" ref-type="fig">Fig. S30</xref>). Participants started this task with an initial score of 10,000 points, which reduced after every loss. We did not find a significant difference in the final participant score between the low- and high-internalizing groups, for either task phase (stable phase: Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>t</italic><sub>155.74</sub> = 0.99, <italic>p</italic> = 0.75, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 3.745, volatile phase: <italic>t</italic><sub>158.7</sub> = 0.31, <italic>p</italic> = 0.77, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 5.618; <xref rid="figS30" ref-type="fig">Fig. S30a</xref>). Similarly, in a regression analysis, we did not find a significant association of the final score with internalizing in the stable phase (<italic>r</italic>(161) = -0.11, <italic>p</italic> = 0.75, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 4.926) and the volatile phase (<italic>r</italic>(161) = -0.11, <italic>p</italic> = 0.75, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 4.854; <xref rid="figS30" ref-type="fig">Fig. S30b</xref>). The analysis also did not reveal a significant difference in performance between the two internalizing groups for either task phase (stable phase: <italic>t</italic><sub>158.65</sub> = -1.8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.56, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 1.328, volatile phase: <italic>t</italic><sub>154.43</sub> = -0.77, <italic>p</italic> = 0.77, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 4.464; <xref rid="figS30" ref-type="fig">Fig. S30c</xref>). Regression of performance with internalizing also did not reveal any significant association in either the stable (<italic>r</italic>(161) = 0.16, <italic>p</italic> = 0.48, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 1.139) or the volatile phase (<italic>r</italic>(161) = 0.03, <italic>p</italic> = 0.77, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 10.526; <xref rid="figS30" ref-type="fig">Fig. S30d</xref>). Analysis of switch percentage following no loss (successful trials) did not reveal any significant difference between the two internalizing groups, for either the stable or volatile phase (stable phase: <italic>t</italic><sub>156.01</sub> = 1.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.75, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 3.704, volatile phase: <italic>t</italic><sub>159.0</sub> = 0.58, <italic>p</italic> = 0.77, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 5.025; <xref rid="figS30" ref-type="fig">Fig. S30e</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, regression analysis did not reveal any significant association between internalizing and switch percentage following no-loss trials for either the stable (<italic>r</italic>(161) = -0.08, <italic>p</italic> = 0.75, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 7.092) or the volatile phase (<italic>r</italic>(161) = -0.03, <italic>p</italic> = 0.77, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 10.638 <xref rid="figS30" ref-type="fig">Fig. S30f</xref>). This pattern was also found in the percentage of switches following losses, where we did not find a significant difference between the low- and high-internalizing groups, in either task phase (stable phase: <italic>t</italic><sub>158.95</sub> = -0.69, <italic>p</italic> = 0.77, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 4.717, volatile phase: <italic>t</italic><sub>158.99</sub> = -0.45, <italic>p</italic> = 0.77, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 5.348; <xref rid="figS30" ref-type="fig">Fig. S30g</xref>). Similarly, regression analysis did not reveal a significant association between internalizing and switch percentages following failed trials, in either the stable (<italic>r</italic>(161) = 0.04, <italic>p</italic> = 0.77, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 9.174) or the volatile phase (<italic>r</italic>(161) = 0.02, <italic>p</italic> = 0.77, <italic>BF</italic><sub>01</sub> = 10.87; <xref rid="figS30" ref-type="fig">Fig. S30h</xref>). This result contrasts with findings from the reward domain, where participants exhibited increased switching following losses during the volatile phase.</p>

<p>We fitted all hierarchical models from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Gagne et al. (2020)</xref> to behavioral data from the reversal learning task with reward and loss domains.

<title>Model Results</title>
<p>Across participants, learning rates were significantly influenced by outcome valence (good vs. bad) and task phase (volatile vs. stable), but were not significantly affected by task domain (reward vs. loss) (<xref rid="figS32" ref-type="fig">Fig. S32a</xref>). Specifically, participants exhibited a higher learning rate following good outcomes compared to bad outcomes (<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>Good</italic>− <italic>bad</italic></sub> <italic>µ</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1.63, 95% HDI = [1.21, 2.09]).

<p>We did not find a significant effect of internalizing on any of the learning-rate components (<xref rid="figS33" ref-type="fig">Fig. S33a</xref>), with all the 95% HDI’s containing zero. Specifically, we did not find internalizing to have a significant influence on learning from outcome valence, task phase, or their interaction (<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>Baseline</italic></sub> <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = 0.36, 95% HDI = [-0.22, 0.97], <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>Good</italic>−<italic>bad</italic></sub> <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = -0.27, 95% HDI = [-0.6, 0.01], <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>V olatile</italic>−<italic>stable</italic></sub> <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = -0.14, 95% HDI = [-0.36, 0.07], <italic>α</italic><sub>(<italic>Good</italic> −<italic>bad</italic>)<italic>x</italic>(<italic>V olatile</italic> −<italic>stable</italic>)</sub> <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = -0.11, 95% HDI = [-0.33, 0.1]).

Further, dividing participants into low- and high-internalizing groups based on their general-factor scores and visualizing their learning rates across valence and task-phase conditions for each domain revealed no qualitative differences. Learning rates for good vs. bad outcomes in either the stable or volatile phase appeared comparable between groups across both task domains (<xref rid="figS33" ref-type="fig">Fig. S33b</xref> andS33c).

<p>Additionally, the analysis did not reveal a significant effect of the anxiety-related factor F1 on any learning-rate component (<xref rid="figS34" ref-type="fig">Fig. S34a</xref>). However, we found a marginal effect of the depression-related factor F2 on the interaction between outcome valence and task phase, with higher learning from good compared to bad outcomes in the volatile phase relative to the stable phase (<italic>α</italic><sub>(<italic>Good</italic> −<italic>bad</italic>)<italic>x</italic>(<italic>V olatile</italic>− <italic>stable</italic>)</sub> <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> = 0.28, 95% HDI = [0.01, 0.58]; <xref rid="figS34" ref-type="fig">Fig. S34b</xref>). While this finding suggests a tendency toward greater learning from positive outcomes in individuals with higher depression-related symptoms, it should be interpreted with caution, given the marginal nature of the effect and the lack of replication across other tasks.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the inverse temperature parameter and its relationship with internalizing, anxiety, and depression (<xref rid="figS35" ref-type="fig">Fig. S35</xref>). Across participants, we found a significant decrease in inverse temperature in the volatile phase compared to the stable phase, indicating that participants made more stochastic choices in the volatile phase (<italic>B</italic><sub><italic>V olatile</italic> −<italic>stable</italic></sub> <italic>µ</italic><sub>0</sub> = -6.39, 95% HDI = [-12.81, -1.09]). However, we did not observe a significant effect of outcome valence (good vs. bad), task domain (reward vs. loss), or any of the interactions on overall inverse temperature (<italic>B</italic><sub><italic>Good</italic>−<italic>bad</italic></sub> <italic>µ</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1.63, 95% HDI = [-2.59, 6.16], <italic>B</italic><sub>(<italic>Good</italic>− <italic>bad</italic>)<italic>x</italic>(<italic>V olatile</italic> −<italic>stable</italic>)</sub> <italic>µ</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.69, 95% HDI = [-3.04, 6.42], <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>Reward</italic> −<italic>loss</italic></sub>: <italic>µ</italic><sub>0</sub> = 3.05, 95% HDI = [- 3.53, 9.38], <italic>B</italic><sub>(<italic>Reward</italic>− <italic>loss</italic>)<italic>x</italic>(<italic>Good</italic> −<italic>bad</italic>)</sub> <italic>µ</italic><sub>0</sub> = -0.23, 95% HDI = [-2.97, 2.59], <italic>B</italic><sub>(<italic>Reward</italic> −<italic>loss</italic>)<italic>x</italic>(<italic>V olatile</italic>− <italic>stable</italic>)</sub> <italic>µ</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.32, 95% HDI = [-5.19, 6.89]; <xref rid="figS35" ref-type="fig">Fig. S35a</xref>). We did not find a significant effect of internalizing (general factor G, <xref rid="figS35" ref-type="fig">Fig. S35b</xref>), the anxiety-related factor F1 (<xref rid="figS35" ref-type="fig">Fig. S35c</xref>), or the depression-related factor F2 (<xref rid="figS35" ref-type="fig">Fig. S35d</xref>) on any inverse temperature component. These results broadly align with findings from the previous task version with reward magnitudes, reinforcing their robustness. Furthermore, the results remained consistent when analyzing parameters from Model 13.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>important</bold> results with regard to the ongoing debate of the relationship between internalizing psychopathology and learning under uncertainty. The methods and analyses are <bold>solid</bold>, and the results are backed by a large sample size, yet the study could still benefit from a more detailed discussion about the difference in experimental design and analysis compared to previous studies. If these concerns are addressed, this study would be of interest to researchers in clinical and computational psychiatry for the behavioral markers of psychopathological symptoms.</p>

<p>The authors conducted a series of experiments using two established decision-making tasks to clarify the relationship between internalizing psychopathology (anxiety and depression) and adaptive learning in uncertain and volatile environments. While prior literature has reported links between internalizing symptoms - particularly trait anxiety - and maladaptive increases in learning rates or impaired adjustment of learning rates, findings have been inconsistent. To address this, the authors designed a comprehensive set of eight experiments that systematically varied task conditions. They also employed a bifactor analysis approach to more precisely capture the variance associated with internalizing symptoms across anxiety and depression. Across these experiments, they found no consistent relationship between internalizing symptoms and learning rates or task performance, concluding that this purported hallmark feature may be more subtle than previously assumed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) A major strength of the paper lies in its impressive collection of eight experiments, which systematically manipulated task conditions such as outcome type, variability, volatility, and training. These were conducted both online and in laboratory settings. Given that trial conditions can drive or obscure observed effects, this careful, systematic approach enables a robust assessment of behavior. The consistency of findings across online and lab samples further strengthens the conclusions.</p>
<p>(2) The analyses are impressively thorough, combining model-agnostic measures, extensive computational modeling (e.g., Bayesian, Rescorla-Wagner, Volatile Kalman Filter), and assessments of reliability. This rigor contributes meaningfully to broader methodological discussions in computational psychiatry, particularly concerning measurement reliability.</p>
<p>(3) The study also employed two well-established, validated computational tasks: a game-based predictive inference task and a binary probabilistic reversal learning task. This choice ensures comparability with prior work and provides a valuable cross-paradigm perspective for examining learning processes.</p>
<p>(4) I also appreciate the open availability of the analysis code that will contribute substantially to the field using similar tasks.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>(1) While the overall sample size (N = 820 across eight experiments) is commendable, the number of participants per experiment is relatively modest, especially in light of the inherent variability in online testing and the typically small effect sizes in correlations with mental health traits (e.g., r = 0.1-0.2). The authors briefly acknowledge that any true effects are likely small; however, the rationale behind the sample sizes selected for each experiment is unclear. This is especially important given that previous studies using the predictive inference task (e.g., Seow &amp; Gillan, 2020, N &gt; 400; Loosen et al., 2024, N &gt; 200) have reported non-significant associations between trait anxiety symptoms and learning rates.</p>
<p>(2) The motivation for focusing on the predictive inference task is also somewhat puzzling, given that no cited study has reported associations between trait anxiety and parameters of this task. While this is mitigated by the inclusion of a probabilistic reversal learning task, which has a stronger track record in detecting such effects, the study misses an opportunity to examine whether individual differences in learning-related measures correlate across the two tasks, which could clarify whether they tap into shared constructs.</p>
<p>(3) The parameterization of the tasks, particularly the use of high standard deviations (SDs) of 20 and 30 for outcome distributions and hazard rates of 0.1 and 0.16, warrants further justification. Are these hazard rates sufficiently distinct? Might the wide SDs reduce sensitivity to volatility changes? Prior studies of the circle version of this predictive inference task (e.g., Vaghi et al., 2019; Seow &amp; Gillan, 2020; Marzuki et al., 2022; Loosen et al., 2024; Hoven et al., 2024) typically used SDs around 12. Indeed, the Supplementary Materials suggest that variability manipulations did not seem to substantially affect learning rates (Figure S5)-calling into question whether the task manipulations achieved their intended cognitive effects.</p>
<p>(4) Relatedly, while the predictive inference task showed good reliability, the reversal learning task exhibited only &quot;poor-to-moderate&quot; reliability in its learning-rate estimates. Given that previous findings linking anxiety to learning rates have often relied on this task, these reliability issues raise concerns about the robustness and generalizability of conclusions drawn from it.</p>
<p>(5) As the authors note, the study relies on a subclinical sample. This limits the generalizability of the findings to individuals with diagnosed disorders. A growing body of research suggests that relationships between cognition and symptomatology can differ meaningfully between general population samples and clinical groups. For example, Hoven et al. (2024) found differing results in the predictive inference task when comparing OCD patients, healthy controls, and high- vs. low-symptom subgroups.</p>
<p>(6) Finally, the operationalization of internalizing symptoms in this study appears to focus on anxiety and depression. However, obsessive-compulsive disorder is also generally considered an internalizing disorder, which presents a gap in the current cited literature of the paper, particularly when there have been numerous studies with the predictive inference task and OCD/compulsivity (e.g., Vaghi et al., 2019; Seow &amp; Gillan, 2020; Marzuki et al., 2022; Loosen et al., 2024; Hoven et al., 2024), rather than trait anxiety per se.</p>
<p>Overall:</p>
<p>Despite the named limitations, the authors have done very impressive work in rigorously examining the relationship between anxiety/internalizing symptoms and learning rates in commonly used decision-making tasks under uncertainty. Their conclusion is well supported by the consistency of their null findings across diverse task conditions, though its generalizability may be limited by some features of the task design and its sample. This study provides strong evidence that will guide future research, whether by shifting the focus of examining dysfunctions of larger effect sizes or by extending investigations to clinical populations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, the authors recruited a large sample of participants to complete two well-established paradigms: the predictive inference task and the volatile reversal learning task. With this dataset, they not only replicated several classical findings on uncertainty-based learning from previous research but also demonstrated that individual differences in learning behavior are not systematically associated with internalizing psychopathology. These results provide valuable large-scale evidence for this line of research.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Use of two different tasks.</p>
<p>(2) Recruitment of a large sample of participants.</p>
<p>(3) Inclusion of multiple experiments with different conditions, demonstrating strong scientific rigor.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Below are questions rather than 'weaknesses':</p>
<p>(1) This study uses a large human sample, which is a clear strength. However, was the study preregistered? It would also be useful to report a power analysis to justify the sample size.</p>
<p>(2) Previous studies have tested two core hypotheses: (a) that internalizing psychopathology is associated with overall higher learning rates, and (b) that it is associated with learning rate adaptation. In the first experiment, the findings seem to disconfirm only the first hypothesis. I found it unclear how, in the predator task, participants were expected to adjust their learning rate to adapt to volatility. Could the authors clarify this point?</p>
<p>(3) According to the Supplementary Information, Model 13 showed the best fit, yet the authors selected Model 12 due to the larger parameter variance in Model 13. What would the results of Model 13 look like? Furthermore, do Models 12 and 13 correspond to the optimal models identified by Gagne et al. (2020)? Please clarify.</p>
<p>(4) In the Discussion, the authors addressed both task reliability and parameter reliability. However, the term reliability seems to be used differently in these two contexts. For example, good parameter recovery indicates strong reliability in one sense, but can we then directly equate this with parameter reliability? It would be helpful to define more precisely what is meant by reliability in each case.</p>
<p>(5) The Discussion also raises the possibility that limited reliability may represent a broader challenge facing the interdisciplinary field of computational psychiatry. What, in the authors' view, are the key future directions for the field to mitigate this issue?</p>
