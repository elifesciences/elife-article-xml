<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common and progressive spinal deformity in children that exhibits striking sexual dimorphism, with girls at more than five-fold greater risk of severe disease compared to boys. Despite its medical impact, the molecular mechanisms that drive AIS are largely unknown. We previously defined a female-specific AIS genetic risk locus in an enhancer near the <italic>PAX1</italic> gene. Here we sought to define the roles of <italic>PAX1</italic> and newly-identified AIS-associated genes in the developmental mechanism of AIS. In a genetic study of 10,519 individuals with AIS and 93,238 unaffected controls, significant association was identified with a variant in <italic>COL11A1</italic> encoding collagen (α1) XI (rs3753841; NM_080629.2_c.4004C&gt;T; p.(Pro1335Leu); P=7.07e<sup>-11</sup>, OR=1.118). Using CRISPR mutagenesis we generated <italic>Pax1</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Pax1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>). In postnatal spines we found that PAX1 and collagen (α1) XI protein both localize within the intervertebral disc (IVD)-vertebral junction region encompassing the growth plate, with less collagen (α1) XI detected in <italic>Pax1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> spines compared to wildtype. By genetic targeting we found that wildtype <italic>Col11a1</italic> expression in costal chondrocytes suppresses expression of <italic>Pax1</italic> and of <italic>Mmp3</italic>, encoding the matrix metalloproteinase 3 enzyme implicated in matrix remodeling. However, this suppression was abrogated in the presence of the AIS-associated <italic>COL11A1</italic><sup>P1335L</sup> mutant. Further, we found that either knockdown of the estrogen receptor gene <italic>Esr2</italic>, or tamoxifen treatment, significantly altered <italic>Col11a1</italic> and <italic>Mmp3</italic> expression in chondrocytes. We propose a new molecular model of AIS pathogenesis wherein genetic variation and estrogen signaling increase disease susceptibility by altering a <italic>Pax1</italic>-<italic>Col11a1</italic>-<italic>Mmp3</italic> signaling axis in spinal chondrocytes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human spinal column is a dynamic, segmented, bony and cartilaginous structure that is essential for integrating the brain and nervous system with the axial skeleton while simultaneously providing flexibility in three dimensions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common developmental disorder of the spine, typically appearing during the adolescent growth spurt. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is reported in all major ancestral groups, with a population prevalence of 1.5-3%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Children with AIS usually present with a characteristic right-thoracic major curve pattern and a compensatory lumbar curve. Major thoracolumbar and lumbar curves are less frequent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The three-dimensional nature of the deformity results in torsion in the spine that is most significant at the apex of the major curve, and changes in the structures of the vertebrae and ribs may develop as the curve worsens or progresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Children with thoracic curves, with larger curves at first presentation, and/or with greater remaining growth potential are at increased risk of progression, but this risk decreases sharply after skeletal maturity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Sex is a recognized risk factor for AIS, with girls having at least a five-fold greater risk of progressive deformity requiring treatment compared to boys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. This well-documented sexual dimorphism has prompted speculation that levels of circulating endocrine hormones, particularly estrogen, are important exposures in AIS susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The genetic architecture of human AIS is complex, and underlying disease mechanisms remain uncertain. Heritability studies of Northern European<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, North American<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, and South Asian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> ancestral groups suggest that disease risk is multifactorial, caused by genetic and environmental contributions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Accordingly, population-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in multiple ancestral groups have identified several AIS-associated susceptibility loci, mostly within non-coding genomic regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In particular, multiple GWAS have implicated noncoding regions near the <italic>LBX1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, <italic>ADGRG6</italic> (also known as <italic>GRP126</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, and <italic>BNC2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> genes. An association with alleles in an enhancer distal to <italic>PAX1</italic>, encoding the transcription factor paired box 1, was primarily driven by females, suggesting that it contributes to the sexual dimorphism observed in AIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Subsequent meta-analysis of combined AIS GWAS identified additional susceptibility loci. These included variants in an intron of <italic>SOX6</italic>, a transcription factor, that along with <italic>PAX1</italic>, is important in early spinal column formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, gene enrichment analyses found significant correlation of AIS-associated loci with biological pathways involving cartilage and connective tissue development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. A more recent GWAS in a Japanese population identified fourteen additional AIS loci that are candidates for further evaluation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In separate studies, genome sequencing in AIS cases and families identified enrichment of rare variants in the <italic>COL11A2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and <italic>HSPG2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> genes, encoding components of the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). Hence variation affecting cartilage and connective tissue ECM is an emerging theme in the heterogeneous genetic architecture of AIS.</p>
<p>Pre-clinical animal models are essential tools for accelerating mechanistic understanding of AIS and for therapeutic testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In zebrafish, several genetic mutants with larval or later-onset spinal deformity have been described, including <italic>ptk7</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, <italic>c21orf59</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, <italic>ccdc40</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, <italic>ccdc151</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, <italic>dyx1c1</italic>, and <italic>kif6</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In rescue experiments, Rebello et al. recently showed that missense mutations in <italic>COL11A2</italic> associated with human congenital scoliosis fail to rescue a vertebral malformation phenotype in a zebrafish <italic>col11a2</italic> knockout line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In mouse, conditional deletion of <italic>Adgrg6</italic> in skeletal cartilage (using <italic>Col2a1</italic>-Cre) produces a progressive scoliosis of the thoracic spine during postnatal development that is marked by herniations within the cartilaginous endplates of involved vertebrae. Progressive scoliosis, albeit to a lesser extent, was also observed when <italic>Adgrg6</italic> was deleted from committed chondrocytes (using ATC-Cre)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. These studies demonstrate that cartilage and possibly other osteochondroprogenitor cells contribute to the scoliosis phenotype in these models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Taken together, genetic and functional studies in mouse, although limited, support the hypothesis that deficiencies in biogenesis and/or homeostasis of cartilage, intervertebral disc (IVD), and dense connective tissues undermine the maintenance of proper spinal alignment during the adolescent growth spurt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The combined contribution of reported AIS-associated variants is broadly estimated to account for less than 10% of the overall genetic risk of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. To address this knowledge gap, we sought to define novel loci associated with AIS susceptibility in genes encoding proteins of the ECM (i.e. the “matrisome”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>). Here we identify new genetic associations with AIS. Further, our functional assessments support a new disease model wherein AIS-associated genetic variation and estrogen signaling perturb a <italic>Pax1-Col11a1-Mmp3</italic> axis in chondrocytes.</p>

<title>Nonsynonymous variants in matrisome genes are associated with increased risk of AIS</title>
<p>The “matrisome” has been defined as “all genes encoding structural ECM components and those encoding proteins that may interact with or remodel the ECM”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Proteins comprising the global ECM as currently defined have been identified by both experimental and bio-informatic methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We assembled 1027 matrisome genes as previously identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, including 274 core-matrisome and 753 matrisome-associated genes (N=1,027 total). For the genes encoding these 1,027 proteins, we identified all nonsynonymous common variants (MAF &gt; 0.01) queried by the Illumina HumanCoreExome-24v1.0 beadchip and determined their genotypes in a discovery cohort of 1,358 cases and 12,507 controls, each of European ancestry (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). After applying multiple quality control measures (see Methods section), we retained 2,008 variants in 597 matrisome genes for association testing (<bold>Supplemental Table 1).</bold> This sample size was estimated to provide at least 80% power to detect significant associations at the matrisome-wide level (α≤2.5e-05), for alleles with population frequency ≥.05 and OR ≥1.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 1a</bold>). Two nonsynonymous variants, in <italic>COL11A1</italic> (rs3753841; NM_080629_c.4004C&gt;T; p.(Pro1335Leu); odds ratio (OR)=1.236 [95% CI=1.134-1.347], P=1.17E<sup>-06</sup>) and <italic>MMP14</italic> (rs1042704; NM_004995_c.817G&gt;A; p.(Asp273Asn); OR=1.239 [95% CI=1.125-1.363], P=1.89E<sup>-05</sup>) were significantly associated with AIS (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref></bold>). Given the sexual dimorphism in AIS and our prior observation of a female-predominant disease locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, we tested the 2,008 variants separately in females (N=1,157 cases and 7,138 controls). In females, the association with rs3753841 remained statistically significant, whereas rs1042704, near <italic>MMP14</italic>, was not associated with AIS in females (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 1b</bold>).

<p>To validate these results, we sought to replicate the associations of rs3753841 and rs1042704 in four independent AIS case-control cohorts, from North America, Europe, and eastern Asia, representing multiple ethnicities (total N = 9,161 AIS cases, 80,731 healthy controls, <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Genotypes for both variants were extracted from these datasets and tested for association by meta-analysis together with the discovery cohort (see Methods). Meta-analysis of all cohorts together increased the evidence for association of both variants with AIS risk (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold>). While a similar effect size was noted for rs1042704 in Japanese and Han Chinese cohorts, the results were less significant, likely due to lower minor allele frequencies (East Asian MAF = 0.02 compared to total non-Asian cohort MAF = 0.20) in these populations (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 1c</bold>). Plotting recombination across both regions suggested that these signals were likely confined to blocks of linkage disequilibrium within the <italic>COL11A1</italic> and <italic>MMP14</italic> genes, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 1d, e</bold>).</p>
<p>Rare dominant mutations in <italic>COL11A1,</italic> often disrupting a Gly-X-Y sequence, can cause Marshall (MRSHS) (OMIM# 154780) or Stickler syndromes (STL2) (OMIM# 604841) marked variously by facial anomalies, sensineural hearing loss, short stature, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, eye anomalies, ectodermal features, and scoliosis. Notably, our AIS cohort and particularly individuals carrying the rs3753841 risk allele were negative for co-morbidities or obvious features of Marshall or Stickler syndromes. Thus, variation in <italic>COL11A1</italic> is independently associated with AIS. Analysis of 625 exomes from the discovery cohort (46%) did not reveal a significant burden of rare <italic>COL11A1</italic> variants, nor common variants in linkage disequilibrium (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.6) with the top SNP rs3753841. These observations suggested that rs3753841 itself could be causal, although our methods would not detect deep intronic variants that could contribute to the overall association signal.</p>

<p>We next sought to characterize <italic>Col11a1</italic> expression in spines of postnatal mice. To detect COL11A1 protein (collagen α1(XI)), we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy using a collagen α1(XI) reactive antibody<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> in newborn (P0.5) and adolescent (P28) mice. In spines of P0.5 mice, strong staining was observed in the nucleus pulposus (NP) and in surrounding annulus fibrosus (AF) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref></bold>). In thoracic spines of P28 mice, the compartments of the IVD were more distinct, and strong collagen α1(XI) staining was observed in each (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref></bold>). In regions of the cartilage endplate (CEP)-vertebral bone transition, collagen α1(XI) was detected in columnar chondrocytes, particularly in the hypertrophic zone adjacent to condensing bone (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref></bold>). We also examined collagen α1(XI) expression in ribs, as these structures are also involved in the scoliotic deformity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In P28 rib growth plates, as in spine, a biphasic pattern was observed in which collagen α1(XI) reactivity was most pronounced around cells of the presumed resting and pre-hypertrophic/hypertrophic zones (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> – figure supplement a,b</bold>).

Simultaneous knockdown of <italic>Col11a1</italic> and <italic>Esr2</italic> expression reduced <italic>Mmp3</italic> expression to normal levels, supporting a possible interaction between <italic>Col11a1</italic> and <italic>Esr2</italic> in regulating <italic>Mmp3</italic>.

These results suggest that estrogen signaling suppresses <italic>Col11a1</italic> expression.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis has been described in the medical literature for centuries, yet its underlying etiology has remained enigmatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Given that AIS originates in children who appear to be otherwise healthy, even its tissue of origin has been difficult to discern, and long debated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The advent of powerful genotyping and sequencing methods in the last two decades has led to breakthrough discoveries of genetic loci associated with AIS, most in non-coding regions of the genome that are difficult to interpret biologically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Aggregating these results, however, provided supportive evidence that pathways of cartilage and connective tissue ECM development are relevant in AIS etiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Here, in the largest multi-ethnic human cohort studied to date, we elected to test the hypothesis that alterations in ECM proteins themselves contribute to AIS susceptibility. This approach yielded most significant evidence for a common protein-altering variant in the <italic>COL11A1</italic> gene encoding collagen α1(XI), a minor yet critical component of cartilaginous ECM. Moreover, our studies define a <italic>COL11A1</italic>-mediated disease pathway (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold>) and point to the chondro-osseous junction of IVD and vertebrae spine as a relevant cellular compartment in AIS etiology.</p>

<p>The results of this study together with the previous observation of <italic>COL11A2</italic> rare variant enrichment in AIS supports a role for the collagen α1(XI) heterotrimer itself in its pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Collagen type XI, composed of three chains encoded by the <italic>COL11A1</italic>, <italic>COL11A2</italic>, and <italic>COL2A1</italic> genes (OMIM #s 120280,120290, 120140, respectively), is a minor component of collagen type II fibrils that are abundant in cartilage. Collagen type XI is also broadly expressed in testis, trachea, tendons, trabecular bone, skeletal muscle, placenta, lung, brain neuroepithelium, the vitreous of the eye, and intervertebral discs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. In the pericellular space, collagen α1(XI) initiates fibrillogenesis with collagen type II fibrils, maintaining regular spacing and diameter of the collagen fibrils, while organizing the pericellular surface by interaction with cartilage proteoglycans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Purified human collagen type XI, when added back to chondrocytes in <italic>in vitro</italic> culture, stimulates chondrogenesis while inhibiting hypertrophy, as measured by histologic staining, proliferation assays, and relative expression of chondrogenic early marker genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. In newborn and one-month old mice, we found that collagen α1(XI) was abundant in IVD and at the chondro-osseous junction of IVD and vertebrae, particularly concentrated in pre-hypertrophic/hypertrophic chondrocytic cells. In long bone growth plates, Long et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> recently identified eight distinct cell clusters after unsupervised analysis of single cell (scRNAseq) of flow-sorted hypertrophic chondrocytes from Col10a1Cre;Rosa26fs-tdTomato mice. At embryonic stage 16.5 (E16.5), <italic>Col11a1</italic> expression was highest in cells with signatures of pre-hypertrophic to hypertrophic transition, and lowest in cells with osteogenic signatures (M. Hilton, personal communication)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Taken together, these results suggest that collagen α1(XI) normally participates in maintaining growth plate cells in a hypertrophic, pre-osteogenic state, although little is known about its precise molecular function in that compartment, or in the IVD, during spinal development. Spines of <italic>Col11a1</italic>-deficient mice (<italic>cho/cho</italic>) show incompletely formed vertebral bodies, spinal curvatures, and decreased separation between vertebrae, which are themselves less mineralized than in wildtype mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Notably, common <italic>COL11A1</italic> variants also have been associated with adult lumbar disc herniation (LDH) and degeneration (LDD), as well as DXA-measured bone size, spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>Pax1</italic> is a well-described marker of early spine development, where it activates a gene expression cascade starting at E12.5-13.5 in mouse development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Our data showed that loss of <italic>Pax1</italic> leads to decreased expression of <italic>Col11a1</italic>, <italic>Sox6,</italic> and <italic>Adgrg6</italic> in E12.5 tails of both male and female mice. The downregulation of <italic>Col11a1</italic> is consistent with a prior study of gene expression in flow-sorted GFP-labeled <italic>Pax1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryonic IVD cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. However, from these experiments we cannot discern if <italic>Pax1</italic> directly regulates <italic>Col11a1</italic> in <italic>cis</italic>, or by an indirect effect. It is likely, however, that <italic>Col11a1</italic> expression in developing tail is directly activated by binding SOX transcription factors, as a prior genomic study using chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) in rat chondrosarcoma cells identified super enhancers near the <italic>Col11a1</italic> gene that were bound multiple times by SOX9 and SOX6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. The SOX5/6/9 trio is known to regulate many of the same genes as PAX1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, but whether this includes <italic>Col11a1</italic> is unknown.</p>
<p>In mouse postnatal spines, we observed co-localization of collagen α1(XI) and PAX1 proteins specifically within the cartilaginous endplate-vertebral junction region that includes the vertebral growth plate. The endplate, which is important as the site allowing diffusion of nutrients from the circulation into the avascular inner IVD, harbors subpopulations of cells expressing type II collagen presumably organized by collagen type XI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. While the endplate is continuous with the vertebral growth plate in mice, it is important to note that in humans the endplate and vertebrae become distinctly separate structures with closure of the growth plates at puberty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. This is also the site of the ring apophyses that form the insertion of the IVD into vertebrae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Lagging maturity of the ring apophysis, combined with mechanical forces across the IVD in the horizontal plane, has been proposed as an initiating factor leading to rotatory decompensation in the adolescent spine in AIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Recently, Sun et al. reported the discovery of a vertebral skeletal stem cell (vSSC) residing in the endplate and marked by expression of the genes <italic>Zic1</italic> and <italic>Pax1,</italic> along with other cell surface markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. These vSSCs also express high levels of <italic>Col11a1</italic> (M. Greenblatt, personal communication). It is interesting to consider that AIS-associated variation in collagen α1(XI), perhaps together with mechanical forces, could alter the differentiation trajectory of this cell niche. Altogether, extant data and our results strongly suggest that cell populations at the IVD-vertebral junction region are relevant in AIS pathogenesis. Further investigation is warranted to understand the developmental programmes of cells in this region of the spine.</p>
<p>Matrix metalloproteinase 3, also known as stromolysin, is a secreted enzyme expressed in connective tissues and in regions of endochondral ossification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. MMP3 has degradative activity toward a variety of ECM components, including proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminin, but notably not type I collagen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Additionally, in chondrocytes MMP3 also has been shown to translocate to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of connective tissue growth factor (<italic>CTGF/CCN2</italic>) by binding to an element known as transcription <underline>e</underline>nhancer <underline>d</underline>ominant in <underline>c</underline>hondrocytes (TRENDIC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our observations of a <italic>Col11a1-Mmp3</italic> signaling axis in chondrocytes and CEP cells raise the possibility that <italic>Col11a1</italic> variation may have consequences for both MMP3 enzymatic activity levels and for <italic>MMP3</italic>-mediated transcriptional programming in these cells. <italic>COL11A1</italic> missense variants, usually altering glycine or proline in Gly-X-Y repeats in the collagen α1(XI) helical domain as with <italic>COL11A1<sup>P</sup></italic><sup>1335</sup><italic><sup>L</sup></italic>, are reported to be frequent in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and have been linked to transcriptional changes and tumor invasiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. The mechanisms by which chondrocytes or other cells sense such single amino acid changes in collagen α1(XI) and induce subsequent transcriptional responses are unknown but may involve direct interaction with integrins in the pericellular space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We found that <italic>Col11a1</italic> expression is sensitive to estrogen receptor blockade or knockdown in chondrocytes. Type XI collagen is also a key player in organizing the pericellular space, which is critical for transmitting mechanical forces from the ECM to the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Thus, it is interesting to consider that type XI collagen may effectively act as a receptor for environmental cues, i.e., mechanical forces and estrogen signaling, in the adolescent spine. Our study provides new insights into the regulation and signaling role of <italic>Col11a1</italic> in chondrocytes, and suggests potential mechanisms by which its genetic variation contributes to AIS susceptibility.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study analyzes a large cohort of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) patients, identifying an association with a variant in COL11A1 (Pro1335Leu). Experimental testing of this potentially pathogenic variant in vitro suggests a connection between Pax1, Col11a1, Mmp3, and estrogen signaling, thus providing <bold>solid</bold> support for the proposed link between hormonal and matrix components in the development of AIS.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This revised study follows up on previous work showing a female-specific enhancer region of PAX1 is associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). This new analysis combines human GWAS analysis from multiple countries to identify a new AIS-associated coding variant in the COL11A1 gene (COL11A1P1335L). Using a Pax1 knockout mouse they go on to find that PAX1 and Collagen XI protein are expressed in the intervertebral discs (IVDs) and robustly in the growth plate, showing that COL11A1 expression is reduced in Pax1 mutant growth plate. Moreover, other AIS-associated genes, Gpr126 and Sox6, were also reduced in Pax1 mutant mice, suggesting a common pathway is involved in AIS.</p>
<p>Using SV40 immortalized costal cartilage cells, derived from floxed Col11a1 mice primary rib cage cartilage, they go to show that removal of Col11a1 leads to reduction of Mmp3 expression. In this context, the expression of wild-type Col11a1 restored regular levels of Mmp3 expression, while expression of the AIS-associated Col11a1P1335L allele failed to restore normal Mmp3 expression. This supports a model that the AIS-associated Col11a1P1335L allele leads to the dysregulation of ECM in vivo.</p>
<p>Using this culture system, they go on to test the role of the estrogen receptor ESR2, showing that loss of this receptor leads to reduced Mmp3 and Pax1 expression, and increased Col11a1 expression. They support this by showing similar gene expression changes and estrogen receptor function in Rat cartilage endplate cell culture.</p>
<p>Altogether, this study nicely brings together an impressive number of human genetic data from multi-ethnic AIS cohorts and controls from across the globe and functionally tests these findings in cell culture and animal models. This study wonderfully integrates other findings from other human and mouse work in AIS and supports a new molecular mechanism by which estrogen can interact and synergize with COL11A1/PAX1/MMP3 signaling to change ECM development and dynamics, thus providing a tangible model for mutations and dysregulation of this pathway can increase the susceptibility of scoliosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work integrates a large cohort of human genetic data from AIS patient and control from diverse ethnic backgrounds, across the globe. This work attempts to functionally test their findings in vivio and by use of cell culture.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Many of the main functional work was done in cell culture and not in vivo.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Yu and colleagues sought to identify new susceptibility genes for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Significance for this work is high, especially given the still large knowledge gap of the mechanistic underpinnings for AIS. In this multidisciplinary body of work, the authors first performed a genetic association study of AIS case-control cohorts (combined 9,161 cases and 80,731 controls) which leveraged common SNPs in 1027 previously defined matrisome genes. Two nonsynonymous variants were found to be significantly associated with AIS: MMP14 p.Asp273Asn and COL11A1 p.Pro1153Leu, the latter of which had the more robust association and remained significant when females were tested independent of males. Next, the authors followed a series of functional validation experiments to support biological involvement of COL11A1 p.Pro1153Leu in AIS through expression, biochemical, and histological studies in physiologically relevant cell and mouse models. Together, the authors propose a hitherto unreported model for AIS that involves the interplay of the COL11A1 susceptibility locus with estrogen signaling to alter a Pax1-Col11a1-Mmp3 signaling axis at the growth plate.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is clearly written and follows a series of logical steps toward connecting multiple matrisome genes and putative AIS effectors in a new framework of pathomechanism. The multidisciplinary nature of the work makes it a strong body of work wherein multiple models offer multiple lines of supportive data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This manuscript remains an important multidisciplinary study of the genetic and functional basis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). To the benefit of the overall manuscript quality, the reviewers have addressed most concerns to satisfaction. I have a few remaining suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Regarding the genetic association of the common COL11A1 variant rs3753841, p.Pro1335Leu, please soften this statement to indicate that the variant could be a &quot;risk locus&quot; rather than &quot;causal&quot; in the following sentence on page 7-8: &quot;These observations suggested that rs3753841 itself could be causal, although our methods would not detect deep intronic variants that could contribute to the overall association signal.&quot;</p>
<p>2. Include the list of three rare missense variants mentioned in the response to reviewers as a supplementary table. Please also include methods for the SKATO rare variant burden analysis.</p>
<p>3. Thank you for addressing the question of whether p.Pro1335Leu is a loss of function, gain of function, or dominant negative variant. The rationale in the response to reviewers was helpful, so please include this line of reasoning, and that there remains uncertainty, in the Discussion of the main text of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This article demonstrates a Pax1-Col11a1-Mmp3 signaling axis associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and finds that estrogen affects this signaling axis. In addition, the authors have identified a new COL11A1 mutation and verified its effect on the Pax1-Col11a1-Mmp3 axis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. Col11a1P1335L is verified in multicenter cohorts with high confidence.</p>
<p>2. The article identified a potential pathogenesis of AIS.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The SV40-immortalized cell line established from Col11a1fl/fl mouse rib cartilage was applied in the study, and overexpression system was used to confirm that P1335L variant in COL11A1 perturbs its regulation of MMP3. However, due to the absence of P1335L point mutant mice, it cannot be confirmed whether P1335L can actually cause AIS, and the pathogenicity of this mutation cannot be directly verified.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewers for truly valuable advice and comments. We have made multiple corrections and revisions to the original pre-print accordingly per the following comments:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Pro1153Leu is extremely common in the general population (allele frequency in gnomAD is 0.5). Further discussion is warranted to justify the possibility that this variant contributes to a phenotype documented in 1.5-3% of the population. Is it possible that this variant is tagging other rare SNPs in the COL11A1 locus, and could any of the existing exome sequencing data be mined for rare nonsynonymous variants?</p>
<p>One possible avenue for future work is to return to any existing exome sequencing data to query for rare variants at the COL11A1 locus. This should be possible for the USA MO case-control cohort. Any rare nonsynonymous variants identified should then be subjected to mutational burden testing, ideally after functional testing to diminish any noise introduced by rare benign variants in both cases and controls. If there is a significant association of rare variation in AIS cases, then they should consider returning to the other cohorts for targeted COL11A1 gene sequencing or whole exome sequencing (whichever approach is easier/less expensive) to demonstrate replication of the association.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Regarding the genetic association of the common COL11A1 variant rs3753841 (p.(Pro1335Leu)), we do not propose that it is the sole risk variant contributing to the association signal we detected and have clarified this in the manuscript. We concluded that it was worthy of functional testing for reasons described here. Although there were several common variants in the discovery GWAS within and around COL11A1, none were significantly associated with AIS and none were in linkage disequilibrium (R2&gt;0.6) with the top SNP rs3753841. We next reviewed rare (MAF&lt;=0.01) coding variants within the COL11A1 LD region of the associated SNP (rs3753841) in 625 available exomes representing 46% of the 1,358 cases from the discovery cohort. The LD block was defined using Haploview based on the 1KG_CEU population. Within the ~41 KB LD region (chr1:103365089- 103406616, GRCh37) we found three rare missense mutations in 6 unrelated individuals, Table below. Two of them (NM_080629.2:c.G4093A:p.A1365T; NM_080629.2:c.G3394A:p.G1132S), from two individuals, are predicted to be deleterious based on CADD and GERP scores and are plausible AIS risk candidates. At this rate we could expect to find only 4-5 individuals with linked rare coding variants in the total cohort of 1,358 which collectively are unlikely to explain the overall association signal we detected. Of course, there also could be deep intronic variants contributing to the association that we would not detect by our methods. However, given this scenario, the relatively high predicted deleteriousness of rs3753841 (CADD= 25.7; GERP=5.75), and its occurrence in a GlyX-Y triplet repeat, we hypothesized that this variant itself could be a risk allele worthy of further investigation.</p>

<label>Author response table 1.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-89762-sa4-table1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>We also appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to perform a rare variant burden analysis of COL11A1. We did conduct pilot gene-based analysis in 4534 European ancestry exomes including 797 of our own AIS cases and 3737 controls and tested the burden of rare variants in COL11A1.  SKATO P value was not significant (COL11A1_P=0.18), but this could due to lack of power and/or background from rare benign variants that could be screened out using the functional testing we have developed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. COL11A1 p.Pro1335Leu is pursued as a direct candidate susceptibility locus, but the functional validation involves both: (a) a complementation assay in mouse GPCs, Figure 5; and (b) cultured rib cartilage cells from Col11a1-Ad5 Cre mice (Figure 4). Please address the     following:</p>
<p>2A. Is Pro1335Leu a loss of function, gain of function, or dominant negative variant? Further rationale for modeling this change in a Col11a1 loss of function cell line would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Regarding functional testing, by knockdown/knockout cell culture experiments, we showed for the first time that Col11a1 negatively regulates Mmp3 expression in cartilage chondrocytes, an AIS-relevant tissue. We then tested the effect of overexpressing the human wt or variant COL11A1 by lentiviral transduction in SV40-transformed chondrocyte cultures.  We deleted endogenous mouse Col11a1 by Cre recombination to remove the background of its strong suppressive effects on Mmp3 expression. We acknowledge that Col11a1 missense mutations could confer gain of function or dominant negative effects that would not be revealed in this assay. However as indicated in our original manuscript we have noted that spinal deformity is described in the cho/cho mouse, a Col11a1 loss of function mutant. We also note the recent publication by Rebello et al. showing that missense mutations in Col11a2 associated with congenital scoliosis fail to rescue a vertebral malformation phenotype in a zebrafish col11a2 KO line. Although the connection between AIS and vertebral malformations is not altogether clear, we surmise that loss of the components of collagen type XI disrupt spinal development.  in vivo experiments in vertebrate model systems are needed to fully establish the consequences and genetic mechanisms by which COL11A1 variants contribute to an AIS phenotype.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>2B. Expression appears to be augmented compared WT in Fig 5B, but there is no direct comparison of WT with variant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Expression of the mutant (from the lentiviral expression vector) is increased compared to mutant. We observed this effect in repeated experiments. Sequencing confirmed that the mutant and wildtype constructs differed only at the position of the rs3753841 SNP. At this time, we cannot explain the difference in expression levels. Nonetheless, even when the variant COL11A1 is relatively overexpressed it fails to suppress MMP3 expression as observed for the wildtype form.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>2C. How do the authors know that their complementation data in Figure 5 are specific?
Repetition of this experiment with an alternative common nonsynonymous variant in COL11A1 (such as rs1676486) would be helpful as a comparison with the expectation that it would be similar to WT.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree that testing an allelic series throughout COL11A1 could be informative, but we have shifted our resources toward in vivo experiments that we believe will ultimately be more informative for deciphering the mechanistic role of COL11A1 in MMP3 regulation and spine deformity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>2D. The y-axes of histograms in panel A need attention and clarification. What is meant by power? Do you mean fold change?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Power is directly comparable to fold change but allows comparison of absolute expression levels between different genes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>2E. Figure 5: how many technical and biological replicates? Confirm that these are stated throughout the figures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you for pointing out this oversight. This information has been added throughout.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 2: What does the gross anatomy of the IVD look like? Could the authors address this by showing an H&amp;E of an adjacent section of the Fig. 2 A panels?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Panel 2 shows H&amp;E staining. Perhaps the reviewer is referring to the WT and Pax1 KO images in Figure 3? We have now added H&amp;E staining of WT and Pax1 KO IVD as supplemental Figure 3E to clarify the IVD anatomy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Page 9: &quot;Cells within the IVD were negative for Pax1 staining ...&quot; There seems to be specific PAX1 expression in many cells within the IVD, which is concerning if this is indeed a supposed null allele of Pax1. This data seems to support that the allele is not null.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We have now added updated images for the COL11A1 and PAX1 staining to include negative controls in which we omitted primary antibodies. As can be seen, there is faint autofluorescence in the PAX1 negative control that appears to explain the “specific staining” referred to by the reviewer. These images confirm that the allele is truly a null.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. There is currently a lack of evidence supporting the claim that &quot;Col11a1 is positively regulated by Pax1 in mouse spine and tail&quot;. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further research to determine the direct regulatory role of Pax1 on Col11a1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree with the reviewer and have clarified that Pax1 may have either a direct or indirect role in Col11a1 regulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. There is no data linking loss of COL11A1 function and spine defects in the mouse model. Furthermore, due to the absence of P1335L point mutant mice, it cannot be confirmed whether P1335L can actually cause AIS, and the pathogenicity of this mutation cannot be directly verified. These limitations need to be clearly stated and discussed. A Col11a1 mouse mutant called chondroysplasia (cho), was shown to be perinatal lethal with severe endochondral defects (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4100752/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4100752/</ext-link>). This information may help contextualize this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We partially agree with the reviewer. Spine defects are reported in the cho mouse (for example, please see reference 36 Hafez et al). We appreciate the suggestion to cite the original Seegmiller et al 1971 reference and have added it to the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. A recent article (PMID37462524) reported mutations in COL11A2 associated with AIS and functionally tested in zebrafish. That study should be cited and discussed as it is directly relevant for this manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree with the reviewer that this study provides important information supporting loss of function I type XI collagen in spinal deformity. Language to this effect has been added to the manuscript and this study is now cited in the paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Please reconcile the following result on page 10 of the results: &quot;Interestingly, the AISassociated gene Adgrg6 was amongst the most significantly dysregulated genes in the RNA-seq analysis (Figure 3c). By qRT-PCR analysis, expression of Col11a1, Adgrg6, and Sox6 were significantly reduced in female and male Pax1-/- mice compared to wild-type mice (Figure 3d-g).&quot; In Figure 3f, the downregulation of Adgrg6 appears to be modest so how can it possibly be highlighted as one of the most significantly downregulated transcripts in the RNAseq data?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: By “significant” we were referring to the P-value significance in RNAseq analysis, not in absolute change in expression. This language was clearly confusing, and we have removed it from the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. It is incorrect to refer to the primary cell culture work as growth plate chondrocytes (GPCs), instead, these are primary costal chondrocyte cultures. These primary cultures have a mixture of chondrocytes at differing levels of differentiation, which may change differentiation status during the culturing on plastic. In sum, these cells are at best chondrocytes, and not specifically growth plate chondrocytes. This needs to be corrected in the abstract and throughout the manuscript. Moreover, on page 11 these cells are referred to as costal cartilage, which is confusing to the reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you for pointing out these inconsistencies. We have changed the manuscript to say “costal chondrocytes” throughout.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>On 10 of the Results: &quot;These data support a mechanistic link between Pax1 and Col11a1, and the AIS-associated genes Gpr126 and Sox6, in affected tissue of the developing tail.&quot; qRT-PCR validation of Sox6, although significant, appears to be very modestly downregulated in KO. Please soften this statement in the text.</p>

<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Have you got any information about how the immortalized (SV40) costal cartilage affected chondrogenic differentiation? The expression of SV40 seemed to stimulate Mmp13 expression.

<p>Response: The “+ or –“ in Figure 5 refers to Ad5-cre. Each experiment was performed in SV40-immortalized costal chondrocytes. We have removed SV40 from the figure and have clarified the legend to say “qRT-PCR of human COL11A1 and endogenous mouse Mmp3 in SV40 immortalized mouse costal chondrocytes transduced with the lentiviral vector only (lanes 1,2), human WT COL11A1 (lane 3), or COL11A1P1335L. Otherwise we absolutely agree that understanding Mmp13 regulation during chondrocyte differentiation is important. We plan to study this using in vivo systems.</p>
