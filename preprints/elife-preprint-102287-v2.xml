<title>Abstract</title><p>Degradation of many yeast mRNAs involves decapping by the Dcp1:Dcp2 complex. Previous studies on decapping activators Edc3 and Scd6 suggested their limited roles in mRNA decay. RNA-seq analysis of mutants lacking one or both proteins revealed that Scd6 and Edc3 have largely redundant activities in targeting numerous mRNAs for degradation that are masked in the single mutants. These transcripts are frequently targeted by decapping activators Dhh1 and Pat1, and the collective evidence suggests that Scd6/Edc3 act interchangeably to recruit Dhh1 to Dcp2. Ribosome profiling shows that redundancy between Scd6 and Edc3 and their functional interactions with Dhh1 and Pat1 extend to translational repression of particular transcripts, including a cohort of poorly translated mRNAs displaying interdependent regulation by all four factors. Scd6/Edc3 also participate with Dhh1/Pat1 in post-transcriptional repression of proteins required for respiration and catabolism of alternative carbon sources, which are normally expressed only in limiting glucose. Simultaneously eliminating Scd6/Edc3 increases mitochondrial membrane potential and elevates metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles typically observed only during growth in low glucose. Thus, Scd6/Edc3 act redundantly, in parallel with Dhh1 and in cooperation with Pat1, to adjust gene expression to nutrient availability by controlling mRNA decapping and decay.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>This preprint has been updated to include the results of new experiments providing direct biochemical validation of our proposal that Scd6 and Edc3 act redundantly to enhance association of Dhh1 with the decapping enzyme Dcp2. This advance was accomplished by demonstrating diminished coimmunoprecipitation of Dhh1 and Dcp2 in the scd6∆edc3∆ double mutant but not in either scd6∆ or edc3∆ single mutant, as now presented in new Figs. 3F and S5. We also carried out new CAGE and RNA-Seq analysis of the scd6∆edc3∆ and WT strains to determine and compare ratios of capped to total mRNAs in the two strains and thereby provide additional evidence that the mRNAs up-regulated in this double mutant are elevated by diminished decapping and degradation versus increased transcription, with the data presented in new Fig. 3C. Thus, the preprint contains six independent lines of evidence pointing to this same conclusion, presented in Figs. 3A-B, (new) Fig. 3C and (renamed) Fig. S3F, Fig. 3D, Figs. 3E, S4B, and S9B, Figs. 6F and S9C, and Fig. S10. The preprint was also modified by the appropriate revisions of text and figures necessary to address all comments and suggestions provided by reviewers of the previous version at the journal eLife.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Degradation of mRNA is a key aspect of gene expression that can be regulated in response to nutrient availability, cell stress, and developmental pathways in eukaryotic cells and further serves to eliminate defective mRNAs. A major pathway of cytoplasmic mRNA turnover involves truncating the poly(A) tail by the Ccr4/Not and Pan2/Pan3 complexes, followed by removal of the m<sup>7</sup>G cap by the Dcp1/Dcp2 decapping complex and 5’ to 3’ exonucleolytic degradation by Xrn1. The decapping complex is activated by factors that interact with low-complexity sequence motifs in the C-terminal tail (CTT) of the catalytic subunit Dcp2, including Edc3, Scd6, DEAD-box helicase Dhh1, and Pat1, which also interact with one another extensively. There is evidence that Pat1 is recruited to oligoadenylate tails remaining on mRNAs following partial deadenylation, in association with the Lsm1-Lsm7 complex, and activates decapping via interactions with other decapping activators and with the Dcp2 CTT itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Parker 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">He and Jacobson 2023</xref>)</p>
<p>Genome-wide analysis of mRNA abundance (RNA-seq) in yeast mutants lacking Dhh1, Pat1, or both factors revealed functional cooperation by Pat1 and Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">He et al. 2018</xref>), with a large fraction being up-regulated only in the <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>). The majority of mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> or <italic>pat1Δ</italic> mutations are likewise up-regulated in <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">He et al. 2018</xref>) and exhibit greater than average proportions of decapped mRNAs in WT cells but not in <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> or <italic>pat1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>), consistent with Dhh1/Pat1 targeting mRNAs for degradation via decapping. While more than half of the mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> are up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> and/or <italic>pat1Δ,</italic> a large fraction are targeted primarily by the Upf factors instead responsible for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Celik et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The cumulative contributions of Dhh1 and Pat1 to mRNA decay is consistent with their independent interactions with distinct segments of the Dcp2 CTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">He et al. 2018</xref>), which appears to be direct for Pat1 but bridged by Edc3 or Scd6 for Dhh1. There is also evidence for distinct decapping complexes containing either Dhh1 or Pat1 in addition to Xrn1, Edc3 or Scd6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al. 2022</xref>). However, Dhh1 occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Miller et al. 2018</xref>), tends to be elevated for mRNAs up-regulated by either <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> (23) or <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>), consistent with Dhh1 contributing to degradation of mRNAs targeted by Pat1. Moreover, Pat1 binding to the Dcp2 CTT was required for degradation of certain Dhh1-targeted mRNAs when Dhh1 recruitment to the CTT was compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>There is evidence that Edc3 is a common constituent of decapping complexes containing Xrn1 and one or more of the decapping activators Dhh1, Pat1, Scd6, and Upf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al. 2022</xref>). It is surprising therefore that Edc3 has been implicated in targeting only two transcripts for degradation, <italic>YRA1</italic> and <italic>RPS28B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Badis et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dong et al. 2007</xref>). Edc3 shares sequence similarity with decapping activator Scd6 and both proteins contain an FDF motif shown to interact competitively with the Dhh1 homolog in animal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tritschler et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tritschler et al. 2009</xref>). Edc3 and Scd6 also share N-terminal LSm domains that compete for binding to helical-leucine-rich (HLM) motifs in the CTT of fission yeast Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fromm et al. 2012</xref>). Analyzing effects of deleting the Edc3 interaction site in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Dcp2-CTT on levels of several Dhh1-repressed mRNAs suggested that recruitment of Dhh1 to Dcp2 can be mediated interchangeably by Edc3 or Scd6 bound to the same site in the Dcp2 CTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al. 2022</xref>). These findings, plus the fact that deleting <italic>S. cerevisiae SCD6</italic> and <italic>EDC3</italic> simultaneously confers a synthetic growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Decourty et al. 2008</xref>), suggest that yeast Scd6 and Edc3 function redundantly in targeting specific mRNAs for decapping and degradation.</p>
<p>Although tethering yeast Dhh1 or Scd6 enhances degradation of reporter mRNAs via Dcp1/Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carroll et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sweet et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zeidan et al. 2018</xref>), it is not well understood how these factors are targeted to specific native mRNAs. Dhh1 has been implicated in accelerating degradation associated with non-optimal codons in yeast mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Presnyak et al. 2015</xref>), being required for the rapid turnover conferred by suboptimal codons inserted in reporter mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sweet et al. 2012</xref>). A queue of slowly elongating ribosomes upstream from non-optimal codons can be recognized by Dhh1, and overexpressing or tethering Dhh1 evokes ribosome stalling at non-optimal codons. Moreover, Dhh1 association and Dhh1-dependent repression of mRNA abundance both correlate with codon non-optimality across the yeast transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Radhakrishnan et al. 2016</xref>). However, the mRNAs most highly up-regulated in <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δ</italic> cells are not enriched for suboptimal codons, suggesting that other features are responsible for their preferential targeting by Dhh1 or Pat1 for decapping/decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to enhancing mRNA decay, there is evidence that Pat1, Dhh1, and Scd6 can repress translation. Tethering Dhh1 or Scd6 represses translation of reporter mRNAs in <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> cells where the tethered transcripts cannot be decapped and degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carroll et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sweet et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zeidan et al. 2018</xref>). Deletion of Dhh1 and Pat1 simultaneously eliminated loss of bulk polysomes evoked by nutrient starvation and also increased initiation rates of certain mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holmes et al. 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Coller and Parker 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arribere et al. 2011</xref>). Supporting a direct role in repressing translation, overexpressing Dhh1 or Pat1 in nonstarved cells evoked polysome disassembly and reduced the initiation rate of specific mRNAs; and addition of Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Coller and Parker 2005</xref>) or N-terminally truncated Pat1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nissan et al. 2010</xref>) to yeast extracts inhibited bulk translation and 48S preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly in vitro. Ribosome profiling studies of <italic>dhh1Δ, pat1Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> mutants identified hundreds of genes whose transcripts are translationally down-regulated or activated by Dhh1 or Pat1 in nutrient-replete cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jungfleisch et al. 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Radhakrishnan et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zeidan et al. 2018</xref>), which frequently involves cooperation between Dhh1 and Pat1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, we showed that Pat1 and Dhh1 function with the decapping enzyme in rich medium to repress the abundance or translation of numerous mRNAs encoding proteins required specifically in media containing an alternative carbon or nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>). These include mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (Ox. Phos.) and diverse other proteins known to be transcriptionally repressed by carbon or nitrogen catabolite repression in rich medium.</p>
<p>In this study, we used a multi-omics approach to determine whether Edc3 and Scd6 have largely redundant functions in targeting mRNAs for decapping and attendant degradation, and whether they functionally cooperate with Pat1 or Dhh1 in repressing the abundance or translation of specific mRNAs. We identified a large cohort of mRNAs that are up-regulated in an <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant but not in either single mutant lacking only Scd6 or Edc3, without a commensurate increase in transcription of the cognate genes. These transcripts display a strikingly similar pattern of up-regulation in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutant in the manner predicted if Edc3/Scd6 redundantly recruit Dhh1 to Dcp2 for activation of decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al. 2022</xref>). We further observed functional redundancy between Scd6 and Edc3 and extensive cooperation with Dhh1/Pat1 in repressing translation of particular mRNAs, with evidence for interdependent repression by all four decapping factors. Importantly, Edc3/Scd6 contribute to post-transcriptional repression of proteins required for catabolism of non-preferred carbon or nitrogen sources on rich medium, acting collectively to enhance glucose repression, maintain low-level mitochondrial electron transport and reduce levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and glyoxylate cycle intermediates in glucose-replete cells.</p>

<title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title>
<p>Unless otherwise indicated, the following yeast strains were employed for all experiments: WT strain HFY114 (W303: <italic>MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">He et al. 2003</xref>), <italic>scd6Δ</italic> strain SYY2352 (<italic>MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100 scd6Δ::kanMX6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">He and Jacobson 2015</xref>), <italic>edc3Δ</italic> strain FZY862 (<italic>MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100 edc3Δ::kanMX4</italic>), and <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> strain FZY858 (<italic>MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100 scd6Δ::hphMX4 edc3Δ::kanMX4</italic>).</p>
<p>Strains FZY858 and FZY862 were generated by replacing chromosomal <italic>EDC3</italic> in strains FZY855 and HFY114, respectively, with the <italic>edc3Δ::kanMX4</italic> allele amplified by PCR from the chromosomal DNA of strain 255 (<italic>MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 edc3Δ::kanMX4</italic>) obtained from Research Genetics. DNA sequences up to 310 bp upstream and 340 bp downstream of the <italic>EDC3</italic> coding sequence were included in the amplified fragment used for transformation of FZY855 and HFY114 to G418-resistance. FZY855 was derived from SYY2352 by transforming with marker-swap plasmid pAG32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Goldstein and McCusker 1999</xref>) to replace <italic>scd6Δ::kanMX6</italic> with <italic>scd6Δ::hphMX6,</italic> selecting for resistance to hygromycin and screening for loss of G418-resistance. The presence of all deletion alleles was verified by PCR analysis of chromosomal DNA.</p>
<p>Strains H5695, H5696, H5697, and H5698 strains, employed for co-immunoprecipitation experiments, were generated by PCR-amplification of a <italic>DHH1-TAP-HIS3MX</italic> fragment from strain F2262 using primers AKV224 and AKV225, containing 474 bp upstream and 450 bp downstream of the <italic>DHH1</italic> stop codon, that was used to transform strains HFY114, FZY862, SYY2352, and FZY858, respectively, to His⁺. A complete list of yeast strains employed is given in Table S1.</p>
<p>Plasmids pLfz614-7 and pLfz635-5 contain the <italic>EDC3</italic> CDS with 420 bp upstream and 490 bp downstream, on a ∼2.6 kb fragment, and plasmids pL615-5 and pLfz636-1 contain the <italic>SCD6</italic> CDS with 500 bp upstream and 180 bp downstream on a ∼1.7 kb fragment, amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and inserted between the XhoI and EcoRI sites of YCplac33 or YCplac111, respectively. Plasmid pAK133 containing <italic>DCP2-3HA</italic> was produced by a multi-step PCR amplification scheme. First, the <italic>DCP2</italic> CDS with 920 nucleotides upstream of the start codon and 587 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon was amplified from genomic DNA of WT strain HFY114. Sequences encoding the 3XHA tag were introduced immediately upstream of the <italic>DCP2</italic> stop codon using primer pairs AKV372/AKV373 and AKV374/AKV375 during the first round of PCR amplification; a second round of PCR followed using primers AKV372 and AKV375 to amplify a complete <italic>DCP2-3HA</italic> fragment also containing sequences homologous to the ends of plasmid YCplac33 linearized by digestion with BamHI.

<title>Evidence that Scd6 and Edc3 functionally cooperate to control the abundance of many individual mRNAs</title>
<p>To determine whether Scd6 and Edc3 function redundantly in post-transcriptional control of gene expression, we constructed a <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant isogenic to the <italic>scd6Δ</italic> and <italic>edc3Δ</italic> single mutants we examined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zeidan et al. 2018</xref>). Only the double mutant exhibits a marked slow-growth (Slg<sup>-</sup>) phenotype on synthetic complete medium (SC), which was largely complemented by introducing either <italic>SCD6</italic> or <italic>EDC3</italic> on a single copy plasmid (Supplemental Fig. S1A). Analysis of polysome assembly revealed a ∼40% reduction in ratio of polysomes to monosomes (P/M) in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant, whereas the single mutants showed little (<italic>scd6Δ</italic>) or no (<italic>edc3Δ</italic>) reduction in bulk translation by this assay (Fig. S1B). These results suggest that Scd6 and Edc3 act redundantly to carry out one or more functions required for WT levels of bulk translation and cell growth in nutrient replete cells.</p>
<p>To examine the effects of the <italic>scd6Δ, edc3Δ,</italic> and <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutations on the abundance and translation of individual mRNAs, we conducted RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) of the mutant and WT strains following growth in liquid rich medium (YPD) at 30°C (processed data compiled in supplementary File S1). Ribo-Seq entails deep-sequencing of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs, or ribosome footprints), and cycloheximide was added to the lysates to arrest elongating ribosomes on the mRNA following cell breakage. The ratio of RPF sequencing reads summed over the coding sequences (CDS) to the total mRNA reads from RNA-Seq for the corresponding transcript provides a measure of translational efficiency (TE) for each mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ingolia et al. 2009</xref>). The ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq results between two biological replicates for each strain were highly reproducible with Pearson correlation coefficients (r) ranging between 0.95-1.0 for different pairwise comparisons of replicates (Fig. S2A-B). We employed DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Love et al. 2014</xref>) to identify statistically significant differences in relative mRNA abundance, RPF abundance, or TE for all expressed mRNAs between WT and mutant strains (see Methods for details).</p>
<p>Analysis of the RNA-Seq results identified 81 mRNAs that were significantly up-regulated in the <italic>edc3Δ</italic> mutant vs. WT by &gt;1.5-fold at a false discovery rate (FDR) of &lt;0.05 (dubbed mRNA_up_e3 transcripts; Fig. S3A), and 123 mRNAs reduced in abundance by <italic>edc3Δ</italic> by the same criteria (dubbed mRNA_dn_e3, Fig. S3B). Only 14 mRNAs were up-regulated and only 34 down-regulated by the <italic>scd6Δ</italic> single mutation (respectively, mRNA_up_s6 and mRNA_dn_s6, Fig. S3A-B). Importantly, many more mRNAs were dysregulated by the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutation: 741 in the mRNA_up_s6,e3 group and 793 in the mRNA_dn_s6,e3 group (Fig. S3A-B), indicating that the two factors have highly redundant functions in controlling mRNA abundance.</p>
<p>Many yeast mutants with Slg<sup>-</sup> phenotypes, including <italic>pat1Δ, dhh1Δ,</italic> and <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> deletion mutants, exhibit altered expression of most mRNAs belonging to the Environmental Stress Response (ESR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">O’Duibhir et al. 2014</xref>), which includes ∼300 induced (iESR) and ∼600 down-regulated (rESR) mRNAs dysregulated in WT cells by various stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gasch et al. 2000</xref>). In keeping with its Slg<sup>-</sup> phenotype, the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutation conferred a marked reduction in median expression of rESR mRNAs, and increased expression of the iESR mRNAs, which exceeded in magnitude the changes observed for the slowest growing yeast deletion mutants analyzed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">O’Duibhir et al. 2014</xref>) (Fig. S3C-D). The two single mutations, by contrast, conferred much smaller changes in ESR mRNAs (Fig. S3C-D). (In all box plots, when notches do not overlap between adjacent boxes, their two medians differ with 95% confidence; and when notches do not overlap 0 in log<sub>2</sub> plots, the median differs significantly from that of all mRNAs, which is invariably close to 1.0.) Consistent with these results, the transcripts up-regulated in the double mutant are enriched for iESR mRNAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), suggesting that the 187 iESR transcripts up-regulated in this strain are responding indirectly to cell stress. The remaining 75% of mRNAs up-regulated in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells are not iESR mRNAs however (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), suggesting that their increased abundance arises from eliminating Edc3/Scd6 functions in mRNA decay. Below, we excluded the ESR mRNAs from analyses of mRNA changes in an effort to focus on the transcripts controlled directly by Scd6 and Edc3.</p>

<p>We recently identified a group of 1018 non-iESR mRNAs up-regulated by either <italic>pat1Δ, dhh1Δ,</italic> or <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>). Importantly, this group is highly enriched for the 591 mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>scd6Δ, edc3Δ,</italic> or <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Indeed, ∼70% of the transcripts up-regulated by <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> are also up-regulated in one of the three <italic>pat1Δ/dhh1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, sector (ii)), showing comparable up-regulation in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ, pat1Δ,</italic> and <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutants, but little change in the <italic>scd6Δ</italic> and <italic>edc3Δ</italic> single mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B(ii)</xref>). These mRNAs generally exhibit the greatest up-regulation in the <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutant, indicating cumulative contributions of Dhh1 and Pat1 to their repression, in contrast to the largely redundant roles played by Scd6 and Edc3 in their repression. As expected, the smaller group of 180 mRNAs significantly up-regulated exclusively by <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> (sector (i) of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) shows strong up-regulation only in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant; but they are appreciably up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> while being largely unaffected by <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, sector (i)). Finally, the majority group of 607 mRNAs significantly up-regulated by only <italic>pat1Δ</italic> or <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> display the largest increases in the two mutants lacking Pat1, but smaller and similar increases in response to the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> and <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2A</xref> &amp; 2B, sector (iii)). Overall, these findings suggest that Dhh1 and Pat1 both contribute to repressing the majority of mRNAs repressed redundantly by Scd6 and Edc3, with Dhh1 contributing more extensively than Pat1.</p>

<p>Further evidence for this last point comes from a k-means clustering analysis of mRNA changes in different mutants for the group of 431 non-iESR mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ,</italic> which revealed a stronger correlation between the changes conferred by <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> and <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.90) than between <italic>pat1Δ</italic> with <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.74) or <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.71) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Consistent with this, the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutations up-regulate a considerably larger proportion of the mRNAs significantly up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> (∼70%) vs. those up-regulated by <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (∼41%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Furthermore, the majority of mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> exhibit redundant repression by Scd6 and Edc3, showing marked up-regulation comparable to that given by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> itself only in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> double mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). These findings are consistent with the involvement of Edc3/Scd6 in the degradation of most mRNAs targeted by Dhh1, which are more variably and less extensively repressed by Pat1.</p>

<title>Evidence that Scd6/Edc3 repress mRNA abundance by enhancing decapping/degradation and facilitating Dhh1 association with Dcp2</title>
<p>We next examined whether the mRNAs significantly down-regulated by Edc3/Scd6 are also regulated by the decapping enzyme Dcp1/Dcp2. Supporting this, cluster analysis of mRNA changes revealed that the majority of non-iESR mRNAs up-regulated in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant are also up-regulated by <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, blue colors in cols. 1 &amp; 3), with a strong correlation between the abundance changes conferred by these mutations relative to WT (ρ=0.74).

These findings implicate decapping by Dcp1:Dcp2 as an important driver of the repression of mRNA levels directed by Scd6/Edc3. The cluster analysis in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> once again reveals greater similarity between the mRNA changes conferred by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and those given by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.90) versus <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.69); and <italic>pat1Δ</italic> also confers a smaller median reduction than <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> of the Scd6/Edc3-down-regulated mRNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Additional support that Scd6/Edc3 target mRNAs for decapping came from evidence that mRNAs up-regulated in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant tend to accumulate in WT cells as decapped isoforms. Following decapping by Dcp1/Dcp2 mRNAs frequently undergo 5’ to 3’ decay co-translationally, with Xrn1 following behind the last translating ribosome loaded prior to decapping, and such decapped intermediates account for ∼12% of all mRNAs in WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pelechano et al. 2015</xref>). We reasoned that mRNAs preferentially targeted by Scd6/Edc3 for decapping and attendant degradation by Xrn1 should exhibit a greater than average proportion of decapped intermediates in WT cells. To test this, we conducted cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) to quantify the abundances of all capped mRNA 5’ ends and compare them to total mRNA abundances determined by RNA-Seq conducted in parallel on biological replicates prepared from the WT and <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> strains described above. Transcript numbers per million reads (TPMs) from CAGE (C) and RNA-Seq (T) were determined and C/T ratios calculated as a proxy for the proportion of capped molecules for each transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>) (File S1). (Because the CAGE and RNA-Seq data were normalized separately, the C/T ratios are relative, not absolute, proportions of capped transcripts.) Importantly, the C/T ratios are lower in WT cells for the 498 non-iESR mRNAs up-regulated in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant compared to all expressed mRNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, cols. 1 &amp; 5) in the manner expected for mRNAs preferentially targeted for decapping in WT cells. By contrast, the C/T ratios are higher than average for the non-rESR mRNAs that are down-regulated in relative abundance in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells, as expected for an unusually low degree of decapping in WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, cols 3 &amp; 5). Importantly, these C/T ratios were elevated in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells to nearly the same level for all three groups of mRNAs, which exceeds the ratios found in WT cells, in the manner expected from eliminating Scd6/Edc3-stimulated decapping (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, cf. cols. 2,4,6). Similar results were obtained for these same groups of dysregulated mRNAs by analyzing our previous CAGE data obtained for the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>) (Fig. S3E). These findings are consistent with the notion that impaired decapping dependent on Scd6/Edc3 and Dhh1 is an important driver of increased mRNA abundance in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant.</p>
<p>Independent evidence for this last conclusion was provided by analyzing the codon protection indices (CPI) of mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic>, an indicator of co-translational decay by Xrn1. Decapped degradation intermediates exhibit three-nucleotide periodicity generated by precise Xrn1 cleavage up to the last translating ribosome at the 5’ end of mRNA, and the CPI quantifies the prevalence of such intermediates for each mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pelechano et al. 2015</xref>). Importantly, the mRNA_up_s6,e3 transcripts (whether including or excluding ESR mRNAs) exhibit higher than average median CPIs, indicating a greater than average involvement of decapping and co-translational degradation by Xrn1 in their decay, whereas mRNA_dn_s6,e3 transcripts exhibit lower than average CPI values, consistent with an alternative degradation pathway controlling their abundance <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether increased transcription contributes to increased abundance of mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic>, we performed ChIP-Seq analysis of Rpb1 to measure RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) occupancies averaged across the CDS of every gene, obtaining highly reproducible results across replicates (Fig. S2D &amp; S4A). To quantify absolute changes in Pol II occupancies, <italic>S. pombe</italic> chromatin was added to each <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> chromatin sample prior to immunoprecipitation. To measure absolute changes in mRNA abundance, we re-analyzed the RNA-Seq data taking into account the recovery of External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) transcripts that were added to each total RNA sample prior to preparation of cDNA libraries, yielding highly reproducible normalized values among replicates (Fig. S2C). Interrogating the non-ESR mRNAs up- or down-regulated by <italic>scd6Δedc3</italic> revealed a 2.79-fold increase in median normalized mRNA abundance for the non-iESR mRNA_up_s6,e3 group that was associated with only a 1.2-fold increase in normalized Rpb1 occupancies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, cols. 1 &amp; 4). The down-regulated non-rESR mRNA_dn_s6,e3 transcripts showed 12% and 7% decreases in spike-in normalized median mRNA abundance and Rpb1 occupancies, respectively, (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, cols. 2 &amp; 5). Because the majority of total mRNA is rRNA, the ERCC normalization effectively yields the abundance of each mRNA relative to rRNA, and the ribosome content per cell is expected to be reduced in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant owing to repression of rESR mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and biogenesis factors (Fig. S3C). We showed previously that the isogenic <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> mutant displays an ESR response of similar magnitude and a 30% reduction in ribosomal subunits per cell compared to same WT examined here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>). Assuming a similar reduction in ribosome abundance in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells, the absolute changes in mRNA per cell conferred by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> are expected to be 0.7-fold of the ERCC-normalized values given in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, yielding fold-changes of 2.0 and 0.62 for the mRNA_up_s6,e3 and mRNA_dn_s6,e3 groups, respectively. Because these predicted changes in mRNA per cell still differ substantially from the corresponding changes in normalized Rpb1 occupancies of 1.2 and 0.93, respectively, there is only a small contribution of altered transcription to the altered abundance of transcripts dysregulated in the double mutant.</p>
<p>Our findings above that the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutations up-regulate highly similar sets of mRNAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) is consistent with a previous proposal that recruitment of Dhh1 to Dcp2 can be mediated interchangeably by Edc3 or Scd6 bound to the same site in the Dcp2 CTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al. 2022</xref>). To test this model we asked whether association of Dhh1 with Dcp2 in cell extracts is impaired only when both Edc3 and Scd6 are eliminated. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged Dcp2 with TAP-tagged Dhh1 was reduced in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells but not in either single mutant in replicate experiments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>, lanes 2-4; Fig. S5(i)-(ii)). The residual association in the double mutant suggests that Dhh1 can interact with Dcp2 either directly or via Pat1 in addition to the interaction mediated by Scd6/Edc3, which might explain why a small fraction of mRNAs are up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> but not by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Slow rates of translation initiation or elongation generally do not dictate preferential decapping/decay by the decapping activators</title>
<p>Codon non-optimality has been linked with Dhh1-mediated mRNA decay partly by demonstrating that the sTAI values of mRNAs, which quantify their overall codon optimality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sabi and Tuller 2014</xref>), are inversely correlated with the changes in mRNA abundance observed in <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> versus WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Radhakrishnan et al. 2016</xref>). Similarly, analyzing the mRNA changes conferred by the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutation for all non-ESR transcripts reveals a small but statistically significant negative correlation with sTAI values (Pearson r of -0.085, P = 2 x 10<sup>-9</sup>) similar to that observed for the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutation (r = -0.071, P = 6 x 10<sup>-6</sup>) (Fig. S6A, cyan vs. orange), indicating a tendency for mRNAs with lower codon optimality/sTAI scores to show greater increases in relative abundance in response to <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> or <italic>dhh1Δ</italic>. However, the 591 non-iESR mRNAs up-regulated by the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutations (from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) have a median sTAI value (0.35) nearly identical to that of all nonESR mRNAs, which is also the case for the group of 1018 mRNAs up-regulated by the <italic>pat1Δ</italic> or <italic>dhh1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>) (Fig. S6B). Similar results were obtained for other metrics of codon optimality, tAI and average CSC (Fig. S6B), suggesting that poor codon optimality is not a key property defining the mRNAs repressed most extensively by these decapping activators. It has also been proposed that competition between translation initiation and mRNA decay, rather than codon optimality and elongation, is a major determinant of mRNA stability in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Muhlrad et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">LaGrandeur and Parker 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwartz and Parker 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chan et al. 2018</xref>). However, the mRNAs up-regulated in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> or <italic>pat1Δ/dhh1</italic> mutants have slightly greater than average median translational efficiencies (TEs) in WT cells (Fig. S6C), as determined by ribosome profiling experiments described below. Thus, neither slow rates of translation initiation nor pausing during elongation at non-optimal codons appears to dictate preferential targeting of the mRNAs most strongly repressed by these four decapping activators.</p>

<title>Scd6 and Edc3 act redundantly and cooperate more extensively with Dhh1 than Pat1 in controlling translation of individual mRNAs</title>
<p>The changes in mRNA abundance were highly correlated with changes in RPF abundance for the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant compared to WT for all expressed transcripts, with an r value of 0.81 (Fig. S2F), providing strong mutual validation of the RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq data for these strains. Nevertheless, the fact that this correlation is weaker than that observed between biological replicates of RNA-Seq or Ribo-Seq data (r values &gt;0.95, Fig. S2A-B), suggests that certain mRNAs exhibit altered translational efficiencies in the double mutant. Indeed, DESeq2 analysis of the Ribo-Seq data identified 184 mRNAs showing TE increases of &gt;1.41-fold at FDR &lt; 0.10 in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> strain (dubbed TE_up_s6,e3) but only 42 and one such mRNA in the <italic>scd6Δ</italic> and <italic>edc3Δ</italic> single mutants, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), suggesting that Scd6 and Edc3 have overlapping functions in repressing the translation of particular mRNAs.

<p>We explored next whether the increased ribosome occupancies observed in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant are associated with increased protein synthesis by conducting TMT mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) of total cell proteins to obtain ratios of peptide abundance in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> strain vs. WT for &gt;4000 different proteins (Fig. S2E). Importantly, significant correlations exist between changes in protein abundance and RPFs across the translatome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Moreover, mRNAs showing increased or decreased RPFs in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> vs. WT cells (&gt;1.5-fold, FDR&lt;0.05, Ribo_up and Ribo_dn) likewise exhibit increased or decreased median protein abundances determined by TMT-MS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). These results suggest that increased ribosome occupancies measured by Ribo-Seq, which could occur by increases in mRNA, TE, or both, are generally associated with increased synthesis of the encoded proteins in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells.</p>
<p>It was possible that translational repression by Edc3/Scd6 generally occurs by slowing elongation, leading to increased ribosome densities (RPF/mRNA ratios, ie. calculated TEs) in WT cells and decreased TE values in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells that would be associated with increased protein expression. In this scenario, changes in TEs would be inversely associated with changes in protein expression. Instead, mRNAs showing increased or decreased TEs in the double mutant (TE_up_s6,e3 and TE_dn_s6,e3 transcripts defined above) also exhibit increased or decreased protein expression in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> vs. WT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>), implying that Scd6/Edc3 generally influence translation at the initiation step.</p>
<p>We previously identified 274 mRNAs whose TEs are up-regulated in the <italic>pat1Δ, dhh1Δ,</italic> or <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> mutants by the same criteria employed here (&gt;1.41-fold at FDR &lt; 0.10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>). Interestingly, these mRNAs overlap significantly with those translationally up-regulated in the single or double <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The 76 mRNAs common to both groups show larger TE increases in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant compared to the 136 transcripts up-regulated exclusively in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5A-B</xref>, sector (ii) vs. sector (i)). These 76 mRNAs also show marked TE increases in the <italic>dhh1Δ, pat1Δ</italic>, and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B(ii)</xref>), indicating that all four decapping activators are required for efficient translational repression of these mRNAs in WT cells. The 136 mRNAs significantly up-regulated only in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants show a moderate increase in median TE in <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells, but little response to <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B(i)</xref>). The 198 mRNAs up-regulated only in the <italic>pat1Δ/dhh1Δ</italic> mutants show only a small TE increase in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> strain and cumulative TE increases in the <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B(iii)</xref>). In summary, similar to our findings for repression of mRNA abundance, efficient translational repression of certain mRNAs requires the combined functions of Pat1, Dhh1, and either Scd6 or Edc3, whereas other mRNAs are translationally repressed by either Edc3/Scd6 or Pat1 with appreciable contributions from Dhh1.</p>

<p>Greater cooperation of Scd6/Edc3 with Dhh1 vs. Pat1 in controlling translation is also revealed by clustering analysis of TE changes in different mutants for the mRNAs exhibiting altered TEs in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants, with greater similarity between TE changes conferred by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> vs. <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.82) compared to <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> vs. <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.68) or <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> vs. <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.69) cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). However, as noted above, the group showing the strongest up-regulation of TEs in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant tends to be highly up-regulated in all three of the other mutants lacking Dhh1 or Pat1 (bracketed mRNAs at the top of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), as in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> for a group of 54 mRNAs whose TEs are up-regulated by 2.0-fold or more in both the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutants. Thus, although Scd6/Edc3 appear to cooperate more extensively with Dhh1 than Pat1 in translational control, the subset of 50-60 mRNAs exhibiting the strongest repression by Scd6/Edc3 or Pat1/Dhh1 require the concerted functions of Pat1, Dhh1, and either Scd6 or Edc3 to achieve their strong translational repression in WT cells. To assess whether mRNAs translationally repressed by the decapping activators are also targeted for degradation by these factors, we examined mRNA changes for the groups of mRNAs exhibiting TE up-regulation in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> or <italic>pat1Δ/dhh1Δ</italic> mutants (sectors (i) to (iii) of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The mRNAs showing increased TEs only in the <italic>pat1Δ/dhh1Δ</italic> strains show little change in mRNA abundance in these mutants (Fig. S7A(iii)), indicating selective repression of translation vs degradation. Similarly, mRNAs translationally up-regulated only in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants show little change in mRNA abundance in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> strain and only modest up-regulation in the <italic>pat1Δ/dhh1Δ</italic> mutants (Fig. S6A(i)). In contrast, the transcripts showing increased TEs in all of the mutants also show markedly increased abundance in the same mutants (Fig. S6A(ii)). Thus, coupled repression of translation and abundance by the decapping factors occurs only for the subset of transcripts exhibiting concerted translational repression by all four factors. In contrast, the much larger groups of transcripts defined above showing increased mRNA abundance in the mutants (described in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) exhibit little change in median TE in all four mutants (Fig. S6B), suggesting that most mRNAs targeted for enhanced turnover do not exhibit translational repression of the fraction of undegraded transcripts remaining in WT cells.</p>
<p>We next examined the translational efficiencies of mRNAs translationally repressed by Scd6/Edc3 by interrogating the Ribo-Seq data for WT cells on rich medium. The mRNAs translationally repressed by Scd6/Edc3 in concert with Pat1/Dhh1 tend to be poorly translated in WT, having a substantially lower median relative TE compared to all mRNAs (0.24 vs. 0.95) (Fig. S6C, col. 2), thus resembling the mRNAs translationally repressed exclusively by Dhh1/Pat1 (col. 3). In contrast, the transcripts translationally repressed exclusively by Edc3/Scd6 are generally well translated, exhibiting a ∼2.5-fold greater than average median TE in WT cells (Fig. S6C, col. 1). Consistent with this distinction, gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that products of the 136 mRNAs translationally repressed exclusively by Scd6/Edc3 are enriched for cytoplasmic or mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (P = 1 x 10<sup>-7</sup>), whereas products of the 76 transcripts repressed by Scd6/Edc3/Pat1/Dhh1 are enriched for factors involved in fermentation (P = 2 x 10<sup>-7</sup>), carbohydrate metabolism (P = 1 x 10<sup>-6</sup>) or metabolism of non-protein amino acids (P = 3 x 10<sup>-6</sup>). Thus, Scd6/Edc3 translationally repress distinct groups of mRNAs depending on whether Dhh1/Pat1 participate in the repression.</p>
<p>We showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zeidan et al. 2018</xref>) that mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> are enriched for Dhh1 protein association in vivo as judged by RIP-Seq analysis of yeast mRNAs using antibodies against Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Miller et al. 2018</xref>), thus providing evidence for a direct role of Dhh1 decapping/degradation of these transcripts. The same observation was made for the mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>pat1Δ,</italic> consistent with widespread cooperation between Dhh1 and Pat1 in repressing mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>). Interestingly, here we observed greater than average Dhh1 occupancies for all four mRNA groups defined above (in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2A</xref> or 5A) that are up-regulated in transcript abundance or TE by the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> or <italic>dhh1Δ/pat1Δ</italic> mutations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). This finding is consistent with the fact that Dhh1 contributes to repressing the abundance or TE of the majority of transcripts in these groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2B</xref> &amp; 5B). It is possible that Dhh1 is recruited to most of these mRNAs in a complex with Dcp1:Dcp2 and other decapping activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al. 2022</xref>), but contributes differentially to their degradation or translational repression.</p>

<title>Scd6/Edc3 post-transcriptionally repress mRNAs encoding enzymes for respiration and catabolism of non-glucose carbon sources in rich medium</title>
<p>Recently, we reported that mRNAs up-regulated in abundance or TE in the <italic>dcp2Δ, pat1Δ</italic> and <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutants are enriched for mitochondrial proteins that function in Ox. Phos. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>). GO analysis led to the same finding here for the non-iESR mRNAs up-regulated in abundance by the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutations, including many of the same categories of mitochondrial functions enriched among the mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ/pat1Δ</italic> mutations (Fig. S8A-B, green type). GO analysis of genes showing increased ribosome occupancies (RPFs), indicating either increased mRNA abundance or TE, confirms that the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutations derepress the translation of Ox. Phos. gene transcripts (Fig. S8C-D). Examining a collection of Ox. Phos. genes functioning in electron transport, the TCA cycle or mitochondrial ATP synthase reveals that the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutations up-regulate expression of these genes primarily at the level of mRNA abundance, with small additional increases in TE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed increased expression of four Ox. Phos. proteins (Qcr8, Atp20, Idh1, and Sdh4), two proteins (Cox14 and Cox20) involved in cytochrome c oxidase assembly, and mitochondrial cytochrome b2 (Cyb2) required for lactate utilization in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells, relative to Gcd6 examined as loading control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-C</xref>). Results similar to these were obtained for the same mitochondrial proteins in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>) and for a subset in <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>). Importantly, we also observed increased expression of Cox2, a mitochondrially encoded subunit of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial ETC, whose expression correlates with mitochondrial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vengayil et al. 2024</xref>). Except for <italic>dcp2Δ</italic>, all the decapping mutants had significantly increased Cox2 protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>), suggesting an increase in ETC activity in these mutants. Up-regulation of mRNA and RPF abundance in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutants also occurred for enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), which catalyze certain reactions of the TCA cycle in the cytoplasm to support gluconeogenesis during respiratory growth on two-carbon compounds; and the increased expression of one such enzyme, Cit2, was confirmed by Western analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6B-C</xref>). Both Ox. Phos. and the glyoxylate cycle normally operate at low levels in yeast growing with abundant glucose, as in our experiments, suggesting that Scd6/Edc3 cooperate with Dhh1/Pat1 to help suppress these pathways in glucose-replete cells.</p>
<p>Consistent with post-transcriptional control of Ox. Phos. genes, the median relative RPF levels were up-regulated in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant substantially more than the increases in relative Pol II occupancies observed at the cognate genes by ChIP-Seq analysis of Rpb1 (Fig. S9B, cols. 1-2). Moreover, the transcription factors responsible for induction of Ox. Phos. genes, the Hap2/Hap3/Hap4/Hap5 complex, were not activated in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells: expression of a <italic>CYC1-lacZ</italic> reporter activated by this complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Forsburg and Guarente 1989</xref>) was not elevated in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants in glucose-containing medium (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F(ii)</xref>) but showed the expected induction in WT cells grown with glycerol/ethanol versus glucose (6F(i)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Broach 2012</xref>). These findings support the notion that reduced decapping stabilizes Ox. Phos. gene transcripts in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells.</p>
<p>In addition to Ox. Phos., GO analysis of genes up-regulated in mRNA or RPF abundance in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants revealed enrichment for utilization of alternative carbon sources (Fig. S8A-D), as observed recently for <italic>dhh1Δ,pat1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>). Consistent with this, 83 carbon catabolite down-regulated (CCR) genes, known to be glucose-repressed or activated by transcription factors Adr1 or Cat8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Young et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tachibana et al. 2005</xref>), exhibit increased translation (RPFs) largely through increased mRNA abundance in both <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutants (Fig. S9A). These genes encode enzymes for β-oxidation of fatty acids in addition to the glyoxylate cycle, which allow cells to synthesize precursors that feed into gluconeogenesis or amino acid biosynthesis, or produce acetyl-CoA and generate NADH by respiration on non-fermentable carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Young et al. 2003</xref>). The CCR genes exhibit larger increases in RPFs compared to Pol II occupancies at the cognate genes in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> vs. WT cells (Fig. S9B, cols. 3-4), consistent with post-transcriptional repression by Scd6/Edc3. Supporting this, an <italic>ADH2-lacZ</italic> reporter transcriptionally induced by activated Adr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sloan et al. 1999</xref>) displayed the expected large induction in our WT strain cultured with glycerol/ethanol versus glucose as carbon source (Fig. S9C(i)), but was down-regulated by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> in glucose-grown cells (Fig. S8C(ii)).</p>

<p>To determine whether up-regulation of Ox.

<p>To confirm increased flux through the TCA cycle coming from glucose breakdown, WT and mutant cells were grown in high glucose, pulsed with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> glucose, and relative <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation into TCA cycle intermediates was estimated for each carbon molecule derived from glucose (as indicated schematically in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>) eight min following the pulse. In all mutants, <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation in all TCA cycle intermediates was significantly higher than in WT cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>), demonstrating increased carbon flux from glucose into the TCA cycle. These results, along with increased ETC activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>), indicate that mitochondrial function is up-regulated in these mutants on glucose. If so, we might expect them to show increased ATP production from respiration versus glycolysis. Measuring total ATP levels in glucose-grown cells revealed that, while all decapping mutants except <italic>pat1Δ</italic> showed reduced ATP per cell (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>), the proportion of ATP produced from respiration, and thus eliminated by sodium azide treatment (by inhibiting the ETC), was elevated in all of the mutants (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>).</p>

<p>Interestingly, amino acids are also up-regulated in the decapping mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), particularly in <italic>pat1Δ</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>), as well as intermediates in amino acid biosynthesis and amino acid derivatives (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). The expression of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes is unaffected or reduced in the mutants however (Fig. S9D), suggesting that increased amino acid abundance results from metabolic reprogramming rather than increased biosynthetic capacity. One possibility is that accumulation of the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate leads to increased production of glutamate and glutamine, precursors in all amino acid biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier 2012</xref>). The two 3-phosphotrioses generated in glycolysis (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate) are also elevated in the mutants, possibly owing to increased glyoxylate shunt function, which might stimulate synthesis of amino acids serine and glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier 2012</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>, Methane metabolism category). The increases in fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, and UDP-glucose in all four mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>, Starch/Sucrose metabolism category) all suggest substantial metabolic rewiring indicative of glucose up-regulation and usage of alternative carbon sources. In addition to amino acids, pyrimidine nucleotides are up-regulated in the mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>, Pyrimidine metab.), which might be driven by the elevated glutamine levels or increased glycolytic flux towards the pentose phosphate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>RNA-seq analysis of single and double <italic>scd6Δ</italic> and <italic>edc3Δ</italic> mutants has revealed that Scd6 and Edc3 have largely overlapping functions in repressing mRNA abundance, as the presence of either protein alone is sufficient for nearly WT levels of most mRNAs found up-regulated in the double mutant (Fig. S3A &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C(ii)-(iii)</xref>). Although the mRNAs dysregulated in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant are enriched for ESR mRNAs; the majority are not ESR transcripts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>) and are most likely repressed more directly by Scd6/Edc3. Functional redundancy of Scd6/Edc3 is consistent with their similarities in sequence and domain structure, including shared FDF motifs that interact competitively with Dhh1 in animals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tritschler et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tritschler et al. 2009</xref>) and N-terminal LSm domains that compete for binding motifs in the Dcp2 CTT of <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fromm et al. 2012</xref>), as well as the synthetic growth defect produced by deleting both genes simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Decourty et al. 2008</xref>) (Fig. S1A). Interestingly, a set of 37 mRNAs appears to be repressed by Edc3 exclusively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C(i)</xref>), including the canonical Edc3 targets identified previously, <italic>YRA1</italic> and <italic>RPS28B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al. 2022</xref>), and is enriched for genes belonging to the GO category “mitochondrion” (22/37 genes) and the Ox. Phos. categories of electron transport and mitochondrial ATP synthesis (11/37 genes: <italic>ATP3 ATP16 ATP5 TIM11 ATP17 COX4 QCR9 CYC1 COX12 ATP18 COX5A</italic>). The fact that deleting <italic>SCD6</italic> in the double mutant frequently diminishes the up-regulation of these transcripts conferred by deleting <italic>EDC3</italic> alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C(i)</xref>) might indicate that eliminating both Scd6 and Edc3 together enables a distinct degradation pathway that compensates for loss of Edc3-stimulated decapping/decay.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that most of the changes in mRNA abundance in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant result from impaired decapping and attendant 5’-3’ degradation by Xrn1. ChIP-seq analysis of Rpb1 shows that Pol II occupancies in the coding sequences increase by much smaller amounts compared to the increased transcript levels for non-iESR mRNAs up-regulated in <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), indicating a minor contribution of increased transcription to their up-regulation. The transcriptional activators of Ox-Phos. and CCR genes, many of whose transcripts are up-regulated by <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic>, remain largely inert in this mutant, ruling out inappropriate transcriptional induction of their target genes in glucose-replete <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> cells. Consistent with mRNA turnover via decapping, most of these transcripts are up-regulated similarly by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and deletion of <italic>DCP2</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>), exhibit a heightened proportion of decapped isoforms in WT cells that is diminished by deleting <italic>SCD6/EDC3</italic> or <italic>DHH1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> &amp; Fig. S3E), and show evidence of co-translational 5’-3’ decay of decapped intermediates by Xrn1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>); none of which was observed for the mRNAs down-regulated in <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> cells. Similar findings were reported previously for sets of mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> or <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>), consistent with the widespread involvement of Dhh1 and Pat1 in controlling the levels of mRNAs preferentially targeted by Scd6/Edc3.</p>
<p>Supporting this last assertion, most (∼70%) of the mRNAs repressed in abundance by Edc3/Scd6 are also repressed by Dhh1 and Pat1, and their efficient repression in WT cells involves independent contributions of similar magnitude by Pat1, Dhh1 and either Edc3 or Scd6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B(ii)</xref>). Another large set of mRNAs is repressed predominantly by Pat1 with lesser contributions by Dhh1 and Scd6/Edc3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B(iii)</xref>). Our finding of extensive cooperation among these four decapping factors is consistent with our recent finding that ∼55% of the mRNAs up-regulated in the <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> mutant, and thus targeted by Dcp2 for enhanced degradation, tend to be up-regulated in the <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> and <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutants, whereas the remaining 45% are generally up-regulated by <italic>upf1Δ</italic> instead. This finding suggested a major bifurcation of Dcp2-activation by either Pat1/Dhh1/Scd6/Edc3 or the Upf factors responsible for NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>).</p>
<p>Closer examination of the effects of individual mutations on mRNA levels revealed a greater overlap between the mRNAs dysregulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> and <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> versus those altered by <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-E</xref>), consistent with the aforementioned FDF motifs in Scd6 and Edc3 that interact with Dhh1 in animal systems, and with evidence for distinct complexes of the decapping enzyme containing Dhh1 and Edc3 or Scd6 but lacking Pat1. It also supports the recent suggestion that Edc3 and Scd6 act interchangeably to recruit Dhh1 to the Edc3-interaction site in the Dcp2 CTT to stimulate turnover of several Dhh1 target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al. 2022</xref>). Our RNA-seq results support this last proposal in showing that all four Dhh1 target mRNAs examined in that study (<italic>EDC1, SDS23, HXT6,</italic> and <italic>HSP12</italic>) are up-regulated in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant while changing little in the single mutants (Fig. S10), two of which (<italic>SDS23</italic> and <italic>HXT6</italic>) were shown previously to have longer half-lifes in <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> vs. WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">He et al. 2018</xref>). Finding that selective up-regulation in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant applies to most mRNAs up-regulated in <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), we propose that redundant Scd6/Edc3 targeting is a widespread mechanism of Dhh1-enhanced mRNA degradation in the yeast transcriptome (Fig. S11). Supporting this, our co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed diminished Dhh1-Dcp2 association in cell extracts of the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant but for either single mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Examining our Ribo-Seq and TMT-MS data suggests that Dhh1 translation and steady-state abundance are increased ∼2-fold in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> strain, indicating that up-regulation of many of the same mRNAs by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> does not result indirectly from reduced levels of Dhh1 in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant. The increased Dhh1 expression might signify a compensatory response to the absence of Scd6/Edc3. We also observed an ∼40% reduction in Dcp2 translation and abundance in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> strain, which might contribute to the up-regulation of mRNAs dysregulated in this mutant. However, our immunoblot analyses revealed no significant reduction in steady-state Dcp2 levels in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells (Input lanes in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3F</xref> and S4C(i)-(ii)). Moreover, our previous finding that the majority of mRNAs subject to NMD, up-regulated by both <italic>upf1Δ</italic> and <italic>dcp2Δ,</italic> are not up-regulated by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>) implies that Dcp2 abundance in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells is adequate for normal levels of NMD. Accordingly, we favor a direct role for Scd6/Edc3 in accelerating degradation of most transcripts up-regulated in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant.</p>
<p>Despite strong evidence for the involvement of decapping in mRNA turnover directed by either Scd6/Edc3 or Pat1/Dhh1, it appears that neither enrichment for non-optimal codons nor low translational efficiencies are principal determinants of preferential targeting of mRNAs by these proteins (Fig. S6A-C). There are probably exceptions to these generalizations among the hundreds of transcripts repressed by these factors; nor can we rule out the involvement of clusters of non-optimal codons in transcripts of average overall codon optimality that generate a queue of slowly elongating ribosomes that triggers decapping. Nevertheless, it seems likely that other sequences or properties of the transcripts most strongly repressed by Scd6/Edc3 or Dhh1/Pat1 frequently underlie their preferential targeting by these factors for decapping/decay. Sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins that actively recruit these decapping activators is an attractive potential mechanism (Fig. S11). For example, there is evidence that Dhh1 is recruited to mRNAs in association with the Ccr4-NOT deadenylase via RNA-binding protein Puf5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Goldstrohm et al. 2006</xref>). Involvement of RNA-binding proteins would also be consistent with the observed specific targeting of mRNAs whose expression is repressed in response to nutrient abundance.</p>
<p>Ribosome profiling of the single and double <italic>scd6Δ</italic> and <italic>edc3Δ</italic> mutants provided evidence that Scd6 and Edc3 also have highly overlapping functions in repressing the translation of ∼200 mRNAs, whose TE values are up-regulated substantially only in the double mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B(iii)</xref>). The observation that changes in TE (RPF density) generally correlate with changes in protein abundance conferred by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>) implies that Scd6/Edc3 generally repress translation at the stage of initiation rather than elongation. Many mRNAs translationally repressed by Scd6/Edc3 additionally require Dhh1, and the subset most strongly repressed also requires Pat1 for efficient translational repression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B(ii) and 5D</xref>). This last group of mRNAs is translated at very low levels in WT cells on rich medium (Fig. S7C), which might reflect the concerted action of all four decapping activators in suppressing translation. The transcript abundance of these mRNAs is also up-regulated in each of the mutants (Fig. S7A(ii)), indicating enhanced degradation coupled with translational repression by the four decapping activators. One possibility is that a complex of Dcp1:Dcp2 containing Scd6/Edc3, Pat1/Dhh1, or different combinations of these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al. 2022</xref>), is recruited to these mRNAs and impedes recruitment of PICs to diminish translation in parallel with stimulating decapping and 5’-3’ degradation by Xrn1 (Fig. S11(i) &amp; (ii)-(iv)).</p>
<p>The additional sets of mRNAs identified here that are translationally repressed exclusively by Scd6/Edc3 or Pat1/Dhh1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A(i) &amp; (iii)</xref>) show much less evidence of transcript degradation promoted by these factors (Fig. S7A(i) &amp; (iii)), suggesting that inhibition of translation initiation occurs without decapping, or involves decapping uncoupled from degradation by Xrn1 (Fig. S10 (ii)-(iii)). In the latter scenario, the decapped mRNAs would be unable to recruit the cap-binding initiation factors necessary for PIC recruitment and hence persist in WT cells as translationally-inert degradation intermediates. Eliminating the decapping activators would diminish decapping and eliminate these fractions of poorly translated uncapped isoforms to confer the increased TE values we observed for the cognate genes in the decapping mutants. This hypothetical mechanism of translational repression via decapping is consistent with the lower than average capped to total mRNA (C/T) ratios found in WT cells for the mRNAs translationally repressed by all four decapping activators or by Pat1/Dhh1 (Fig. S6D (ii)-(iii)), indicating accumulation of decapped isoforms in WT cells, as observed previously for a subset of mRNAs translationally repressed by Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>). In contrast, the mRNAs that are translationally repressed exclusively by Scd6/Edc3 display higher than average C/T ratios in WT (Fig. S7D(i)), which is more compatible with an inhibition of PIC recruitment independently of decapping (Fig. S11(iii)). Translational repression without decapping could also occur if transcripts bound by decapping complexes are sequestered from the translation initiation machinery in RNA granules where mRNA decapping occurs inefficiently (Fig S11(iv)). Finally, it is important to note that mRNA decay occurs apparently without translational control for the much larger groups of ∼600 and ∼1000 transcripts showing up-regulated mRNA abundance but little evidence of TE changes in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> mutants, respectively (Fig. S7B). It is unclear whether these mRNAs escape translational repression and are targeted exclusively for decapping/degradation (Fig. S11(i)) or are simply degraded too fast to allow translational repression to be detected by ribosomal profiling of steady-state mRNAs.</p>
<p>Recently, we reported that Pat1 and Dhh1 functionally collaborate with the decapping enzyme to repress genes and cellular pathways normally repressed in rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>). Here we found evidence that Scd6 and Edc3 broadly cooperate with Pat1/Dhh1 in this control, acting redundantly to repress the abundance, translation, or both, of mRNAs encoding numerous proteins involved in respiration or utilization of alternative carbon sources (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6A-C</xref>, S8A-D), without affecting transcription of the cognate genes <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>, S9A-C). Evidence that up-regulation of Ox. Phos. mRNAs/proteins in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant is sufficient to increase respiration in glucose-replete cells came from our findings of increased mitochondrially-encoded subunit II of ETC component cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>) and elevated mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>) in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant, extending similar findings we made previously for <italic>dcp2Δ, dhh1Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>). Consistent with this, our metabolomics analysis revealed elevated steady-state levels of TCA cycle intermediates in all four decapping mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), and increased <sup>13</sup>C carbon incorporation from <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose breakdown into TCA cycle intermediates in the same mutant strains (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Analysis of ATP levels further revealed increased proportions of ATP derived from Ox. Phos. in the decapping mutants (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>), which together provide strong evidence that mitochondrial respiration is inappropriately elevated in glucose-replete cells of decapping activator mutants. It is well established that the enzymes involved in respiration and catabolism of non-glucose carbon sources are repressed at the transcriptional level in glucose-replete yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zaman et al. 2008</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that Scd6/Edc3 collaborate with Dhh1/Pat1 to provide an additional layer of post-transcriptional control of these enzymes through enhanced decapping/decay or translational repression to help ensure their complete suppression when glucose is abundant.</p>

<caption><title>Hypothetical model to explain concerted repression of mRNA abundance or translation of particular mRNAs by decapping activators Scd6, Edc3, Dhh1, and Pat1.</title>
<p>A complex of Dcp1:Dcp2 containing Scd6/Edc3, Pat1/Dhh1, or different combinations of these factors, is recruited to target mRNAs, possibly by a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding to the 3’UTR. In agreement with a recent proposal (10), the recruitment of Dhh1 is enhanced by its redundant interactions with Scd6 or Edc3, which interact with the same segment of the Dcp2 CTT, whereas Pat1 is recruited independently to a distinct region of the CTT. One outcome of association of the decapping complex with an mRNA is activation of decapping with attendant 5’-3’ degradation by Xrn1 occurring without detectable repression of translation (i). A different outcome is translational repression by decapping wherein degradation by Xrn1 is inefficient and decapped intermediates accumulate that cannot bind the cap-binding initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4G (depicted as subunits of eIF4F excluded from the m<sup>7</sup>G mRNA cap) and thus persist as translationally inert isoforms (ii). Alternatively, decapping may not occur and the decapping complex competes with the cap-binding initiation factors to selectively inhibit translation initiation (iii), a fate that could be favored by sequestration of the transcript in RNA granules in a manner facilitated by the decapping activator proteins (iv).</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>mRNA decapping and decay factors play critical roles in post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression. Here, Kumar and colleagues investigate how deleting two yeast decapping enhancer proteins (Edc3 and Scd6), either alone or in tandem, affects the transcriptome. Using RNA-Seq, CAGE-Seq and ribosome profiling, they conclude that these factors generally act in a redundant fashion, with a mutant lacking both proteins showing an increased abundance of select mRNAs. As these upregulated transcripts are also upregulated in mutants lacking the decapping enzyme, Dcp2, and show no increases in transcription of their cognate genes, the authors conclude that this is at the level of mRNA decapping and decay. This was further supported by CAGE-Seq analyses carried out in WT cells and the scd∆6edc3∆ double mutant. Their ribosome profiling data also lead them to conclude that Scd6 and Edc3 display functional redundancy and cooperativity with Dhh1/Pat1 in repressing the translation of specific transcripts. Finally, as their data suggest that Scd6 and Edc3 repress mRNAs coding for proteins involved in cellular respiration, as well as proteins involved in the catabolism of alternative carbon sources, they go on to show that these decapping activators play a role in repressing oxidative phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this manuscript is well-written and contains a large amount of compelling high-quality data and analyses. At its core, it helps to shed light on the overlapping roles Edc3 and Scd6 have in sculpting the yeast transcriptome.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While not essential, it would be interesting if the authors carried out add-back experiments to determine which domain within Scd6/Edce3 plays a critical role for enforcing the regulation that they see? Their double mutant now puts them in a perfect position to carry out such experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Kumar and Zhang presents compelling evidence that Edc3 and Scd6 decapping activators, present a high degree of redundancy that can only be overcome by double mutants of both. In addition, the authors provide strong evidence for their role in regulating starvation-induced pathways as evidenced by measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential, metabolomics and analysis of the flux of Krebs cycle intermediates.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Kumar, Zhang et al provide multiple source of evidence of the direct mechanism of Edc3 and Scd6, by using and comparing different approaches such as mRNA-seq, ribosome occupancies and translational efficiencies. By extensive analysis the authors show that this complex can also regulate genes outside the Environmental Stress Response (non-iESR) that are significantly up-regulated in all three mutants. Remarkably, the gene ontology analysis of these non-iESR genes identify enrichment for mitochondrial proteins that are implicated in the Krebs cycle. Overall, this study adds novel mechanistic insight into how nutrients control gene expression by modulating decapping and translational repression.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors show very nicely that growth phenotypes from scd6Δedc3∆ can be rescued by transformation of EDC3 (pLfz614-7) or SCD6 (pLfz615-5). Future work could make use of these rescue strategies, for example as a platform to further characterise protein-protein interactions between Edc3, Scd6 and Dhh1.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Kumar et al investigated the role of two decapping activators, Edc3 and Scd6, in regulating mRNA decay and translation in yeast. Using a variety of approaches including RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, proteomics, polysome analysis, and metabolomics the authors demonstrate that whereas single deletions of Edc3 or Scd6 have modest effects, the double mutant leads to increased abundance of mRNAs, many of which overlap with those targeted by the decapping activators Dhh1 and Pat1. The data suggest that Edc3 and Scd6 function redundantly to recruit Dhh1 to the Dcp2 decapping complex, thereby promoting mRNA turnover and translational repression. The authors show that these factors cooperate with Dhh1/Pat1 to repress transcripts involved in respiration, mitochondrial function, and alternative carbon source utilization, linking post-transcriptional regulation to nutrient responses. The study establishes Edc3 and Scd6 as important, but redundant regulators that fine-tune gene expression and metabolic adaptation in response to nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper has several strengths, including the comprehensive approach taken by the authors using multiple experimental techniques (RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, Western blotting, TMT-MS, polysome profiling, and metabolomics) to provide multiple lines of evidence to support their conclusions. The authors demonstrate clear redundancy of the factors by using single and double mutants for Edc3 and Scd6 and their global approach enables an understanding of these factors' roles across the yeast transcriptome. The work connects post-transcriptional processes to nutrient-dependent gene regulation, providing insights into how cells adapt to changes in their environment. The authors demonstrate the redundant roles of Edc3 and Scd6 in mRNA decapping and translation repression. Their RNA-seq and ribosome profiling results convincingly show that many mRNAs are derepressed only in the double mutants, confirming their hypothesis of redundancy. Furthermore, the functional cooperation between Edc3/Scd6 and Dhh1/Pat1 in regulating specific metabolic pathways, including mitochondrial function and carbon source utilization, is supported by the metabolomic data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study uses indirect evidence to support claims about the effect on mRNA stability rather than directly measuring mRNA stability. However, the combination of Pol II occupancy and RNA abundance measurements is consistent with the claims regarding mRNA stability. The addition of new experiments in the revision co-IPing Dhh1 and Dcp2 strengthens the argument that Edc3 and Scd6 recruit these factors.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this manuscript is well-written and contains a large amount of high-quality data and analyses. At its core, it helps to shed light on the overlapping roles of Edc3 and Scd6 in sculpting the yeast transcriptome.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the data presented makes conclusions about mRNA stability based on corresponding ChIP-Seq analyses and analyzing other mutants (e.g. Dcp2 knockout), at no point is mRNA stability actually ever directly assessed. This direct assessment, even for select transcripts, would further strengthen their conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern but wish to emphasize that we conducted ChIP-Seq analysis of RNA Polymerase II occupancies in the CDSs of all genes, known to be a reliable indicator of transcription rate, and found only small increases in Pol II occupancies that cannot account for the increased transcript levels of the cohort of mRNAs up-regulated in the scd∆6edc3∆ double mutant (Fig. 3E). This provides strong evidence that increased transcription is not the main driver of increased mRNA abundance in this mutant.  Bolstering this conclusion, we showed that the Hap2/Hap3/Hap4/Hap5 complex of transcription factors responsible for induction of Ox. Phos. genes was not activated in scd6Δedc3Δ cells in glucose medium (Fig. 6F(ii)); nor was the Adr1 activator of CCR genes activated (Fig. S9C(i)), ruling out transcriptional induction of their target genes in glucose-replete scd6Δ/edc3Δ cells and instead favoring reduced degradation as the mechanism underlying derepression of Ox. Phos. and CCR gene transcripts in this mutant. In Fig. 3B, we further showed that the majority of mRNAs up-regulated in the scd6Δedc3Δ double mutant are also derepressed by dcp2Δ, and in Fig. 3D that the mRNAs up-regulated in scd∆6edc3∆ cells exhibit a higher than average codon protection index (CPI) indicating a heightened involvement of decapping and co-translational degradation by Xrn1 in their decay. To provide additional support for our conclusion, we have conducted new experiments to measure the abundance of capped mRNAs genome-wide by CAGE sequencing of total mRNA in both WT and scd∆6edc3∆ cells.  As established previously, normalizing CAGE TPMs to total mRNA TPMs determined by RNA-Seq, dubbed the C/T ratio, provides a reliable measure of the capped proportion of each transcript.  The new data presented in Fig. 3C indicate that the mRNAs up-regulated in the scd∆6edc3∆ mutant have significantly lower than average C/T ratios in WT cells, whereas the C/T ratios for the down-regulated transcripts are higher than average, and that these differences between the two groups and all expressed mRNAs are diminished in the scd∆6edc3∆ double mutant. These are the results expected if the up-regulated mRNAs are selectively targeted for decapping in WT cells dependent on Edc3/Scd6, whereas the downregulated mRNAs are targeted by Edc3/Scd6 less than the average transcript. In the original version of the paper, we came to the same conclusion by analyzing our previous CAGE data for the dhh1∆ mutant for the same transcripts dysregulated scd∆6edc3∆ cells, now presented as supportive data in Fig. S3F. Finally, we added the fact that among all four Dhh1 target mRNAs examined in the previous study of He et al. (2022) and found here to be up-regulated selectively in the scd6∆edc3∆ double mutant (Fig. S10), two of them (SDS23 and HXT6) were shown directly to have longer half-lives in dhh1∆ vs. WT cells by He et al. (2018). Hence, the combined evidence is compelling that selective up-regulation of particular mRNAs in the scd∆6edc3∆ mutant results from diminished decapping/decay rather than enhanced transcription; and we feel that the additional supporting evidence that would be provided by measuring half-lives of a small group of up-regulated transcripts would not justify the considerable effort required to do so.  Moreover, the standard approach for such experiments of impairing transcription with an inhibitor of Pol II or a Pol II Ts<sup>-</sup> mutation has been criticized because of the known buffering (suppression) of mRNA decay rates in response to impaired transcription.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Scd6 and Edc3 show a high level of functional redundancy, as demonstrated by the double mutant. As these proteins form complexes with other decapping factors/activators, I'm curious if depleting both proteins in the double mutant destabilizes any of these other factors. Have the authors ever assessed the levels of other key decapping factors in the double mutants (i.e. Dhh1, Pat1, Dcp2...etc)? I wonder if depleting both proteins leads to a general destabilization of key complexes. It would also be interesting to see if depleting Edc3 or Scd6 leads to a concomitant increase in the other protein as a compensatory mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insight.  Examining our Ribo-Seq and TMT-MS data revealed that Dhh1 expression and steady-state abundance are increased ~2-fold in the scd6∆edc3∆ strain, indicating that the up-regulation of many of the same mRNAs by scd6∆edc3∆ and dhh1∆ does not result indirectly from reduced levels of Dhh1 in the scd6∆edc3∆ mutant. The predicted increased in Dhh1 expression might signify a compensatory response to the absence of Scd6/Edc3.  We also observed an ~40% reduction in Dcp2 translation (RPFs) and mRNA abundance in the scd6∆edc3∆ strain, which might contribute to the up-regulation of mRNAs dysregulated in this mutant. However, our new immunoblot analyses revealed no significant reduction in steady-state Dcp2 levels in scd6∆edc3∆ cells (Input lanes in Figs. 3F and S4C(i)-(ii)). Moreover, our previous finding that the majority of mRNAs subject to NMD, up-regulated by both upf1∆ and dcp2∆, are not upregulated by scd6∆edc3∆ implies that Dcp2 abundance in scd6∆edc3∆ cells is adequate for normal levels of NMD and favors a direct role for Scd6/Edc3 in accelerating degradation of most transcripts up-regulated in this mutant. We have added these points to the DISCUSSION.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) While not essential, it would be interesting if the authors carried out add-back experiments to determine which domain within Scd6/Edce3 plays a critical role in enforcing the regulation that they see. Their double mutant now puts them in a perfect position to carry out such experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that our scd6∆edc3∆ strain provides an opportunity to dissect the Scd6 and Edc3 proteins to determine which domains and motifs of each protein are most critically required for their functions in activating mRNA decay. However, if conducted thoroughly, this would entail an extensive analysis requiring a combination of genetics, biochemistry and genomics.  Considering the large amount of data already presented in 43 and 34 panels of main and supplementary figures, respectively, we feel that these additional experiments would be conducted more appropriately as a stand-alone follow-up study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors show very nicely in Figure S1A that growth phenotypes from scd6Δedc3∆ can be rescued by transformation of EDC3 (pLfz614-7) or SCD6 (pLfz615-5). The manuscript might benefit from using these rescue strategies in the analysis performed (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome occupancies, and translational efficiencies). Also, these rescue assays could provide a good platform to further characterise the protein-protein interactions between Edc3, Scd6, and Dhh1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We responded to this point immediately above in responding to Rev. #1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The limitations of the study include the use of indirect evidence to support claims that Edc3 and Scd6 recruit Dhh1 to the Dcp2 complex, which is inferred from correlations in mRNA abundance and ribosome profiling data rather than direct biochemical evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While the reviewer makes a valid point, it is important to note that the greater correlations between effects of scd6∆edc3∆ with those conferred by dhh1∆ vs. pat1∆ also extended to changes in metabolites (Fig. 7A-C). To provide more direct evidence that Edc3 and Scd6 recruit Dhh1 to the Dcp2 complex, we have now conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments (presented in new Figs. 3F and S5) demonstrating that association of Dhh1 with Dcp2 is diminished in the scd6∆edc3∆ double mutant but not in either scd6∆ or edc3∆ single mutant, thus providing biochemical support for our proposal.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, there is limited exploration of other signals as the study is focused on glucose availability, and it is unclear whether the findings would apply broadly across different environmental stresses or metabolic pathways. Nonetheless, the study provides new insights into how mRNA decapping and degradation are tightly linked to metabolic regulation and nutrient responses in yeast. The RNA-seq and ribosome profiling datasets are valuable resources for the scientific community, providing quantitative information on the role of decapping activators in mRNA stability and translation control.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While not disputing the facts of this comment, we think it is unjustified to label as a weakness that our study focused on glucose-grown cells considering the large amount of new data and insights made possible by our multi-omics approach, presented in &gt;70 separate figure panels and nine supplementary datafiles, which the reviewer has characterized as being valuable to the scientific community.  Parallel studies in non-preferred carbon or nitrogen sources are underway and represent large-scale investigations in their own right, for which the current dataset in glucose-replete cells provides the critical reference condition.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors made a note that a set of 37 mRNAs is repressed exclusively by Edc3 with little contribution by Scd6, a list that includes the RPS28B mRNA. Edc3 has been previously reported to promote the decay of this mRNA in a deadenylation-independent fashion by binding to an element in its 3'UTR (PMIDs 15225544, 24492965). Can the authors comment on whether Edc3 may be binding to similar elements in the 3'UTRs of these transcripts in their shortlist? This could be an interesting topic matter for discussion as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While an interesting idea, this seems unlikely because the 3’UTR sequence in RPS28B mRNA was shown to bind Rps28 protein itself to confer heightened decapping and decay dependent on Edc3 in a negative autoregulatory loop that exerts tight control over Rps28 protein levels.  It would be surprising if Edc3mediated repression of the other 36 mRNAs would involve Rps28 as none of them encode cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins. Nevertheless, we searched for a conserved motif among the 3’UTRs of the 37 mRNAs using the MEME suite and found enrichment for motifs identified for RNA binding proteins Hrp1 and Nab2 and two novel motifs, but none of these motifs could be recognized within in the Rps28 autoregulatory loop.  We have chosen not to comment on these findings in the revised manuscript to avoid lengthening it unnecessarily with inconclusive observations.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors show very nicely in Figure S1A that growth phenotypes from scd6Δedc3∆ can be rescued by the transformation of EDC3 (pLfz614-7) or SCD6 (pLfz615-5). The manuscript might benefit from using these rescue strategies on the analysis performed (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome occupancies, and translational efficiencies); or expressing truncated mutants of EDC3 (pLfz614-7) or SCD6 (pLfz615-5), to show that they can act as dominant negative competitors, either on the binding to Dhh1 and Dcp2.</p>

<p>The figure is correctly labeled. Generally, one does not expect to see RPFs in the 5’UTR region unless there is an efficiently translated uORF, which appears not to be the case for MDH2.</p>

<p>In general, the information in this panel and C is inadequate. None of the numbers are clearly explained in the figure legend or in the figure.</p>

<p>We had cited the legend to Fig. S3C for details of all such gene browser images but have now inserted this information into the Fig. 1D legend, at the first occurrence of such data in the regular figures.</p>

<p>(4) Figure 2D is a very complicated Venn Diagram. I suggest using UpSet plots as an alternative to Venn diagrams to more clearly convey overlaps between sets.</p>

<p>(5) The use of the same color scheme to represent different sets in panels of the same figure is a source of confusion. E.g. the cyan in Figures 2A, 2D, and 2E indicates unrelated categories, but one would think they are related.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The use of the same cyan color in these three figure panels actually does designate results for the same set of 591 mRNAs up-regulated in the three mutants.  The application of the color schemes is now mentioned explicitly in Figs. 1, 2, and S3.</p>

<p>(7) The whole manuscript is extremely long which reduces the overall impact. For example, the introduction is six pages long. I suggest reducing redundant text and being more concise to enhance readability.</p>

<p>(9) The ERCC normalization is unclear. Were the spike-ins added before cell lysis to allow estimation of per-cell RNA counts or to the extracted RNA? If added to extracted RNA rather than cells it is not clear to me how the claim can be made regarding increased mRNA abundance in the mutants.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As we explained in the Methods, 2.4 µl of 1:100 diluted ERCC RNA Spike-In Control Mix 1 was added to 1.2 µg of each total RNA sample prior to cDNA library preparation.  Because the majority of total mRNA is comprised of rRNA, this normalization yields the abundance of each mRNA relative to rRNA. Owing to repression of rESR mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and biogenesis factors in the scd6∆edc3∆ strain (Fig. S3D), the ribosome content per cell is expected to be reduced in this mutant vs. WT. We showed previously that the isogenic dcp2∆ mutant that elicits an ESR response of similar magnitude, showed a 30% reduction in bulk ribosomal subunits per cell compared to same WT strain examined here {Vijjamarri, 2023 #7866}.  Assuming a similar reduction in ribosome abundance in the scd6∆edc3∆ mutant, the changes in mRNA per cell conferred by the scd6∆edc3∆ mutation are expected to be 0.7-fold of the ERCCnormalized values given in Fig. 3E, yielding fold-changes of 2.00 and 0.62 for the mRNA_up and mRNA_dn, groups, respectively, which still differ substantially from the corresponding changes in normalized Rpb1 occupancies of 1.2 and 0.93, respectively.  We have added this new analysis to the text of RESULTS.</p>

<p>(10) The use of the terms &quot;up-regulated&quot; and &quot;derepressed&quot; throughout is confusing. Both refer to observed increased abundance of mRNAs, but they imply different causes which are never clearly defined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We changed all occurrences of “derepressed” to “up-regulated”.</p>
