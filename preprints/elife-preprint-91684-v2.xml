<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Xanthomonas citri</italic> subsp. <italic>citri</italic> (<italic>Xcc</italic>), the causal agent of citrus canker, elicits canker symptoms in citrus plants because of the transcriptional activator-like (TAL) effector PthA4, which activates the expression of the citrus susceptibility gene <italic>CsLOB1</italic>. This study reports the regulation of the putative carbohydrate-binding protein gene <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> by PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1 during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection. We found that the transcription of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was induced by infection with <italic>Xcc</italic> in a PthA4-dependent manner. Even though it specifically bound to a putative TAL effector-binding element in the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter, PthA4 exerted a suppressive effect on the promoter activity. In contrast, CsLOB1 bound to the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter to activate its expression. The silencing of <italic>CsLOB1</italic> significantly reduced the level of expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>, which demonstrated that <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was directly regulated by CsLOB1. Intriguingly, PhtA4 interacted with CsLOB1 and exerted feedback control that suppressed the induction of expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> by CsLOB1. Transient overexpression and gene silencing revealed that <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was required for the optimal development of canker symptoms. These results support the hypothesis that the expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> is dynamically directed by PthA4 for canker formation through the PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Citrus canker is a severe bacterial disease that impacts the production of citrus because it affects most commercial cultivars of citrus in tropical and subtropical areas. The early symptoms on leaves, stems, and fruits are characterized by tiny, slightly raised blister-like lesions with water-soaked margins, which then develop into necrotic, raised lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brunings et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to the severe defoliation and premature fruit dehiscence that usually occur on heavily infected trees, the blemished fruits also have significantly reduced commercial value. The citrus canker is associated with five different bacterial pathotypes, including three pathotypes of <italic>Xanthomonas citri</italic> subsp. <italic>citri</italic> (<italic>Xcc</italic>) (A, A*, and A<sup>w</sup>) and two pathotypes of <italic>X. fuscans</italic> subsp. <italic>aurantifolii</italic> (B and C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gottwald et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sun et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>Xcc</italic> A-type canker is the most prevalent and affects a wide range of hosts, including <italic>Citrus</italic> spp. and many closely related rutaceous plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Graham et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Xcc</italic> PthA4 is a transcription activator-like (TAL) effector that is delivered into host plants by a type III secretion system (T3SS). The <italic>Xcc</italic> strains defective in the <italic>pthA4</italic> gene cannot <italic>pthA4</italic> alone induces weak canker phenotypes in citrus leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Duan et al., 2007</xref>). The heterologous expression of T3SS and <italic>pthA4</italic> homologous genes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> elicits similar canker symptoms in citrus but not in tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana benthianum</italic>), soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>), or cotton (<italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kanamori et al., 1998</xref>). Variants of the PthA4 effector are widely present across all five bacterial subspecies that cause citrus canker disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Swarup et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Al-Saadi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jalan et al., 2013</xref>). PthA4 acts as a major virulence determinant for the formation of cankers when translocated into the nuclei of its citrus host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yang et al., 1995</xref>). The superhelical structure of this TAL effector recognizes host sequences through its repeat-variable di-residue (RVD), which specifically recognizes the effector-binding element (EBE) in the gene promoter of host plants, and thus, activates the expression of host target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, PthA4 acts in a protein–protein interaction manner during infection with <italic>Xcc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Domingues et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to the proteins associated with DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Domingues et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">de Souza et al., 2012</xref>), PthA4 specifically interacts with citrus CsMAF1 and releases the suppressive effect on RNA Polymerase III to increase the transcription of tRNA and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Soprano et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, <italic>Xcc</italic> PthA4 functions through versatile mechanisms and modulates target genes not only at the transcriptional level but also at the protein level.</p>
<p>PthA4 activates the transcription of the <italic>CsLOB1</italic> susceptibility gene in host citrus plants owing to the TAL effector DNA-binding principles and specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Moscou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Boch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, gene editing of the coding region or promoter sequence of <italic>CsLOB1</italic> has been used to promote the resistance of citrus to infection with <italic>Xcc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Peng et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>CsLOB1</italic> belongs to the lateral organ boundary domain (LBD) gene family, which encodes a set of plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) that contain cysteine-rich DNA binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Husbands et al., 2007</xref>). Plant LBD genes are involved in the regulation of plant growth, as well as the production of anthocyanins and nitrogen metabolism, and also respond to both hormonal and environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Majer et al., 2010</xref>). There are as many as 36 LBD proteins in citrus plants. CsLOB2 and CsLOB3 show the same involvement in inducing the formation of pustules as CsLOB1 when they are induced by <italic>Xcc</italic>, which expresses an artificial TAL effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). In this case, many differentially expressed citrus genes have been identified, including those related to cell wall metabolism. However, the CsLOB2 and CsLOB3 promoters do not contain specific binding elements for PthA4; thus, neither can be induced by PthA4 during infection by <italic>Xcc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Since <italic>CsLOB1</italic> is a TF, elucidating its downstream target genes is particularly important to understand the molecular events associated with the development of pustule symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2014</xref>). PthA4 and CsLOB1 form a regulatory cascade that activate the citrus genes during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Duan et al., 2018</xref>). Our previous research showed that the ectopic expression of the TAL gene <italic>avrXa7</italic> in <italic>Xcc</italic> suppressed the development of cankers but induced a yellowing phenotype around the inoculation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, 138 upregulated citrus plant genes were identified to respond to wild-type (WT) <italic>Xcc</italic> infection but were relatively downregulated in leaves inoculated with <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 that expresses <italic>avrXa7.</italic> This study aimed to characterize the target genes of the citrus hosts that are directly regulated by the PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1 during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection, as well as its potential role in canker development.</p>

<title>The expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> depends on <italic>pthA4</italic> during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection</title>
<p>Our previous study on a transcriptome analysis reported that 138 genes were upregulated in citrus plants infected with the WT <italic>Xcc</italic> and downregulated in plants inoculated with <italic>Xcc</italic> that expressed <italic>avrXa7.</italic> Those genes were assumed to be related to the major <italic>Xcc</italic> virulence effector PthA4. PthA4 has 17.5 RVDs in its central domain that correspond to an EBE of 18 nucleotides of the target gene promoter. Based on the TAL effector-DNA binding code, PthA4 can bind an optimal EBE of the 19 bp oligonucleotide -TATAAACCCCCAATACCCT-, in which the first nucleotide “T” at 0 position is strictly conserved (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1— figure supplement 1</xref>). For each of the 138 genes, we downloaded and analyzed the 2000 bp DNA sequence upstream of the translation start site from the public citrus genome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.citrusgenomedb.org/">https://www.citrusgenomedb.org/</ext-link>).

<p>The transcript levels of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> and <italic>CsLOB1</italic> were studied to determine whether they were associated with PthA4. In view of the transcriptome analysis, their transcript levels were first studied in sweet orange (<italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>) plants inoculated with the WT <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 and <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 that expressed <italic>avrXa7</italic>. The inoculation of <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 that expressed <italic>avrXa7</italic> did not cause canker symptoms and displayed a yellow phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref>). In comparison with the uninoculated control, the level of expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was induced remarkably by inoculation with the WT <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 but not <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 that expressed <italic>avrXa7</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref>). Their transcript levels were then studied in <italic>C. sinensis</italic> plants inoculated with the <italic>pthA4</italic> Tn5 insertion mutant Mxac126-80, which was impaired in its ability to cause canker symptoms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref>). In comparison with the plants inoculated with the WT <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1, <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> and <italic>CsLOB1</italic> were downregulated in the plants infected with Mxac126-80 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref>). These findings demonstrated that <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was activated by <italic>Xcc</italic> infection in a PthA4-dependent manner.</p>

<p>A BLAST search was performed in the citrus genome database using the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> sequence.

<p>A sequence analysis of the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> and <italic>Cs9g12650</italic> promoter regions revealed that are 71% homologous. A prediction of the promoter in Softberry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml">http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml</ext-link>) identified the core structure region from the same location in both the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> and <italic>Cs9g12650</italic> promoters (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). It should be noted that the predicted PthA4 EBE was located in the promoter core structure. A sequence alignment indicated that the last 22 nucleotides at the 3’ terminus in <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter had been lost genetically in the <italic>Cs9g12650</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Fragments of 463 bp in the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter and 460 bp in the <italic>Cs9g12650</italic> promoter that composed the core structure were fused with a luciferase reporter. The transient overexpression of the promoter luciferase fusion indicated that the <italic>Cs9g12650</italic> promoter was unable to drive the expression of luciferase in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref>). This demonstrated that the <italic>Cs9g12650</italic> promoter region lacked promoter activity. To confirm the effect of 22 nucleotides on promoter activity, we subsequently created a <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter mutant with a deletion of 22 nucleotides at the 3’ terminus. The mutant completely lost its ability to drive the expression of luciferase, suggesting that the 22 nucleotides are essential for activity of the promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref>).</p>

<title>PthA4 suppresses <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter activity independent of the binding action</title>
<p>The PthA4-dependent induction of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection prompted us to determine whether it is directly regulated by PthA4. The 463 bp <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter was used in yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays. The EGY48 yeast co-transformed with pGBKT7-pthA4 and pG221 showed weak β-galactosidase activity, which demonstrated that PthA4 functions as a transcriptional activator. The co-transformation of pGBKT7-pthA4 and pG221-P<italic>Cs9g12620</italic> resulted in deep blue, suggesting that PthA4 binds the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter. The enhanced β-galactosidase activity was quantified by the Miller method (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3A</italic></xref>). In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), the application of 0.117, 0.469, 1.875, 7.5, 30 and 120 μg of GST-PthA4 proteins partially hindered the mobility of 25 ng <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter DNA. The application of 7.5, 30 and 120 μg GST-PthA4 proteins completely retarded the mobility of 25 ng promoter DNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref>).

<p>To examine whether the activity was affected by PthA4, the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter was cloned into the binary vector pCAMBIA1381 fused to a <italic>gusA</italic> reporter gene. Co-transformation with <italic>pthA4</italic> did not induce the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter activity.

For further verification, the levels of expression of <italic>gusA</italic> and <italic>pthA4</italic> were evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Compared with the expression of the promoter-GUS fusion alone or in combination with the empty vector pHB control, the transcript level of <italic>gusA</italic> was reduced when the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter-GUS fusion was co-transformed with <italic>pthA4</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>In the EMSA analysis that utilized a synthetic PthA4 EBE (-TCCCACTTTAATATATAAA-) as a probe, 6, 12 and 24 μg of GST-PthA4 protein partially hindered the mobility of oligonucleotide (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref>).

<p>PthA4 exerted a role in suppressing the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter independently of its binding to EBE, which led us to determine whether PthA4 could physically interact with CsLOB1.

<p>The contribution of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> to canker development was subsequently examined by citrus tristeza virus (CTV)-induced gene silencing in <italic>C. sinensis</italic> plants. The efficiency of gene silencing was evaluated in one-month-old leaves at 60 days post-stem inoculation. The infection by CTV was indicated by verification of the transcripts of CTV <italic>P23</italic> gene. The transcript level of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was then verified to be reduced by approximately 70% in the gene-silenced <italic>C. sinensis</italic> plants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7C</italic></xref>). Inoculation of the WT <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 caused remarkably attenuated canker symptoms in the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants. In comparison with the control plants that were infected with empty CTV, there were remarkably fewer symptoms on the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7D</italic></xref>). The <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 in the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants grew more slowly than in the control plants. Significantly fewer cell numbers were isolated from the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants than from the control plants at 2, 4, and 6 days post-inoculation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7E</italic></xref>). The expression levels of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> and <italic>CsLOB1</italic> genes in <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants inoculated with <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 showed that the induced transcription levels of both were decreased, and the expression levels of <italic>pthA4</italic> were also significantly decreased, down-regulated by 38%, 15% and 16%, respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7F</italic></xref>).

On <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants, wildtype 049 and 049E/<italic>pthA4</italic> caused greatly reduced canker symptom, while the 049E/<italic>pthA4</italic> caused weak canker symptom alike to TAL-free mutant 049E (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7G</italic></xref>). Furthermore, the population of 049 and 049E/<italic>pthA4</italic> recovered from <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants was lower than that in control plants.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ectopic expression of <italic>avrXa7</italic> in <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 did not induce canker symptoms on citrus plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), which was consistent with a previous study that reported that the browning phenotype was elicited by an <italic>Xcc</italic> L2 strain that expressed <italic>avrXa7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ishihara et al., 2003</xref>). This was hypothesized to be caused by two groups of differentially expressed genes, including (i) resistance genes induced by AvrXa7, and (ii) susceptibility genes induced by PthA4 but suppressed by the expression of AvrXa7. A transcriptome analysis was utilized to identify the different relevant citrus genes and showed that AvrXa7 specifically activated the aspartic protease gene <italic>Cs7g06780.1</italic> and linoleate 13S-lipoxygenase gene <italic>orange1.1t03773.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we focused on identification of the genes induced by PthA4 for canker formation. Based on the pattern of expression and analysis of promoter activity, Cs9g12620 was proven to be dynamically regulated by the PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1 for the development of canker symptoms. This supported the hypothesis that the PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1 serves a critical role in the complicated regulatory network on gene expression during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection.</p>
<p>The original purpose of this study was to explore the genes that were directly targeted by PthA4 through TAL effector-DNA recognition. Based on a sequence analysis, the two genes <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> and <italic>CsLOB1</italic> were predicted to contain PthA4 EBEs. An analysis of the pattern of expression revealed that <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> and <italic>CsLOB1</italic> were induced by <italic>Xcc</italic> infection in a PthA4-dependent manner. Because the susceptibility gene <italic>CsLOB1</italic> has already been proven to be targeted by <italic>Xcc</italic> PthA4, the binding and regulatory role of PthA4 on the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter was assayed experimentally. Y1H, EMSA, and promoter reporter fusion analyses were used and enabled the conclusion that PthA4 bound to the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter, whereas it suppressed the promoter activity. Since two CsLOB1 putative binding sites were predicted from the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter, we demonstrated that CsLOB1 bound directly to the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter. Most importantly, CsLOB1 could activate the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter. As such, <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> is actually a target of <italic>CsLOB1</italic>.</p>
<p>The ectopic expression of <italic>CsLOB1</italic> restores the mutant canker symptoms of <italic>Xcc pthA4</italic>, which demonstrates that <italic>CsLOB1</italic> is the key target of PthA4 and thus, induces pustule symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Duan et al., 2018</xref>). The transient overexpression of CsLOB1 did not induce an obvious phenotype in the citrus plant leaves, which was consistent with the findings of previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, the contribution of CsLOB1 to canker symptoms has been verified by the transformation of ‘Duncan’ grapefruit (<italic>Citrus</italic> x <italic>paradisi</italic>) plants with a 35S:CsLOB1-glucocorticoid receptor construct, which suggested that the continuous expression of CsLOB1 is essential for the development of canker symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Duan et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Duan <italic>et al</italic>. (2018)</xref> reported that a number of citrus genes appear to be associated with <italic>CsLOB1</italic>, but only the <italic>Cs2g20600</italic> promoter probe interacted with CsLOB1. <italic>Cs2g20600</italic> encodes a zinc finger C3HC4-type RING finger protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Duan et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we found that <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was another target that is directly regulated by CsLOB1. The regulatory role of <italic>CsLOB1</italic> includes promoting host cell proliferation, regulating citrus cell wall remodeling, and affecting hormone signaling pathways, which is accompanied by the optimal growth of <italic>Xcc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zou et al., 2021</xref>). Although it has been reported to specifically bind to -CGGC-in its target promoter region, CsLOB1 retained the ability to bind the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter DNA when the two specific binding sites LB1 and LB2 were deleted. We hypothesized that there are other putative binding sites of CsLOB1 in the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter, and multiple citrus genes are directly targeted by CsLOB1 for the development of cankers during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection.</p>
<p>PthA4 acts as a sole disease TAL required by <italic>Xcc</italic> to cause symptoms of canker on citrus plants. It localizes to the nuclei following secretion into host cell by the type III secretion system. A transient overexpression analysis showed that PthA4 exhibited a particular suppressive effect on the CsLOB1-activated <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter activity. Since the PthA4 binding site is critical for activity of the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter, the binding of PthA4 suppressed the promoter activity. This prompted us to study whether PthA4 affects CsLOB1 alternatively. Y2H and pull-down assays showed that PthA4 interacted with CsLOB1 at the protein-protein level. This provided a new insight to study the dynamical regulatory role of PthA4 during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection since we found that PthA4 affects the expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> in a dose-dependent manner. When PthA4 was expressed at a high level at 10 dpi, the level of expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was surprisingly lower. This suggested that there is a precise mechanism of the PthA4-CsLOB1-<italic>Cs9g12620</italic> regulatory cascade during infection with <italic>Xcc</italic>.</p>
<p>Although the amino acid sequence of Cs9g12650 was 86.3% homologous with that of Cs9g12620, they differed in their promoter sequences. The promoter of <italic>Cs9g12650</italic> lacks 22 bp of nucleotides at its 3’ terminus, which are critical for the activity of its promoter. The activity of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter was completely lost if the 22 bp sequence was deleted by mutation. Therefore, <italic>Cs9g12650</italic> is not transcribed in citrus plants. This supported the hypothesis that the null activity of <italic>Cs9g12650</italic> promoter was owing to genetic diversity in citrus plants, which leads to different patterns of expression between the two paralogs in citrus. The 22 bp sequence at the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter could be a potential site for gene editing to create citrus plants that are resistant to citrus canker. A similar regulation of expression has been found in <italic>CsLOB1</italic>; CsLOB2 and CsLOB3 show the same ability to induce pustule formation as CsLOB1, but their promoters do not contain the PthA4 EBE; therefore, neither can be induced by PthA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The Cs9g12620 protein contains three distinctive conserved domains, including a signal peptide, a duplicated DUF642 region, and a bacterial exosortase protein domain. The duplicated DUF642 region has been shown to be a carbohydrate-binding domain. The exosortase system is involved in directing transport across the plasma membrane, with additional posttranslational modifications, such as glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Haft et al., 2012</xref>). This system is distributed across many biofilm-producing environmental bacteria and is closely related to the <italic>N</italic>-acyl amino acid synthases in Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Craig et al., 2011</xref>). It was hypothesized that Cs9g12620 could possibly be involved in the transportation of carbohydrates in citrus cells. This was similar to the SWEET genes induced by the effectors that pathogenic bacteria secrete into plants, and they export intracellular sugar into the extracellular space, which can be utilized by pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). The binding of carbohydrates and the exact role for canker formation merits further study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the putative carbohydrate-binding protein gene <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was identified as a target of CsLOB1, which was directly regulated by PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1. In addition to the enhanced pattern of expression in response to <italic>Xcc</italic> infection, <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was dynamically feedback regulated by PthA4 in a dose-dependent manner. At the early infection stage, the presence of PthA4 is responsible for the induction of CsLOB1, which is necessary for the activation of Cs9g12620. At the late infection stage, the over-redundancy of PthA4 exerts a feedback suppression effect on the activation of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> by CsLOB1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref>). The findings provide strong evidence to understand the molecular complexity of PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1 during the development of citrus canker.</p>

Site-directed mutation of the first nucleotide “T” in EBE of PthA4 or deletion of CsLOB1 binding sites LB1 and LB2 were created by overlapping PCR using the primers listed in Supplementary file 1b. The promoter mutants M<sub>A</sub>, M<sub>C</sub>, M<sub>G</sub>, M<sub>LB1</sub>, M<sub>LB2</sub>, and M<sub>LB1/2</sub> that were generated were fused with luciferase (LUC) in pGWB435. The activities of LUC were assayed after transient overexpression in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. For each assay at 2 dpi, the inoculated leaves were treated with 0.5 mM luciferin, kept in the dark for 1 min to quench the fluorescence, and then used to capture luciferase luminescence images by a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging apparatus (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ, USA). Each experiment had three replicates.</p>

<p>The binding of both PthA4 and CsLOB1 to the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter DNA (including M<sub>LB1</sub>, M<sub>LB2</sub>, and M<sub>LB1/2</sub>) was detected by an Cy5-labeled probe electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). The binding of PthA4 to the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter DNA (M<sub>A</sub>, M<sub>C</sub>, and M<sub>G</sub>) was visualized by ethidium bromide staining as part of EMSA. The GST-pthA4 and GST-CsLOB1 constructs were created by separately inserting the <italic>pthA4</italic> and <italic>CsLOB1</italic> genes into the pET41a(+) vector (Supplementary file 1a). GST-PthA4, GST-CsLOB1, and GST tag were expressed separately in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) by induction with 1.0 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The purified GST-PthA4, GST-CsLOB1, and GST tag were subjected to ethidium bromide staining with concentration gradients by a two-fold dilution. The proteins were incubated with 25 ng of promoter DNA in gel shift binding buffer (50 ng/μL Poly (dI•dC), 0.05 M Tris-HCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, 0.15 M KCl, and 1.0 mM dithiothreitol). The GST-PthA4 protein, GST-CsLOB1 protein, and GST tag were diluted into series that consisted of 0.117, 0.469, 1.875, 7.5, 30, and 120 µg; 0.234, 0.938, 3.75, 7.5, 15, and 60 µg; and 1.953, 7.813, 3.75, and 15.625 µg; respectively. After incubation at 28°C for 30 min, the mixtures were subjected to a DNA mobility analysis by electrophoresis in a 6% non-denaturing acrylamide gel. The DNA bands were visualized by fluorescence imaging using a Typhoon Trio Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Analyses of the binding to promoter mutants M<sub>A</sub>, M<sub>C</sub>, and M<sub>G</sub> were conducted with the same strategy but using different GST-PthA4 protein series.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study provides new insight into potential subtle dynamics in effector biology. The data presented generally support the claims, but in some cases, significant controls are missing and so the overall work is currently <bold>incomplete</bold>. If the limitations can be addressed, this work should be of broad relevance for biologists interested in molecular plant-microbe interactions.</p>

<p>Previous Review:</p>
<p>The authors have identified the predicted EBE of PthA4 in the promoter of Cs9g12620, which is induced by Xcc. The authors identified a homolog of Cs9g12620, which has variations in the promoter region. The authors show PthA4 suppresses Cs9g12620 promoter activity independent of the binding action. The authors also show that CsLOB1 binds to the promoter of Cs9g12620. Interestingly, the authors show that PthA4 interacts with CsLOB1 at protein level. Finally, it shows that Cs9g12620 is important for canker symptoms. Overall, this study has reported some interesting discoveries and the writing is generally well done. However, the discoveries are affected by the reliability of the data and some flaws of the experimental designs.</p>
<p>Here are some major issues:</p>
<p>The authors have demonstrated that Cs9g12620 contains the EBE of PthA4 in the promoter region, to show that PthA4 controls Cs9g12620, the authors need to compare to the wild type Xcc and pthA4 mutant for Cs9g12620 expression. The data in Figure 1 is not enough.</p>
<p>The authors confirmed the interaction between PthA4 and the EBE in the promoter of Cs9g12620 using DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). However, Fig. 2B is not convincing. The lane without GST-PthA4 also clearly showed mobility shift. For EMSA assay, the authors need also to include non-labeled probe as competitor to verify the specificity. The description of the EMSA in this paper suggests that it was not done properly. It is suggested the authors to redo this EMSA assay following the protocol: Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) for detecting protein-nucleic acid interactions PMID: 17703195.</p>
<p>The authors also claimed that PthA4 suppresses the promote activity of Cs9g12620. The data is not convincing and also contradicts with their own data that overexpression of Cs9g12620 causes canker and silencing of it reduces canker considering PthA4 is required for canker development. The authors conducted the assays using transient expression of PthA4. It should be done with Xcc wild type, pthA4 mutant and negative control to inoculate citrus plants to check the expression of Cs9g12620.</p>
<p>Fig. 6 AB is not convincing. There are no apparent differences. The variations shown in B is common in different wild type samples. It is suggested that the authors to conduct transgenic instead of transient overexpression.</p>
<p>Gene silencing data needs more appropriate controls. Fig. D. seems to suggest canker symptoms actually happen for the RNAi treated. The authors need to make sure same amount of Xcc was used for both CTV empty vector and the RNAi. It is suggested a blink test is needed here.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>Point 1: Addressed well.</p>
<p>Point 2: The EMSA was reconducted with adding unlabeled DNA, however, the results are still not convincing. Firstly, in fig.3D lane 5, with the absence of unlabeled DNA, the shifted bound signal wasn't reduced significantly. Secondly, still in fig.3D lane 5, the free labeled DNA probe at the bottom of the gel didn't increase. Which together mean that the unlabeled DNA was unable to compete with the labeled DNA and the &quot;bound&quot; shifted bands might not be true positive.</p>
<p>Point 3: The authors didn't address the question clearly regarding the connection between the inhibition of Cs9g12620 promoter by PthA4 and the positive function of Cs9g12620 on citrus canker.</p>
<p>Point 4: The comment was not addressed. Fig.7A and B are not convincing. Firstly, no evidence shows the expression of transiently expressed genes. Secondly, hard to tell the difference in 7A. Thirdly, since CsLOB1 positively regulates Cs9g12620, why expressing of CsLOB1 is unable to cause phenotype, while expression of PthA4 does?</p>
<p>Point 5: addressed.</p>

<p>The data in Figure 1 D and E show a pthA4 Tn5 insertion mutant Mxac126-80 and the expression level of Cs9g12620 in citrus inoculated with the pthA4 mutant.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your comments. We have re-conducted the EMSA analysis based on your suggestion. The DNA probe was labeled with Cy5, included a non-labeled probe as a competitor. (Figure 3 B and D; Figure 4B and E)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>We have detected Cs9g12620 expression in silencing citrus plants inoculated wild type Xcc 29-1. (Figure 7F)</p>

<p>Point 4: Figure 6 AB is not convincing. There are no apparent differences. The variations shown in B are common in different wild-type samples. It is suggested that the authors conduct transgenic instead of transient overexpression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It has been proven that transient expression of PthA4 leads to canker-like phenotype, suggesting that this experiment is effective. However, it will be more confident if conduct transgenic plant overexpressing pthA4 and Cs9g12620. We’ll create the plants in our following research to confirm the phenotype.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 5: Gene silencing data needs more appropriate controls. Figure D seems to suggest canker symptoms actually happen for the RNAi treated. The authors need to make sure the same amount of Xcc was used for both CTV empty vector and the RNAi. It is suggested a blink test is needed here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used the same amount of Xcc to inoculate CTV empty vector and the RNAi. In either inoculation, the cultured Xcc cells were suspended in sterile distilled water to a final concentration of 108 CFU/mL (OD600 = 0.3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 6: Figure 1. Please draw a figure to clearly show the location of the EBE in the promoter of Cs9g12620, including the transcription start site, and translational start site.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The EBE in Cs9g12620 promoter was indicated by underlined in Figure supplement 1. We did not sure about the translation start site, but the translation start site was labelled.</p>
