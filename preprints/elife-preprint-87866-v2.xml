<title>Abstract</title><p>Mapping the connectivity of diverse neuronal types provides the foundation for understanding the structure and function of neural circuits. High-throughput and low-cost neuroanatomical techniques based on RNA barcode sequencing have the potential to map circuits at cellular resolution and a brain-wide scale, but existing Sindbis virus-based techniques can only map long-range projections using anterograde tracing approaches. Rabies virus can complement anterograde tracing approaches by enabling either retrograde labeling of projection neurons or monosynaptic tracing of direct inputs to genetically targeted postsynaptic neurons. However, barcoded rabies virus has so far been only used to map non-neuronal cellular interactions <italic>in vivo</italic> and synaptic connectivity of cultured neurons. Here we combine barcoded rabies virus with single-cell and <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing to perform retrograde labeling and transsynaptic labeling in the mouse brain. We sequenced 96 retrogradely labeled cells and 295 transsynaptically labeled cells using single-cell RNA-seq, and 4,130 retrogradely labeled cells and 2,914 transsynaptically labeled cells <italic>in situ</italic>. We found that the transcriptomic identities of rabies virus-infected cells can be robustly identified using both single-cell RNA-seq and <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing. By associating gene expression with connectivity inferred from barcode sequencing, we distinguished long-range projecting cortical cell types from multiple cortical areas and identified cell types with converging or diverging synaptic connectivity. Combining <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing with barcoded rabies virus complements existing sequencing-based neuroanatomical techniques and provides a potential path for mapping synaptic connectivity of neuronal types at scale.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The connectivity of diverse types of neurons constrains the flow and processing of information in neural circuits. Neuroanatomical techniques based on microscopy rely on sparse labeling combined with optical tracing to achieve single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Winnubst et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Peng et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gao et al. 2022</xref>). However, these approaches are usually labor-intensive and difficult to scale up. Furthermore, because many of these approaches rely on specialized imaging platforms, they are difficult to combine with transcriptomic interrogation for defining cell types. Thus, developing high-throughput neuroanatomical techniques that can map neuronal connectivity and associate connectivity with gene expression at single-cell resolution could help generate new insights into the organization of neural circuits that are difficult to gain using conventional neuroanatomical techniques.</p>
<p>RNA barcoding-based neuroanatomical techniques are a new approach that dramatically improves the throughput of single-neuron projection mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kebschull et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sun et al. 2021</xref>). In these techniques, Sindbis virus is used to express random RNA sequences, or RNA “barcodes,” to uniquely label each neuron. The barcoded virus RNAs replicate and distribute throughout the somata and axons; therefore, matching barcodes in the axons to those in the somata reveal the axonal projections of individual neurons. Because many barcode molecules can be sequenced in parallel, barcoding-based neuroanatomical approaches can determine the long-range projections of tens of thousands of neurons in single animals. These barcoding-based techniques have been applied to various brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kebschull et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Han et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gergues et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Klingler et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mathis et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Munoz-Castaneda et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sun et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al. 2022</xref>) and have validated and extended findings by previous studies using imaging-based tracing techniques.</p>
<p>Despite the transformative power of barcoding-based neuroanatomical techniques, the Sindbis virus-based approaches can only reveal information about the axons (i.e., projection mapping) of labeled neurons with cell bodies at the injection sites, because these vectors do not spread between cells. These approaches thus cannot obtain information about the neurons’ synaptic partners. A potentially powerful extension of this approach that could allow mapping of connections, instead of just projections, would be to use rabies virus. Rabies virus naturally spreads between synaptically-connected neurons in the retrograde direction. In particular, the use of deletion-mutant rabies viruses (e.g., “ΔG” viruses, with their glycoprotein gene G deleted) to perform transsynaptic labeling has become common in neuroscience, as it allows “monosynaptic tracing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wickersham et al. 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wall et al. 2010</xref>), or the viral labeling of neurons directly presynaptic to a targeted starting population of neurons.</p>
<p>In the standard monosynaptic tracing paradigm, a targeted starting population of neurons is first transduced by “helper” adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), causing them to express the rabies virus gene G (to complement the G-deleted recombinant rabies) and an avian cell surface protein, TVA. TVA is the receptor for an avian retrovirus (avian sarcoma and leukosis virus subgroup A, or ASLV-A) that is unable to infect mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Young et al. 1993</xref>). Subsequently, a ΔG rabies virus that is packaged with the ASLV-A envelope protein (EnvA) is injected at the same location to selectively infect the TVA- expressing cells. Due to the expression of the rabies viral gene G <italic>in trans</italic>, the ΔG rabies virus replicates and spreads from these “source cells” to neurons directly presynaptic to them. In a second approach, ΔG rabies virus that is packaged with its own glycoprotein can be used to retrogradely label neurons with projections to a target area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wickersham et al. 2007a</xref>). This approach, in contrast to the monosynaptic tracing paradigm, reveals only the axonal projections of neurons, but not their synaptic connectivity.</p>
<p>RNA barcoding can be combined with both rabies virus-based tracing approaches to drastically improve the throughput at which projections or connectivity can be interrogated at cellular resolution. Retrograde labeling from multiple locations using several preparations of glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus (RVΔG), each carrying different barcodes, would allow multiplexed retrograde tracing, i.e., the association of neurons with their projections to many different injection sites within single brains (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). This approach is conceptually similar to that used in a recent study in which barcoded AAV was used to perform multiplexed retrograde labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhao et al. 2022</xref>), but rabies virus potentially has different tropism that can broaden the use of barcoded retrograde labeling approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chatterjee et al. 2018</xref>). Multiplexed retrograde tracing approaches complement anterograde tracing techniques: Because only neurons that are labeled at the injection sites are mapped in anterograde tracing, it is difficult to precisely estimate how the density of projection neurons varies across large brain regions; in contrast, retrograde labeling approaches label neurons with projections to the injection site regardless of which brain region they are in. As anatomical borders between brain areas (e.g. cortical areas) usually correspond to distinct changes in cytoarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brodmann 1909</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Vogt and Vogt 1919</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Von Bonin 1947</xref>) and transcriptomically defined neuronal types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. 2023</xref>), retrograde labeling is particularly valuable for understanding how long-range connectivity is associated with cell types and anatomical boundaries.</p>

<caption><title>Models of multiplexed retrograde labeling and monosynaptic tracing using barcoded rabies virus</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) In multiplexed retrograde labeling, rabies viruses carrying different barcodes are injected into different brain regions, and retrogradely labeled neurons can be distinguished based on the barcodes they carry. Numbers and colors indicate different barcodes injected into each area. (<bold>B</bold>) In multiplexed monosynaptic tracing, potential source cells are first labeled by helper AAV viruses expressing TVA and rabies glycoprotein (yellow cells, <italic>left</italic>). These cells can be infected by barcoded rabies virus (barcodes are indicated by numbers, <italic>middle</italic>). These source cells can then pass the barcodes to presynaptic neurons (numbered gray cells, <italic>right</italic>). Both rabies barcodes and endogenous mRNAs can be read out to infer cell type connectivity. However, if multiple source cells share the same barcode, they may obscure single-cell connectivity mapping and must be filtered out (crossed out cells, <italic>right</italic>).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Alternatively, combining the transsynaptic labeling approach with RNA barcoding could allow sequencing-based readouts of synaptically-connected networks of neurons, providing information about the synaptic partners of neurons, rather than only their patterns of axonal projections. Specifically, simply using the standard monosynaptic tracing system but using a barcoded pool of ΔG rabies virus could allow mapping of synaptic connectivity between many cells at cellular resolution (multiplexed transsynaptic labeling; <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). Although other techniques, such as electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bae et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Androvic et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zheng et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schneider-Mizell et al. 2023</xref>) and multi-patch experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Campagnola et al. 2022</xref>), can also read out synaptic connectivity, these approaches are difficult to scale up to many neurons across large areas of the brain. Thus, achieving barcoded transsynaptic tracing using rabies virus could potentially transform the scale at which synaptic connectivity of transcriptomic types of neurons can be interrogated at cellular resolution.</p>
<p>Using barcoded rabies virus-based approaches to associate connectivity or projections of neurons with their gene expression requires overcoming several technical and conceptual challenges. First, rabies virus alters the gene expression of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Patino et al. 2022</xref>), which may obscure the transcriptomic signatures of neurons. It is unclear how changes in gene expression affect the ability to distinguish fine-grained transcriptomic types and whether cell typing is still possible using spatial transcriptomic approaches, such as <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing, that interrogate a targeted panel of genes. Second, conventional single-cell sequencing is costly and labor intensive. Thus, sequencing throughput will likely limit the multiplexing advantages associated with barcoding strategies. Third, in a barcoded transsynaptic labeling experiment, synaptic connectivity between individual source cells and their presynaptic partners can only be inferred from networks of barcode-sharing neurons with a single source cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). A barcode, however, may be found in multiple or no source cells, which would prohibit connectivity mapping at the single-neuron level. Finally, accurately assessing the distribution of barcodes in a transsynaptic labeling experiment requires sampling most barcodes and/or source cells in an experiment. This is difficult to achieve using single-cell sequencing approaches that require tissue dissociation, because loss of cells during dissociation is inevitable. These challenges are fundamental barriers for using barcoded transsynaptic labeling to infer synaptic connectivity at cellular resolution regardless of the choice of virus. Solving these problems will not only allow barcoded rabies virus-based connectivity mapping, but also provide a foundation for potential future techniques based on a wide range of transsynaptic viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ugolini et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Xiong et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fischer et al. 2023</xref>), pseudorabies virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Martin and Dolivo 1983</xref>), vesicular stomatitis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beier et al. 2013</xref>), and yellow fever virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al. 2021</xref>). Because <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ke et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. 2023</xref>) can read out both endogenous mRNAs and random RNA barcodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sun et al. 2021</xref>) with high throughput and low cost and does not rely on tissue dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sun et al. 2021</xref>), it is uniquely suited to overcome the challenges associated with barcoded rabies tracing.</p>
<p>Here we adapt single-cell RNA-seq and an <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing approach based on Barcoded Anatomy Resolved by Sequencing (BARseq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sun et al. 2021</xref>) to map connectivity of transcriptomic types of neurons using barcoded rabies-based retrograde labeling and transsynaptic labeling. We examine the effect of rabies virus infection on the gene expression and clearly identify transcriptomic identities of rabies-labeled neurons. We then explore conceptually how connectivity can be inferred from rabies barcodes in a trans-synaptic labeling experiment. Finally, we perform scRNA-seq and <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing on neurons that are transsynaptically labeled by rabies virus to identify pairs of cell types that show preferences to synapse onto the same post-synaptic neurons.</p>

<title>Identifying transcriptomic types of retrogradely labeled neurons by barcoded rabies virus</title>
<p>To assess whether we can robustly identify transcriptomically defined neuronal types in a multiplexed retrograde labeling experiment, we performed two-plex retrograde labeling using two libraries of barcoded rabies virus coated with the native rabies glycoprotein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>; <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4d">Methods M4</xref></bold>). In addition to encoding the red fluorescent protein mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shaner et al. 2004</xref>), the two viral libraries contained 20-nt barcode cassettes located in the 3’UTR of the rabies nucleoprotein mRNA, which allowed high-level expression of the barcodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Conzelmann 1998</xref>). In addition, one of the libraries contained a 22-nt exogenous sequence (the 10x Genomics “Chromium capture sequence 2”, referred to below as CCS) next to the barcode cassette. We sequenced the two barcoded libraries using Illumina next-generation sequencing and identified at least 8,552 and 13,211 barcodes, respectively (see <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4h">Methods M8</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4i">Methods M9</xref></bold>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We did not find barcodes that were present in both libraries. Thus, the two libraries could be distinguished both by their barcode sequences and the presence or absence of the CCS.</p>

<p>We injected the two libraries into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGd) and anterolateral visual cortex (VISal), respectively, in two animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). After 7 days, we dissected out the primary visual cortex (VISp), dissociated the neurons, and FACS-isolated 48 mCherry-expressing neurons from each animal for scRNA-seq using SMART-seq v4 (see <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4f">Methods M6</xref></bold>). scRNA-seq data from rabies virus-infected cells had comparable quality to non-infected cells (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. S1A</xref></bold>). Of 96 mCherry-expressing cells sequenced, 75 neurons were of high quality (with &gt; 100,000 total reads, &gt; 1,000 detected genes, and odds ratios of GC dinucleotides &lt;0.5; see <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4g">Methods M7</xref></bold> for details).</p>
<p>We then mapped each neuron to reference scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tasic et al. 2018</xref>) by comparing a cell’s marker gene expression with the marker gene expression of the reference cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gouwens et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Graybuck et al. 2021</xref>) (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4g">Methods M7</xref></bold>). Briefly, we first selected marker genes that distinguished each cluster in the reference taxonomy tree, and then performed 100 rounds of correlation analysis between a given single cell transcriptome to be mapped and the reference taxonomy tree using 80% of the marker panel selected at random in each round. Cells that were assigned to the same cluster in ≥ 70 of 100 rounds (mapping confidence &gt;0.7) and with a mapping correlation &gt;0.6 were considered to be mapped to the cluster with high quality. A total of 54 cells were mapped to the reference taxonomy tree with high quality [mapping confidence &gt; 0.7 (5 cells removed) and mapping correlation &gt; 0.6 (an additional 16 cells removed); <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. S1B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4g">Methods M7</xref></bold>]; these cells were used for downstream analysis. Most cells that were removed by the mapping correlation thresholds were either “Microglia Siglech” or “PVM Mrc1,” which tend to have lower gene counts compared to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tasic et al. 2018</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Prosniak et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhao et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huang and Sabatini 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Patino et al. 2022</xref>), some immune response-related genes were up-regulated in rabies virus-infected cells compared to non-infected cells (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. S2A, B</xref></bold>). We also noticed that some inhibitory cell types showed higher expression of activity-related genes, such as <italic>Baz1</italic>, <italic>Fosl2</italic>, and <italic>Jun</italic> compared to non-infected cells (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. S3</xref></bold>). Nonetheless, the expression patterns of cell type markers were comparable to the reference scRNA-seq dataset (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E, F</xref>). Thus, transcriptomic types of rabies infected neurons can be robustly read out using scRNA-seq.</p>

<p>Rabies transcripts were detected in all FACS-collected cells, including the 54 mapped cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Consistent with their known expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Conzelmann 1998</xref>), transcripts for the rabies nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, and matrix proteins were more abundant than the transcripts for mCherry (which replaced the rabies glycoprotein) and the large protein. Consistent with the robust detection of rabies transcripts, 50 out of 54 neurons had sequencing reads covering the barcode region of the nucleoprotein transcript (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>; <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Among the 50 neurons, 48 neurons carried only one barcode each, and two cells shared the 49<sup>th</sup> barcode. Of these 49 barcodes, 18 had the CCS sequence at the 3’ flanking region. The barcode sequences were consistent with known barcodes in the corresponding barcode libraries: all 18 CCS-containing barcodes matched known barcodes in the CCS library and all 31 barcodes that did not contain a CCS sequence matched known barcodes in the non-CCS library. In the cortex, L6 corticothalamic (CT) neurons and L5 extra-telencephalic neurons (L5 ET, also known as L5 pyramidal tract/PT neurons) mainly project to the thalamus, but not the cortex, whereas intra-telencephalic (IT) neurons mainly project to the cortex and the striatum, but not the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Harris and Shepherd 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harris et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Peng et al. 2021</xref>). Consistent with the known connectivity of cortical cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Harris and Shepherd 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tasic et al. 2018</xref>), 14 L6 CT neurons, 3 L6b neurons, and 1 L5 ET neurons projected to the LGd, and not VISal; in contrast, 24 IT neurons and 1 near-projecting (NP) neuron projected to VISal, but not LGd (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). We also observed a small number of inhibitory neurons labeled by the VISal injection, but not the LGd injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). This labeling was expected, because inhibitory neurons at the border of VISp and VISal could potentially be labeled by the VISal injection and subsequently dissected for single-cell RNA-seq. Based on these results, we estimate that the false positive rate in distinguishing the transcriptomic types of retrogradely labeled neurons is between 0 – 3.1 % (see <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4m">Methods M13</xref></bold>). Thus, multiplexed retrograde tracing using barcoded rabies virus recapitulated known projection patterns of cortical neuronal types.</p>

<title><italic>In situ</italic> sequencing identifies transcriptomic types of rabies-barcoded neurons</title>
<p>scRNA-seq provides a detailed view of the transcriptomic landscape of rabies-labeled neurons, but this approach has several limitations. First, a large fraction of neurons is lost during single-cell dissociation prior to sequencing. Because neuronal types differ in their survival rates during dissociation, this procedure introduces biases in the composition of neurons that are sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tasic et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tasic et al. 2018</xref>). Second, a consequence of tissue dissociation is that the precise locations of neurons are lost, which can obscure potential spatial organization of neuronal connectivity. Finally, the low throughput and high cost of scRNA-seq limit the scale at which the retrogradely labeled neurons can be interrogated. To overcome these limitations, we next used <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing to resolve both gene expression and rabies barcodes in retrogradely labeled neurons.</p>
<p>Our <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing approach is based on BARseq, a high-throughput technique that can determine both long-range projections of neurons and their gene expression by <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing of both endogenous gene expression and mRNA barcodes encoded in the genome of Sindbis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sun et al. 2021</xref>). We have previously shown that BARseq-style <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing can distinguish transcriptomic types of cortical neurons with high transcriptomic resolution in non-infected mouse brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. 2023</xref>). To adapt BARseq to rabies barcodes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), we used primers that were complementary to the region that was 3’ to the barcodes on the genomic strand to reverse-transcribe the rabies barcode. In addition to the primers for the rabies barcodes, we also used random 20-mers to reverse transcribe the endogenous mRNAs. After reverse transcription <italic>in situ</italic>, we used padlock probes to target both the flanking regions of the barcodes and 104 marker genes (<bold><underline>Table S3</underline></bold>), which we previously used to distinguish cortical excitatory neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. 2023</xref>). We then gap-filled the barcode-targeting padlock probes, ligated all padlock probes, and performed rolling circle amplification as in standard BARseq experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sun et al. 2021</xref>). We performed seven rounds of Illumina sequencing <italic>in situ</italic> to read out 101 cell type marker genes, one round of hybridization to detect three high-level cell type markers (<italic>Slc17a7</italic>, <italic>Gad1</italic>, and <italic>Slc30a3</italic>), and 15 rounds of sequencing <italic>in situ</italic> to read out the rabies barcodes. We segmented the cells using Cellpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Stringer et al. 2020</xref>) and decoded gene rolonies using BarDensr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al. 2019</xref>) to obtain single-cell gene expression, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. 2023</xref>). To basecall barcode rolonies, we picked peaks in the first round of barcode sequencing images using both an intensity threshold and a prominence threshold. We then determined the pixel values in all four sequencing channels across all cycles to readout barcode sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al. 2019</xref>), and assigned barcode rolonies to segmented cells.

</fig>
<p>We next applied this approach to examine the distribution of neurons with projections to VISal and the retrosplenial cortex (RSP), two cortical areas within the ventral and dorsal stream of the visual pathways, respectively. We used the same two libraries of ΔG rabies virus that were coated with the rabies virus glycoprotein as in the scRNA-seq based experiment. We injected the library that contained CCS into VISal, and the non-CCS-containing library into RSP; the injection into RSP also infected a portion of the superior colliculus (SC) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). After 7 days, we sacrificed the animals and cryo-sectioned the brains into 20 µm-coronal sections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). We sequenced 791,966 segmented cells on eight coronal sections from two animals, and 524,952 cells had sufficient mRNA reads (at least 20 reads per cell and at least 5 genes per cell) to pass quality control (QC). We performed <italic>de novo</italic> clustering on QC-filtered cells (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4l">Methods M12</xref></bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. 2023</xref>) and identified 35 subclasses of neurons, including 20 subclasses of excitatory neurons. We further clustered the 20 excitatory subclasses into 116 types (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, E</xref>). We then mapped the subclasses from our dataset to subclasses in reference scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tasic et al. 2018</xref>) using SingleR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aran et al. 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Consistent with previous BARseq results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. 2023</xref>), the BARseq subclasses had one-to-one correspondence to subclasses of cortical excitatory neurons found in scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Economo et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tasic et al. 2018</xref>). Thus, <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing resolved cortical excitatory neurons at high transcriptomic resolution.</p>
<p>To assign barcodes to cells, we considered a barcode to be associated with a cell if we found at least six molecules of that barcode in a cell (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4m">Methods M13</xref></bold>). Of 4,130 barcoded cells we identified, all but 204 (4.9%) cells contained a single barcode that was above this threshold (&gt;6 counts per cell) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G, H</xref>). In most cells, the primary barcode, i.e. the barcode with the most abundant counts in each cell, accounted for 82% ± 19% (mean ± standard deviation) of barcodes within each cell; in 3850 out of 4130 (93.2%) barcoded cells, the read counts of the primary barcode accounted for at least half of all barcode reads in a cell before thresholding (i.e., including barcodes with six or fewer reads in a cell; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I, J</xref>). Consistent with the scRNA-seq experiment described above (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), barcoded cells co-mingled with non-barcoded cells in a UMAP plot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>) and had similar read counts and gene counts per cell compared to non-barcoded cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L, M</xref>), suggesting that labeling by rabies virus did not significantly alter the expression of the genes that we targeted. The barcoded cells included excitatory neurons in the cortex, and inhibitory neurons in the cortex and in the midbrain regions; these inhibitory neurons likely picked up barcodes through their local axons, because the injection sites were either adjacent to or in the same cortical and subcortical areas that were sequenced <italic>in situ</italic>. Thus, consistent with the results of the scRNA-seq-based approach (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing resolved the transcriptomic identities of rabies infected cells and determined their rabies barcodes.</p>

<title><italic>In situ</italic> sequencing-based retrograde tracing reveals projections of transcriptomic types of neurons across cortical areas</title>
<p>From all barcoded cells, we identified 1,415 unique barcodes and matched them to the two barcoded libraries (containing at least 8,552 and 13,211 barcodes, respectively; see <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4i">Methods M9</xref></bold>). Because we sequenced 15 out of 20 bases in the rabies barcodes, we first assessed whether the shorter reads were sufficient to unambiguously assign barcodes to the two libraries. We calculated the minimum Hamming distance of each barcode found in cells to the known barcodes in the two libraries and a third mock library with similar numbers of random barcodes (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>). Many barcodes had zero to one mismatch to the two barcode libraries, but not a random barcode library. This peak was distinct from a second peak that was centered at four to five mismatches and included barcodes that were absent from the barcode libraries. No barcode (out of 1,415 unique barcodes in this dataset) was within one mismatch to any barcode in the random barcode library. These results indicate that sequencing 15 bases of the barcodes was sufficient to correct mismatches that could have potentially resulted from errors in sequencing and/or mutation in rabies virus. We thus allowed one mismatch when matching barcodes to the two libraries and found 1,169 VISal-projecting cells and 2,483 SC/RSP-projecting cells, including five cells that projected to both areas (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Of the barcodes that matched the two libraries, the number of cells that carried a barcode correlated with the frequency of that barcode in the library (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>; Pearson correlation 0.41). An additional 496 barcodes from 483 cells did not match either barcode library, likely because the two virus libraries were not sequenced completely to fully recover all barcodes they contained (see <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4i">Methods M9</xref></bold> for discussions on the unmatched barcodes).</p>

<p>VISal-projecting cells and SC/RSP-projecting neurons were differentially distributed across brain areas and were enriched in different transcriptomic subclasses (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-G</xref></bold>). VISal-projecting neurons were found mostly in VISp and cortical areas <italic>lateral</italic> to VISp, including VISl and TEa (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). All transcriptomic types of cortical excitatory neurons, except L6 CT and L6b neurons, were labeled, but the fraction of cells labeled were dependent on the area that the neurons were in. For example, VISal-projecting L2/3 IT neurons were found mostly in VISp and VISl, but not in TEa (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Because superficial layer neurons are involved in feedforward projections from lower-hierarchy cortical areas to higher-hierarchy ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rockland and Pandya 1979</xref>), this observation is consistent with the hierarchy of cortical areas [VISp and VISl have lower hierarchy than VISal, whereas TEa has higher hierarchy; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harris et al. 2019</xref>)]. In contrast, SC/RSP-projecting neurons were found <italic>medial</italic> to VISp (including VISpm and RSPd), in hippocampal areas including the postsubiculum, presubiculum, and the ventral subiculum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>), and in the midbrain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Within the cortex, projections were dominated by L4/5 IT neurons in VISpm and RSPd, and L5 ET neurons in VISp. Because IT neurons project to the cortex but not the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Harris and Shepherd 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harris et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Peng et al. 2021</xref>), the L4/5 IT neurons likely projected to RSP, not SC, whereas, the L5 ET neurons likely projected to the SC. Thus, IT neurons that projected to VISal and RSP were separated along the mediolateral axis. This separation is consistent with the ventral and dorsal streams of the visual pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wang et al. 2012</xref>): whereas VISl, TEa, and ECT belong to the ventral stream, VISpm and RSPd belong to the dorsal stream. These results recapitulated known patterns of projections across areas and transcriptomic subclasses and were consistent with the two pathways in the mouse visual circuit.</p>
<p>Because neurons of different transcriptomic types within a subclass are differentially enriched across cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yao et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. 2023</xref>), we wondered if the differences in projections of the same subclass of neurons across cortical areas can be explained solely by variations in the composition of cell types within subclasses. We first focused on the L4/5 IT neurons, which project to either VISal or RSP from the lateral or medial cortical areas, respectively. Consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. 2023</xref>), the transcriptomic types of L4/5 IT neurons were differentially enriched across cortical areas along the mediolateral axis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). For example, L4/5_IT_1 and L4/5_IT_3 neurons were enriched in lateral areas, such as VISl, TEa, and ECT, whereas L4/5_IT_4 to L4/5_IT_6 were enriched in VISp, VISpm, and RSPd. The enrichment of cell types across cortical areas, however, cannot account for the differences in projections of L4/5 IT neurons from different cortical areas (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I, J</xref>). For example, L4/5_IT_2 in VISpm and RSPd mainly projected to RSP, but not VISal, whereas those in TEa and VISl projected to VISal, not RSP. To quantify how much source areas and cell types contribute to the diversity in projections, we discretized the cortex into “cubelets.” Each cubelet spanned all cortical layers, was 20 µm thick along the anteroposterior axis (i.e., the thickness of a section), and was about 110 µm in width along the mediolateral axis (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4m">Methods M13</xref></bold>). In each cubelet, we calculated the fraction of neurons that projected to VISal for each cell type (we did not perform this analysis for RSP-projecting cells because of insufficient sample size). We then used one-way ANOVA to estimate the variance in the fraction of neurons with projections that can be explained by source area labels, cell type labels, or both (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4m">Methods M13</xref></bold>). If projections are determined solely by cell types and the differences in projection probabilities across cortical areas are only due to different compositions of cell types, then the variance in the fraction of neurons with projections explained by cell types and source areas together should be similar to the variance explained by cell types and shuffled source area labels. Within the L4/5 IT subclass, cell type and source area each explained a modest fraction of variance (cell type: 5.9 ± 3.7%; source area: 6.3 ± 6.5%, mean ± std; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>). In contrast, combining cell type and source area explained more variance (31.8 ± 25.7%, mean ± std; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>;) compared to cell types and shuffled source area labels (p = 6×10<sup>−58</sup> using one-sample two-tailed t-test comparing to 100 iterations of controls with shuffled areas). Similar results were observed across all subclasses of cortical excitatory neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>; p = 6×10<sup>−37</sup> using one-sample two-tailed t-test comparing types with areas to 100 iterations of types with shuffled areas). In particular, the additional variance explained by areas is similar in combination with types compared to in combination with subclasses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>).These results indicate that projections of cortical neurons are determined by both the transcriptomic identities of the neurons at the resolution we observed and their anatomical location.</p>

<title>Interpreting barcoded transsynaptic tracing requires distinguishing barcode-sharing networks</title>
<p>Because we can identify transcriptomic identities of neurons labeled with rabies barcode, similar approaches can also be used in a transsynaptic labeling experiment to interrogate synaptic connectivity. In a barcoded transsynaptic labeling experiment, networks of neurons can share the same barcode because of either connectivity between presynaptic cells and source cells or technical and biological artifacts. Distinguishing different types of barcode-sharing networks is thus crucial for resolving single-cell connectivity. In the following, we first lay out how different types of barcode-sharing networks affect connectivity mapping and how they can be distinguished from each other. We then use <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing to resolve these networks in a barcoded transsynaptic labeling experiment.</p>
<p>Ideally, each source cell should express a unique barcode, which is also shared with its presynaptic cells. By matching barcodes in the presynaptic cells to those in the source cells, we can then infer connectivity between the presynaptic cells to individual source cells (<italic>single-source networks</italic>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Aa</xref>). In practice, however, multiple source cells may express the same barcode. This barcode sharing could be caused by two viral particles with the same barcodes that independently infected two source cells (<italic>double-labeled networks</italic>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ab</xref>). For a given barcode, the probability that the same barcode is found in a second source cell because of double labeling scales with the frequency of that barcode in the library and the total number of source cells that are directly labeled in an experiment. Thus, for a given experiment with known number of source cells, barcodes that are more abundant in a library are more likely to result in double-labeled networks. This type of barcode sharing can be minimized by employing sufficiently diverse and uniformly distributed barcodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kebschull et al. 2016</xref>). However, this is typically challenging to achieve with rabies virus, because the recombinant rabies virus production process usually leads to uneven amplification of barcodes, resulting in their highly skewed distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Clark et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Saunders et al. 2022</xref>). Alternatively, two cells expressing the rabies glycoprotein can be interconnected. In this case, the source cell may pass the barcode to the other cell, thus obscuring the identity of the original source cell (<italic>connected-source networks</italic>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ac</xref>). Because the probability of connected-source networks scales with both the number of source cells and their local connection probability, limiting the number of source cells or restricting source cells to sparsely connected subpopulations of neurons will reduce this type of network. Finally, it is possible to find barcodes that occur only in cells without glycoprotein expression, but not in corresponding source cells. This can happen when the rabies virus directly infects cells that do not express the glycoprotein (<italic>no-source networks</italic>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ad</xref>). This may happen because the virus library contains trace amount of non-pseudotyped rabies virus, or because the infected cells express TVA but not the glycoprotein (these are expressed from separate helper AAVs in our system). In this scenario, each barcode should be found in only one or a few cells, because the probability of generating a large no-source network is exponentially smaller: For a barcode with frequency <italic>f</italic> in the library and total <italic>N</italic> infection events, the probability of having <italic>M</italic> independent infection events with that barcode is <italic><sup>M</sup>C<sub>N</sub></italic> × <italic>f<sup>N</sup></italic> × (1 − <italic>f</italic>)<sup><italic>M – N</italic></sup>. As an example, in an experiment with 1000 infection events, the probability for a barcode with <italic>f</italic> = 0.001 to appear in a no-source networks with at least 2 cells is as high as 0.26, but the probability for the same barcode to appear in a no-source network with at least 7 cells is 8×10<sup>−5</sup>. Alternatively, source cells may be dead due to cytotoxicity or missed by sequencing (<italic>lost-source networks</italic>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ae</xref>). If a source cell died, it may spread the barcode to presynaptic neurons and/or to neighboring cells through the release of viral particles during necrosis. In either case, we speculate that these networks are likely to contain more neurons than no-source networks in an experiment with a reasonable number of total infections. Furthermore, the presence of lost-source networks in an experiment could cause some double-labeled networks or connected-source networks to be misidentified as single-source networks because some source cells in these networks may have been lost.</p>
<p>Because only true single-source networks can unambiguously resolve synaptic connectivity between individual source cells and presynaptic cells, mapping connectivity between source cells and presynaptic cells requires an experiment in which all source cells are sequenced and few source cells are lost. In contrast, single-source networks and lost-source networks can all be used to infer synaptic convergence, i.e., the degree to which two neuronal types synapse onto the same cells, regardless of the identity of the source cell. Because the probability of generating no-source networks and double-labeled networks for a barcode can both be estimated given the total number of barcodes seen in an experiment and the frequency of barcodes in the library, these networks can be identified and filtered out if most barcodes are sequenced in an experiment. Connected-source networks may in principle obscure synaptic convergence if a source cell that is transsynaptically labeled further pass the barcode to its presynaptic cells. However, because these tertiary infections (presynaptic cells of the transsynaptically labeled source cell) occur after the secondary infections (presynaptic cells of the original source cell), the number of barcoded cells that are presynaptic to the transsynaptically labeled source cell is likely smaller compared to those that are presynaptic to the original source cell. We thus speculate that connected-source networks are dominated by presynaptic cells of the original source cells and can also be used in the analysis of synaptic convergence. Therefore, inferring synaptic convergence neither requires sequencing all source cells nor is constrained by the presence of lost source cells.</p>

<title><italic>In situ</italic> sequencing of barcoded rabies virus reveals cell type preferences in synaptic convergence</title>
<p>Having established how barcode-sharing networks can be analyzed in theory, we next applied this approach to a barcoded trans-synaptic rabies tracing experiment. We first tried using SMART-seq v4 scRNA-seq to read out the connectivity and transcriptomic identity of transsynaptically labeled neurons from four animals (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S1</xref></bold>). However, because scRNA-seq can only interrogate a fraction of all barcoded cells, we were unable to confidently infer connectivity from the rabies barcodes (see <bold><underline>Supplementary Note 1</underline></bold> for details; <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. S4</xref></bold>). To sequence more barcoded cells, we then investigated whether <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing could be used in a multiplexed transsynaptic labeling experiment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). We injected AAV2-retro-synP-mCre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jin et al. 2023</xref>) into the dorsal striatum, and two helper viruses, AAV1-synP-FLEX-splitTVA-EGFP-tTA and AAV1-TREtight-mTagBFP2-B19G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liu et al. 2017</xref>), into the somatosensory cortex. This combination allows expression of TVA and the rabies glycoprotein in corticostriatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jin et al. 2023</xref>). After seven days, we injected a barcoded EnvA-pseudotyped ΔG rabies virus library into the somatosensory cortex. This library contained the same barcodes as the CCS-containing library used for retrograde labeling, with at least 13,211 barcodes. After another seven days, we collected 20-µm coronal sections and sequenced both endogenous genes and the rabies barcodes in 32 consecutive sections <italic>in situ</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>). These sections, which spanned 640 µm along the AP axis, largely covered the whole injection site. Because <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing did not require dissociation and was able to capture even both halves of barcoded cells that were split between two sections (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>), sequencing consecutive sections that spanned the whole injection site should allow us to interrogate most source cells. We interrogated the same gene panel as in the retrograde labeling experiment, except that we substituted probes for <italic>Slc30a3</italic> with probes for the rabies glycoprotein gene. Barcode rolonies were basecalled individually within cells, which allowed us to read out multiple barcodes from the same cell (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>We sequenced 3,107,645 cells, including 2,914 barcoded cells (summarized in <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). Barcoded cells were defined as cells with at least eight counts of the same barcode, with the barcode being sufficiently complex (linguistic sequence complexity &gt; 10<sup>−0.9</sup>; see <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4n">Methods M14</xref></bold> for definition). These quality control thresholds were determined by manually proofreading a subset of barcoded cells: two proofreaders examined barcoded cells with different barcode counts or barcode complexity and determined whether each cell was indeed barcoded; based on the manual inspections, we then determined the best threshold that allowed us to distinguish cells from background fluorescence and from barcodes in passing axons/dendrites (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5A</xref></bold>). We next defined potential source cells and potential presynaptic cells based on rabies glycoprotein expression. In conventional trans-synaptic tracing experiments, potential source cells are usually determined by the expression of fluorescent proteins. Because the <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing approach we used did not preserve fluorescent labeling, we used the copy numbers of the rabies glycoprotein transcript to distinguish source cells from presynaptic cells. We estimated a threshold for the glycoprotein transcript, so that the transcriptomic types of cells with glycoprotein reads above this threshold were consistent with corticostriatal projection neurons (see <bold><underline>Supplementary Note 2</underline></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5</xref></bold> for details). We found that cells expressing at least 12 counts of the glycoprotein transcript likely correspond to BFP+ cells in a conventional tracing experiment. However, we also observed many cells with lower numbers of glycoprotein transcripts (see <bold><underline>Discussion</underline></bold> about the potential sources of this low-level expression). Although these cells were unlikely to be considered source cells in a conventional tracing experiment, the glycoprotein expressed in them could potentially allow barcodes to be passed onto presynaptic neurons. Thus, excluding them from potential source cells may cause double-labeled networks and connected-source networks to be mistaken as single-source networks (see <bold><underline>Supplementary Note 2</underline></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5</xref></bold> for a detailed analysis). To minimize potential false-positive identification of synaptic connections, we used a conservative threshold of two transcripts per cell to define potential source cells. Of the 2,914 barcoded cells, 138 cells had at least two counts of the rabies glycoprotein and were considered potential source cells; 2,590 barcoded cells had no glycoprotein expression and were considered potential presynaptic cells; the remaining 186 barcoded cells had a single read of glycoprotein and were removed from further analyses. Consistent with the retrograde labeling experiment, the barcoded cells had similar numbers of endogenous gene reads as non-barcoded cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E, F</xref>) and clustered together with non-barcoded cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G, H</xref>).</p>

<p>Because distinguishing different types of barcode-sharing networks requires sequencing most source cells, we first estimated what fraction of the source cells that were present in the tissue was sequenced. The number of cells that shared a barcode varied widely from 1 cell/barcode to 359 cells/barcode. Since previous studies showed that each source cell can label dozens to hundreds of presynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wertz et al. 2015</xref>) when infected at relatively high viral titer (as we have done in this experiment), we reasoned that barcodes that were found only in a small number of cells may indicate either no-source networks or lost-source networks due to dead source cells. We thus focused on 23 barcodes that were present in at least 12 cells per barcode, and calculated the fraction of barcodes that were also found in source cells with read counts above a certain threshold. We varied this threshold to generate a range of estimates that likely over-estimated and under-estimated the number of source cells at the extreme ends, respectively, and found that 80% – 93% barcodes were found in source cells (see <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4n">Methods M14</xref></bold> for details; <bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5B</xref></bold>). We further filtered the 138 potential source cells to remove those that had wrong segmentations or included barcodes from nearby cells based on manual examination of the sequencing images, resulting in 120 high quality source cells with 59 unique barcodes.</p>
<p>We then estimated the number of barcodes that belonged to the three types of networks with source cells (single-source networks, double-labeled networks, and connected-source networks; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Aa-c</xref></bold>). Six source cells contained two barcodes each and the remaining 114 source cells contained a single barcode, resulting in 120 source cells and 126 unique combinations of source cell/barcodes. 43 barcodes in 42 source cells were found only in a single source cell each (one of these source cells contained two barcodes); of these 43 barcodes, 31 barcodes in 30 source cells were shared with 381 putative presynaptic cells (12 ± 14 cells per barcode after rounding, mean ± std; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>; <bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S6</xref></bold>). The remaining 16 (59 – 43) barcodes labeled multiple source cells each (81 source cells in total, including 3 source cells that contained both shared barcodes and unique barcodes).</p>
<p>Barcodes shared across source cells could be caused by either connected source cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ac</xref>) or double labeling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ab</xref>). To estimate the contribution of these two sources, we leveraged the fact that the probability of double labeling scales with the frequency of a barcode in a library, whereas the probability of connected source cells does not. Because source cell/barcode combinations, rather than barcode counts or source cell counts alone, represented potential independent infection events or transsynaptic labeling between source cells, we used the number of source cell/barcode combinations to estimate the number of barcodes of either type of network. Briefly, we calculated the posterior probability of <italic>N</italic> transduction events to generate 59 barcodes in the source cells, given the barcode frequency in the library (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4n">Methods M14</xref></bold>). We found that the most likely number of transduction events was 76 (95% confidence interval 67 to 87; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J, K</xref>), suggesting that about 33 (76 – 43) barcode/source cell combinations can be explained by multiple source cells being infected with the same barcodes through independent infection events. Since there were a total of 126 unique combinations of source cells and barcodes, the remaining 50 (126 - 76) source-barcode pairs were likely from source cells that were connected to other source cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). This high number of connected source cells is expected, because many cortical neuronal types are highly connected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Campagnola et al. 2022</xref>). Thus, our analyses suggest that barcode sharing among source cells was dominated by connected-source networks.</p>
<p>We next estimated the number of barcode-sharing networks without source cells (no-source networks or lost-source networks; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ad, e</xref></bold>). To distinguish these networks, we took advantage of the fact that no-source networks, which are created by multiple infections involving the same barcode, are exponentially rarer as the size of the network increases; in contrast, lost-source networks, which are created by spreading from missing source cells, are not expected to follow this relationship. In total, 490 barcodes were found in presynaptic cells but not in source cells. Indeed, the distribution of the number of cells containing each barcode that were absent in source cells revealed two peaks, one large peak around 1 cell per barcode and a smaller peak around 8 cells per barcode (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>). 429 of these barcodes (88%) were found in fewer than 5 cells, suggesting that barcodes that were not found in source cells were dominated by direct infection of cells that did not express the glycoprotein (no-source networks). To estimate a lower bound of the number of source cells that died, we considered all networks with at least 5 cells and no source cell as lost-source networks. This conservative estimate resulted in 61 dead source cells, compared to 120 observed source cells and 76 estimated independent infection events. These results are consistent with previous observations using single cell-initiated monosynaptic tracing that around half of source cells died by seven days after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wertz et al. 2015</xref>). Because many source cells died in this experiment, some barcodes that were originally shared across multiple source cells may appear as single-source networks. This ambiguity obscures mapping synaptic connectivity between the source cells and presynaptic cells, but has limited effect on inferring synaptic convergence, i.e., which neuronal types are more likely to synapse onto the same post-synaptic cell, regardless of the identity of the post-synaptic cell.</p>
<p>We next filtered our data with the goal of estimating synaptic convergence. As discussed above, single-source networks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Aa</xref>), lost-source networks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ae</xref>), and connected-source networks can all be used to estimate synaptic convergence, because presynaptic neurons that shared the same barcodes all synapsed onto the same cells (although the identity of the post-synaptic cells are unknown in lost-source networks). No-source networks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ad</xref>) and double-labeled networks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ab</xref>), in contrast, contained many neurons that were not related by connectivity and would obscure synaptic convergence. To minimize the impact of these two networks, we identified and removed both types of networks by limiting network size and barcode frequency, respectively. Because cells in no-source networks were generated by independent infection events and generally contained few cells, we first filtered out networks that were too small (&lt; 5 cells; <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4n">Methods M14</xref></bold>). Because double-labeled networks likely occurred to barcodes that were abundant, we applied a maximum barcode frequency threshold (1.3×10<sup>−3</sup> based on the library sequencing). This threshold should ensure that about 95% of the barcodes could only have transduced a single source cell from the initial infection by EnvA-enveloped virus (see <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4n">Methods M14</xref></bold>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>).</p>
<p>For all potential presynaptic neurons that shared a barcode, we counted each pair of presynaptic neurons as a pair of “converging connections.” We aggregated all pairs of converging connections across all filtered barcodes for cortical subclasses of presynaptic neurons, and calculated the bias in synaptic convergence as the ratio between the observed number of converging connections compared to the expected numbers of connections based on random connectivity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5N</xref>; see <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4n">Methods M14</xref></bold>). That is, if neurons of subclass A and those of subclass B are more likely to synapse onto the same post-synaptic cell, then these subclasses have a convergence bias greater than 1, and vice versa. We found that IT neurons generally synapse onto similar cells (the convergence bias is 2.75 between L2/3 IT and L5 IT, 2.81 between L4/5 IT and L5 IT, and 1.06 between L5 IT and L6 IT, false positive rate &lt; 0.05 by shuffled control). However, IT neurons in layer 6 (L6 IT) were less likely to synapse onto the same postsynaptic cells as other cortical neurons, including IT neurons in the superficial layers (L2/3 IT and L4/5 IT, convergence bias 0.83 and 0.80, respectively), the corticofugal projection neurons (L5 ET and L6 CT, convergence bias 0.78 and 0.53, respectively), NP neurons (convergence bias 0.72), and two subclasses of inhibitory neurons (Lamp5 and Pvalb, convergence bias 0.70 and 0.84, respectively). The differences in the connectivity of L6 IT neurons are reminiscent of their characteristic areal and laminar patterns of long-range projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tasic et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al. 2019</xref>) compared to other IT neurons. We speculate that the distinct L6 IT connectivity may reflect specialized roles in cortical processing.</p>

<title><italic>In situ</italic> sequencing of barcoded rabies virus achieves multiplexed retrograde labeling</title>
<p>In barcoding-based multiplexed retrograde tracing, different barcodes are used to distinguish projections to different injection sites. Unlike conventional fluorescence-based multiplexed retrograde tracing techniques, a barcoding-based approach is not limited by the number of distinguishable colors of fluorescence. Because the maximal barcode diversity that can be theoretically achieved increases exponentially with the length of the barcode (4<italic><sup>N</sup></italic> in which <italic>N</italic> is the length of the barcode), possible barcode diversity is virtually unlimited. Thus, in a barcoded retrograde tracing experiment, the number of targets that can be investigated by retrograde labeling in a single experiment is likely limited by the number of injections. In our experiments, we only performed retrograde labeling from two sites as a proof of principle, but this approach can be applied to retrograde tracing from dozens of sites to reveal multiple projections from individual cells in future experiments.</p>
<p>Barcoded retrograde and anterograde projection mapping approaches obtain complementary information. Barcoded anterograde labeling approaches, such as MAPseq and BARseq, can barcode many neuronal somata in a local region in a single injection, and thus can reveal the diversity of projections of densely labeled neurons within a region. In contrast, retrograde labeling approaches can reveal the distribution of neurons with the same projections over large brain regions. In this study, we interrogated the distribution of neurons across seven adjacent cortical areas and found that both source areas and the transcriptomic identities of cortical neurons contribute to their projection patterns. To perform the equivalent experiment using an anterograde tracing approach would require multiple injections at precise locations to achieve uniform labeling across a large region of the cortex. The sensitivity of the two approaches is also constrained by different factors: the sensitivity of MAPseq/BARseq relies on detecting individual barcode molecules in the axons; in contrast, because rabies genome is highly amplified in each infected cell, the sensitivity of barcoded rabies-based retrograde labeling is not limited by barcode detection but determined by viral transduction. Any future improvement in rabies virus-based retrograde tracing in general would also benefit barcoded approaches. Therefore, the combination of barcoding-based retrograde and anterograde projection mapping techniques provides a versatile set of tools for understanding the organization of long-range circuits.</p>

<title><italic>In situ</italic> sequencing resolves barcode-sharing networks in transsynaptic labeling</title>
<p>Transsynaptic labeling using barcoded rabies virus has the potential to map synaptic connectivity of individual neurons with unparalleled throughput and to resolve the transcriptomic identities of connected neurons at high resolution. In a barcoded transsynaptic labeling experiment, accurately inferring synaptic relationships among neurons requires distinguishing different types of barcode-sharing networks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) and filtering out networks that can obscure connectivity analysis. Accurately identifying the network that each neuron belongs to requires sequencing all source cells. This requirement is difficult to achieve using single-cell RNA-seq-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Clark et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Saunders et al. 2022</xref>). Because conventional single-cell approaches require tissue dissociation, some source cells are inevitably lost. <italic>In situ</italic> sequencing, in contrast, bypasses the need for tissue dissociation and has the potential to sequence all source cells. Accidental loss of sections during cryo-sectioning can be further minimized using a tape-transfer system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pinskiy et al. 2015</xref>), which is also compatible with BARseq-style <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al. 2019</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> sequencing thus provides a path to accurately resolve synaptic connectivity in a barcoded rabies-based transsynaptic labeling experiment.</p>
<p>In our experiment, we found that many source cells likely died in the experiment, which prevented us from unambiguously determining the connectivity between source cells and presynaptic neurons. Nonetheless, we could infer which neuronal types were more likely to synapse together onto the same source cell, regardless of the identity of the source cell. This analysis goes beyond previous barcoded rabies-based approaches(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Clark et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Saunders et al. 2022</xref>), and represents a first proof-of-principle of inferring the statistics of synaptic connectivity of neuronal types using a barcoding-based approach. Further optimizing the technique to unambiguously determine connectivity between source cells and presynaptic neurons will not only generate insights into the connectivity of neuronal types, but also allow comparison to connectivity inferred from electron microscopy data(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">MICrONS Consortium et al. 2021</xref>) and patch-seq data(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Campagnola et al. 2022</xref>) to validate the specificity of rabies monosynaptic tracing.</p>

<title>Optimizing viral strategies to achieve highly multiplexed mapping of synaptic connectivity</title>
<p>Our analyses based on the <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing data identified several factors that can be optimized in future experiments to achieve barcoded monosynaptic tracing at single-cell resolution. Most importantly, reducing source cell death would allow more precise matching between pre-synaptic neurons and source cells. Losing source cells not only obscures the various types of barcode-sharing networks but may also produce neurons that share the same barcode not through synaptic connectivity, but through necrosis of the source cell. Cytotoxicity in source cells can be ameliorated by titrating concentrations of AAV and rabies virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lavin et al. 2020</xref>), optimizing the incubation period after injecting rabies virus, using alternative strains of rabies virus with less cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Reardon et al. 2016</xref>), and/or using engineered glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim et al. 2016</xref>). Because barcode sequencing <italic>in situ</italic> was sufficiently sensitive, our approach can also be adapted to new generations of deletion mutant vectors with reduced viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chatterjee et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jin et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to minimizing source cell death, other factors can be optimized to map synaptic connectivity more efficiently. First, we found many rabies-infected neurons with barcodes that were absent in source cells. Although these small no-source networks do not need to be eliminated to map synaptic connectivity, they nonetheless reduce effective barcode diversity and contribute to noise in the data. We speculate that these rabies-infected cells resulted from direct infection by rabies virus in neurons that had a low-level expression of TVA in the absence of Cre. It could be possible to minimize direct infections in future experiments by using mutant TVA that reduces background infection (TVA66T)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Miyamichi et al. 2013</xref>) and by optimizing the titer of rabies virus and AAV helper viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lavin et al. 2020</xref>). Furthermore, parallel control experiments, in which AAV helper viruses expressing either the Cre or the glycoprotein is omitted, can be used to establish ground truth for the prevalence of independent infections and no-source networks.</p>
<p>Second, reducing the number of source cells that share barcodes can improve the number of networks that can be used to infer synaptic connectivity. Because the number of connected source cells increases with both the probability of connections and the total number of cells that express the glycoprotein, connected source cells can be minimized by titrating the number of glycoprotein-expressing neurons and/or by labeling specific subpopulations of neurons that were sparsely connected. Improving the diversity and/or the distribution of barcodes in the rabies library would also reduce barcode sharing across source cells.</p>
<p>Finally, trans-synaptic transmission efficiency can be improved in future experiments. In our experiment, many potential source cells with low numbers of glycoprotein transcripts had only small numbers of corresponding presynaptic cells, suggesting that this low-level expression only allowed transmission of the rabies virus with low efficiency. We speculate that this broad but low-level expression of rabies glycoprotein may have been driven by the TREtight promoter in the absence of Cre-dependent tTA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Loew et al. 2010</xref>). Thus, placing the glycoprotein under the direct control of Cre could reduce its broad but low-level expression and constrain potential source cells to a sparser population. These modifications, combined with control experiments that assess the extent of connected source cells, double labeling, and dead source cells experimentally, could help achieve efficient barcoded monosynaptic tracing in future experiments.</p>

<title>Building a comprehensive barcoded connectomics toolbox based on <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing</title>
<p>Barcoding-based monosynaptic tracing has unique advantages compared to other connectivity mapping techniques. Paired recordings combined with patch-seq can determine the functional connectivity of a small number of neurons and their transcriptomic types(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Campagnola et al. 2022</xref>), but it is restricted to mapping connectivity over a short distance, since both connection probability and the probability of preserving those connections in slice culture drops considerably as the patched neurons become more distant. CRACM (channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Petreanu et al. 2007</xref>) can map long-range synaptic connectivity, but it can only map inputs from a population of genetically labeled neurons and cannot resolve differences within this population. Electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">MICrONS Consortium et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shapson-Coe et al. 2021</xref>) remains the gold standard for identifying synapses, but it is challenging to associate connectivity with the transcriptomic identities of neurons and to interrogate long-range connectivity across brain regions. In comparison, barcoding-based monosynaptic tracing is compatible with interrogation of transcriptomic identities of neurons. Furthermore, because the connectivity is read out by sequencing instead of tracing, the error in connectivity mapping does not scale with the distance between the connected neurons. These characteristics are not restricted to rabies virus-based monosynaptic tracing, but also apply to potential future techniques based on other trans-synaptic viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Martin and Dolivo 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ugolini et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beier et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Xiong et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fischer et al. 2023</xref>) Thus, barcoding-based monosynaptic tracing is ideally suited for mapping the long-range synaptic connectivity of neuronal types and complements existing synaptic connectivity mapping tools.</p>
<p><italic>In situ</italic> sequencing is ideally suited for barcoding-based neuroanatomical techniques compared to conventional dissociation based single-cell or single-nuclear RNA-seq techniques. <italic>In situ</italic> sequencing not only has the ability to capture most source cells, but is also faster and cheaper in mapping cell types than most dissociation based techniques on a per-cell basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. 2023</xref>). For example, <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing performed in the transsynaptic labeling experiment, which included dense sequencing of 3.1 million cells in total across 32 consecutive coronal sections, cost less than $4,000 in reagents. Furthermore, <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing captures the mapped neurons at high spatial resolution, which can reveal spatial organization of connectivity. Such space-based rules in connectivity are common in vertebrate brains (e.g. retinotopy, cortical column) and may exist independent of transcriptomic type-based differences in connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al. 2022</xref>); specific spatial patterns of connectivity loss are common in many neurodegenerative diseases. By combining <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing with barcoded rabies tracing, we expand <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing-based barcoded neuroanatomical approaches to include anterograde projection mapping (BARseq), multiplexed retrograde tracing, and multiplexed transsynaptic tracing. This diverse set of <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing-based tools enables flexible strategies for mapping neuronal connectivity across scales.</p>

Details for individual preparations are as follows:</p>
<p>RVΔG-4mCherry_20-mer barcode(B19G) (used for retrograde labeling): Supernatants were collected beginning 3 days after transfection and continuing for a total of five days, with supernatants replaced with 13 ml fresh medium until the last collection; each supernatant was filtered and refrigerated until all supernatants were titered together on HEK-293T cells as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wickersham et al. 2010</xref>).

Regions of interest were micro-dissected, followed by enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and FACS analysis. For retrograde tracing, 48-52 mCherry-positive cells from each mouse were sorted into 8-well strips containing SMART-Seq lysis buffer with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/µL; Takara Cat#ST0764). For retrograde transsynaptic tracing, 48 mCherry-positive cells from each mouse were first sorted into 8-well strips, followed by the sorting of mCherry-/mTagBFP2-double positive cells.

<p>We found 13,212 and 8,553 barcodes, respectively, from the RVΔG-4mCherry_20-mer barcode(B19G) and RVΔG-4mCherry_CCS2_20nt_HM(EnvA) libraries. The RVΔG-4mCherry_CCS2_20nt_HM(B19G) library was used to prepare the RVΔG-4mCherry_CCS2_20nt_HM(EnvA) library, so we did not separately sequence the barcodes in the B19G coated library.</p>
<p>In the retrograde labeling experiment, 12% of barcodes (496 out of 4,130 barcoded cells) did not match barcodes that were seen in the two libraries. These unmatched barcodes were likely caused by the shallow depth at which these two libraries were sequenced. For example, in the RVΔG-4mCherry_CCS2_20nt_HM(EnvA) library, 99.9% of reads corresponded to unique UMIs (200,021 reads corresponding to 199,815 UMIs). This high fraction of reads with unique UMIs indicates that the sequencing was very shallow and were unlikely to reveal all barcodes. As a point of reference, in typical MAPseq and/or BARseq experiments using barcoded Sindbis virus, each unique UMI that corresponds to a barcode molecule usually has at least 5 – 10 reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kebschull et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al. 2019</xref>). Because of this shallow sequencing depth, a large fraction of UMIs were likely missed during sequencing. Because 37% (5,914 out of 13,212) and 46% (3,964 out of 8553) barcodes found in the two libraries had a single UMI recovered, many barcodes with similar frequencies as the recovered barcodes with only 1-2 UMIs were likely missed by chance. Thus, the numbers of barcodes we found represent lower bounds of the barcode diversity in these libraries, and the shallow depth of sequencing could potentially explain the number of barcodes that were not matched to the libraries.</p>
<p>The RVΔG-4mCherry_CCS2_20nt_HM(B19G) library was used to prepare the RVΔG-4mCherry_CCS2_20nt_HM(EnvA) library, so we did not separately sequence the barcodes in the B19G coated library.</p>

<title><italic>In situ</italic> sequencing – library preparation</title>
<p><italic>In situ</italic> sequencing was performed as previously described for BARseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sun et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. 2023</xref>) and a detailed step-by-step protocol is provided at protocols.io (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.n2bvj82q5gk5/v1">dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.n2bvj82q5gk5/v1</ext-link>). Briefly, brain sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 hour, dehydrated through 70%, 85%, and 100% ethanol, and incubated in 100% ethanol for 1.5 hours at 4°C. After rehydration in PBST (PBS and 0.5% Tween-20), we incubate in the reverse transcription mix (RT primers, 20 U/μL RevertAid H Minus M-MuLV reverse transcriptase, 500 μM dNTP, 0.2 μg/μL BSA, 1 U/μL RiboLock RNase Inhibitor, 1× RevertAid RT buffer) at 37°C overnight. On the second day, we crosslink cDNA using BS(PEG)<sub>9</sub> (40 μL in 160 μL PBST) for 1 hour, neutralize the remaining crosslinker with 1M Tris pH 8.0 for 30 mins, and wash with PBST. We then incubate in non-gap-filling ligation mix (1× Ampligase buffer, padlock probe mix for endogenous genes, 0.5 U/μL Ampligase, 0.4 U/μL RNase H, 1 U/μL RiboLock RNase Inhibitor, additional 50 mM KCl, 20% formamide) for 30 mins at 37°C and 45 mins at 45°C, followed by incubating in the gap-filling ligation mix [same as the non-gap-filling mix with the rabies barcode padlock probe (XCAI5) as the only padlock probe, and with 50 μM dNTP, 0.2 U/μL Phusion DNA polymerase, and 5% glycerol] for 5 mins at 37°C and 45 mins at 45°C. After incubation, we wash the sample with PBST, hybridize with 1 μM RCA primer (XC1417) for 10 mins in 2× SSC with10% formamide, wash twice in 2× SSC with10% formamide and twice in PBST, then incubate in the RCA mix (1 U/μL phi29 DNA polymerase, 1x phi29 polymerase buffer, 0.25 mM dNTP, 0.2 μg/μL BSA, 5% glycerol (extra of those from the enzymes), 125 μM aminoallyl dUTP) overnight at room temperature. On the third day we crosslink and neutralize additional crosslinkers as performed on the second day.</p>
<p>In the reverse transcription mix, the RT primers included 50 μM (final concentration) random primer (XC2757) and 2 μM each of primers against the rabies barcode flanking regions (XCAI6 and XCAI7). For the monosynaptic tracing experiments, the RT primers additionally included 2 μM of primers for the rabies glycoprotein (XCAI63 – XCAI76). All RT primers contain amine groups at the 5’ end, which allow crosslinking on the second day. In the retrograde tracing experiments, the non-gap-filling padlock probe mix included all padlock probes for endogenous genes. In the monosynaptic tracing experiments, the non-gap-filling padlock probe mix included all padlock probes for endogenous genes except <italic>Slc30a3</italic>, and additionally included padlocks for the rabies glycoprotein (XCAI77 – XCAI90).</p>

<p>Sequencing was performed using Illumina MiSeq Reagent Nano Kit v2 (300-cycles) and imaged on a Nikon Ti2-E microscope with Crest xlight v3 spinning disk confocal, photometrics Kinetix camera, and Lumencor Celesta laser. All images were taken with a Nikon CFI S Plan Fluor LWD 20XC objective. For each sample, we first sequence seven sequencing cycles for genes, followed by one hybridization cycle, followed by 15 sequencing cycles for barcodes. In each imaging round, we took a z-stack of 21 images centered around the tissue with 1.5 µm step size at each field of view (FOV). Adjacent FOVs had an overlap of 24%. Detailed list of filters and lasers used for each imaging channel are listed in <bold><xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref></bold>.</p>

<p>For sequencing the first gene cycles, we hybridized sequencing primer (YS220) in 2× SSC with10% formamide for 10 mins at room temperature, wash twice in 2× SSC with10% formamide and twice in PBS2T (PBS with 2% Tween-20). We then incubate the sample in MiSeq Incorporation buffer at 60°C for 3 mins, wash in PBS2T, then incubate the sample in Iodoacetamide (9.3 mg vial in 2.5 mL PBS2T) at 60°C for 3 mins, wash once in PBS2T and twice in Incorporation buffer, incubate twice in IMS at 60°C for 3 mins, wash four times with PBS2T at 60°C for 3 mins, then wash and image in SRE.</p>
<p>For sequencing the first barcode cycle, we first strip the sequenced products with three 10 min incubations at 60°C in 2× SSC with 60% formamide. We then wash with 2× SSC with10% formamide, hybridize the barcode sequencing primer (XCAI5) and proceed with sequencing in the same way as for the first gene cycle.</p>
<p>For subsequent sequencing cycles for both genes and barcodes, we wash twice in Incorporation buffer, incubate twice in CMS at 60°C for 3 mins, wash twice in Incorporation buffer, then proceed with incubation with iodoacetamide as performed for the first sequencing cycle.</p>
<p>For hybridization cycles, we strip the sequenced products with three 10 min incubations at 60°C in 2× SSC with 60% formamide. We then wash with 2× SSC with10% formamide, hybridize the hybridization probes (XC2758, XC2759, XC2760, YS221) for 10 mins at room temperature, then wash twice with 2× SSC with10% formamide, and incubate in PBST with 0.002 mg/mL DAPI for 5 mins. We then change to SRE and image.</p>

<p><italic>In situ</italic> sequencing data was processed in MATLAB using custom scripts (see <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4o">Data and Code Availability</xref></bold>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. 2023</xref>)In general, we processed each FOV separately, and only combined data from FOV after extracting rolony-level and cell-level data. We denoised the max projection images from each imaging stack using noise2void (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Krull et al. 2018</xref>), fixed x-y shifts between channels, and corrected channel bleed through. We then registered all gene sequencing cycles to the first gene sequencing cycle using the sum of the signals from all four sequencing channels; we registered the hybridization cycle to the first gene sequencing cycle using the TxRed channel, which visualized all the sequenced gene rolonies; we registered all barcode sequencing cycles to the first barcode sequencing cycle using the sum of sequencing signals; and we registered the first barcode sequencing cycle to the first gene sequencing cycle using the brightfield image. We then performed cell segmentation with Cellpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Stringer et al. 2020</xref>), using the sum of all four hybridization channels, which visualize all gene rolonies, as cytoplasmic signals and the DAPI channel in hybridization cycle as nuclear signals. Gene rolonies are decoded using Bardensr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al. 2021</xref>). Barcode rolonies were first identified by picking peaks in the first barcode cycle using both prominence and intensity thresholds. We then called the nucleotide at each cycle as the channel with the strongest signal of the four sequencing channels. Within each cell, barcodes within 2 mismatches away from other barcodes are error-corrected to the most abundant barcodes within the same cell. All FOVs were stitched using ImageJ to find the transformation matrix from each FOV to each slice. These transformation matrices were then applied to the position of cells and rolonies to find their positions in each slice. Cells that were imaged multiple times in the overlapping regions between neighboring FOVS were removed using an approach based on AABB collision detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baraff and Witkin 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>We filtered out neurons with fewer than 20 counts/cell and 5 genes/cell, then clustered the cells in an iterative approach using Louvain clustering as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. 2023</xref>).

<label>M13.</label><title>Multiplexed retrograde tracing analysis</title>
<p>To estimate an upper bound of the false positive rate for the retrograde tracing experiment using scRNA-seq, we used the definition of false positive rate: <italic>FPR</italic> = <italic>FP</italic>⁄(<italic>FP</italic> + <italic>TN</italic>), where <italic>FP</italic> is the number of false positive detections and <italic>TN</italic> is the number of true negative detections. Because L5 ET and L6 CT neurons are the main neuronal types that project to the LGd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Harris and Shepherd 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tasic et al. 2018</xref>), we defined <italic>TN</italic> as all sequenced inhibitory neurons, IT neurons and L5 NP neurons that did not project to the LGd (24 IT neurons, 1 L5 NP neurons, and 7 inhibitory neurons; total 32 neurons), and <italic>FP</italic> as those that did project to the LGd (0 neurons). We did not include L6b neurons, because some L6b neurons form a continuum with L6 CT neurons in transcriptomics and morphology. It is thus unclear whether L6b neurons could project to the thalamus. Since no <italic>FP</italic> was identified in this dataset, the true <italic>FP</italic> likely lies between 0 and 1. We thus estimate that the upper bound of <italic>FPR</italic> as (1 + <italic>FP</italic>)/(<italic>FP</italic> + <italic>TN</italic>) = 1/32, or 3.1%.</p>
<p>The analysis of the <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing experiment was performed in MATLAB. Cells were considered barcoded if it contained at least six reads of the same barcode, and the barcodes were matched to the two sequencing libraries allowing one mismatch. To analyze the spatial patterns of the somas of projection neurons, we first divided the cortex into 267 “cubelets.” On each slice, the cubelets were drawn so that they spanned all layers of the cortex and had roughly similar width (∼100 µm) along the outer surface of the cortex along the mediolateral axis. These cubelets largely covered cortical areas VISp, VISl, ECT, and TEa. We did not draw over RSP because the curvature of the cortex at RSP makes it difficult to define cubelets in this area. In each cubelet <italic>c</italic>, we denoted the projection probability for each cell type <italic>t</italic> as <italic>P<sub>ct</sub></italic>. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="532873v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> be the mean projection probability across all cell types and cubelets, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="532873v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> be the total variance. We then computed the variance explained by areas, subclasses, types, and types with areas as follows:

<label>M14.</label><title>Barcoded transsynaptic labeling analysis</title>
<p>For the scRNA-seq based transsynaptic labeling experiment, barcode-level analyses, including Hamming distance and matching to barcode library, were performed in MATLAB.</p>
<p>For the <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing experiments, we filtered barcodes based on linguistic sequence complexity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Trifonov 1990</xref>) and barcode counts per cell. For a barcode with length <italic>M</italic>, the linguistic sequence complexity <italic>C</italic> is defined as the product of the vocabulary-usage measures of <italic>n</italic>-grams, <italic>U<sub>n</sub></italic>, for all possible <italic>ns:</italic>
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="532873v2_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Where <italic>U<sub>n</sub></italic> is defined as the ratio between the number of unique n-grams that was observed and the minimum between all possible n-grams and the total number of n-grams in that sequence. We first curated barcoded cells manually to determine appropriate thresholds. We generated 100 × 100 pixels crops of images of all barcode sequencing cycles, the first gene sequencing cycle, the hybridization cycle channels, and cell segmentation mask for 262 cells with varying barcode counts per cell and barcode complexity. The images were visually inspected to determine whether a barcode with the called barcode is present in the cell to determine the thresholds for complexity and barcode counts that removed wrong barcodes. These barcodes were dominated by incomplete cells at the borders of an FOV (low complexity), autofluorescence background (low complexity), and wrong basecalls due to overlapping barcode rolonies (low counts). To determine the source cells, we additionally required cells to have at least two read counts of the rabies glycoprotein. This threshold was chosen so that most glycoprotein positive cells were around the injection sites and were concentrated in layer 5, which are enriched in corticostriatal projection neurons.</p>
<p>To estimate the fraction of barcodes that were observed in source cells, we only focused on barcodes that had sufficient reads per cell (≥10 reads per cell) and were in networks that were large enough to exclude most no-source networks and lost-source networks (≥ 12 cells per barcode). We then asked what fraction of those barcodes were found in source cells, which were defined by having a barcode with at least <italic>X</italic> reads per cell. Because we knew based on manual inspection that all barcodes with at least ten reads per cell were real, but only some barcodes with between three to ten reads per cell were real, we reasoned that thresholding at <italic>X</italic> =10 would likely underestimate the number of barcodes that were found in source cells, whereas thresholding at <italic>X</italic> =3 would overestimate the number of barcodes that were found in source cells. Estimates using these two thresholds thus provided the upper and lower bound of the true rate at which barcodes were observed in source cells.</p>
<p>To estimate the number of independent infection events that achieved the number of barcodes in source cells observed in the experiment, we calculated the posterior probability, <italic>P(N|M)</italic>, of using <italic>N</italic> independent infection events to achieve <italic>M</italic> = 59 unique barcodes using Bayes’ theorem:
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="532873v2_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Where <italic>P(M/N)</italic> is the probability of drawing <italic>M</italic> unique barcodes after <italic>N</italic> infections based on the barcode frequency in the virus library, <italic>P(N)</italic> is the probability of having <italic>N</italic> infections (uniform distribution), and <italic>P(M)</italic> is the probability of drawing <italic>M</italic> unique barcodes overall:
<disp-formula id="ueqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="532873v2_ueqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Where <italic>C</italic> = 126 is the number of unique barcode-source cell combinations that was observed.</p>
<p>To find biases in converging outputs between cell types, we first removed all barcodes with fewer than five cells, which resulted in 153 barcodes. This lower boundary allowed us to filter out most no-source networks. We then estimated the number of independent infection events and the maximum barcode frequency to achieve 95% single infection. We randomly drew barcodes from the barcode library based on their frequencies until we obtained the same number of barcodes as in the <italic>in situ</italic> dataset. Because the library was sequenced only to 82%, we considered the remaining 18% of barcodes to be all non-repetitive for the purpose of this analysis. We repeated this process 10,000 times and used the median numbers as estimate for the total number of infection events and the barcode frequency threshold for the subsequent analysis. For each barcode, we considered all pair-wise combinations of cells that share that barcode to have converging outputs and accumulated the number of converging outputs across all barcodes for each combination of cortical subclasses. To estimate the biases compared to the expected number of converging outputs, we calculated the expected number of converging outputs as the square of cell counts for each cortical subclass, normalized so that the total number of connections is the same as the data. To estimate p values, we shuffled the identity of connected cells and recalculated the number of converging outputs for each pair of cortical subclasses. We repeated this process 10,000 times and used two times the fraction of iterations with more extreme values of converging outputs as the p values.</p>
<p>Estimating the barcode frequency threshold required knowing the distribution of barcodes in the barcode library. Because the library sequencing was very shallow (most UMIs had a single read), for barcodes with very few UMIs, we could not distinguish whether those barcodes were real barcode/UMI pairs or whether they resulted from PCR errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kebschull and Zador 2015</xref>). Furthermore, many barcodes that had low frequencies in the library (which were ideal for unique labeling) were likely missed from the barcode sequencing. Thus, we could not get an accurate estimate of the distribution for the rare barcodes. However, since double labeling was more likely to occur to barcodes that were more abundant, we only needed to know the distribution of abundant barcodes to find a frequency threshold that can ensure a small number of double labeling events. Thus, we thus used the most abundant 1,820 barcodes (out of 13,211 barcodes observed) in the RVΔG-4mCherry_CCS2_20nt_HM (EnvA) library when estimating the frequency threshold; these 1,820 barcodes each had at least 21 UMI counts and constituted 81.9% of all barcode molecules in this library.</p>

<title>Supplementary Note 1</title>
<p>We tested whether scRNA-seq was sufficient to map single-cell connectivity using barcoded transsynaptic labeling. We first injected a Cre-dependent helper AAV virus combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liu et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lavin et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lavin et al. 2020</xref>) to express TVA (co-expressed with EGFP) and the rabies glycoprotein (co-expressed with mTagBFP2) in Cre-defined populations of cells in VISp (three Sst-IRES-Cre animals and one Vip-IRES-Cre animal). After 14 days, we injected a barcoded ΔG rabies virus library expressing mCherry and pseudotyped with EnvA for selective infection of TVA-expressing neurons. This library contained the same barcodes as the CCS-containing library used for retrograde labeling, with at least 13,211 barcodes. After another seven days, we dissected out the visual cortex, isolated both mTagBFP2+/mCherry+ neurons and mTagBFP2-/mCherry+ neurons using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and performed scRNA-seq on both populations using SMART-Seq v4 (total 295 cells from four animals; <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. S4A</xref></bold>). After quality control, we identified 195 potential presynaptic neurons (defined as expressing rabies viral genes, but not transcripts from both helper AAV-viruses) and 37 potential source neurons (defined as expressing both helper AAV transcripts and the other rabies viral genes) (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. S4B</xref></bold>). Consistent with the Cre lines used, the source neurons were predominantly Sst neurons in the three Sst-IRES-Cre animals, and predominantly Vip neurons in the Vip-IRES-Cre animal (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. S4C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To assess the accuracy of barcode sequencing using scRNA-seq, we compared the distribution of the minimum Hamming distance between barcode pairs in our dataset or a random set of 20-nt barcodes of similar size (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. S4D</xref></bold>). Whereas no random barcodes had minimum Hamming distance of 5 or less, the distribution of minimum Hamming distance for barcodes had two peaks at 1 and 4, respectively. These two peaks likely correspond to sequencing errors and errors resulting from having multiple barcodes per cell. We thus corrected barcodes by allowing up to five mismatches (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We then identified and removed double-labeled networks from the barcoded cells. Double-labeled networks should be largely restricted to barcodes that were abundant in the virus library. We thus estimated the prevalence of these networks based on barcode distribution across different animals: if a barcode was found in multiple animals, then it would be unlikely that it labeled a single source cell in one of the animals. Of 20 unique barcodes in all cells, six barcodes were found in only one animal, whereas eight of the 14 remaining barcodes were found in all four animals (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. S4E</xref></bold>). Consistent with the hypothesis that these barcodes were abundant in the virus library, the frequencies of barcodes found in all four animals ranged from 0.27% to 0.03% (median 0.08%), whereas the frequencies of barcodes that were found in only one animal were all &lt; 0.01% with median at 4×10<sup>−5</sup> (p = 7×10<sup>−4</sup> compared to the frequency of barcodes that were found in all animals using rank sum test; <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. S4F</xref></bold>). Of the six barcodes that were found in only one animal, five were found in a single neuron each, and the remaining barcode was found only in one source neuron and one non-source (i.e., not expressing G) neuron. Thus, after removing barcodes that likely generated double-labeled networks, the remaining barcoded cells were too few to infer connections in these four animals. We attributed this to cell loss from dissociation and FACS that is inherent to the scRNA-seq pipeline.</p>

<title>Supplementary Note 2</title>
<p>In conventional rabies monosynaptic tracing experiments, source cells are usually determined by fluorescent proteins that co-express with the rabies glycoprotein. The <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing procedure we used did not robustly preserve fluorescence in the tissue, so we detected the transcripts of the rabies glycoprotein to identify source cells. Because we did not know how RNA transcript levels relate to visible co-expression of fluorescent proteins, we varied the threshold above which we considered a cell to express the glycoprotein and examined the composition of cell types within this population (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5B</xref></bold>). We reasoned that since corticostriatal neurons mainly consisted of deep layer excitatory neurons, an equivalent threshold in the glycoprotein transcript should result in cells that were mostly deep-layer IT neurons and L5 ET neuron, but not L6 CT neurons or inhibitory neurons. At a low threshold, the labeled cells contained a large portion of inhibitory neurons; as we increased the threshold, inhibitory neurons were preferentially removed compared to excitatory neurons. With a threshold of 12 glycoprotein reads per cell, the labeled cells were predominantly L5 ET neurons, and L6 IT neurons. Based on these results, we considered a glycoprotein read count of about 12 as equivalent to having visible fluorescence in a conventional experiment.</p>
<p>Although neurons with fewer than 12 glycoprotein reads per cell likely did not transmit the rabies virus efficiently, they may still contribute to smaller barcode-sharing networks. Because these barcode-sharing networks could either be connected-source networks (i.e., if a source cell with few glycoprotein reads was presynaptic to another source cell) or double-labeled networks (i.e., if a source cell with few glycoprotein reads was independently infected with the same barcode as another source cell), removing these cells from the population of source cells would convert these networks into single-source networks and confound the interpretation of synaptic connectivity at cellular resolution. Using a lower threshold would potentially include false positive source cells that did not pass the barcodes to other neurons. Such neurons, however, would not contribute to barcode-sharing networks. Thus, to ensure the single-cell resolution in our analyses, we used a conservative threshold of two glycoprotein reads per cell to identify potential source cells. Using this threshold, potential source cells remained largely mostly in layer 5, suggesting that corticostriatal neurons remained enriched using this conservative threshold (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To assess whether the labeling patterns in the barcoded trans-synaptic labeling experiment was reasonable, we performed a control experiment in an animal that was injected in parallel as the barcoded trans-synaptic labeling experiment (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). We then examined fluorescent protein expression in this animal (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5D</xref></bold>). In a coronal section that included the injection site (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5D, <italic>left</italic></xref></bold>), neurons were broadly infected by rabies virus and expressed mCherry from the rabies genome. Sparser labeling was seen in the striatum and in medial cortical areas (motor cortex and anterior cingulate cortex). In a second coronal section that was about 1 mm posterior to the injection site (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5D, <italic>right</italic></xref></bold>), more labeling was seen in the auditory cortex and areas of the thalamus that roughly corresponded to posterior complex of the thalamus and the ventral posteromedial nucleus (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5D, <italic>inset</italic></xref></bold>), which were known to project to the primary somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harris et al. 2019</xref>). Thus, the labeling pattern was largely consistent with the input patterns of the primary somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harris et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined the spatial distribution of potential source cells. Consistent with the fact that L5 neurons are enriched for corticostriatal projections, most BFP-expressing cells were found in L5 (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5E, <italic>middle</italic></xref></bold>). The area that most BFP-expressing cells were found, however, only partially overlapped with the region with the bulk of mCherry-expressing rabies-infected cells, which appeared to be centered around the injection site in the cortex based on the depression on the cortical surface(<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5E, <italic>right</italic></xref></bold>). Thus, the spatial pattern of BFP expression was consistent with retrograde labeling from the striatum, but they only partially overlapped with the rabies virus injection in the cortex. This partial overlap likely contributed to the sparseness of neurons that were trans-synaptically labeled in distant areas (e.g., in the thalamus). Furthermore, because presynaptic neurons are usually centered around the source cells in the same cortical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wertz et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yao et al. 2023</xref>), we speculate that a large fraction of rabies-infected neurons likely resulted from direct infections that were independent from source cells (i.e., forming no-source networks). These analyses are consistent with the high number of no-source networks observed in the barcoded experiment.</p>

<p>In this preprint, Zhang et al. describe a new tool for mapping the connectivity of mouse neurons. Essentially, the tool leverages the known peculiar infection capabilities of Rabies virus: once injected into a specific site in the brain, this virus has the capability to &quot;walk upstream&quot; the neural circuits, both within cells and across cells: on one hand, the virus can enter from a nerve terminal and infect retrogradely the cell body of the same cell (retrograde transport). On the other hand, the virus can also sometimes spread to the presynaptic partners of the initial target cells, via retrograde viral transmission.</p>
<p>Similarly to previously published approaches with other viruses, the authors engineer a complex library of viral variants, each carrying a unique sequence ('barcode'), so they can uniquely label and distinguish independent infection events and their specific presynaptic connections, and show that it is possible to read these barcodes in-situ, producing spatial connectivity maps. They also show that it is possible to read these barcodes together with endogenous mRNAs, and that this allows spatial mapping of cell types together with anatomical connectivity.</p>
<p>The main novelty of this work lies in the combined use of rabies virus for retrograde labeling together with barcoding and in-situ readout. Previous studies had used rabies virus for retrograde labeling, albeit with low multiplexing capabilities, so only a handful of circuits could be traced at the same time. Other studies had instead used barcoded viral libraries for connectivity mapping, but mostly focused on the use of different viruses for labeling individual projections (anterograde tracing) and never used a retrograde-infective virus.</p>
<p>The authors creatively merge these two bits of technology into a powerful genetic tool, and extensively and convincingly validate its performance against known anatomical knowledge. The authors also do a very good job at highlighting and discussing potential points of failure in the methods.</p>
<p>Unresolved questions, which more broadly affect also other viral-labeling methods, are for example how to deal with uneven tropism (ie. if the virus is unable or inefficient in infecting some specific parts of the brain), or how to prevent the cytotoxicity induced by the high levels of viral replication and expression, which will tend to produce &quot;no source networks&quot;, neural circuits whose initial cell can't be identified because it's dead. This last point is particularly relevant for in-situ based approaches: while high expression levels are desirable for the particular barcode detection chemistry the authors chose to use (gap-filling), they are also potentially detrimental for cell survival, and risk producing extensive cell death (which indeed the authors single out as a detectable pitfall in their analysis). This is likely to be one the major optimisation space for future implementations of this barcoding approach.</p>
<p>Overall the paper is well balanced, the data are well presented and the conclusions are strongly supported by the data. Impact-wise, the method is definitely going to be very useful for the neurobiology community.</p>

<p>Although the trans-synaptic tracing method mediated by the rabies virus (RV) has been widely utilized to infer input connectivity across the brain to a genetically defined population in mice, the analysis of labeled pre-synaptic neurons in terms of cell-type has been primarily reliant on classical low-throughput histochemical techniques. In this study, the authors made a significant advance toward high-throughput transcriptomic (TC) cell typing by both dissociated single-cell RNAseq and the spatial TC method known as BARseq to decode a vast array of molecularly labeled (&quot;barcoded&quot;) RV vector library. First, they demonstrated that a barcoded RV vector can be employed as a simple retrograde tracer akin to AAVretro. Second, they provided a theoretical classification of neural networks at the single-cell resolution that can be attained through barcoded-RV and concluded that the identification of the vast majority (ideally 100%) of starter cells (the origin of RV-based trans-synaptic tracing) is essential for the inference of single-cell resolution neural connectivity. Taking this into consideration, the authors opted for the BARseq-based spatial TC that could, in principle, capture all the starter cells. Finally, they demonstrated the proof-of-concept in the somatosensory cortex, including infrared connectivity from 381 putative pre-synaptic partners to 31 uniquely barcoded-starter cells, as well as many insightful estimations of input convergence at the cell-type resolution in vivo. Collectively, this work will establish a cornerstone for future advancements in rabies-barcode technology.</p>
<p>This revised version incorporates imaging data to assess the stringency of identifying the starter cells in comparison with conventional protein-based detection methods. Additionally, it encompasses insightful discussions concerning potential limitations and offers perspectives on future improvements. The method section is systematically subdivided with subsection numbers, facilitating the cross-referencing of the corresponding sections in the main text and figure legends. I posit that adopting this stylistic approach as the standard for manuscripts delineating innovative methodological strides would be prudent. The clarity of the figure legends has been significantly enhanced, contributing to a more accessible understanding of the figure panels. In sum, this manuscript is articulate and thorough, epitomizing scientific rigor.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Zhang and colleagues attempts to combine genetically barcoded rabies viruses with spatial transcriptomics in order to genetically identify connected pairs. The major shortcoming with the application of a barcoded rabies virus, as reported by 2 groups prior, is that with the high dropout rate inherent in single cell procedures, it is difficult to definitively identify connected pairs. By combining the two methods, they are able to establish a platform for doing that, and provide insight into connectivity, as well as pros and cons of their method, which is well thought out and balanced.</p>
<p>The authors did a nice job of addressing my comments which mainly centered around the presentation of data, specificity, and wording.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This important study combines genetically barcoded rabies viruses with spatial transcriptomics in vivo in the mouse brain to decode connectivity of neural circuits. The data generated by the combination of these approaches in this new way is mostly convincing as the authors provide validation and proof-of-concept that the approach can be successful. While this new combination of established techniques has promise for elucidating brain connectivity, there are still some nuances and caveats to the interpretations of the results that are lacking especially with regards to noting unexpected barcodes either due to unexpected/novel connections or unexpected rabies spread.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this revised manuscript, we added a new control experiment and additional analyses to address two main questions from the reviewers: (1) How the threshold of glycoprotein transcript counts used to identify source cells was determined, and (2) whether the limited long-range labeling was expected in the trans-synaptic experiment. The new experiments and analyses validated the distribution of source cells and presynaptic cells observed in the original barcoded transsynaptic tracing experiment and validated the choice of the threshold of glycoprotein transcripts. As the reviewers suggested, we also included additional discussion on how future experiments can improve upon this study, including strategies to improve source cell survival and minimizing viral infection caused by leaky expression of TVA. We also provided additional clarification on the analyses for both the retrograde labeling experiment and the trans-synaptic tracing experiment. We modified the Results and Discussion sections on the trans-synaptic tracing experiment to improve clarity to general readers. Detailed changes to address specific comments by reviewers are included below.</p>

<p>Unresolved questions, which more broadly affect also other viral-labeling methods, are for example how to deal with uneven tropism (ie. if the virus is unable or inefficient in infecting some specific parts of the brain), or how to prevent the cytotoxicity induced by the high levels of viral replication and expression, which will tend to produce &quot;no source networks&quot;, neural circuits whose initial cell can't be identified because it's dead.

</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer suggested, we included additional discussion about tropism and cytotoxicity in the revised Discussion. Our sensitivity for barcode detection is sufficient, since we estimated (based on manual proofreading) that most barcoded neurons had more than ten counts of a barcode in the trans-synaptic tracing experiment. The high sensitivity may potentially allow us to adapt next-generation rabies virus with low replication, such as the third generation ΔL rabies virus (Jin et al, 2022, biorxiv) in future optimizations.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Although the trans-synaptic tracing method mediated by the rabies virus (RV) has been widely utilized to infer input connectivity across the brain to a genetically defined population in mice, the analysis of labeled pre-synaptic neurons in terms of cell-type has been primarily reliant on classical low-throughput histochemical techniques. In this study, the authors made a significant advance toward high-throughput transcriptomic (TC) cell typing by both dissociated single-cell RNAseq and the spatial TC method known as BARseq to decode a vast array of molecularly labeled (&quot;barcoded&quot;) RV vector library. First, they demonstrated that a barcoded-RV vector can be employed as a simple retrograde tracer akin to AAVretro. Second, they provided a theoretical classification of neural networks at the single-cell resolution that can be attained through barcoded-RV and concluded that the identification of the vast majority (ideally 100%) of starter cells (the origin of RV-based trans-synaptic tracing) is essential for the inference of single-cell resolution neural connectivity. Taking this into consideration, the authors opted for the BARseq-based spatial TC that could, in principle, capture all the starter cells. Finally, they demonstrated the proof-of-concept in the somatosensory cortex, including infrared connectivity from 381 putative pre-synaptic partners to 31 uniquely barcoded-starter cells, as well as many insightful estimations of input convergence at the cell-type resolution in vivo. While the manuscript encompasses significant technical and theoretical advances, it may be challenging for the general readers of eLife to comprehend. The following comments are offered to enhance the manuscript's clarity and readability.</p>
<p>We modified the Results and Discussion sections on the trans-synaptic tracing experiment to improve clarity to general readers. We separated out the theoretical discussion about barcode sharing networks as a separate subsection, explicitly stated the rationale of how different barcode sharing networks are distinguished in the in situ trans-synaptic tracing experiment, and added additional discussion on future optimizations. Detailed descriptions are provided below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>1. I find it difficult to comprehend the rationale behind labeling inhibitory neurons in the VISp through long-distance retrograde labeling from the VISal or Thalamus (Fig. 2F, I and Fig. S3) since long-distance projectors in the cortex are nearly 100% excitatory neurons. It is also unclear why such a large number of inhibitory neurons was labeled at a long distance through RV vector injections into the RSP/SC or VISal (Fig. 3K). Furthermore, a significant number of inhibitory starter cells in the somatosensory cortex was generated based on their projection to the striatum (Fig. 5H), which is unexpected given our current understanding of the cortico-striatum projections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The labeling of inhibitory neurons can be explained by several factors in the three different experiments.</p>
<p>(1) In the scRNAseq-based retrograde labeling experiment (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3), the injection site VISal is adjacent to VISp. Because we dissected VISp for single-cell RNAseq, we may find labeled inhibitory neurons at the VISp border that extend short axons into VISal. We explained this in the revised Results.</p>
<p>(2) In the in situ sequencing-based retrograde labeling experiment (Fig. 3,4), the proximity between the two injection sites VISal and RSP/SC, and the sequenced areas (which included not only VISp but also RSP) could also contribute to labeling through local axons of inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, because we also sequenced midbrain regions, inhibitory neurons in the superior colliculus could pick up the barcodes through local axons. We included an explanation of this in the revised Results.</p>
<p>(3) In the trans-synaptic tracing experiment, we speculate that low level leaky expression from the TREtight promoter led to non-Cre-dependent expression in many neurons. To test this hypothesis, we first performed a control injection in which we saw that the fluorescent protein expression were indeed restricted to layer 5, as expected from corticostriatal labeling. Based on the labeling pattern, we estimated that about 12 copies of the glycoprotein transcript per cell would likely be needed to achieve fluorescent protein expression. Since many source cells in our experiment were below this threshold, these results support the hypothesis that the majority of source cells with low level expression of the glycoprotein were likely Cre-independent. Because these cells could still contribute to barcode sharing networks, we could not exclude them as in a conventional bulk trans-synaptic tracing experiment. In future experiments, we can potentially reduce this population by improving the helper AAV viruses used to express TVA and the glycoprotein. We included this explanation in Results and more detailed analysis in Supplementary Note 2, and discussed potential future optimizations in the Discussion.
This new analysis in Supplementary Note 2 is also related to the Reviewer’s question regarding the threshold used for determining source cells (see below).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. It is unclear as to why the authors did not perform an analysis of the barcodes in Fig. 2. Given that the primary objective of this manuscript is to evaluate the effectiveness of multiplexing barcoded technology in RV vectors, I would strongly recommend that the authors provide a detailed description of the barcode data here, including any technical difficulties or limitations encountered, which will be of great value in the future design of RV-barcode technologies. In case the barcode data are not included in Fig. 2, I would suggest that the authors consider excluding Fig. 2 and Fig. S1-S3 in their entirety from the manuscript to enhance its readability for general readers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the single-cell RNAseq-based retrograde tracing, all barcodes recovered matched to known barcodes in the corresponding library. We included a short description of these results in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Regarding the trans-synaptic tracing utilizing a barcoded RV vector in conjunction with BARseq decoding (Fig. 5), which is the core of this manuscript, I have a few specific questions/comments. First, the rationale behind defining cells with only two rolonies counts of rabies glycoprotein (RG) as starter cells is unclear. Why did the authors not analyze the sample based on the colocalization of GFP (from the AAV) and mCherry (from the RV) proteins, which is a conventional method to define starter cells? If this approach is technically difficult, the authors could provide an independent histochemical assessment of the detection stringency of GFP positive cells based on two or more colonies of RG.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In situ sequencing does not preserve fluorescent protein signals, so we used transcript counts to determine which cells expressed the glycoprotein. We have added new analyses in the Results and in Supplementary Note 2 to determine the transcript counts that were equivalent to cells that had detectable BFP expression. We found that BFP expression is equivalent to ~12 counts of the glycoprotein transcript per cell, which is much higher than the threshold we used. However, we could not solely rely on this estimate to define the source cells, because cells that had lower expression of the glycoprotein (possibly from leaky Cre-independent expression) may still pass the barcodes to presynaptic cells. This can lead to an underestimation of double-labeled and connected-source networks and an overestimation of single-source networks and can obscure synaptic connectivity at the cellular resolution. We thus used a very conservative threshold of two transcripts in the analysis. This conservative threshold will likely overestimate the number of source cells that shared barcodes and underestimate the number of single-source networks. Since this is a first study of barcoded transsynaptic tracing in vivo, we chose to err on the conservative side to make sure that the subsequent analysis has single-cell resolution. Future characterization and optimization may lead to a better threshold to fully utilize data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Second, it is difficult to interpret the proportion of the 2,914 barcoded cells that were linked to barcoded starter cells (single-source, double-labeled, or connected-source) and those that remained orphan (no-source or lost-source). A simple table or bar graph representation would be helpful. The abundance of the no-source network (resulting from Cre-independent initial infection of the RV vector) can be estimated in independent negative control experiments that omit either Cre injection or AAV-RG injection. The latter, if combined with BARseq decoding, can provide an experimental prediction of the frequency of double-labeled events since connected-source networks are not labeled in the absence of RG.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added Table 2, which breaks down the 2,914 barcoded cells based on whether they are presynaptic or source cells, and which type of network they belong to. We agree with the reviewer that the additional Cre- or RG- control experiments in parallel would allow an independent estimate of the double labeled networks and the no-source networks. We have included added a discussion of possible controls to further optimize the trans-synaptic tracing approach in future studies in the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Third, I would appreciate more quantitative data on the putative single-source network (Fig. 5I and S6) in terms of the distribution of pre- and post-synaptic TC cell types. The majority of labeling appeared to occur locally, with only two thalamic neurons observed in sample 25311842 (Fig. S6). How many instances of long-distance labeling (for example, &gt; 500 microns away from the injection site) were observed in total? Is this low efficiency of long-distance labeling expected based on the utilized combinations of AAVs and RV vectors? A simple independent RV tracing solely detecting mCherry would be useful for evaluating the labeling efficiency of the method. I have experienced similar &quot;less jump&quot; RV tracing when RV particles were prepared in a single step, as this study did, rather than multiple rounds of amplification in traditional protocols, such as Osakada F et al Nat Protocol 2013.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We imaged an animal that was injected in parallel to assess labeling (now included in Supplementary Note 2 and Supp. Fig. S5). The labeling pattern in the newly imaged animal was largely consistent with the results from the barcoded experiment: most labeled neurons were seen in the vicinity of the injection site, and sparser labeling was seen in other cortical areas and the thalamus. We further found that most neurons that were labeled in the thalamus were about 1 mm posterior to the center of the injection site, and thus would not have been sequenced in the in situ sequencing experiment (in which we sequenced about 640 µm of tissue spanning the injection site).</p>
<p>In addition, we found that the bulk of the cells that expressed mCherry from the rabies virus only partially overlapped with the area that contained cells co-expressing BFP with the rabies glycoprotein. Moreover, very few cells co-expressed mCherry and BFP, which would be considered source cells in a conventional mono-synaptic tracing experiment. The small numbers of source cells likely also contributed to the sparseness of long-range labeling in the barcoded experiment.</p>
<p>These interpretations and comparisons to the barcoded experiment are now included in Supplementary Note 2.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Zhang and colleagues attempts to combine genetically barcoded rabies viruses with spatial transcriptomics in order to genetically identify connected pairs. The major shortcoming with the application of a barcoded rabies virus, as reported by 2 groups prior, is that with the high dropout rate inherent in single cell procedures, it is difficult to definitively identify connected pairs. By combining the two methods, they are able to establish a platform for doing that, and provide insight into connectivity, as well as pros and cons of their method, which is well thought out and balanced.</p>
<p>Overall the manuscript is well-done, but I have a few minor considerations about tone and accuracy of statements, as well as some limitations in how experiments were done. First, the idea of using rabies to obtain broader tropism than AAVs isn't really accurate - each virus has its own set of tropisms, and it isn't clear that rabies is broader (or can be made to be broader).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer suggested, we toned down this claim and stated that rabies virus has different tropism to complement AAV.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Second, rabies does not label all neurons that project to a target site - it labels some fraction of them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We meant to say that retrograde labeling is not restricted to labeling neurons from a certain brain region. We have clarified in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Third, the high rate of rabies virus mutation should be considered - if it is, or is not a problem in detecting barcodes with high fidelity, this should be noted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our analysis showed that sequencing 15 bases was sufficient to tolerate a small number of mismatches in the barcode sequences and could distinguish real barcodes from random sequences (Fig. 4A). Thus, we can tolerate mutations in the barcode sequence. We have clarified this in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fourth, there are a number of implicit assumptions in this manuscript, not all of which are equally backed up by data. For example, it is not clear that all rabies virus transmission is synaptic specific; in fact, quite a few studies argue that it is not (e.g., detection of rabies transcripts in glial cells). Thus, arguments about lost-source networks and the idea that if a cell is lost from the network, that will stop synaptic transmission, is not clear. There is also the very real propensity that, the sicker a starter cell gets, the more non-specific spread of virus (e.g., via necrosis) occurs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that how strictly virus transmission is restricted to synapses remains a hotly debated question in the field, and this question is relevant not only to techniques based on barcoded rabies tracing, but to all trans-synaptic tracing experiments. A barcoding-based approach can generate single-cell data that enable direct comparison to other data modalities that measure synaptic connectivity, such as multi-patch and EM. These future experiments may provide additional insights into the questions that the reviewer raised. We have included additional discussion about how non-synaptic transmission of barcodes because of the necrosis of source cells may affect the analysis in the Discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding the scenario in which the source cell dies, we agree with the reviewer and have clarified in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fifth, in the experiments performed in Figure 5, the authors used a FLEx-TVA expressed via a
retrograde Cre, and followed this by injection of their rabies virus library. The issue here is that there will be many (potentially thousands) of local infection events near the injection site that TVA-mediated but are Cre-dependent (=off-target expression of TVA in the absence of Cre). This is a major confound in interpreting the labeling of these cells. They may express very low levels of TVA, but still have infection be mediated by TVA. The authors did not clearly explore how expression of TVA related to rabies virus infection of cells near the rabies injection site. A modified version of TVA, such as 66T, should have been used to mitigate this issue. Otherwise, it is impossible to determine connectivity locally. The authors do not go to great lengths to interpret the findings of these observations, so I am not sure this is a critical issue, but it should be pointed out by the authors as a caveat to their dataset.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that this type of infection could potentially be a major contributor to no-source networks, which were abundant in our experiment. Because small no-source networks were excluded from our analyses, and large no-source networks were only included for barcodes with low frequency (i.e., it would be nearly impossible statistically to generate such large no-source networks from independent infections), we believe that the effect of independent infections on our analyses were minimized. We have added a control experiment in Fig S5 and Supplementary Note 2, which further supported the hypothesis that there were many independent infections. We also included additional discussion about how this can be assessed and optimized in future studies in the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Sixth, the authors are making estimates of rabies spread by comparison to a set of experiments that was performed quite differently. In the two studies cited (Liu et al., done the standard way, and Wertz et al., tracing from a single cell), the authors were likely infecting with a rabies virus using a high multiplicity of infection, which likely yields higher rates of viral expression in these starter cells and higher levels of input labeling. However, in these experiments, the authors need to infect with a low MOI, and explicitly exclude cells with &gt;1 barcode. Having only a single virion trigger infection of starter cells will likely reduce the #s of inputs relative to starter neurons. Thus, the stringent criteria for excluding small networks may not be entirely warranted. If the authors wish to only explore larger networks, this caveat should be explicitly noted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the trans-synaptic labeling experiment, we actually used high rabies titer (200 nL, 7.6e10 iu/mL) that was comparable to conventional rabies tracing experiments. We did not exclude cells with multiple barcodes (as opposed to barcodes in multiple source cells), because we could resolve multiple barcodes in the same cell and indeed found many cells with multiple barcodes. We have clarified this in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, if the caveats above are noted and more nuance is added to some of the interpretation and discussion of results, this would greatly help the manuscript, as readers will be looking to the authors as the authority on how to use this technology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In addition to addressing the specific concerns of the reviewer as described above, we modified the Results and Discussion sections on the trans-synaptic tracing experiment to improve clarity to general readers and expanded the discussion on future optimizations.</p>

<p>The scientific problem is clearly stated and well laid out, the data are clearly presented, and the experiments well justified and nicely discussed. It was overall a very enjoyable read.  The figures are generally nice and clear, however, I find the legends excessively concise. A bit too often, they just sort of introduce the title of the panel rather than a proper explanation of what it is depicted. A clear case is for example visible in Fig 2, where the description of the panels is minimal, but this is a general trend of the manuscript. This makes the figures a bit hard to follow as self-contained entities, without having to continuously go back to the main text. I think this could be improved with longer and more helpful descriptions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised all figure legends to make them more descriptive.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Other minor things:</p>
<p>In the cDNA synthesis step for in-situ sequencing, I believe the authors might have forgotten one detail: the addition of aminoallyl dUTP to the RT reaction. If I recall correctly this is done in BARseq. The fact that the authors crosslink with BS-PEG on day 2, makes me suspect they spike in these nucleotides during the RT but this is not specified in the relevant step. Perhaps this is a mistake that needs correction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The RT primers we used have an amine group at 5’, which directly allows crosslinking. Thus, we did not need to spike in aminoallyl dUTP in the RT reaction. We have clarified this in the Methods.</p>

<p>We included a separate subsection on the sequencing of rabies libraries and the analysis of the sequencing depth in the Methods.

<p>We corrected the typo in K, further clarified the “Area” labels, and changed the “S” label in 4K to “−”.
