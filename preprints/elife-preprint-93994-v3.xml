<abstract><p>Foraging in the wild requires coordinated switching of critical functions, including goal-oriented navigation and context-appropriate action selection. Nevertheless, few studies have examined how different functions are represented in the brain during naturalistic foraging. To address this question, we recorded multiple single-unit activities from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats seeking a sucrose reward in the presence of an unpredictable attack posed by a robotic predator (Lobsterbot). Simultaneously recorded ensemble activities from neurons were analyzed in reference to various behavioral indices as the animal moved freely across the foraging area (F) between the nest (N) and the goal (E) area. An artificial neural network, trained with simultaneously recorded neural activity, estimated the rat’s current distance from the Lobsterbot. The accuracy of distance estimation was the highest in the middle F-zone in which the dominant behavior was active navigation. The spatial encoding persisted in the N-zone when non-navigational behaviors such as grooming, rearing, and sniffing were excluded. In contrast, the accuracy decreased as the animal approached the E-zone, when the activity of the same neuronal ensembles was more correlated with events related to dynamic decision-making between food procurement and Lobsterbot evasion. A population-wide analysis confirmed highly heterogeneous encoding by the region. To further assess the decision-related activity in the E-zone, a naïve Bayesian classifier was trained to predict the success and failure of avoidance behavior. The classifier predicted the avoidance outcome as much as 6 s before the head withdrawal. In addition, two sub-populations of recorded units with distinct temporal dynamics contributed differently to the prediction. These findings suggest that an overlapping population of mPFC neurons may switch between two heterogenous modes, encoding relevant locations for goal-directed navigation or an imminent situational challenge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Foraging in nature entails context-appropriate action selection to resolve a mixture of challenges, including risk and value assessment, maintenance of goal-oriented navigation, and task-switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pyke et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stephens &amp; Krebs, 1986</xref>). For example, foraging animals must update the value of the goal in a space-time domain, negotiate threats while obtaining food, and regulate various stimulus-driven defensive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fanselow &amp; Lester, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mobbs et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mobbs &amp; Kim, 2015</xref>). These survival-related demands require executive functions capable of flexibly updating risk and value representations in working memory to adapt to the foraging environment. Numerous studies have identified the prefrontal cortex as a primary computational hub for hosting multiple strategies and integrating survival-related information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fuster, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Korn &amp; Bach, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>A critical component of successful foraging is goal-directed navigation. Although the hippocampus (HIPP) is crucial for maintaining reward location and path planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jarzebowski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nyberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wikenheiser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wikenheiser &amp; Redish, 2015</xref>), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and its interaction with the HIPP also play a role in goal-directed navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Guise &amp; Shapiro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sapiurka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, given that the mPFC is involved in processing deliberate defensive strategies in multiple situations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mobbs et al., 2020</xref> for review), naturalistic foraging where risk and reward coexist may serve as a suitable foundation for exploring adaptive information processing in the mPFC. Notably, mPFC houses spatially selective neurons that represent relative positions in a maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaefer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang &amp; Mailman, 2018</xref>), goal locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hok et al., 2005</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Böhm &amp; Lee, 2020</xref>), and precise Cartesian coordinates during food procurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mashhoori et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The mPFC also processes emotional stimuli, especially those signaling environmental threats. Through its extensive connections with the major limbic areas including the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gabbott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hoover &amp; Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Vertes, 2004</xref>), the mPFC is causally linked to both learning and expression of fear responses. For example, the infralimbic cortex (IL) of the mPFC is associated with the extinction of conditioned fear response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Park &amp; Choi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, the activation of the prelimbic cortex (PL) is linked to the expression of fear-conditioned responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burgos-Robles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dejean et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">M. M. Diehl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, PL neurons show increased activity in response to survival-related stimuli such as food, artificial predators, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). These findings suggest that the critical information for risky decision-making might be represented and processed in the mPFC.</p>
<p>Currently, there is limited understanding of how the brain organizes navigation and behavior selections during naturalistic foraging. It is unclear whether spatial representation and emotional processing are separated at the single neuron level or coexist within overlapping populations of the mPFC neurons. In this study, we devised a naturalistic foraging task which allowed self-initiated shuttling between different locations and require avoiding an unpredictable attack by a robotic predator while approaching sucrose. This approach allowed continuous monitoring of the neural activity as the rat switched between navigation and strategic reward procurement. Machine learning-based populational decoding methods, alongside single-cell analyses, were employed to investigate the correlations between neuronal activity and a range of behavioral indices across different sections within the foraging arena.</p>

<title>Mix of avoidance and escape behaviors during naturalistic foraging under threat</title>
<p>The foraging arena, modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kimm &amp; Choi (2018)</xref>, was designed to encourage naturalistic foraging that involved both approaching food and avoiding threat. The arena was divided into two distinctive zones by a wall with a pass-through opening in the middle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>): the foraging (F) and the nest (N) zones. At one end of the F-zone, a motorized gate controlled the access to the robot compartment, which contained a sucrose port and the predator-like “Lobsterbot”, named for its large, claw-like arms. Entry into the sucrose port was detected by a beam sensor mounted near the gate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). A semicircular area surrounding the robot compartment was designated as the encounter (E) zone where the rat’s body was located during sucrose licking and Lobsterbot attack.</p>

<p>The experiment comprises three distinct phases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>): habituation, shuttling, and Lobsterbot phase. The Lobsterbot phase was further divided into early and late phases separated by the time of surgery. During the habituation phase, a food-deprived rat was acclimated to the sucrose port that released sucrose solution. The lick port was activated by an IR-beam sensor, triggering the solenoid valve when the beam was interrupted. The rat gradually learned to obtain rewards by continuously licking the port. Once the rat maintained a stable licking frequency, typically after 3 days, the shuttling phase began.</p>
<p>In the shuttling phase, rats were trained to shuttle between zones to obtain sucrose. The robot compartment’s gate closed six seconds after the first lick and reopened only when the rat returned to the N-zone. After three days of shuttling phase, the Lobsterbot phase was introduced. During this phase, the robot executed a fast-striking attack, 3 s (30%) or 6 s (70%) from the first lick, with the timing randomized across trials to mimic natural uncertainty and prevent simple time-counting strategies. As in the shuttling phase, the gate closed automatically after the attack, and the rat must return to the N-zone to reopen it.</p>
<p>In each trial of the Lobsterbot phase, the foraging rat could respond with either <bold>avoidance withdrawal</bold> (AW: head retraction before the attack) or <bold>escape withdrawal</bold> (EW: reflexive head retraction after the attack; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> illustrates a representative sequence of responses and events in two consecutive trials. AW was marked by a distinct interval between head withdrawal (end of the blue shade) and the attack (red line), whereas EW was characterized by overlap between the attack and the animal’s presence in the E-zone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Video 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>We examined head withdrawal timepoints to assess whether rats developed a temporal strategy to differentiate between the 3 sand 6 s attack trials. No such strategy was observed; premature withdrawals during 6 s trials were evenly distributed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p>All five rats exhibited distinctive phasic behavioral changes. Notably, approach attempts (number of trials) dropped sharply during the first Lobsterbot session (Lob1), then stabilized in later sessions after the surgery (starting from Lob4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). Similar phasic patterns were observed in the number of licks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>), licks per trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>) and lick latency after gate opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure S2D</xref>). Comparing the last shuttling session (Sht3) with all pre-surgery Lobsterbot sessions (Lob1-Lob3) revealed significant changes in approach attempts (Friedman test; χ²(3)=9.240, p=.017), licks (χ²(3)=12.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001), lick latency (χ²(3)=7.800, <italic>p</italic> =.044), and licks per trial (χ²(3)=13.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001). Specifically, both licks and licks per trial decreased during Lob1 (Dunn’s multiple comparisons test; <italic>p</italic>=.021; <italic>p</italic>=.043) and returned to shuttling-phase levels by Lob3 (<italic>p</italic>&gt;.999 for both).</p>
<p>In the early sessions of the Lobsterbot phase, the rats displayed passive defensive behaviors such as freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Blanchard &amp; Blanchard, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McClelland &amp; Colman, 1967</xref>) and stretched-attend posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grewal et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mackintosh &amp; Grant, 1963</xref>). These behaviors diminished toward the middle of the phase. Compared to the shuttling phase—where rats typically licked until the gate closed on nearly all trials (88.96%), the Lobsterbot phase featured a mix of AW and EW trials (65.11% and 34.89% respectively). Due to the transient drop in approach attempts and the variety of defensive responses following initial threat exposure, surgery was performed after three Lobsterbot sessions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Population activity in the mPFC predicts the distance from the Lobsterbot while navigating in the arena</title>
<p>Recording data were collected from a total of five rats implanted with a custom-made moveable tetrode drive. The tetrodes were initially implanted in the PL and advanced ventrally toward the IL at the end of each session (0.1∼0.2 mm/session). Recording locations were reversely calculated from the marking lesion made after the last recording session. Tetrode tracks were identified by visual inspection under a microscope as indicated by black vertical lines on the matching atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Paxinos &amp; Watson, 2007</xref>) as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. All tetrodes except for one spanned both the PL and the IL. After cluster cutting and preprocessing (see Materials and Methods), 632 units (57 ∼ 198 units per rat) from the PL (n = 379) and the IL (n = 253) were selected for ensemble analysis.</p>

<p>Previous studies have reported spatial correlates were observed in multiple subregions of the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hok et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jung et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mashhoori et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sauer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>). To determine whether location-specific neural activity exists at the single-cell level in our dataset, a traditional place map was constructed for individual neurons. Although most neurons did not show cohesive place fields, a few neurons modulated their firing rates based on the rat’s current location. However, even these neurons were not comparable to place cells in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">O’Keefe &amp; Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>) or grid cells in the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>) as the place fields were patchy and irregular in some cases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; Units 66 and 125) or too broad, spanning the entire zone rather than a discrete location within it (Units 26 and 56). The latter type of neuron has been identified in other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaefer et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Since we did not find neural activity that can be mapped straight onto the spatial layout of the arena based on individual activity, we performed machine-learning (ML) analysis targeting all recorded units during the given session. Among various machine learning algorithms, we selected a robust tool for decoding underlying patterns in the data, rather than to model the architecture of the mPFC. We implemented a four-layer artificial neural network regressor (ANN; see Materials and Methods for a detailed structure), as the ANN achieves significantly lower decoding errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>) and has robustness to hyperparameter changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Glaser et al., 2020</xref>). The inputs to the regressor were the simultaneously recorded neural activity which was segmented into 50-ms bins and the predicted output was the distance between the rat’s head and the center of the E-zone where reward and threat co-exist (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis of trained ANNs revealed that the distance from the rat to the center of the E-zone can be decoded from the mPFC ensemble activity. Compared to the control regressor trained on a shuffled dataset, the regressor with original data showed significantly lower errors (paired t-test, <italic>t</italic>(39) = 10.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001). However, we did not observe a difference in decoding accuracy between the PL and IL ensembles, and there were no significant interactions between regressor type (shuffled vs. original) and regions (mixed-effects model; regions: <italic>p</italic>=.996; interaction: <italic>p</italic>=.782). These results indicate that the population activity in both the PL and IL contains spatial information (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Video 3</xref>). Overall accuracy measured by mean absolute error (MAE) was 16.61 (± 3.67) cm, which was slightly higher than values from previous reports employing different spatial tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mashhoori et al., 2018</xref>). This reduced accuracy may reflect the smaller number of neurons per ensemble in our dataset (mean = 15.8) relative to prior studies. Given the properties of algorithm, we expect that larger ensembles would improve performance.</p>
<p>We next asked whether the decoding accuracy varied with movement directions. Specifically, we compared the decoding accuracy of the regressor for outbound (from the N-to E-zone) vs. inbound (from the E- to N- zone) navigation within the F-zone. There was no significant difference in decoding accuracy between outbound vs. inbound trips (paired <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>t</italic>(39) = 1.52, <italic>p</italic> =.136), indicating that the stability of spatial encoding was maintained regardless of the moving direction or perceived context (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>One potential concern is that the decoder might rely on visual cues or zone-specific behaviors (e.g., Lobsterbot confrontation or licking) rather than spatial signal per se. To rule out this possibility, we analyzed a subset of data collected when the compartment door was closed, preventing visual access to the Lobsterbot and sucrose port and limiting active foraging behavior. Even under these conditions, the regressor decoded distance with a MAE of 12.14 (± 3.046) cm (paired <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>t</italic>(39) = 12.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001). Notably, the regressor’s performance was significantly higher with this subset than with the full dataset (paired <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>t</italic>(39) = 9.895, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001). In summary, these findings indicate ensemble activity in the mPFC contains sufficient spatial information, detectable through ML-based decoding.</p>

<title>Removing the Lobsterbot decreases spatial decoding accuracy</title>
<p>Earlier studies have suggested that PL neurons do not exhibit any spatially correlated firing patterns in an empty round apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Poucet, 1997</xref>). This absence of spatial correlates may result from a lack of complex goal-oriented navigation behavior, which requires deliberate planning to acquire more rewards and avoid potential threats. To evaluate how the Lobsterbot’s presence impacted spatial decoding accuracy, additional single-unit recording experiments (Ctrl-Exp) were conducted and compared with the previous results (Lob-Exp). In this experiment, three rats followed the same protocol until the microdrive implant surgery. After the surgery, unlike the Lob-Exp group, the Ctrl-Exp group returned to the shuttling phase, during which the Lobsterbot was removed. With this protocol, both groups experienced sessions with the Lobsterbot, but the Ctrl-Exp group’s task became less complex, as it was reduced to mere reward collection. During a total of nine recording sessions, 112 units were identified and ANN regressors were built and trained using these data. Statistical tests indicated that the original dataset had significantly lower decoding errors (20.48 ±2.31 cm) compared to the shuffled dataset (22.61 ±1.95 cm; paired <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>t</italic>(8) = 6.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001). Nevertheless, when the error was compared with that of Lob-Exp, the Ctrl-Exp group showed a higher decoding errors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>; unpaired t-test; <italic>t</italic>(47) = 3.02, <italic>p</italic> =.004). This did not result from differences in activity levels, as there was no significant difference in total travel distance between the Lob-Exp and Ctrl-Exp groups (unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>t</italic>(47) = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> =.941).</p>
<p>Another factor potentially contributing to the increase in decoding errors could be differences in recording quality across experiments. To discriminate the effects, a generalized linear model (GLM) was constructed with predictors of 1) the Lobsterbot’s presence, 2) the number of units recorded, and 3) the recording site (PL vs. IL) on decoding error. The results showed that the GLM predicted the outcome variable with significant accuracy (<italic>F</italic>(3,45) = 14.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001), explaining 48.38% of the variance in decoding error. The regression coefficients were as follows: presence of the Lobsterbot (2.76, standard error [<italic>SE</italic>] = 1.11, <italic>t</italic> = 2.49, <italic>p</italic> =.016), number of recorded cells (−0.43, <italic>SE</italic> =.08, <italic>t</italic> = 5.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001), and recording location (0.91, <italic>SE</italic> =.92, <italic>p</italic> =.329). The results indicated that the number of recorded cells significantly influenced decoding accuracy. Most importantly, the presence of the Lobsterbot significantly decreased the overall decoding error, even after accounting for the number of recorded cells. In summary, the removal of the Lobsterbot decreased spatial decoding accuracy.</p>

<title>Non-navigational behavior reduces the accuracy of decoded location</title>
<p>Although initial analysis showed that the distance of the rat to the center of the E-zone could be decoded with reasonable accuracy, the spatial precision was unevenly distributed throughout the arena (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The magnitude of error was highest in the N-zone, followed by the E-zone, and lowest in the F-zone. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of the zone (<italic>F</italic>(1.68, 65.52) = 40.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001). Post hoc analysis showed that the MAE in the F-zone (13.86 ± 2.56 cm) was significantly lower than that in the N-zone (22.72 ± 6.38 cm; <italic>t</italic>(39) = 10.69; <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001) and the E-zone (19.98 ± 7.30 cm; <italic>t</italic>(39) = 6.34; <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001).

To correct for the unequal distribution of location visits (more visits to the F- than to other zones), the regressor was trained using a subset of the original data, which was equalized for the data size per distance range (see Materials and Methods). Despite the correction, there was a significant main effect of the zone (<italic>F</italic>(1.16, 45.43) = 119.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001) and the post hoc results showed that the MAEs in the N-zone (19.52 ± 4.46 cm; <italic>t</italic>(39) = 10.45; <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001) and the E-zone (26.13 ± 7.57 cm; <italic>t</italic>(39) = 11.40; <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001) had a significantly higher errors when compared to the F-zone (14.10 ± 1.64 cm).</p>

<p>In the N-zone, the rats engaged in stereotypic behaviors such as grooming, climbing, and rearing, during which they stopped locomotive behavior (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). To determine whether these non-navigational behaviors resulted in higher decoding errors, these behaviors inside the N-zone is manually labelled and the MAEs during navigational vs. non-navigational behaviors were compared. Due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset resulting from varying preference for non-navigational behaviors, data from 21 sessions were included, each containing at least 20% of one type of behavior. The paired t-test showed a significant difference between the MAEs during the non-navigational and navigational behaviors in the N-zone (paired t-test; t(20) = 9.381, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).

<title>Population analysis reveals a different functional mode in the E-zone</title>
<p>To assess the functional coherence of population activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Durstewitz et al., 2010</xref>) within and across different zones, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the ensemble data collected throughout the session. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> illustrates the first two principal components of the transformed neural data from a representative recording session (number of units = 19).

<graphic xlink:href="567066v4_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To quantitatively measure functional resemblance among ensemble activity within different zones, we measured the distance between pairs of centroids projected onto the latent space (N-F, N-E, and F-E). A Friedman test showed a significant difference between centroid pairs (χ²(2)=51.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001). Further post hoc analysis revealed a significant difference between N-F and N-E pairs (<italic>p</italic> &lt;.001) and N-E and F-E pairs (<italic>p</italic> &lt;.001) but not in N-F and F-E pairs (<italic>p</italic> =.353), suggesting an ordinal similarity with N-F (D =.72) being most similar, followed by F-E (D = .94) and N-E (D = 1.44) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the firing pattern in the E-zone was the most dissimilar, reflecting a functional state different from those in other zones. In contrast, the distance between centroids of the N- and F-zones was relatively small, indicating that the overlap between the neural subspaces in the two zones was not negligible.</p>
<p>Although PCA can capture population differences between neural ensembles in the zones, a small subset of neurons highly tuned to salient sensory cues could solely drive this separation. Particularly in the E-zone, which encompasses two significant events—head-entry and head-withdrawal—neurons responsive to the delivery of rewards or attacks from the robot could dominate the principal components. To minimize this influence, we defined “critical event times” as ±1 second from head-entry and head-withdrawal, excluded neural data during these periods, and then recalculated the principal components. The results still demonstrated the same sequential ensemble differences (<italic>F</italic>(1.57, 61.34) = 73.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001), indicating that the population differences are not driven by events specific to any zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). In summary, populational activity inside the E-zone showed distinctive activity patterns unlike those of active navigation.</p>

<title>Hierarchical clustering identifies functionally distinctive sub-populations in the E-zone</title>
<p>In the E-zone, navigational behavior was largely replaced by approach attempts and avoidance behaviors. To characterize the temporal dynamics of single-unit activity in the E-zone, we examined the modulation of firing rate to the two key behaviors; head-entry and head-withdrawal. The temporal dynamic of neuronal firing relative to these two behavioral events was visualized using color-coded raster plots and peri-event time histograms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>), featuring spiking activities from all behavior-responsive units (see Materials and Methods). Overall, the units showed modulated firing with varying degrees of temporal relations to the two events. Most strikingly, overall modulation patterns were clearly different between head-entry and head-withdrawal.</p>

</fig>
<p>During head-entry, a large portion of the units increased the firing before the event (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, top</xref>), a pattern confirmed by pooled analysis across neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, bottom</xref>). The mean activity showed a peak approximately 150 ms before the head-entry, with the peak exhibiting substantial width (FWHM of ∼200 ms), suggesting the presence of varied neuron populations differing in peak position. In contrast, this anticipatory modulation was not clearly identified when the activities were aligned to the head-withdrawal. Instead, activity sharply increased around the event itself (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, top</xref>), producing a narrow peak at 0 ms (FWHM=∼75 ms, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, bottom</xref>).</p>
<p>To categorize recorded units into multiple sub-populations based on their functional connectivity in reference to the key events, the unsupervised hierarchical clustering method was applied to all recorded units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boehlen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Di Miceli et al., 2020</xref>). We identified two sub-populations when we classified neurons according to their activity around the head-entry (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The first sub-population (HE1: n = 366, 57.91%) showed an anticipatory increase with a peak located at 350 ms before and a negative modulation after entry and remained low for an extended period. The other sub-population (HE2: n = 189, 29.91%) showed a more concentrated positive modulation at around the time of entry. When we used the head withdrawal as criterion, three sub-populations were identified (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The first (HW1: n = 380, 60.13%) showed a complex modulation pattern: lower than the baseline in the beginning, followed by a peak firing timed at the head-withdrawal. The second (HW2: n = 147, 23.26%) maintained increased activity until the onset of head-withdrawal and returned to zero afterward. The last sub-population, HW3, which consisted of a relatively small number of units (n = 62, 9.81%), showed an inhibitory response at the time of head-withdrawal.</p>
<p>Well-trained rats typically run across the F-zone at high velocity and arrive at the sucrose port in the E-zone, stopping abruptly. Moreover, the head-entry is always aligned with the rats’ movements, including both subtle (AW) and reflexive (EW) movement. Consequently, it is plausible that the sudden movement might result sudden change in neural activity around the time of head-entry and/or head-withdrawal. To exclude this possibility, a “run-and-stop” event was correlated with the neural data. The event was defined as the transitional moment between a directional locomotion of 2 s or longer and a subsequent pause of 1 s or longer (see Materials and Methods). Unit activities were aligned around this run-and-stop event, and the mean activity of each sub-population was plotted for visual inspection. As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>, there was no detectable neural modulation around the run-and-stop events. The lack of significant modulation at the time of action suggests that the neural modulation occurring around the head-entry and head-withdrawal is not a simple motoric response.</p>
<p>An interesting overlap was found between sub-populations characterized by head-entry and head-withdrawal. In the HW1 group, 78.68% (n = 299) of units were classified as HE1. On the other hand, 63.95% (n = 94) of the HW2 units were from HE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplementary Figure S6A</xref>). Based on this, we further characterized the temporal dynamics of spike activity in relation to the two behavioral events using the combined categories: Type 1 (HE1-HW1) and Type 2 (HE2-HW2). These two subpopulations demonstrated distinctive firing patterns within the E-zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplementary Figure S6B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7</xref>). Specifically, Type 1 neurons exhibited a rapid decline in activity following a short peak 200 ms before the head-entry, whereas Type 2 neurons displayed a sustained high peak activity (z ≍ 2) from the onset of the head-entry until the head-withdrawal.</p>
<p>We also examined whether there is a significant difference between the PL and IL in the proportion of Type 1 and Type 2 neurons. In the PL, among 379 recorded units, 143 units (37.73%) were labeled as Type 1, and 75 units (19.79%) were labeled as Type 2. In contrast, in the IL, 156 units (61.66%) and 19 units (7.51%) of 253 recorded units were labeled as Type 1 and Type 2, respectively. A Chi-square analysis revealed that the PL contains a significantly higher proportion of Type 2 neurons (χ²(1, 632) = 34.85, p &lt; .001), while the IL contains a significantly higher proportion of Type 1 neurons compared to the other region (χ²(1, 632) = 18.07, p &lt; .001). Taken together, these findings provide support for the existence of at least two distinct subpopulations in the PL and IL that may be involved in different cognitive functions within the E-zone.</p>

<title>Population activities in the E-zone encode success and failure of avoidance with high accuracy</title>
<p>The previous analysis confirmed that a significant number of neurons modulated their activity before or around the time of approach toward and withdrawal from the E-zone. We then further analyzed the correlation between neural activity and success and failure of avoidance behavior. If the mPFC neurons participate in the avoidance decisions, avoidance withdrawal (AW; withdrawal before the attack) and escape withdrawal (EW; withdrawal after the attack) may be distinguishable from decoded population activity even prior to motor execution. A naïve Bayesian classifier (see Materials and Methods) was trained to distinguish AW from EW using 2-s neural ensemble data around the onset of the event (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We corrected the accuracy against the sample imbalance owing to varying degrees of the AW/EW response ratio across different sessions. Our analysis showed that the classifier based on the original dataset achieved a significantly higher prediction accuracy (72.71%) than a theoretical chance-level prediction (50%) or a shuffled dataset (51.62%) (paired <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>t</italic>(39) = 10.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001) in distinguishing AW from EW (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, we analyzed whether there is a difference in prediction accuracy between sessions with different recorded regions, the PL and the IL. A repeated two-way ANOVA revealed no significant difference between recorded regions, nor any interaction (regions: <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 0.1828, <italic>p</italic> = 0.671; interaction: <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 0.1614, p = 0.690).</p>

</fig>
<p>Because the behavioral reactions following the two events were quite different (bigger reactions during the EW as if the animal failed to predict the attack), it is not clear whether the naïve Bayesian classifier discriminated the two types of responses based on the post-event population activity, which would have been a reflection of the different reactions in the two responses rather than an anticipatory or value-driven encoding. To clarify this issue, we trained naïve Bayesian classifiers using 2-s ensemble activity at varying time points before the execution of the head-withdrawal response. Multiple t-tests between original and shuffled datasets revealed that AW/EW discrimination accuracy began to increase above the chance level 6 s before the actual response and remain significant at all time points (multiple paired <italic>t</italic>-tests with Šídák-Boferroni correction; <italic>ps</italic> &lt; .01; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="utbl1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the previous clustering analysis that identified functionally cohesive sub-populations of neurons (Types 1 and 2), we further investigated the predictive encoding by the ensemble activity of the two subpopulations. The naïve Bayesian classifier uses class likelihood, P(unit|AW) and P(unit|EW), to classify a particular type of withdrawal response. By comparing the class likelihoods, we can assess the ability of these subgroups to distinguish between AW and EW. This ability is quantified by a ‘Class Discrimination Index,’ calculated as a log odds ratio. This index reflects the likelihood that a given feature set is associated with a particular type of withdrawal response (AW or EW). To test whether the unit activity right before the head-withdrawal (from 2 s before the head-withdrawal to the onset of the head-withdrawal) was correlated with subsequent avoidance behavior, we calculated the log odds ratio from the trained classifier. The results showed that Type 2 neurons had a significantly higher log odds ratio, indicating a high correlation between unit activity and success in avoidance, whereas no discriminatory modulation was observed for Type 1 neurons or others (one sample t-test, <italic>t</italic>(298) = .564; <italic>p</italic> =.573, <italic>t</italic>(94) = 5.63; <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001, <italic>t</italic>(238) = .531; <italic>p</italic> =.596, Type 1, Type 2, and others, respectively). These results indicate that Type 2 units carries information that is relevant for classifying trial as AW. To summarize, the populational neural activity of the mPFC in rats within the E-zone distinguished between two types of head-withdrawal behavior, and increased activity of unit subgroups was strongly associated with the execution of AW.</p>

<title>Overlapping populations of mPFC neurons adaptively encode spatial information and defensive decision</title>
<p>Through a series of analyses, we found that both distance and foraging decision can be decoded from the same mPFC neural ensemble.

For example, if a neuron holds substantial data and is heavily relied upon by the decoder, shuffling its signal will significantly increase the error. We analyzed the permutation feature importance scores for each neuron for both distance regression and event classification (see Materials and Methods).</p>

<p>First, for the distance regressor, the median permutation feature importance score was 0.73 cm (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). This suggests that shuffling one unit’s neural activity increases the decoding error by less than 1 cm. Moreover, 95% of units exhibited a permutation feature importance score below 1.998 cm, indicating only a negligible increase. To determine whether a subset of neurons with high feature importance scores solely drives distance decoding, we tested whether removing the top 20% of neurons with the highest scores in a given session affects distance decoding. The results showed that although removal significantly increased the decoding error, the regressor trained with the remaining data still achieved a significantly lower error (17.35cm; Wilcoxon signed rank test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001). Next, we applied a similar method to the event classifier. This analysis revealed a median permutation feature importance score of 0.01 and a 95th percentile of 0.06. We also tested the effect of removing the top 20% of neurons with the highest scores and found that the decoder still exhibited a significantly lower error (paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>t</italic>(39)=6.899, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001). This result indicates that there is no sub-population which dominates in encoding distance information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we tested whether there is a correlation between the feature importance scores of the distance regressor and the event classifier. If there were two subgroups of neurons, each dedicated to encoding distance and events respectively, we might expect to see a negative correlation. To verify this, we calculated Pearson’s correlation for each session. We found that there was no significant correlation between the feature importance scores of the two encoders (r=0.077, <italic>p=</italic>.062), indicating the absence of two distinct subpopulations that exclusively encode either distance or event.</p>
<p>Additionally, we found no evidence that Type I or Type II neurons have statistically higher or lower feature importance in the distance regressor. These results support the notion that distance and avoidance outcomes are not encoded separately by subsets of neurons; rather, the entire ensemble encodes two different concepts according to the given context.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found distinct ensemble activity states in the mPFC (PL and IL) of a foraging rat, each linked to specific spatial zones or task demands within the foraging environment. The rat’s distance from the conflict zone could be decoded with stable accuracy during navigation, but ensemble activity switched to encode defensive behavior when the rat entered the immediate reward-threat zone (E-zone). In this high-conflict context, the rat’s threat-evading behavior (AW), coupled with forgoing the reward, could be predicted with a naïve Bayesian classifier. These findings show that mPFC neurons engage in two distinct functional modes of processing allocentric spatial information and egocentric reward-threat information.</p>
<p>In the present study, spatial information was extracted from the mPFC neuron in terms of distance. Previous studies on mPFC spatial coding ranged from reporting no spatial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Poucet, 1997</xref>) to precise coordinates encoding with errors as small as a few centimeters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mashhoori et al., 2018</xref>). In some studies, the spatial coding mechanism was directly compared between the hippocampus and the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaefer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Powell &amp; Redish, 2014</xref>), and the mPFC cells were found to encode a generalized form of space rather than specific locations. Therefore, we focused on distance as a more generalized spatial index that also reflects an internal representation of value and risk, and built an ANN regressor to target it.</p>
<p>Brief navigation was sufficient to recruit most recorded mPFC neurons into spatial encoding, with decoding accuracy consistent across the F-zone regardless of navigational direction (inbound vs. outbound) or visual cues during foraging. The spatial resolution encoded by the ensemble of neurons was precise enough to provide navigational utility (13.86 cm in the F-zone) considering an adult rat’s body length (∼20 cm without tail), supporting the spatial encoding hypothesis.</p>
<p>However, spatial encoding was disrupted when the rat engaged with the Lobsterbot in the E-zone, paralleling findings that a disfavored reward can distort location decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mashhoori et al., 2018</xref>). Non-navigational behaviors such as grooming and sniffing also degraded accuracy, suggesting that spatial coding in the mPFC is tightly bound with task-demands such as goal-directed navigation or threat avoidance. Consistent with this, removing the Lobsterbot—reducing the task to simple reward collection—lowered decoding accuracy, echoing previous reports that complex, goal-driven navigation sharpens mPFC spatial selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hok et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ma et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with previous findings that mPFC neurons are sensitive to changes in valence—whether reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Horst &amp; Laubach, 2013</xref>), threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burgos-Robles et al., 2009</xref>), or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al., 2018</xref>)—the recorded neurons modulated their firing rate around entry into and withdrawal from the E-zone, where sucrose reward and robotic threat coexisted. In line with the mPFC’s established role in executive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dalley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">G. W. Diehl &amp; Redish, 2023</xref>), an ensemble classifier trained on the recorded unit activity predicted AW success with high accuracy (0.73). This prediction remained significantly above the chance level (0.5), even several seconds before the action.</p>
<p>Interestingly, decoding accuracy for distance and avoidance decision did not differ between the PL an IL, despite their well-established functional dissociation in fear conditioning and extinction studies: the PL has been linked to fear expression, and the IL to fear extinction learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burgos-Robles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dejean et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Quirk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Vidal-Gonzalez et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, more Type 2 neurons were found in the PL and more Type 1 neurons were found in the IL. To recap, typical Type 1 neurons increased the activity briefly after the head entry and then remained inhibited, while Type 2 neurons showed a burst of activity during head entry and sustained increased activity. One study employing context-dependent fear discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) also identified two distinct types of PL units: short-latency CS-responsive units, which increased firing during the initial 150 ms of tone presentation, and persistently firing units, which maintained firing for up to 30 seconds. Given the temporal dynamics of Type 2 neurons, it is possible that our unsupervised clustering method may have merged the two types of neurons found in Kim et al.’s study.</p>
<p>We did not observe decreased IL activity during dynamic foraging, whereas prior studies have shown that IL excitability decreases after fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Santini et al., 2008</xref>) and that increased IL activity is required for fear extinction learning. In our paradigm, extinction learning was unlikely, as the threat persisted throughout the experiment. Future studies with direct manipulation of these subpopulations, particularly examining head withdrawal timing after such interventions, could provide insight into how these subpopulations guide behavior.</p>
<p>We also found that the activity of Type 2 neurons was highly correlated with the success of AW. What is the role of the Type 2 sub-population in the execution of active defensive behavior? One straightforward hypothesis is that the increased activity simply represents internal motivation of fear or anxiety. This premise is supported by multiple experiments where the PL is vital for the expression of freezing responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burgos-Robles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, Type 2 units may represent the perceived threat level, which would strongly correlate with the rat’s voluntary head-withdrawal. Alternatively, the Type 2 sub-population may contribute to the computation or decision-making processes underlying defensive behaviors. Supporting this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Halladay and Blair (2015)</xref> identified two distinct sub-populations in the PL selectively responsive to specific defensive behaviors— conditioned movement inhibition and conditioned movement excitation. Given that Type 2 neurons increased firing during AW trials, they may overlap with the excitation-related neuronal subgroups in Halladay and Blair’s study. Despite this interesting conjecture, any analysis based on recording data is only correlational, mandating further studies with direct manipulation of the subpopulation to confirm its functional specificity.</p>
<p>Encoded representations in the mPFC range from prediction of upcoming decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Passecker et al., 2019</xref>) to rule switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Laskowski et al., 2016</xref>). This diversity of cognitive functions in the mPFC has also been observed in primates, giving rise to the <italic>adaptive coding model</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Duncan, 2001</xref>). This model posits that the mPFC neurons are fine-tuned to encode task-relevant information depending on the contexts. Our data support this framework: over 80% of units that encoded distance in the F-zone modulated their firing during defensive decision-making in the E-zone, reflecting a context-dependent functional switching. PCA further revealed that the manifold of populational activity in the E-zone was distinct from that of the F- and N-zones, underscoring the heterogeneity of mPFC activity during threat-reward conflict (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ebitz &amp; Hayden, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, upon exiting the E-zone, neurons resumed distance encoding in the same manner as before. Because the regressor was trained on data from the entire session, such stable decoding would not be possible if encoding schemes changed each time the rats re-entered the F-zone. In our dynamic foraging task, rats rapidly alternated between navigational behavior in the F-zone and confrontational behavior in the E-zone, yet spatial decoding in the F-zone remained stable. This suggests selective, reversible switching between functional modes rather than global reorganization of coding with each context change.</p>
<p>These results point to a dual, context-sensitive encoding scheme in the mPFC, accommodating both spatial navigation and defensive decision-making within the same behavioral session (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). This multifunctionality helps reconcile conflicting views of the mPFC’s role in spatial orientation by showing that spatial and non-spatial coding can coexist in a task-dependent manner. The “department store” analogy of the mPFC—where diverse functions emerge from learned associations between contexts, locations, events, and adaptive responses—is consistent with our findings.</p>

<title>Hypothetical control models by which mPFC neurons assume different functional states.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> In the F-zone, navigational behaviors enhance the mPFC’s encoding of spatial information compared to other zones. In the N-zone, spatial coding diminishes when the rat engages in non-navigational behaviors. However, in the E-zone, these neurons shift their encoding strategy and become involved in coding for active foraging. We did not find a subset of neurons dedicated exclusively to either spatial coding or active foraging throughout the session. Instead, neurons changed their encoding scheme in a population-wide manner. <bold>(B)</bold> Three hypotheses about how the switch is manifested. In this example, most mPFC neurons encode spatial information (blue circles). Information encoded in the mPFC can be regulated by internal/external arbitration signal (top-bottom blue arrow from green circles), or influenced by direct sensory inputs and navigation-related signals (left-right blue arrow) that prompt mPFC neurons to encode spatial information. A third possibility is that both signals compete to gain control.</p>

</fig>
<p>In our multi-task design, decoder accuracy varied systematically with context, raising the question of how the mPFC determines which information to encode. We consider three possibilities: (1) a bottom-up hypothesis, in which encoding priorities are dictated by sensory inputs or upstream signals; (2) a top-down hypothesis, in which an internal “arbitrator” selects the encoding mode and coordinates relevant information; and (3) a competitive hypothesis, in which bottom-up and top-down influences operate simultaneously, with the dominant input determining the active encoding mode (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>
<p>Although our study cannot resolve the mechanism, a control experiment in which rats performed a simple shuttling task provides some insight. Removing the Lobsterbot degraded spatial encoding rather than enhancing it, suggesting that reducing task demands alone does not bias the mPFC toward one encoding mode. This aligns with the top-down or arbitrator hypothesis, in which mPFC neurons encode heterogeneous information when task demands are high and require coordinated, goal-directed behavior.</p>
<p>Which brain region might act as this arbitrator? Evidence from human neuroimaging studies implicates the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a central hub for switching cognitive modes. During task switching, the ACC shows increased activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hyafil et al., 2009</xref>), enhances connectivity with task-specific regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aben et al., 2020</xref>), correlates with multitask performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kondo et al., 2004</xref>), and monitors the reliability of competing decision systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, these findings point to a pivotal role for the ACC in coordinating task assignment. Rodent studies also link the ACC to strategic mode switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tervo et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that the rodent ACC could similarly arbitrate between strategies, determining which task-relevant variables are represented in the ventral mPFC, including the PL and IL. Future studies combining multi-context tasks with causal manipulations will be essential to determine whether these functional shifts are driven primarily by top-down arbitration or by bottom-up sensory inputs.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Eight male Sprague Dawley rats (250-300 g, 5-6 weeks of age, Orient Bio.) were used in this study. The rats were housed in pairs on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum for a one-week acclimation period. In the following week, rats were handled for 10 min each day until they displayed reduced fear responses towards the experimenter.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Apparatus and procedures</title>
<p>The apparatus followed the same dimensions as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kimm &amp; Choi (2018)</xref>, measuring 800 mm × 480 mm and a height of 500 mm excluding the robot compartment. It was covered in gray EMF-shield fabric to reduce high-frequency noise during experiments. Battery-powered LED strip lighting illuminated the apparatus and −60 dB white noise masked background sounds. The system employed four Arduino Uno boards and a Raspberry Pi board for experiment control and behavioral tracking. All sensor and control signals were relayed to an RV5 multiprocessor (Tucker-Davis Technologies, FL, USA) for further analysis. Bird’s-eye view videos were captured during sessions, and the rat’s location was tracked using the butter package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/knowblesse/butter">https://github.com/knowblesse/butter</ext-link>). All control schematics and codes are publicly available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/knowblesse/Lobster/Apparatus">https://github.com/knowblesse/Lobster/Apparatus</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Before the training, food and water were gradually restricted until the rats’ weight reached 80% of their initial value. Over three days, they acclimated to the apparatus for 20 min. Training began with the habituation phase, during which rats had unrestricted sucrose port access for 20 min. The sucrose port has an IR sensor which was activated by a single lick. The rat usually stays in front of the lick port and continuously lick up to a rate of 6.3 times per second to obtain sucrose. Any sucrose droplets dropped in the bottom sink were immediately removed by negative pressure so that the rat’s behavior was focused on the licking. Upon reaching 1,500 licks per trial, rats proceeded to the three-day shuttling phase. The shuttling session was 30 min long, and the gate was closed 6 s after the first lick, forcing rats into the N-zone to reopen it. The subsequent Lobsterbot phase introduced the Lobsterbot, which executed two grabbing motions after 3 s (30%) or 6 s (70%) from the initial lick. After three days of Lobsterbot sessions, the rats underwent microdrive implant surgery, and recording data were collected from subsequent sessions, either Lobsterbot or shuttling sessions, depending on the experiment. For all post-surgery sessions, those with fewer than 20 approaches in 30 minutes were excluded from further analysis.</p>

<title>Surgery</title>
<p>Before surgery, rats were anesthetized using isoflurane (3%-5%) and oxygen (500 mL/min). Enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg) and meloxicam (1 mg/kg) were administered to prevent infection and mitigate postsurgical pain. A craniotomy was performed at AP +3.2 mm and ML 0.5 mm from the bregma using a carbide burr (Komet, Kempten, Germany) mounted on a high-speed drill (Strong 207A; Saeshin, Daegu, Korea). The tip of each microdrive was lowered to the following coordinates: AP +3.2 mm, ML right 0.3 ∼ 0.6 mm, DV −4 mm from the bregma. The precise ML coordinate was determined after the craniotomy to avoid damage to the superior sagittal sinus. Six to seven screws were securely affixed to the skull, and two additional screws above the cerebellum were used as the ground and reference points. Finally, dental cement was applied around the microdrive to secure the implant. Rats were allowed at least one week of recovery before the recordings. All procedures were approved by the Korea University Institutional Animal Care &amp; Use Committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Two types of microdrives were used in the recordings: a custom-made 4-tetrode microdrive and a pre-assembled 16-channel silicon probe (A2×2-tet-10 mm-150-150-121-HZ16_21 mm, NeuroNexus, MI, USA) mounted on a 3D printed microdrive. The microdrive featured an M1.6-18 mm screw with a 0.35 mm pitch. The recording site was retroactively determined by calculating the number of rotations from the final recording site, identified by a marking lesion.</p>
<p>During each recording session, the rat’s microdrive was connected to a ZIF-Clip digital headstage (Tucker-Davis Technologies, FL, USA). The neural signals were collected at a 25 kHz sampling rate, amplified, digitized from the head stage, and transferred to the RZ5 (Tucker-Davis Technologies, FL, USA) for data acquisition. The acquired data stream was further bandpass filtered between 300 and 5000 kHz, and all spikes above 3 to 4 sigma compared to the stream were collected for further clustering analysis. The Offline Sorter (Plexon, TX, USA) was used for the manual clustering process. All units with firing rates below 0.5 Hz or exactly 60 Hz (power noise) were considered artifacts and removed from further analysis. Sessions with fewer than 10 recorded units were also excluded.</p>

<title>Spatial decoding data preparation</title>
<p>For the neural data used in the spatial encoding analysis of the mPFC, the following method was employed. First, a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 100 ms and a length of 1000 ms was prepared. Each unit’s spike data were down-sampled and serialized to a 1000 Hz vector, and the kernel was applied to smooth the signal. The mean and standard deviation values of this vector were computed and used to normalize the vector. After normalization, the vector was binned into 50 ms windows, resulting in 20 data points per second. Finally, each datapoint was paired with the corresponding location data.</p>
<p>The spatial firing map was constructed using the same normalized activity data. Neural activity was averaged for each pixel and then smoothed using a Gaussian filter with a sigma of 15 px and a filter size of 1001 px.</p>

<title>ANN regressor</title>
<p>A neural network regressor was built using the PyTorch package. It comprised seven layers in total, including the output layer; four of these were fully connected (FC) layers and two were drop-out layers. The initial weights for the FC layers were normalized with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 0.2. Mean squared error loss was used in conjunction with the stochastic gradient descent method. For each regressor, a control regressor was built, which used the same data-label set, but the relationships were randomly shuffled. The evaluation of the regression results used a stratified 5-fold cross-validation while ensuring that each subset maintained the same proportion of data from the three zones. The five regression results per dataset were combined, and these results were compared with the true dataset using MAE. For the training/testing dataset, preprocessed 50 ms-long neural data were used. The binned neural data from all units (n) were concatenated to form a 1 × n size vector. These vectors were paired with the corresponding distance during the 50 ms time window. In the dataset adjusted for uneven location visits, we divided distance values into five equally sized bins. Then, a sub-dataset was created that contains an equal number of data points for each of these bins. Two different GPU servers were employed for training: a Tesla V100 from the National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA, Seoul, Korea) and an in-house A4000.</p>

<title>Decoding error heatmap construction</title>
<p>To construct the decoding error heatmap, the following method was used. First, error data from each pixel were collected and mean values were computed. To accommodate pixels not visited by a rat during an entire session, an interpolation method was employed. A custom Matlab script, built using the <italic>scatteredInterpolant</italic> function, was used to interpolate errors for unknown locations. The 2D interpolated decoding error was subsequently smoothed using a Gaussian filter with a sigma value of 15 px and a filter size of 1001 px. These smoothed error values were then converted to cm, and a contour plot was overlaid using 25 levels.</p>

<title>PCA</title>
<p>A custom Python script for PCA was created using the <italic>sci-kit-learn</italic> package. Neural data vectors generated for the spatial decoding analysis were used for this analysis. The behavior and head tracking data were matched with neural data vectors, and the corresponding zone was labeled to the vectors. All neural data vectors from a single session were projected onto a new space using the PCA. For each zone, the centroid of the projected neural data vectors was calculated using Euclidean distance. The within-zone distance <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="567066v4_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and the between-zone distance <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="567066v4_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> were calculated using the equations below.

<p>Representative figures were drawn in a manner to highlight the cluster differences.

<title>Behavior-responsive unit analysis</title>
<p>Behavior-responsive units were identified using the following method. For each trial, spikes within a 4-s window (2 s before and after the onset of three events: gate opening upon returning to the N-zone, head-entry, and head-withdrawal) were counted and registered in 50 ms-long time bins, resulting in 80 data points per trial. These neural activities were then averaged across all trials, producing a 1 × 80 vector for each event. The binned neural activity ± 2 s from the entrance to the N-zone was chosen as a baseline, considering that the rat was consistently oriented towards areas other than the robot. The mean and standard deviation of the baseline were used to normalize activity during the head-entry and the head-withdrawal. The overall method created two event vectors, head-entry-vector and head-withdrawal-vector, per unit. A unit was considered behavior-responsive to an event if any value within the 80 data points of the event vector was greater or less than 3 sigma.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4j">
<title>Hierarchical cell clustering analysis</title>
<p>To cluster cells that exhibited similar responses during the head-entry and/or head-withdrawal, an unsupervised hierarchical cell clustering method was employed. For every pair of units, the similarity score using Pearson’s r was calculated, and the pair with the highest similarity score was grouped to form a new pseudo-unit that had the average response of the two units. This procedure was repeated until all units were grouped into eight pseudo-units. Among each pseudo-unit, if the number of units belonging to the group was equal to or greater than 50, the pseudo-unit was considered a valid cluster. Otherwise, the pseudo-unit was classified as an artifact.</p>
<p>To compensate for the limited number of neurons recorded per session, the hyperparameter set was chosen to generalize their activity and categorize them into major types, allowing us to focus on neurons that appeared across multiple recording sessions. Although changes in the hyperparameter sets resulted in different numbers of clusters, the major activity types remained consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). However, there is a chance that this method may not differentiate smaller subsets of neurons, particularly those with fewer than 50 recorded neurons.</p>

<title>Run-and-stop event analysis</title>
<p>To examine whether a change in movement velocity was related to neural activity, a “run-and-stop” event was defined by the following criteria: 1) to qualify as “run” at a given moment, the rat must be moving at least 7.5 cm/s for at least 2 s or longer; 2) to qualify as the “stop” at a given moment, the rat must be moving at most 5 cm/s for at least 1 s or longer; and 3) the “run-and-stop” event was the time point between “run” and “stop” outside the E-zone. The temporal relationship between the run-and-stop event and neural activity was visualized using the same method as in the behavior-responsive unit analysis.</p>

<title>Naïve Bayes AW/EW classifier and data preparation</title>
<p>For the neural data used in the head-withdrawal-type (AW/EW) classification analysis, a data preparation method similar to that of the spatial decoding analysis was employed. First, the same Gaussian kernel was generated and applied to the down-sampled and serialized neural data. Mean and standard deviation values of this vector were computed for later normalization. Unlike the 50 ms-length neural data used in spatial regression, 2-s-length neural data was used. For each trial, all spikes within a 2-s window around the onset of the head-withdrawal were collected and serialized into a 1000 Hz vector. The Gaussian kernel was applied and normalized using precalculated values. This vector was then binned into 50 ms intervals, resulting in 40 data points per event. Binned vectors from all recorded units (n) were concatenated to form a 1 × (40n) size vector per trial. These vectors were then paired with their corresponding head-withdrawal-type, AW or EW. In the analysis using varying time windows, the previously employed data preparation method was the same, but the time range of the neural data varied relative to the head-withdrawal.</p>
<p>A naïve Bayesian classifier based on the multivariate Bernoulli model was built using the <italic>sci-kit-learn</italic> package. A custom Python script was written to train and evaluate the classifiers. The classifier employed a uniform prior and smoothing parameter, alpha, which was set to 1 in all classifiers used in the study. Similar to the analysis using the ANN regressor, a control classifier was built that was trained with shuffled data. The evaluation of the classifier results employed the stratified 5-fold cross-validation method with each subset maintaining the same proportion of head-entry/head-withdrawal. Five classification results per dataset were combined, and these results were compared with the true dataset using balanced accuracy, calculated using the equation below.

</disp-formula>
To interpret how the classifier anticipated upcoming head-withdrawal behavior, class discrimination index was employed, focusing on a dataset with a time window of −2 to 0 s. To calculate the index, the class likelihood for every dimension was extracted during each test dataset evaluation, and a natural logarithm was applied to balance the small likelihood values. With each unit’s neural data divided into 40 bins, the log likelihood values were added to create a joint probability. This process yielded five joint likelihood values per unit, and their average was computed. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mladenić &amp; Grobelnik’s (1999)</xref> method, the log odds ratio between P(unit|AW) and P(unit|EW) was calculated for all units using the equation below.
<disp-formula id="disp-eqn-3">
<graphic xlink:href="567066v4_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where P(unit|AW) denotes joint likelihood (probability of observing unit activity given the AW) and P(unit|EW) denotes the same for the EW. These values were then compared according to the unit’s assigned group: Type 1, Type 2, or others. Taking the natural log of the odds ratio brings about a symmetricity in the results. A positive value represented a unit’s relatively increased activity during the AW compared to the EW, and a negative value represented the opposite.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad, MA, USA). To confirm normality of the data, Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to all data we obtained from the experiment. For all statistical tests, <italic>p-</italic>value of &lt;.05 were used to assess the significance of differences and all <italic>t</italic>-tests were two tailed. The correlation analysis comparing feature importance scores from two decoders excluded the 1% of outliers before computing Pearson’s r. Both ANOVA and mixed-effect model analysis applied the Geisser-Greenhouse correction to account for violations of the sphericity assumption. The corrected degree of freedom is presented alongside F values. For multiple comparison tests, Sidak’s correction was used to control the family-wise error rate. For multiple linear regression analysis of the distance decoding error, the following model was incorporated.
<disp-formula id="disp-eqn-4">

The model fitting method incorporated the least squares method assuming a Gaussian distribution of residuals. Boolean variables, <italic>presence of Lobsterbot</italic>, and <italic>recording site</italic> used dummy codes (0: Lobster, 1: Control; 0: PL, 1: IL) to represent the state of the experiment. All error bars in graphs represent one standard error of the mean.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Jeong and Choi examine neural correlates of behavior during a naturalistic foraging task in which rats must dynamically balance resource acquisition (foraging) with the risk of threat. Rats first learn to forage for sucrose reward from a spout, and when a threat is introduced (an attack-like movement from a &quot;LobsterBot&quot;), they adjust their behavior to continue foraging while balancing exposure to the threat, adopting anticipatory withdraw behaviors to avoid encounter with the LobsterBot. Using electrode recordings targeting the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), they identify heterogenous encoding of task variables across prelimbic and infralimbic cortex neurons, including correlates of distance to the reward/threat zone and correlates of both anticipatory and reactionary avoidance behavior. Based on analysis of population responses, they show that prefrontal cortex switches between different regimes of population activity to process spatial information or behavioral responses to threat in a context-dependent manner. Characterization of the heterogenous coding scheme by which frontal cortex represents information in different goal states is an important contribution to our understanding of brain mechanisms underlying flexible behavior in ecological settings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>As many behavioral neuroscience studies employ highly controlled task designs, relatively less is generally known about how the brain organizes navigation and behavioral selection in naturalistic settings, where environment states and goals are more fluid. Here, the authors take advantage of a natural challenge faced by many animals - how to forage for resources in an unpredictable environment - to investigate neural correlates of behavior when goal states are dynamic. They investigate how prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity is structured to support different functional &quot;modes&quot; (here, between a navigational mode and a threat-sensitive foraging mode) for flexible behavior. Overall, an important strength and real value of this study is the design of the behavioral experiment, which is trial-structured, permitting strong statistical methods for neural data analysis, yet still rich enough for unconstrained, natural behavior structured by the animal's volitional goals. The experiment is also phased to measure behavioral changes as animals first encounter a threat, and then learn to adapt their foraging strategy to its presence. Characterization of this adaptation process is itself quite interesting and sets a foundation for further study of threat learning and risk management in the foraging context. Finally, the characterization of single-neuron and population dynamics in mPFC in this naturalistic setting with fluid goal states is an important contribution to the field. Previous studies have identified neural correlates of spatial and behavioral variables in frontal cortex, but how these representations are structured, or how they are dynamically adjusted when animals shift their goals, has been less clear. The authors synthesize their main conclusions into a conceptual model for how mPFC could encode task variables in a context-dependent manner, and provide a useful framework for thinking about circuit-level mechanisms that may support mode switching.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The task design in this study is intentionally stimulus-rich and places minimal constraint on the animal to preserve naturalistic behavior, and this introduces some confounds that place some limits on the interpretability of neural responses. For example, some variables which are the target of neural correlation analysis, such as spatial/proximity coding and coding of threat and threat-related behaviors, are naturally entwined. In their revisions, the authors have included extensive analyses and control conditions to disambiguate these confounds. Within the limits of their task design, this provides compelling evidence that mPFC neurons encode threat, decision, and spatial information in a context-dependent manner. Future experiment designs, which intentionally separate task contexts (e.g. navigation vs. foraging), could serve to further clarify the structure of coding across contexts and/or goal states.</p>
<p>While the study provides an important advance in our understanding of mPFC coding structure under naturalistic conditions, the study still lacks functional manipulations to establish any form of causality. This limitation is acknowledged in the text, and the report is careful not to over interpret suggestions of causal contribution, instead setting a foundation for future investigations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Jeong &amp; Choi (2023) use a semi-naturalistic paradigm to tackle the question of how the activity of neurons in the mPFC might continuously encode different functions. They offer two possibilities: either there are separate dedicated populations encoding each function, or cells alter their activity dependent on the current goal of the animal. In a threat-avoidance task rats procurred sucrose in an area of a chamber where, after remaining there for some amount of time, a 'Lobsterbot' robot attacked. In order to initiate the next trial rats had to move through the arena to another area before returning to the robot encounter zone. Therefore the task has two key components: threat avoidance and navigating through space. Recordings in the IL and PL of the mPFC revealed encoding that depended on what stage of the task the animal was currently engaged in. When animals were navigating, neuronal ensembles in these regions encoded distance from the threat. However, whilst animals were directly engaged with the threat and simultaneously consuming reward, it was possible to decode from a subset of the population whether animals would evade the threat. Therefore the authors claim that neurons in the mPFC switched between two functional modes: representing allocentric spatial information, and representing egocentric information pertaining to the reward and threat. Finally, the authors propose a conceptual model based on these data whereby this switching of population encoding is driven by either bottom-up sensory information or top-down arbitration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Whilst these multiple functions of activity in the mPFC have generally been observed in tasks dedicated to the study of a singular function, less work has been done in contexts where animals continuously switch between different modes of behaviour in a more natural way. Being able to assess whether previous findings of mPFC function apply in natural contexts is very valuable to the field, even outside of those interested in the mPFC directly. This also speaks to the novelty of the work; although mixed selectivity encoding of threat assessment and action selection has been demonstrated in some contexts (e.g. Grunfeld &amp; Likhtik, 2018) understanding the way in which encoding changes on-the-fly in a self-paced task is valuable both for verifying whether current understanding holds true and for extending our models of functional coding in the mPFC.</p>
<p>The authors are also generally thoughtful in their analyses and use a variety of approaches to probe the information encoded in the recorded activity. In particular, they use relatively close analysis of behaviour as well as manipulating the task itself by removing the threat to verify their own results. The use of such a rich task also allows them to draw comparisons, e.g. in different zones of the arena or different types of responses to threat, that a more reduced task would not otherwise allow. Additional in-depth analyses in the updated version of the manuscript, particularly the feature importance analysis, as well as complimentary null findings (a lack of cohesive place cell encoding, and no difference in location coding dependent on direction of trajectory) further support the authors' conclusion that populations of cells in the mPFC are switching their functional coding based on task context rather than behaviour per se. Finally, the authors' updated model schematic proposes an intriguing and testable implementation of how this encoding switch may be manifested by looking at differentiable inputs to these populations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main existing weakness of this study is that its findings are correlational (as the authors highlight in the discussion). Future work might aim to verify and expand the authors' findings - for example, whether the elevated response of Type 2 neurons directly contributes to the decision-making process or just represents fear/anxiety motivation/threat level - through direct physiological manipulation. However, I appreciate the challenges of interpreting data even in the presence of such manipulations and some of the additional analyses of behaviour, for example the stability of animals' inter-lick intervals in the E-zone, go some way towards ruling out alternative behavioural explanations. Yet the most ideal version of this analysis is to use a pose estimation method such as DeepLabCut to more fully measure behavioural changes. This, in combination with direct physiological manipulation, would allow the authors to fully validate that the switching of encoding by this population of neurons in the mPFC has the functional attributes as claimed here.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates how various behavioral features are represented in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats engaged in a naturalistic foraging task. The authors recorded electrophysiological responses of individual neurons as animals transitioned between navigation, reward consumption, avoidance, and escape behaviors. Employing a range of computational and statistical methods, including artificial neural networks, dimensionality reduction, hierarchical clustering, and Bayesian classifiers, the authors sought to predict from neural activity distinct task variables (such as distance from the reward zone and the success or failure of avoidance behavior). The findings suggest that mPFC neurons alternate between at least two distinct functional modes, namely spatial encoding and threat evaluation, contingent on the specific location.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study attempt to address an important question: understanding the role of mPFC across multiple dynamic behaviors. The authors highlight the diverse roles attributed to mPFC in previous literature and seek to explain this apparent heterogeneity. They designed an ethologically relevant foraging task that facilitated the examination of complex dynamic behavior, collecting comprehensive behavioral and neural data. The analyses conducted are both sound and rigorous.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Because the study still lacks experimental manipulation, the findings remain correlational. The authors have appropriately tempered their claims regarding the functional role of the mPFC in the task. The nature of the switch between functional modes encoding distinct task variables (i.e., distance to reward, and threat-avoidance behavior type) is not established. Moreover, the evidence presented to dissociate movement from these task variables is not fully convincing, particularly without single-session video analysis of movement. Specifically, while the new analyses in Figure 7 are informative, they may not fully account for all potential confounding variables arising from changes in context or behavior.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Jeong and Choi examine neural correlates of behavior during a naturalistic foraging task in which rats must dynamically balance resource acquisition (foraging) with the risk of threat. Rats first learn to forage for sucrose reward from a spout, and when a threat is introduced (an attack-like movement from a &quot;LobsterBot&quot;), they adjust their behavior to continue foraging while balancing exposure to the threat, adopting anticipatory withdraw behaviors to avoid encounter with the LobsterBot. Using electrode recordings targeting the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), they identify heterogenous encoding of task variables across prelimbic and infralimbic cortex neurons, including correlates of distance to the reward/threat zone and correlates of both anticipatory and reactionary avoidance behavior. Based on analysis of population responses, they show that prefrontal cortex switches between different regimes of population activity to process spatial information or behavioral responses to threat in a context-dependent manner. Characterization of the heterogenous coding scheme by which frontal cortex represents information in different goal states is an important contribution to our understanding of brain mechanisms underlying flexible behavior in ecological settings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>As many behavioral neuroscience studies employ highly controlled task designs, relatively less is generally known about how the brain organizes navigation and behavioral selection in naturalistic settings, where environment states and goals are more fluid. Here, the authors take advantage of a natural challenge faced by many animals - how to forage for resources in an unpredictable environment - to investigate neural correlates of behavior when goal states are dynamic. Related to his, they also investigate prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity is structured to support different functional &quot;modes&quot; (here, between a navigational mode and a threat-sensitive foraging mode) for flexible behavior. Overall, an important strength and real value of this study is the design of the behavioral experiment, which is trial-structured, permitting strong statistical methods for neural data analysis, yet still rich enough to encourage natural behavior structured by the animal's volitional goals. The experiment is also phased to measure behavioral changes as animals first encounter a threat, and then learn to adapt their foraging strategy to its presence. Characterization of this adaptation process is itself quite interesting and sets a foundation for further study of threat learning and risk management in the foraging context. Finally, the characterization of single-neuron and population dynamics in PFC in this naturalistic setting with fluid goal states is an important contribution to the field. Previous studies have identified neural correlates of spatial and behavioral variables in frontal cortex, but how these representations are structured, or how they are dynamically adjusted when animals shift their goals, has been less clear. The authors synthesize their main conclusions into a conceptual model for how PFC activity can support mode switching, which can be tested in future studies with other task designed and functional manipulations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the task design in this study is intentionally stimulus-rich and places minimal constraint on the animal to preserve naturalistic behavior, this also introduces confounds that limit interpretability of the neural analysis. For example, some variables which are the target of neural correlation analysis, such as spatial/proximity coding and coding of threat and threat-related behaviors, are naturally entwined. To their credit, the authors have included careful analyses and control conditions to disambiguate these variables and significantly improve clarity.</p>
<p>The authors also claim that the heterogenous coding of spatial and behavioral variables in PFC is structured in a particular way that depends on the animal's goals or context. As the authors themselves discuss, the different &quot;zones&quot; contain distinct behaviors and stimuli, and since some neurons are modulated by these events (e.g., licking sucrose water, withdrawing from the LobsterBot, etc.), differences in population activity may to some extent reflect behavior/event coding. The authors have included a control analysis, removing timepoints corresponding to salient events, to substantiate the claim that PFC neurons switch between different coding &quot;modes.&quot; While this significantly strengthens evidence for their conclusion, this analysis still depends on relatively coarse labeling of only very salient events. Future experiment designs, which intentionally separate task contexts (e.g. navigation vs. foraging), could serve to further clarify the structure of coding across contexts and/or goal states.</p>
<p>Finally, while the study includes many careful, in-depth neural and behavioral analyses to support the notion that modal coding of task variables in PFC may play a role in organizing flexible, dynamic behavior, the study still lacks functional manipulations to establish any form of causality. This limitation is acknowledged in the text, and the report is careful not to over interpret suggestions of causal contribution, instead setting a foundation for future investigations.</p>

<p>Thank you for the positive comment. We also acknowledge the inherent drawbacks of studying naturalistic behavior. As you also mentioned in the second round of review, separating navigation and foraging tasks in a larger apparatus, such as the one illustrated below, could better distinguish neural activity patterns associated with these different task types. To address the limitations of the current study, we have revised the report to avoid overinterpretation or unwarranted assumptions, and we appreciate that you have recognized this effort.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Jeong &amp; Choi (2023) use a semi-naturalistic paradigm to tackle the question of how the activity of neurons in the mPFC might continuously encode different functions. They offer two possibilities: either there are separate dedicated populations encoding each function, or cells alter their activity dependent on the current goal of the animal. In a threat-avoidance task rats procurred sucrose in an area of a chamber where, after remaining there for some amount of time, a 'Lobsterbot' robot attacked. In order to initiate the next trial rats had to move through the arena to another area before returning to the robot encounter zone. Therefore the task has two key components: threat avoidance and navigating through space. Recordings in the IL and PL of the mPFC revealed encoding that depended on what stage of the task the animal was currently engaged in. When animals were navigating, neuronal ensembles in these regions encoded distance from the threat. However, whilst animals were directly engaged with the threat and simultaneously consuming reward, it was possible to decode from a subset of the population whether animals would evade the threat. Therefore the authors claim that neurons in the mPFC switched between two functional modes: representing allocentric spatial information, and representing egocentric information pertaining to the reward and threat. Finally, the authors propose a conceptual model based on these data whereby this switching of population encoding is driven by either bottom-up sensory information or top-down arbitration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Whilst these multiple functions of activity in the mPFC have generally been observed in tasks dedicated to the study of a singular function, less work has been done in contexts where animals continuously switch between different modes of behaviour in a more natural way. Being able to assess whether previous findings of mPFC function apply in natural contexts is very valuable to the field, even outside of those interested in the mPFC directly. This also speaks to the novelty of the work; although mixed selectivity encoding of threat assessment and action selection has been demonstrated in some contexts (e.g. Grunfeld &amp; Likhtik, 2018) understanding the way in which encoding changes on-the-fly in a self-paced task is valuable both for verifying whether current understanding holds true and for extending our models of functional coding in the mPFC.</p>
<p>The authors are also generally thoughtful in their analyses and use a variety of approaches to probe the information encoded in the recorded activity. In particular, they use relatively close analysis of behaviour as well as manipulating the task itself by removing the threat to verify their own results. The use of such a rich task also allows them to draw comparisons, e.g. in different zones of the arena or different types of responses to threat, that a more reduced task would not otherwise allow. Additional in-depth analyses in the updated version of the manuscript, particularly the feature importance analysis, as well as complimentary null findings (a lack of cohesive place cell encoding, and no difference in location coding dependent on direction of trajectory) further support the authors' conclusion that populations of cells in the mPFC are switching their functional coding based on task context rather than behaviour per se. Finally, the authors' updated model schematic proposes an intriguing and testable implementation of how this encoding switch may be manifested by looking at differentiable inputs to these populations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main existing weakness of this study is that its findings are correlational (as the authors highlight in the discussion). Future work might aim to verify and expand the authors' findings - for example, whether the elevated response of Type 2 neurons directly contributes to the decision-making process or just represents fear/anxiety motivation/threat level - through direct physiological manipulation. However, I appreciate the challenges of interpreting data even in the presence of such manipulations and some of the additional analyses of behaviour, for example the stability of animals' inter-lick intervals in the E-zone, go some way towards ruling out alternative behavioural explanations. Yet the most ideal version of this analysis is to use a pose estimation method such as DeepLabCut to more fully measure behavioural changes. This, in combination with direct physiological manipulation, would allow the authors to fully validate that the switching of encoding by this population of neurons in the mPFC has the functional attributes as claimed here.</p>
<p>I wanted to add a minor comment about interpreting the two possible accounts presented in fig. 8 to suggest a third possibility: that both bottom-up sensory and top-down arbitration mechanisms can occur simultaneously to influence whether the activity of the population switches. Indeed, a model where these inputs are balanced or pitted against each other, so to speak, to continuously modulate encoding in the mPFC seems both adaptive and likely. Further, some speculation on the source of the 'arbitrator' in the top-down account would make this model more tractable for future testing of its validity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important perspective. We fully agree that an intricate and recurrent interaction between bottom-up and top-down modulations is a highly plausible account of how the mPFC changes its encoding mode. In line with this suggestion, we have incorporated this idea as a third possibility in the revised Discussion, alongside an updated version of Figure 8 that explicitly illustrates this competitive model.</p>
<p>Although we were unable to identify a definitive study directly measuring how the mPFC switches encoding modes across tasks, we did find relevant human EEG and fMRI studies addressing this issue. Based on these findings, we now propose the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a potential hub for top-down arbitration. We have added a paragraph in the Discussion describing this possibility and its implications for future testing.</p>
<p>“Which brain region might act as this arbitrator? Evidence from human neuroimaging studies implicates the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a central hub for switching cognitive modes. During task switching, the ACC shows increased activation (Hyafil et al., 2009), enhances connectivity with task-specific regions (Aben et al., 2020), correlates with multitask performance (Kondo et al., 2004), and monitors the reliability of competing decision systems (Lee et al., 2014). Collectively, these findings point to a pivotal role for the ACC in coordinating task assignment. Rodent studies also link the ACC to strategic mode switching (Tervo et al., 2014), suggesting that the rodent ACC could similarly arbitrate between strategies, determining which task-relevant variables are represented in the ventral mPFC, including the PL and IL. Future studies combining multi-context tasks with causal manipulations will be essential to determine whether these functional shifts are driven primarily by top-down arbitration or by bottom-up sensory inputs.”</p>

Specifically, while the new analyses in Figure 7 are informative, they may not fully account for all potential confounding variables arising from changes in context or behavior.</p>
<p>Regarding the claim of highly stereotyped behavior, there are some inconsistencies. While the authors assert this, Figure 1F shows inter-animal variability, and the PETHs, representing averaged activity, may not fully capture the variability of the behavior across sessions and animals. To strengthen this aspect, a more detailed analysis that examines the relationship between behavior and neural activity on a trial-by-trial basis, or at minimum, per session, could help.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful recommendation and the opportunity to clarify our use of the term “stereotyped behavior.” By this, we were specifically referring to the animals’ consistent licking behavior in the E-zone, rather than to the latency of head withdrawal, which indeed varied across trials and animals. Because licking tempo and body posture during sucrose consumption were highly consistent, the decision to avoid or stay (AW vs. EW) could not be predicted from overt behavior alone. This consistency strengthens our conclusion that the significant predictive power of the Bayesian decoding analysis reflects intrinsic firing patterns of the mPFC neural network, rather than simple behavioral correlates of avoidance.</p>
<p>We also note that the Bayesian model was conducted on a trial-by-trial basis, and the reported prediction accuracy of 73% represents the average across all individual trials (Figure 6B, C). Thus, the analysis inherently captures variability across trials and animals, directly addressing the reviewer’s concern.</p>
<p>The reviewer is correct that the PETHs shown in Figure 5 are based on session-averaged activity aligned to head-entry and head-withdrawal events. The purpose of this analysis was to illustrate that certain modulation patterns could be grouped into 2–3 distinct categories. While averaged activity can provide insight into collective responses to external events, we agree that trial-based analyses provide a more rigorous demonstration of the link between neural ensemble activity and behavioral decisions. This is precisely why we complemented the PETH analysis with Bayesian decoding, which provides stronger evidence that mPFC ensemble activity is predictive of the animal’s choice to avoid or stay.</p>

<p>Similarly, the claim regarding the limited scope of extraneous behavior (beyond licking) requires further substantiation. It would be more convincing to quantify potential variations in licking vigor and to provide evidence for the absence of significant postural changes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this concern, we quantified licking vigor using the inter-lick interval (ILI) as an indirect index. A lick was defined as the period from tongue contact with the IR beam (Lick-On) to withdrawal (Lick-Off), and the ILI was calculated as the time between a Lick-Off and the subsequent Lick-On. Across all animals, ILIs were clustered within a narrow range with a median of 0.155 s (see Author response image 4, left panel).</p>
<p>We analyzed licking vigor at two levels: within trials and within sessions. Because reduced vigor or satiation would lengthen ILIs, comparing the first half and the last half of ILIs within a trial or within a session provides a sensitive proxy for licking consistency.</p>
<p>Within trials: For each of 2,820 trials, we compared the mean ILI of the first half of licks to that of the second half. The average difference was only ~ 17 ms (middle panel). Across sessions: Trial-averaged ILIs were compared between the first and last halves of each session, yielding a mean difference ~ 1.7 ms per session (right panel).</p>
<p>These analyses demonstrate that rats maintained stable licking vigor whenever they entered the E-zone, regardless of avoidance outcome.</p>

<p>Concerning the ANN model, while I understand the choice of a 4-layer network for its performance, the study could have benefited from exploring simpler models. A model where weight corresponds directly to individual neurons could improve interpretability and facilitate the investigation of dynamic changes in neuronal 'modes' (i.e., weight adjustments) over time.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with the reviewer on the importance of biologically interpretable models. While artificial neural networks (ANNs) share certain similarities with neural computation, they are not intended to capture biological realism. For example, the error correction mechanism used in ANNs, such as backpropagation has no direct counterpart in mammalian neural circuits. Although we considered approaches that would link each computational node more directly to the activity of individual neurons, building such a model would require temporally sensitive, mechanistic frameworks (e.g., leaky integrate-and-fire networks) and an extensive behavioral alignment effort, which is beyond the scope of the current study.</p>
<p>Our use of an ANN was intended solely as an analytical tool to uncover hidden patterns in multi-unit activity that may not be detectable with traditional methods. Among various machine-learning algorithms, we selected a four-layer ANN regressor because it achieved significantly lower decoding errors (Supplementary Figure S3) and showed robustness to hyperparameter variation (Glaser et al., 2020). To acknowledge the limitations of this approach and suggest future directions, we have revised the Results section to explicitly discuss these points.</p>
<p>“Among various machine learning algorithms, we selected a robust tool for decoding underlying patterns in the data, rather than to model the architecture of the mPFC. We implemented a four-layer artificial neural network regressor (ANN; see Materials and Methods for a detailed structure), as the ANN achieves significantly lower decoding errors (Supplementary Figure S3) and has robustness to hyperparameter changes (Glaser et al., 2020).”</p>
