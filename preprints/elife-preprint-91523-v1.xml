<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Root gravitropic bending represents a fundamental aspect of terrestrial plant physiology. Gravity is perceived by sedimentation of starch-rich plastids (statoliths) to the bottom of the central root cap cells. Following gravity perception, intercellular auxin transport is redirected downwards leading to an asymmetric auxin accumulation at the lower root side causing inhibition of cell expansion, ultimately resulting in downwards bending. How gravity-induced statoliths repositioning is translated into asymmetric auxin distribution remains unclear despite PIN auxin efflux carriers and the Negative Gravitropic Response of roots (NGR) proteins polarize along statolith sedimentation, thus providing a plausible mechanism for auxin flow redirection. In this study, using a functional NGR1-GFP construct, we visualized the NGR1 localization on the statolith surface and plasma membrane (PM) domains in close proximity to the statoliths, correlating with their movements. We determined that NGR1 binding to these PM domains is indispensable for NGR1 functionality and relies on cysteine acylation and adjacent polybasic regions as well as on lipid and sterol PM composition. Detailed timing of the early events following graviperception suggested that both NGR1 repolarization and initial auxin asymmetry precede the visible PIN3 polarization. This discrepancy motivated us to unveil a rapid, NGR-dependent translocation of PIN-activating AGCVIII kinase D6PK towards lower PMs of gravity-perceiving cells, thus providing an attractive model for rapid redirection of auxin fluxes following gravistimulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plants are capable of sensing gravity and adjust their organs’ growth direction accordingly. This phenomenon is called gravitropism, with positive gravitropism referring to the root growing down towards the soil and negative gravitropism describing the upward growth of the shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kawamoto and Morita, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kolesnikov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Takahashi et al., 2021</xref>). The model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> senses gravity in the shoot endodermal cells and root cap columella cells, in special gravity sensing cells, which contain starch enriched plastids - amyloplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kiss et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Morita, 2010</xref>). Due to their higher density, amyloplasts thus act as statoliths and sediment within cells depending on the direction of gravity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sack, 1991</xref>). Following amyloplast sedimentation, the PIN auxin efflux carriers (PIN3 and PIN7) polarize towards the bottom cell sides, thus creating a downwards polarized auxin flow, which subsequently results in the asymmetric auxin accumulation at the lower side of the organ mediating the shoot/root curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Band et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Friml et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rakusová et al., 2011</xref>). While sedimenting amyloplasts clearly serve as a signal for asymmetric auxin distribution, the precise mechanism remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Han et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kiss et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, the LAZY protein family has been identified as a crucial player in the process of auxin redistribution and normal tropic response for both roots and shoots following gravistimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jiao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yoshihara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yoshihara and Iino, 2007</xref>). LZY1, LZY2, and LZY3 function redundantly in shoot gravitropism; LZY2, LZY3, and LZY4 - also referred to as NGR1, NGR3, and NGR2 (NEGATIVE GRAVITROPIC RESPONSE OF ROOTS) - regulate the root gravitropism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kawamoto and Morita, 2022</xref>). <italic>ngr1,2,3</italic> triple mutant plants display an anti-gravitropic phenotype with the root growing slightly upwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ge and Chen, 2016</xref>). This phenotype is accompanied by an inverted PIN3 polarization, thus redirecting the auxin flow to the upper side of the gravistimulated root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ge and Chen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Taniguchi et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, it was recently demonstrated that following gravistimulation, NGR3 localizes asymmetrically to the plasma membrane (PM) in columella cells of lateral roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Furutani et al., 2020</xref>). However, the structure and molecular function of NGR proteins, as well as specific domains that could allow for PM association and polarization are still unknown. Polarization of NGR3 further acts as a precursor of PIN3 relocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Furutani et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, PIN transport activity is finetuned by phosphorylation mediated by AGCVIII serine/threonine kinases like D6 PROTEIN KINASE (D6PK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014</xref>). Whether additional factors play a role in this signaling cascade and how the underlying molecular mechanism connecting gravity sensing to asymmetric auxin distribution may look like, remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>Here, we provide novel insights into mechanisms of gravity-induced NGR1 polarization and downstream processes leading to PIN-dependent auxin fluxes activation and ultimately, gravitropic bending. We show the crucial function of polybasic regions and acylation of NGR1 for its binding to the PM and amyloplasts in columella cells, which is essential for its function in gravitropic bending. Pharmacological approaches show that the membrane composition affects NGR1 PM binding and polarization. Finally, we show rapid translocation of PIN activator - D6 protein kinase as an event downstream of NGR signaling. These observations suggest a model where statolith sedimentation is accompanied by rapid NGR relocation, which mediates similar relocation of the D6PK activator of PIN transporters, providing means to rapidly redirect asymmetric auxin fluxes in response to gravity.</p>

<title>NGR1 localizes to statoliths and their sedimentation is accompanied by NGR1 polarization at the lower PM</title>
<p>To observe NGR localization in the columella cells, we cloned <italic>NGR1-GFP</italic> under its native promoter (<italic>NGR1p::NGR1-GFP</italic>) and transformed it into the <italic>ngr1/2/3</italic> triple mutants.

NGR1-GFP displayed a highly specific columella expression, which was most prominent at the PM and the statolith periphery. NGR1-GFP signal from the PM was not evenly distributed, but rather polarized to the lower side of the columella cells in the vicinity of the sedimented statoliths (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Constitutive overexpression of NGR1-GFP under 35S promoter (<italic>35Sp::NGR1-GFP</italic>) confirmed that in multiple other cell types, NGR1-GFP localizes to the PM suggesting direct membrane binding mechanism. Additionally, NGR1 is associated with other plastid types such as chloroplasts in guard cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). To separate the GFP signal from the chlorophyll, we used fluorescence lifetime imaging, which confirmed that NGR1-GFP localizes at the chloroplast periphery (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). This implies a general plastid targeting mechanism of NGR. Notably, chloroplasts in the vicinity of the PM strongly correlated with NGR1 accumulating at the PM nearby, similar to the scenario in columella (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A,C</xref>).</p>
<p>This shows that NGR1-GFP localizes to the plastids and PM in their vicinity providing a mechanism for how gravity-induced statolith sedimentation can polarize NGR1-GFP to the bottom PM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Timing of events during the gravitropic response</title>
<p>Next, we tracked the timing of events during gravitropic bending. We used a vertical stage microscope and minimized the time required for rotating the sample. 180° rotation was performed during the imaging so that precise timing could be determined from the individual frame timestamps. Following gravitropic stimulus, NGR1 at the PM relocalized dynamically with the falling statoliths (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). First, the signal at the top membrane decreased and then reached the bottom PM together with statoliths, around 5 minutes after the stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,D</xref>). If the root was rotated 180° from the vertical position, the time required for the statolith sedimentation has increased due to the cell’s elongated shape and the presence of vacuole. In such a scenario, it took more than 15 minutes for the statoliths to fall. Again, the increase of the NGR1 signal at the bottom side correlated with the statolith occurrence, implying that statolith vicinity is the region where NGR1 signal gets enriched (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>). When monitored for an extended period of time, NGR1 signal was always decorating the PM proximal to the statolith (Supplementary movie 1).</p>
<p>To put these early gravitropic events in the context of the auxin gradient formation, we tracked PIN3 localization dynamics, intracellular calcium transients, and auxin reporter DII-Venus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brunoud et al., 2012</xref>). Calcium transients are one of the fastest known auxin response events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Monshausen et al., 2011</xref>) and we monitored them using plants stably transformed with GCaMP3 fluorescent sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zariwala et al., 2012</xref>). While the signal increase at the bottom side of the root was visible within a minute after statoliths touched the bottom membrane, its decrease at the top PM started immediately after rotation. This implies that the first signaling event in the root gravitropic bending is the statolith removal from the top membrane, rather than its arrival at the bottom (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). While subsequent changes in the DII-Venus degradation were consistent with the calcium-based timing, the first visible PIN3 polarization to the bottom columella cell sides was detectable only after 15 minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F,G</xref>). Nonetheless, already the earliest auxin asymmetry is likely generated by PIN-mediated polar auxin transport as it was completely blocked by the treatment with N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), a PIN inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abas et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize, statolith sedimentation is accompanied by rapid NGR1 relocation to the PM subdomain proximal to the NGR1-containing statoliths. The first event in gravitropic response is the NGR1 leaving the top membrane accompanied by decrease in the auxin signaling at the upper root side, followed by NGR1 arrival at the bottom membrane and increase in auxin signaling at the bottom side. This initial auxin asymmetry is mediated by PIN-dependent auxin transport, despite visible polarization of PIN3 can be detected only later.</p>

<title>NGR1 polarization does not require BFA-sensitive trafficking</title>
<p>To gain more insight into the dynamics of the NGR1 localization to the PM and amyloplasts, we tested different inhibitors to alter membrane composition and interfere with endocytic trafficking. Recently, it has been shown that RCC1-like domain (RLD) proteins directly interact with NGRs and play a crucial role in polar auxin transport during gravity signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Furutani et al., 2020</xref>). As RLD trafficking is known to be sensitive to the ARF-GEF inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Furutani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), we examined if the drug also affects the localization and polarization of NGR1. 5-day-old <italic>NGR1p::NGR1-GFP</italic> seedlings were incubated with 50µM BFA together with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX, 50µM) and the endocytic tracer FM4-64 (2µM) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Geldner et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, while FM4-64-stained membranes accumulated into so-called BFA compartments, NGR1-GFP did not and still showed association with the PM and amyloplasts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). Furthermore, the polarization of NGR1 following gravity stimulation was not disrupted in the presence of BFA. Similar effects were observed in overexpressed NGR1 as it also did not show co-localization with BFA aggregates (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2A-C</xref>).</p>

<p>This shows that NGR1 localization and gravity-induced polarization does not undergo BFA-sensitive endocytic recycling mediated by the ARF-GEF GNOM as it has been shown for other proteins involved in gravity response like RLDs and PINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Geldner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Naramoto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>NGR1 PM association requires specific membrane composition</title>
<p>NGR1 displays PM localization although transmembrane domains are not predicted in its structure and it does not undergo BFA-sensitive trafficking. This implies the existence of posttranslational modifications such as S-acylation to associate with PM. To test for the presence of S-acylation sites, we utilized the reducing properties of Dithiothreitol (DTT), which interferes with the formation of the thioester bond thus effectively preventing S-acylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sabol et al., 2017</xref>). Following previously described conditions, NGR1-GFP showed an increase in cytoplasmic signal and reduction of PM association (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Similar effect of DTT was observed when expressing NGR1 under the 35S promoter, suggesting that there is indeed an acylation site (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D-E</xref>). Interestingly, NGR1 still localizes to amyloplasts, indicating a different way of plastid association compared to the PM.</p>
<p>Next, we tested whether apart from the NGR1 S-acylation, the membrane composition itself might be essential for the NGR1 PM association. Previously it has been shown that polybasic regions (PBRs) of proteins can target them to anionic phospholipids like PtdIns(4)P (PI4P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hammond et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">McLaughlin and Murray, 2005</xref>). We tested whether the dissociation of PI4P from the PM will affect the PM association. <italic>NGR1p::NGR1-GFP</italic> was incubated for 30 minutes with 30 µM phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a PtdIns(4) kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hammond et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Vermeer et al., 2009</xref>). The NGR1-GFP cytosolic signal was significantly increased, indicating that the interplay between PBRs and phospholipids is important for NGR1 PM but not amyloplast association (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we wanted to determine whether sterols might influence the PM association of NGR1. NGR1-GFP seedlings were grown on fenpropimorph (FEN), an inhibitor of sterol biosynthesis that decreases the number of sterols and can trigger their conversion into cyclopropyl sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Frescatada-Rosa et al., 2014</xref>). NGR1-GFP showed an increase in cytoplasmic signal and membrane localization was largely lost (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Comparable effects were also observed after treatment with another sterol synthesis inhibitor lovastatin (LOV) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2F</xref>). However, similarly to DTT and PAO, amyloplast localization could not be disturbed.</p>
<p>These observations show that NGR1 PM but not necessarily plastid localization depends likely on acylation, phospholipid, and sterol membrane composition.</p>

<title>NGR1 PM localization is synergistically mediated by polybasic regions and a palmitoylation site</title>
<p>To further study NGR1 membrane localization, we examined the amino acid sequence of the NGR1 to understand which sites of the protein mediate its association with the membrane. We identified 2 polybasic regions K<sup>113</sup>K<sup>114</sup>R<sup>115</sup>K<sup>116</sup> (PBR1) and K<sup>186</sup>K<sup>187</sup>K<sup>188</sup>R<sup>189</sup> (PBR2) – these strands of positively charged amino acids may mediate the interaction of NGR1 with negatively charged phospholipids. Also, we noticed a conserved Cys<sup>206</sup> residue – a potential S-palmitoylation (PALM) site according to the GPS-Lipid post-translational modification prediction tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Xie et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the role of these sites in the NGR1 membrane localization we performed site-directed mutagenesis based on the NGR1-GFP construct. We introduced mutations K<sup>114</sup>E&amp;R<sup>115</sup>E (-PBR1), and K<sup>187</sup>E&amp;K<sup>188</sup>E (-PBR2) to the polybasic regions of the NGR1 to neutralize their positive charge, and mutated the conserved cysteine C<sup>206</sup>A (-PALM) to abolish the potential palmitoylation site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). NGR1<sup>-PALM</sup>-GFP, NGR1<sup>-PBR2</sup>-GFP, and NGR1<sup>-PBR1&amp;2</sup>-GFP under the native NGR1 promoter were transformed into the <italic>ngr1/2/3</italic> background.

The NGR1<sup>-PALM</sup> version resembled the reorientation of the NGR1<sup>WT</sup>-GFP version and NGR<sup>-PBR2</sup> and NGR1<sup>-PBR1&amp;2</sup> versions demonstrated a slight delay in the main root angle restoration after reorientation in the vertical scanner setup (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). Then we performed confocal imaging of the root columella cells to check the localization of the NGR1<sup>-PALM</sup>-GFP, NGR1<sup>-PBR2</sup>-GFP, and NGR1<sup>-PBR1&amp;2</sup>-GFP proteins (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>). To compare the different mutant versions we quantified the PM/cytoplasm signal ratio. The PM/cytoplasm ratio was slightly decreased for NGR1<sup>-PALM</sup>-GFP, NGR1<sup>-PBR2</sup>-GFP, and NGR1<sup>-PBR1&amp;2</sup>-GFP mutants compared to NGR1<sup>WT</sup>-GFP (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref>).</p>

<p>As the mutations only in the palmitoylation site or only in the polybasic regions of the NGR1 did not lead to the significant disruption of the plant gravitropic response and the dissociation of the protein from the membrane, we combined these mutations to check their collective effect. We generated NGR1<sup>-PALM&amp;PBR2</sup>-GFP with a mutation in the PALM site and the PBR2, and NGR1<sup>-PALM&amp;PBR1&amp;2</sup> with a mutation in both PBR1 and PBR2 and PALM site. <italic>NGR1p::NGR1<sup>-PALM&amp;PBR2</sup>-GFP</italic> and <italic>NGR1p::NGR1<sup>-PALM&amp;PBR1&amp;2</sup>-GFP</italic> could not fully complement <italic>ngr1/2/3</italic> triple mutant. The main root of the 5 d.o. seedlings demonstrated inclination from the vertical angle (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3E</xref>). In contrast to NGR1-GFP complemented <italic>ngr1/2/3</italic> plants, complementation with NGR1<sup>-PALM&amp;PBR2</sup> displayed partially compromised restoration of the main root angle upon reorientation, while the NGR1<sup>-PALM&amp;PBR1&amp;2</sup> root bending was completely disrupted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). With confocal microscopy we observed the dissociation of the NGR1<sup>-PALM&amp;PBR2</sup> and NGR1<sup>-PALM&amp;PBR1&amp;2</sup> from the PM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). PM/cytoplasm ratio was significantly decreased for both NGR1<sup>-PALM&amp;PBR2</sup> and NGR1<sup>-</sup> <sup>PALM&amp;PBR1&amp;2</sup> compared to non-mutated NGR1-GFP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Taken together, the combination of mutations in polybasic regions and palmitoylation site resulted in the decrease of NGR1-GFP PM binding and loss of the protein functionality.</p>
<p>If the selected polybasic regions and palmitoylation site represent solely the mean of the PM anchoring, then bringing the protein back to the PM by different targeting signal should restore its functionality. To test this hypothesis, we introduced another membrane-association site to the mutant versions of NGR1-GFP. It was shown that the N-terminus of LZY1 mediates its membrane localization potentially via a predicted N-myristoylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yoshihara and Spalding, 2020</xref>). This site is not conserved in the NGR1. Remarkably, LZY1 does not possess the palmitoylated Cys residue conserved in NGR1 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>). We changed the N-terminus of all the NGR1 mutant versions carrying the mutation C<sup>206</sup>A to introduce the LZY1 N-terminal myristoylation site. The obtained <italic>NGR1<sup>Nmyr</sup> <sup>-PALM</sup>-GFP, NGR1<sup>Nmyr</sup> <sup>-PALM&amp;PBR2</sup>-GFP, NGR1<sup>Nmyr</sup> <sup>-PALM&amp;PBR1&amp;2</sup>-GFP</italic> versions under NGR1 native promoter were transformed to the <italic>ngr1/2/3</italic>.</p>
<p>As an alternative, we used a well-characterized membrane-association sequence from the C-terminus of ROP2 (ROP-CT) carrying a polybasic region and geranyl-geranylation site (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yalovsky et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, as for the N-myristoylation site, we added the ROP-CT on the C-terminus after the GFP tag to all the variants with the mutated PALM site. The resulting <italic>NGR1p::NGR1<sup>-PALM</sup> <sup>ROP-CT</sup>-GFP, NGR1p::NGR1<sup>-PALM&amp;PBR2</sup> <sup>ROP-CT</sup>-GFP, NGR1p::NGR1<sup>-PALM&amp;PBR1&amp;2</sup> <sup>ROP-CT</sup>-GFP</italic> were transformed in <italic>ngr1/2/3</italic> background. PM localization and gravitropic response of the versions with another acylation site were restored gradually (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C-H</xref>).</p>
<p>We examined the localization of the GFP signal in the columella of both restored <sub>lines (NGR1</sub>Nmyr-PALM&amp;PBR1&amp;2<sub>-GFP and NGR1</sub>-PALM&amp;PBR1&amp;2 ROP-CT<sub>-GFP). NGR1</sub>Nmyr-PALM&amp;PBR1&amp;2 membrane association was partially restored, and NGR1<sup>-PALM&amp;PBR1&amp;2</sup> <sup>ROP-CT</sup> membrane association was fully restored (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E,F</xref>). In accordance with PM localization, the gravitropic response of those plants was also restored (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G,H</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus NGR1 PM localization is mediated synergistically by polybasic regions and palmitoylation site, and the NGR1 PM association is crucial for NGR1 functioning in root gravitropic response.</p>

<title>D6PK relocalizes in columella following gravistimulation in NGR1-dependent manner</title>
<p>NGR1 protein relocalization occurs simultaneously with statolith sedimentation and is rapidly followed by PIN-dependent asymmetric auxin accumulation at the lower root side. These events, however, precede a visible PIN3 polarization towards the bottom columella cell sides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-G</xref>). Alternatively, we hypothesized that asymmetric PIN activation at this position may precede the PIN polarization there and mediate the early auxin asymmetry. To test this, we analyzed the localization of D6PK, a well-established PIN3 activating kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Willige et al., 2013</xref>). We monitored D6PK under its native promoter with N-terminal YFP and mCHERRY (mCH) tags. This revealed a highly dynamic polarized D6PK localization following gravistimulation. Following 180° rotation, YFP-D6PK and mCH-D6PK displayed a very clear translocation to the new bottom side of the columella cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>). To resolve whether this polarization depends on NGR proteins, we transformed mCHERRY-D6PK (mCH-D6PK) to both <italic>ngr1/2/3</italic> triple mutants and Col-0 wild type plants. Notably, following gravistimulation, D6PK polarization was absent in <italic>ngr1/2/3</italic> triple mutants (Fig. 5C-D, Supplementary movie 2). Surprisingly, other cell types such as meristematic cells or epidermal cells still displayed undisturbed basal (WT-like) D6PK polarity in <italic>ngr1/2/3</italic> triple mutant suggesting a role of NGRs in D6PK targeting specifically during gravity response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we provide several new crucial insights into the mechanism through which plant roots adapt their growth in response to gravity: (i) we mapped the early events after gravistimulation with unprecedented time resolution challenging the current gravitropic models; (ii) we observed real-time relocalization of the key gravitropic regulator, NGR1 on and alongside the descending statoliths and (iii) mapped the conditions for NGR1 crucial association with the PM; and, finally, (iv) we detected rapid, NGR1-dependent relocation of D6PK auxin transport activator. This altogether suggests a new mechanism for rapid redirection of auxin fluxes following gravistimulation.</p>

<title>Early events during root gravitropic response</title>
<p>The temporal correlation between NGR1 relocation and auxin asymmetry dynamics was tested by monitoring auxin-dependent calcium transients. Interestingly, while an auxin-induced calcium wave can be observed following statolith descent to the bottom side of the gravity-sensing cells, preceding this, a decline in calcium transients occurs at the upper root side. These observations suggest that the first signaling event in root gravitropic bending may not be statolith contact with the cell bottom, but rather the departure of statoliths from the upper PM, closely followed by NGR1 and D6PK translocation to the bottom cell sides. Only significantly later, similar polarization of PIN auxin exporters can be confidently observed. This may be reflected by actual onset of the root bending, as there is growing evidence, that the actual root bending begins much sooner than previously reported, in fact, some degree of bending was observed already within the first 5 minutes following gravistimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dubey et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Serre et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Insights into NGR membrane association and gravity-induced polarization</title>
<p>NGR-GFP relocation to the new bottom membrane happens rapidly and is not affected when ARF GEF-mediated endomembrane trafficking is inhibited. Although the precise mechanism of NGR1 dynamic relocation following gravitropic stimulus still remains elusive, this study brings some new insights. The NGR1 membrane anchoring mechanism is dependent on cysteine acylation and adjacent polybasic stretches, which interact with charged lipids at the membrane surface. Such a mechanism is typical for a plethora of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hemsley and Grierson, 2008</xref>). Since we could restore the protein functionality by adding two different membrane anchors on the NGR1 N and C terminus, we conclude that the mechanism of membrane targeting is rather universal. Point mutated NGR1 proteins which lost their membrane binding ability still retained the statolith binding, implying an independent targeting mechanism. Therefore we can conclude that statolith-bound NGR1 is not sufficient for the NGR1 function in gravitropism.</p>
<p>Our pharmacological experiments indicate that both sterols and charged lipids play a role in the NGR membrane binding. This resembles other highly polarized structures such as root hairs, where sterols and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate are vital for the polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Champeyroux et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ovecka et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, PIN2 polarity was defective in sterol synthesis mutants, implying the role of sterols in planar polarity as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Men et al., 2008</xref>). Whether there is mobile sterol-rich domain moving alongside the statolith or the membrane composition is uniform remains to be elucidated.</p>

<title>Gravity-induced D6PK kinase polarization as mechanism for rapid auxin fluxes redirection</title>
<p>PIN auxin transporters were shown to polarize following gravistimulation to the bottom of gravity-sensing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Friml et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Furutani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010</xref>) providing a mechanism for redirection of auxin fluxes downwards. Although PIN polarization has been shown to be reliant on NGR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ge and Chen, 2019</xref>), the timing of early gravitropic events resolved here suggests that it occurs too late to account for the initial auxin asymmetry. Either, we are unable to detect early, less-pronounced PIN asymmetry or there is an additional mechanism preceding the auxin flux redirection via PIN relocation.</p>
<p>Our discovery of similar gravity-induced polarization of D6PK AGCVIII kinases, which is contingent on NGR activity, bridges this critical knowledge gap and suggests that, prior to relocation of PIN transporters, AGCVIII-mediated PIN activation at the lower cell sides rapidly redirects auxin fluxes following gravity perception. Notably, PIN3 phosphorylation is important for gravity response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Grones et al., 2018</xref>) and higher-order D6PK mutants display mild gravitropic bending phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zourelidou et al., 2009</xref>), which are, however, weaker than <italic>ngr1/2/3</italic> mutants. This observation might be attributed to the multiplicity of the AGC kinase family and/or an additional mechanism governing the differential accumulation of PIN proteins, following D6PK polarization, thus contributing to the regulation of auxin flux.</p>
<p>Similarly to NGRs, D6PK membrane localization depends on polybasic regions and sterol-rich environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barbosa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Stanislas et al., 2015</xref>). However, in contrast to NGR proteins, D6PK localization is dependent on BFA-sensitive trafficking regulator GNOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barbosa et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2014</xref>) and thus is likely delivered to the PM by vesicle trafficking. RLD proteins, implicated in the regulation of the GNOM-dependent PIN trafficking pathway, are directly recruited by NGR homolog NGR3 (LZY3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Furutani et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, RLD proteins contain the BRX domain, which is responsible for the NGR interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Furutani et al., 2020</xref>). In the different cellular context, BRX protein was shown to be an inhibitor of AGC kinase (PAX) induced PIN3 activation and an interactor of multiple D6PK proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Marhava et al., 2018</xref>). This implies that BRX containing proteins may act as negative feedback on PIN phosphorylation after gravistimulation. Indeed, our observations indicate that the D6PK signal at the new bottom membrane reaches its maximum approximately 7-8 minutes after gravistimulation and subsequently diminishes, hinting at the existence of a negative feedback mechanism. The involvement of RLDs in this process remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>Taken together, an updated model of early events in root gravity-sensing cells emerges: (i) Statoliths sediment and bring associated NGR proteins to the lower PM; by a mechanism requiring electrostatic interaction-based association of NGR with the PM; (ii) dependent on these events, the D6PK translocates almost concomitantly also to the bottom cell sides, likely by GNOM-dependent trafficking mechanism; (iii) D6PK activates PINs at the lower side, auxin transport get redirected downwards reflected by a decrease of auxin response at the upper side followed by auxin response increase at the lower root side; (iv) D6PK asymmetry gradually diminishes, possibly by action of BRX domain-containing proteins and the whole PIN-dependent auxin transport machinery gradually relocates to the lower cell side for more sustained redirection of auxin fluxes. There are still many mechanistic links to be confirmed and clarified in this model but it is consistent with all observations on the sequence of events following gravistimulation and with all additional data from other developmental contexts.</p>

<p>NGR1 transformants were selected on plates containing 30µg/ml hygromycin. NGR1p::NGR1-GFP plants with genotyped with primers gNGRmut-NGR1prom-fwd and gNGRmut-T35S-rev, and the middle part of the NGR1 was sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations.</p>
<p><italic>D6PKp::mCH-D6PK</italic> was produced using the Greengate cloning strategy. Greengate entry blocks were generated with the use of the Gibson assembly (pGGA-D6PK promotor) and restriction-ligation assembly (pGGC-D6PK). 2KB fragment upstream of D6PK start codon was used and the BsaI site was removed using point mutated compatible cohesive ends for the Gibson assembly between fragments A and B. Other building blocks used were: pGGB-mCHERRY-linker (pGGB001), pGGD-Dummy (pGGD002), pGGE UBQ10 terminator (pGGE009), pGGF-d-AlanineR (pGGF003), destination vector (pGGZ001 modified to contain bacterial kanamycin resistance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lampropoulos et al., 2013</xref>), plasmids were obtained from Addgene or were kindly provided by Dr. Andrea Bleckmann. pD6PK::mCH-D6PK transformants bearing DAO-selection cassette were selected on the 3 mM D-Alanine.</p>

<p>For imaging, vertically mounted Zeiss LSM800 was used with air objectives Plan Apochromat 20x/0.8 M27 and Plan Apochromat 10x/0.45 M27 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Air objective Plan Apochromat 20x/0.8 M27 and water objective Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.2 M27 were used in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>. Plan apochromat 60x 1.4 Oil objective was used for the airyscan imaging (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). For fluorescence lifetime imaging (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>), Leica Stellaris 5 with Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.2 M27 was used. GCaMP signal was imaged using GFP emission (500-540nm) using 405nm and 488nm excitation lasers. Signal obtained by 405nm excitation was used as a ratiometric reference. For the gravitropic experiments, brightfield images were always taken together with the fluorescent probes to determine the statolith contact with basal PM. This was determined as a time at which statolith movement relative to the cell surface stopped.</p>

<title>Plant treatments</title>
<p>The following inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO: Brefeldin A (Sigma); Cycloheximide (Sigma); PAO (Sigma); Fenpropimorph (Sigma); Lovastatin (Sigma); NPA (DUCHEFA N0926). BFA treatment was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Geldner et al., 2001</xref>). In brief, seedlings were submerged in liquid MS medium and pre-treated with 50µM CHX for 30 minutes. Subsequently, they were incubated with 50µM BFA and 50µM CHX for 75 minutes. Then, 2µM FM4-64 was added and co-incubated with 50µM BFA and 50µM CHX for 15 minutes. Treatment with PAO was executed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barbosa et al., 2016</xref>); seedlings were incubated in 30µM PAO-containing liquid MS medium for 20 minutes, followed by the addition of 2µM FM4-64 and another 10-minute incubation. For quantification purposes, 5-day-old seedlings grown on AM+ plates with 1µM LOV and 250µg/ml FEN were utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Stanislas et al., 2015</xref>). Representative images were captured of 5-day-old seedlings that were initially grown on AM+ and subsequently transferred to 1µM LOV and 50µg/ml FEN for a duration of 2 hours. To treat with DTT, seedlings were incubated in liquid MS medium supplemented with 50mM DTT (Sigma; dissolved in H2O) for 3 hours, followed by a 10-minute incubation with 2µM FM4-64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sabol et al., 2017</xref>). Unless otherwise stated, treated seedlings were mounted in liquid MS medium for live imaging. As a control for used inhibitors, solvent control treatments were performed in parallel.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>To quantify signals in the individual cells, time series were stabilized by Correct 3D drift Fiji plugin. All image data was obtained in 16-bit format. ROI were selected and measured using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism. Data was normalized so that the first value = 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A,D,F</xref>, 4D) or by using reference channel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>, 2B)</p>
<p>In order to analyze subcellular colocalization we utilized the tool JACoP (Just Another Co-localization Plugin), that allows for a correlation of pixels of dual-channel images based on Pearson’s coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Gravitropic bending experiments were performed in the vertically oriented scanner setup. 4 d.o. seedlings were transferred to a new solid agarose media plate and aligned so that the roots were straightened. Images obtained with 30 min intervals were registered with the Fiji StackReg plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Roots were manually tracked and angle increments were calculated using Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>For the PM/cytoplasm ratio quantification, the background of the confocal images was subtracted; with the multi-point selection tool 15-50 points on the PM, and 15-50 points in the cytoplasm were selected, and the intensity of the GFP signal was measured. The location of the PM membrane was confirmed with the FM4-64 staining. The PM region was selected on the bottom side of the cells, as NGR1 is localized polarly. The cytoplasmic region was selected close to the selected membrane region and did not include the region with amyloplasts and the vacuole. For individual cells the averaged PM signal was divided by the averaged cytoplasmic signal. The PM/cytoplasm ratio for the lines is quantified as the average of the PM/cytoplasm ratios for individual cells of this line. If not stated otherwise, all experiments were performed in triplicate. 3 or more independent transgenic lines were always used with similar results.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The current work by Kulich et al. examines the dynamic relocalization of NGR1 (LAZY2) a member of the LAZY protein family which is key for auxin redistribution during gravitropic responses. After gravistimulation of the triple mutant ngr123 (lazy234), the PIN3 activating kinase D6PK is not polarized in the columella cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors show a thorough characterization of NGR1 relocalization dynamics after gravistimulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Genetically the relocalization of D6PK depends on the LAZY protein family, but some essential details are missing in this study. On the one hand, NGR1-GFP does not associate with the BFA compartments and maintains its association with the PM and amyloplasts. On the other hand, D6PK relies on GNOM, via vesicle trafficking sensitive to BFA, suggesting that D6PK follows a different relocalization route than NGR1 which is BFA-insensitive. Based on these observations, D6PK relocalization requires the LAZY proteins, but D6PK and NGR1 relocalize through independent routes. How can this be interpreted or reconciled?</p>
<p>Two other works (now published) provide valuable and fundamental findings related to the mechanism examined in the current manuscript and display complementary and similar results to the ones shown in the current manuscript. Given the similarities in the examined mechanisms, these preprints should be referenced, recognized, and discussed in the manuscript under review. It is assumed that the three projects were independently developed, but the results of these previous works should be addressed and taken into account at least during the discussion and when drawing any conclusions. This does not mean that this work is less relevant. On the contrary, some of the observations that seem to be redundant are more solid, and firm conclusions can now be drawn from them.</p>

<p>Summary: This manuscript addresses what rapid molecular events underly the earliest responses after gravity-sensing via the sedimentation of starch-enriched amyloplasts in columella cells of the plant root cap. The LAZY or NEGATIVE GRAVITROPIC RESPONSE OF ROOTS (NGR) protein family is involved in this process and localizes to both the amyloplast and to the plasma membrane (PM) of columella cells.</p>
<p>The current manuscript complements and extends Nishimura et al., Science, 2023. Kulich and colleagues describe the role of the LZY2 protein, also called NGR1, during this process, imaging its fast relocation and addressing additional novel points such as molecular mechanisms underlying NGR1 plasma membrane association as well as revealing the requirement of NGR1/LZY2, 3,4 for the polar localization of the AGCVIII D6 protein kinase at the PM of columella cells, in which NGR1/LZY2 acts redundantly with LZY3 and LZY4.</p>
<p>The authors initially monitored relocalization of functional NGR1-GFP in columella cells of the ngr1 ngr2 ngr3 triple mutant after 180-degree reorientation of the roots. Within 10 -15 min NGR1-GFP signal disappeared from the upper PM after reorientation and reappeared at the lower PM of the reoriented cells in close proximity to the sedimented amyloplasts. Reorientation of NGR1-GFP occurred substantially faster than PIN3-GFP reorientation, at about the same time or slightly later than a rise in a calcium sensor (GCaMP3) just preceding a change in D2-Venus auxin sensor alterations. Reorientation of NGR1-GFP proved to be fast and not dependent on a brefeldin A-sensitive ARF GEF-mediated vesicle trafficking, unlike the trafficking of PIN proteins, like PIN3, or the AGCVIII D6 protein kinase. Strikingly, the PM association of NGR1-GFP was highly sensitive to pharmacological interference with sterol composition or concentration and phosphatidylinositol (4)kinase inhibition as well as dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment interfering with thioester bond formation e.g. during S-acylation. Indeed, combined mutation of a palmitoylation site and polybasic regions of NRG1 abolished its PM but not its amyloplast localization and rendered the protein non-functional during the gravitropic response, suggesting NRG1 PM localization is essential for the gravitropic response. Targeting the protein to the PM via an artificially introduced N-terminal myristoylation and an ROP2-derived polybasic region and geranylgeranylation site partially restored its functionality in the gravitropic response.</p>
<p>Strengths: This timely work should be of broad interest to plant, cell and developmental biologists across the field as gravity sensing and signaling may well be of general interest. The point that NGR1 is rapidly responsive to gravistimulation, polarizes at the PM in the vicinity to amyloplast and that this is required for repolarization of D6 protein kinase, prior to PIN relocation is really compelling. The manuscript is generally well-written and accessible to a general readership. The figures are clear and of high quality, and the methods are sufficiently explained for reproduction of the experiments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Statistical analysis has been performed for some figures but is lacking for most of the quantitative analyses in the figure legends.</p>
<p>The title claims a bit more than what is actually shown in the manuscript: While auxin response reporter alterations are monitored, &quot;rapid redirection of auxin fluxes&quot; are not really directly addressed and, while D6PK can activate PIN proteins in other contexts, it is not explicitly shown in the manuscript that PIN3 is a target in the context of columella cells in vivo. A title such as &quot;Rapid redirection of D6 protein kinase during Arabidopsis root gravitropism relies on plasma membrane translocation of NGR proteins&quot; would reflect the results better.</p>
<p>Fig. 4: The point that D6PK is transcytosed cannot be made here based on the data of these authors. They should have used a photoswitchable version of NGR1 to show that the same molecules observed at the upper PM are translocated to the lower PM. Nishimura and colleagues actually did that for NGR4. However, this is a lot of work and maybe for NGR1 that fusion would have too low fluorescence intensity (as it was the case for NGR3). So, I think a rewording would be sufficient such as NGR-dependent reorientation of D6PK plasma membrane localization&quot; as this does not say, from where it comes to the lower PM. Theoretically, the signal could also be amyloplast-derived or newly synthesized (or just folded) NGR1-GFP.</p>
<p>The authors make a model in which D6PK AGCVIII kinase-dependent on NGRs activates PIN3 to drive auxin fluxes. However, alterations in auxin responses are observed prior to PIN3 reorientation. They should explain this discrepancy better and clearly describe that this is a working hypothesis for the future rather than explicitly proven, yet.</p>

<p>The mechanism controlling plant gravity sensing has fascinated researchers for centuries. It has been clear for at least the past decade that starch-filled plastids (termed statoliths) in specialised gravity-sensing columella cells sense changes in root orientation, triggering an asymmetric auxin gradient that alters root growth direction. Nevertheless, exactly how statolith movement triggers PIN auxin efflux carrier activation and auxin gradient formation has remained unclear until very recently. A series of new papers (in Science and Cell) and this manuscript report how LAZY proteins (also referred to as NEGATIVE GRAVITROPIC 50 RESPONSE OF ROOTS; NGR) play a pivotal role in regulating root gravitropism. In terms of their overall significance, their collective findings provide seminal insights into the very earliest steps for how plant roots sense gravity which are arguably the most important papers about root gravitropism in the past decade.</p>
<p>In the current manuscript, Kulich et al initially report (through creating a functional NGR1-GFP reporter) that &quot;NGR1-GFP displayed a highly specific columella expression, which was most prominent at the PM and the statolith periphery.&quot; Is NGR1-GFP expressed in shoot tissues? If yes, is it in starch sheath (the gravity-sensing equivalent of root columella cells)? The authors also note &quot;NGR1-GFP signal from the PM was not evenly distributed, but rather polarized to the lower side of the columella cells in the vicinity of the sedimented statoliths (Fig. 1A).&quot; and (when overexpressing NGR-GFP) &quot;chloroplasts in the vicinity of the PM strongly correlated with NGR1 accumulating at the PM nearby, similar to the scenario in columella&quot; suggesting that NGR1 does not require additional tissue-specific factors (i.e. trafficking proteins or lipids) to assist in its intracellular movement from plastid to PM.</p>
<p>Next, the authors study the spatiotemporal dynamics of NGR1-GFP re-localisation with other early gravitropic signals and/or components Calcium, auxin, and PIN3. The temporal data presented in Figure 1 illustrates how the GCaMP calcium reporter (in panel E) revealed &quot;the first signaling event in the root gravitropic bending is the statolith removal from the top membrane, rather than its arrival at the bottom&quot; It appeared that the auxin DII-VENUS reporter was also changing rapidly (panel G) - was this detectable BEFORE statolith re-sedimentation?</p>
<p>
Please can the authors explain their NPA result in Fig 1E? Why would treatment with the auxin transport inhibitor NPA block Ca signalling (unless the latter was dependent on the former)?</p>
<p>
They go on to note &quot;This initial auxin asymmetry is mediated by PIN-dependent auxin transport, despite visible polarization of PIN3 can be detected only later&quot; which suggests that PIN activity was being modified prior to PIN polarisation.</p>
<p>In contrast to other proteins involved in gravity response like RLDs and PINs, NGR1 localization and gravity-induced polarization does not undergo BFA-sensitive endocytic recycling by ARF-GEF GNOM. This makes sense given NGR1 is initially targeted to plastids, THEN the PM. Does NGR1 contain a cleavable plastid targeting signal? The authors go on to elegantly demonstrate that NGR1 PM targeting relies on palmitoylation through imaging and mutagenesis-based transgenic ngr rescue assays.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors demonstrate that gravitropic-induced auxin gradient formation is initially dependent on PIN3 auxin efflux activation (prior to PIN3 re-localisation). This early PIN3 activation process is dependent on NGR1 re-targeting D6PK (a PIN3 activating kinase). This elegant molecular mechanism integrates all the regulatory components described in the paper into a comprehensive root gravity sensing model.</p>
