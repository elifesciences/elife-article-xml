<abstract>
<p>Motility endows microorganisms with the ability to swim to nutrient-rich environments, but many species are sessile. Existing hydrodynamic arguments in support of either strategy, to swim or to attach and generate feeding currents, are often built on a limited set of experimental or modeling assumptions. Here, to assess the hydrodynamics of these “swim” or “stay” strategies, we propose a comprehensive methodology that combines mechanistic modeling with a survey of published shape and flow data in ciliates. Model predictions and empirical observations show small variations in feeding rates in favor of either motile or sessile cells. Case-specific variations notwithstanding, our overarching analysis shows that flow physics imposes no constraint on the feeding rates that are achievable by the swimming versus sessile strategies – they can both be equally competitive in transporting nutrients and wastes to and from the cell surface within flow regimes typically experienced by ciliates. Our findings help resolve a longstanding dilemma of which strategy is hydrodynamically optimal and explain patterns occurring in natural communities that alternate between free swimming and temporary attachments. Importantly, our findings indicate that the evolutionary pressures that shaped these strategies acted in concert with, not against, flow physics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The dense and soluble nature of water allows nutrients necessary for survival to surround small organisms living in both fresh and marine ecosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. However, the acquisition of these nutrients, either dissolved or particulate, is often challenging because they are frequently dilute or located within sparsely distributed patches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Small, single-celled protists near the base of aquatic food chains have faced an evolutionary choice: either swim and use flows generated by swimming to encounter prey, or attach to a substrate and generate feeding currents from which to extract passing particles. Both “swim” or “stay” solutions occur among species in natural communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] and a number of species actively alternate between swimming and attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> presents a focused survey of these strategies within a pivotal clade of microorganisms, the Ciliophora.</p>

<p>The “swim” or “stay” strategies shape material transport through this essential link in aquatic trophic systems, thus affecting not only the fitness of these microorganisms, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] but also impacting global biogeochemical cycles and the food web chain [12– 15]. Therefore, understanding the flow physics underlying the exchange of nutrients and wastes at this scale is important across disparate fields of the life sciences, from evolutionary biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] to ecosystem ecology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>It has been generally appreciated that microorganisms, swimming or tethered, manipulate the fluid environment to maintain a sufficient turnover rate of nutrients and metabolites, unattainable by diffusive transport alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. However, to date, and with ample experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] and computational [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] studies, flow analysis has yielded contradictory results favoring either of the “swim” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] or “stay” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] alternatives as optimal nutritional strategies.</p>
<p>If consideration of flow physics clearly favors one of the “swim” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] or “stay” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] alternatives, then the existence of both indicates that the evolutionary pressures that led to the abundance of the other strategy had to act against flow physics and the propensity to optimize material transport to and from the cell surface. It would also imply that both solutions cannot occupy the same ecological niche without one of them being seriously disadvantaged. An alternative possibility is that flow physics supports both solutions equally and that the choice of strategy does not compromise material transport to and from the cell surface.</p>
<p>But how can we distinguish between these two possibilities? Establishing such a distinction is challenging because any attempt at quantifying flows around a specific microorganism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] inherently accounts for all evolutionary variables that shaped that microorganism and thus fails to provide a general and unbiased mechanistic understanding of the role of flow physics. Mathematical models allow objective comparison of the feeding rates achievable in the attached versus swimming states, while keeping all other variables the same. Surprisingly, besides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], there is a paucity of mathematical studies that directly address this question. Importantly, results based on any single model naturally depend on the modeling assumptions; thus, any attempt at drawing general conclusions from considering a single organism or mathematical model should be carefully scrutinized.</p>
<p>In this study, we propose a systematic approach to address existing limitations in evaluating the hydrodynamics of the “swim” or “stay” alternatives. Our approach combines a survey of existing experimental observations within the entire Ciliophora clade (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) with mathematical models that span the morphology and flow conditions within which all surveyed ciliates fall (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). We additionally include a comparison with diatoms to distinguish the effects of relative body motion independent of cilia-driven feed-ing currents. We find based on both empirical observations and mathematical models, that encounter rates of the swim and stay strategies converge under realistic conditions and are essentially equivalent within flow regimes typically experienced by ciliates.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Our results are organized around three main themes: (A) comparative analysis of morphologies, size, and fluid flows in sessile and swimming ciliates and sinking diatoms, (B) evaluation of nutrient uptake in mathematical models of sessile and motile feeders spanning the Stokeslet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] and envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] models and covering the entire range within which all surveyed ciliates fall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], (C) analysis of biological data in light of model prediction and of asymptotic analysis in the two extremes of diffusion and advection dominant limits.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Comparative morphometric, phylogenetic and flow data in ciliates and diatoms</title>
<p>We conducted a survey on the morphology, flows, and phylogenetic lineage of ciliates and diatoms, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Sessile ciliates, such as the <italic>Stentor</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], <italic>Opercularia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], <italic>and Vorticella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], are characterized by a ciliary crown, where the motion of beating cilia entrains fluid toward the cell. The cell body and ciliary crown are positioned away from the surface they live upon, usually with a stalk, to minimize the effect of that surface on slowing down the cilia-driven microcurrents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Further, to avoid generating recirculating microcurrents and reduce reprocessing of depleted water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], sessile ciliates actively regulate their orientation to feed at an angle relative to the substratum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. At optimal inclination, the effective cilia-generated force is nearly parallel to the bounding substrate and creates quasi-unidirectional flows that drive nutrients and particles past the cell feeding apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. In motile ciliates, such as the <italic>Paramecium</italic> and <italic>Volvox</italic>, the surface of the organism is often entirely covered with cilia that beat in a coordinated manner and power the organism to swim through the surrounding fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Diatoms lack motility apparatus and sink by regulating their buoyancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Empirical flow measurements around sessile [21, 40, 44, 48, 56, 57] and motile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] ciliates are sparse. Here, we collected morphometric and flow data from published work covering ten species of sessile ciliates [30, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44], ten species of swimming ciliates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], and seven species of diatoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. A summary of the ranges of sizes and characteristic speeds are reported in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Fig. S1; detailed measurements are listed in a supplemental data file. Size is represented by the volume-equivalent spherical radius <italic>a</italic> (Fig. S2). The characteristic speeds <italic>U</italic> for sessile ciliates are based on the maximal flow speeds measured near the ciliary crown. For swimming ciliates and sinking diatoms, we collected measured swimming and sinking speeds, which, given the no-slip boundary condition in this viscous regime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], also represent flow speeds near the surface of these microorganisms.</p>

<p>Phylogenetically, all surveyed microorganisms, except the <italic>Volvox</italic>, belong to the SAR supergroup, encompassing the Stramenopiles, Alveolates, and Rhizaria clades (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The Rhizaria clade is not represented in our survey because it mostly consists of ameboids, while its flagellates have complex and functionally-ambiguous morphologies that do not fit in the present analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. <italic>Volvox</italic>, the only multicellular microorganism listed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, is an algae that belongs to the Viridiplantae clade. Diatoms evolved from the same SAR supergroup as the majority of unicellular ciliates, but without the ciliary motility apparatus, and while early ciliates date back to about 700 million years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], diatoms appeared later, about 200 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Diatoms generally exist in a suspended state and sink under low nutrient conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Of the twelve ciliates listed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, many transition during their lifecycle between sessile and free swimming states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. <italic>Stentors</italic> become rounder when swimming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>].</p>
<p>The microcurrents generated by these ciliates improve solute transport to and from the surface of the microorganism. For a characteristic microcurrent of speed <italic>U</italic> = 100 <italic>µ</italic>m · s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>, small molecules and particles would be transported over a characteristic distance <italic>a</italic> = 100 <italic>µ</italic>m in approximately <italic>a/U</italic> = 1 s. In contrast, the same substance transported by diffusion alone takes a considerably longer time to traverse the same distance. For example, diffusive transport of oxygen and small molecules, with diffusivities that are in the order of <italic>D</italic> = 10<sup><italic>−</italic>9</sup> m<sup>2</sup> · s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>, takes about <italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>/D</italic> = 10 s, while live and dead bacterial particles with respective diffusivity <italic>D</italic> = 4 × 10<sup><italic>−</italic>10</sup> m<sup>2</sup> · s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> and <italic>D</italic> = 2×10<sup><italic>−</italic>13</sup> m<sup>2</sup> ·s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>] take about <italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>/D</italic> = 25 s and 10000 s, respectively. The ratio of diffusive <italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>/D</italic> to advective <italic>a/U</italic> timescales defines the Péclet number, Pe = <italic>aU/D</italic>. For Pe ≪ 1, mass transport is controlled by molecular diffusion. For the microorganisms that we surveyed, we obtain Pe ranging from nearly 0 to as large as 10<sup>3</sup> −10<sup>5</sup> depending on the nutrient diffusivity (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This dimensional analysis suggests that the flows generated by the microorganisms substantially enhance the transport of solutes to and from their surface, and while it clearly shows that diatoms typically occupy a smaller range of Pe numbers, this analysis does not reveal a clear distinction between sessile and swimming ciliates. To further explore such distinction, if present, and to assess whether ciliates are disadvantaged by flow physics in their attached state compared to their swimming state as suggested in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], we developed mathematical models that allow for an unbiased comparison between these two states.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Mathematical modeling of fluid flows and nutrient uptake</title>
<p>To quantify and compare nutrient uptake across microorganisms, we approximated the cell body by a sphere of radius <italic>a</italic>, as typically done in modeling sessile and swimming ciliates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] and sinking diatoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The fluid velocity <bold>u</bold> around the sphere is governed by the incompressible Stokes equations, −∇<italic>p</italic> + <italic>η</italic>∇<sup>2</sup><bold>u</bold> = 0 and ∇ · <bold>u</bold> = 0, where <italic>p</italic> is the pressure field and <italic>η</italic> is viscosity. We solved these equations in spherical coordinates (<italic>r, θ, ϕ</italic>), considering axisymmetry in <italic>ϕ</italic> and proper boundary conditions. In the motile case, we solved for the fluid velocity field <bold>u</bold> in body frame by superimposing a uniform flow of speed <italic>U</italic> equal to the swimming speed past the sphere; we calculated the value of <italic>U</italic> from force balance considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>] (see SI for details).</p>
<p>We solved the Stokes equations for two models of cilia activity: cilia represented as a Stokeslet force <italic>F</italic><sub>cilia</sub> placed at a distance <italic>L</italic> and pointing towards the center of the sphere and no-slip velocity at the spherical surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), and densely-packed cilia defining an envelope model with a slip velocity <bold>u</bold>|<sub><italic>r</italic>=<italic>a</italic></sub> = 𝒰 sin <italic>θ</italic> at the spherical surface where all cilia exert tangential forces pointing from one end of the sphere to the opposite end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). In dimensionless form, we set the cell’s length scale <italic>a</italic> = 1 and tangential velocity scale 𝒰 = 1 in the envelope model, and we set the ciliary force <italic>F</italic><sub>cilia</sub> in the Stokeslet model to produce the same swimming speed (<italic>U</italic> = 2<italic>/</italic>3) as in the envelope model when the sphere is motile.</p>
<p>To evaluate the steady-state concentration of dissolved nutrients around the cell surface, we numerically solved the dimensionless advection-diffusion equation Pe <bold>u</bold> · ∇<italic>C</italic> = Δ<italic>C</italic> in the context of the Stokeslet and envelope models. Here, the advective and diffusive rates of change of the nutrient concentration field <italic>C</italic>, normalized by its farfield value <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>∞</italic></sub>, are given by Pe <bold>u</bold> · ∇<italic>C</italic> and Δ<italic>C</italic>, respectively, with ∇<italic>C</italic> the concentration gradient. At the surface of the sphere, the concentration is set to zero to reflect that nutrient absorption at the surface of the microorganism greatly exceeds transport rates of molecular diffusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>].</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C,D</xref>, flow streamlines (white) and concentration fields (colormap at Pe = 100) are shown in the Stokeslet and envelope models. In the sessile sphere, ciliary flows drive fresh nutrient concentration from the far-field towards the ciliated surface. These fresh nutrients thin the concentration boundary layer at the leading surface of the sphere, where typically the cytostome or feeding apparatus is found in sessile ciliates, with a trailing plume or “tail” of nutrient depletion. Similar concentration fields are obtained in the swimming case, albeit with narrower trailing plume.</p>
<p>To assess the effects of these cilia-generated flows on the transport of nutrients to the cell surface, we used two common metrics of feeding. The fluid flux or clearance rate <italic>Q</italic> through an encounter zone near the organism’s oral surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] and the concentration flux of dissolved nutrients at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Namely, following [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], we defined the clearance rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="593824v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, normalized by the advective flux <italic>πR</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>U</italic>, over an annular encounter zone of radius <italic>R</italic> extending radially away from the cell surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). For dissolved nutrients, we integrated the inward concentration flux<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="593824v1_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, normalized by the diffusive nutrient uptake <italic>I</italic><sub>diffusion</sub> = 4<italic>πRDC</italic><sub><italic>∞</italic></sub> to get the Sherwood number Sh = <italic>I/I</italic><sub>diffusion</sub>.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, we report the clearance rate <italic>Q</italic> in the context of the Stokeslet model as a function of the ciliary force location <italic>L/a</italic> for a small annular encounter zone of radius <italic>R</italic> = 1.1<italic>a</italic> extending away from the cell surface. Swimming is always more beneficial. However, the increase in clearance rate due to swimming is less than 10%. This is in contrast to the several fold advantage obtained in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] for <italic>L</italic> = 4<italic>a</italic> and <italic>R</italic> = 10<italic>a</italic>. (results of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] are reproduced in Fig. S3). We employed the same metric <italic>Q</italic> in the envelope model and found that motility is also more advantageous, albeit at less than 5% benefit (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>).</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">G</xref>, we report the Sh number based on the Stokelet and envelope models, respectively. In the Stokeslet model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), sessile spheres do better when the cilia force is close to the cell surface (<italic>L</italic> − <italic>a</italic>)<italic>/a</italic> ⪅ 1.25. In the envelope model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), motile spheres do slightly better for all Pe⪅ 100. The difference ΔSh between the sessile and motile spheres favors, by less than 20%, the sessile strategy in the Stokeslet model and the swimming strategy in the envelope model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparing Sh between the Stokeslet and envelope models (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), we found that, at Pe = 100, Sh = 2.7 (sessile) and 2.6 (motile) in the Stokeslet model compared to Sh = 6.7 (sessile) and 6.9 (motile) in the envelope model. This is over two-fold enhancement in nutrient uptake at the same swimming speed <italic>U</italic> = 2<italic>/</italic>3 simply by distributing the ciliary force over the entire surface of the cell! Indeed, this improvement occurs because the ciliary motion in the envelope model significantly thins the concentration boundary layer along the entire cell surface as opposed to only near where the cilia force is concentrated in the Stokeslet model.</p>
<p>In our survey of sessile and motile ciliates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), cilia are clearly distributed over the cell surface. Thus, we next explored in the context of the envelope model the behavior of the Sh number across a range of Pe values that reflect empirical values experienced by the surveyed ciliates (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

In <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, we superimposed our asymptotic results, together with the asymptotic results of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>], onto our numerical findings. At small Pe ≪ 1, the Sh numbers for swimming and sinking spheres scale similarly with Pe (Sh ∼ Pe), whereas Sh scales worse (Sh ∼ Pe<sup>2</sup>) for the sessile sphere. Our thorough literature survey indicates, save one, no data points for sessile microorganisms in this limit. At large Pe ≫ 1, the Sh numbers of the sessile and swimming spheres scale similiary with Pe<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="593824v1_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, whereas the sinking sphere scales worse<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="593824v1_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. These results confirm that, hydrodynamically, sessile and swimming ciliates are equivalent in the limit of large Pe: when cilia generate strong feeding currents that drive nutrients and particulates towards the cell body, attached microorganisms can be equally competitive with motile microorganisms that swim to feed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We contributed a comprehensive methodology for evaluating the role of flow physics and comparing feeding rates in motile and sessile ciliates. Our approach combined a survey of previously-published empirical measurements of ciliates’ shape and velocity with two mechanistic models of cilia-driven flows (concentrated point force and distributed force density) and two metrics of nutrient uptakes (clearance rate and Sherwood number) in attached and swimming ciliates. The concentrated versus distributed ciliary force models form two extreme limits within which all surveyed ciliates fall. Clear-ance rate measures advective material transport through an encounter zone, which is independent of Pe; Sh number accounts for both diffusive and advective transport and varies with Pe.</p>
<p>The difference in feeding rates between the sessile and motile strategies depended on the choice of model, model parameters, and feeding metric (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of the concentrated force model and considering clearance rate as a metric for feeding, we found that it is better to swim than to attach, but these advantages are modest (less than 20%) under justifiable conditions of ciliary force placement and encounter zone close to the cell surface. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], several fold improvement were reported for swimming using the same model and feeding metric but questionable parameter values: clearance rates were computed through an encounter zone that extended up to ten body lengths away from the cell surface without accounting for the effect that such an extensive collection surface would have on drag generation during swimming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. We showed that for a small encounter zone that justifies omission of these drag forces, the improvement in clearance rate during swimming is much smaller than predicted in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Surprisingly, using the same concentrated force model, we found that attachment improves nutrient uptake when considering concentration of dissolved nutrients at Pe = 100 and measuring the Sherwood number associated with nutrient uptake over the entire cell surface. Again, the improvement is modest (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Taken together, these results show that in the same model, two different feeding metrics favor different strategies, albeit at a slim advantage of less than 20% in favor of either swimming or attachment.</p>
<p>When distributing the ciliary force over the entire cell surface, we found, using either metric, that swimming is more beneficial by a very small margin for Pe ≤ 100 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the difference in Sh number between swimming and attached cells decreases at larger Pe values (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), and in the asymptotic limit of Pe≫ 1, Sh scales similarly with Pe (Sh ∝ Pe<sup>1<italic>/</italic>2</sup>) for both swimming and sessile cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). That is, at large Pe, material transport to and from the cell surface is not compromised by the choice of strategy.</p>
<p>From our survey of previously-published empirical measurements of ciliates’ shape and velocity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we extracted biologically-relevant ranges of Pe values (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and combined these empirical observations with model predictions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We found significant overlap in Sh number between sessile and motile organisms at a wide range of representative Pe values. These findings clearly show that both attachment and free swimming can lead to similar nutrient acquisition within a wide range of flows and Péclet values typically experienced by ciliates.</p>
<p>This study provides a fresh perspective on evaluating the role of flow physics in the feeding strategies of microorganisms. Prior methods in support of either the motile or sessile strategies as optimal drew general conclusions from focused analyses. Support for swimming came principally from flow-based models of idealized organisms propelling themselves through water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Support for maximum feeding by attached protists came from empirical measurements of prey removal by swimming versus attached individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Our approach shows that, while feeding rates may vary between organisms and mathematical models, given a cellular (ciliary) machinery that allows microorganisms to manipulate the surrounding fluid and generate flows, flow physics itself imposes no constraint on what is achievable by the swimming versus sessile strategies – they can both be equally competitive in transporting nutrients and wastes to and from the cell surface in the large Pe limit where nutrient advection is dominant. Our findings suggest that the choice of feeding strategy was likely influ-enced by evolutionary, ecological or behavioral variables other than flow physics, such as metabolic or sensory requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>], predator avoidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>], symbiotic relations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], and nutrient availability or environmental turbulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>].</p>
<p>Along with assessing feeding rates in motile versus sessile strategies, our analysis revealed interesting “design” principles for maximizing nutrient uptake by distributing ciliary activity over the entire cell surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This design thins the nutrientdepletion boundary layer at the surface of the cell where absorption occurs: for the same overall swimming speed, distributing ciliary activity over the cell surface improves nutrient uptake by over two fold compared to when the ciliary force is concentrated at one location (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Indeed, cilia are often distributed over a portion or entire cell surface in sessile and motile ciliates, with some variability in cilia distribution and cell surface fraction where prey is intercepted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To account for such variability, we computed the flow and concentration fields under various perturbations to cilia coverage and surface fraction where absorption takes place (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). For each perturbation, we calculated the Sh number in the form of a percentage of that corresponding to full cilia coverage and absorption over the entire surface. We found small differences in Sh numbers between the sessile and motile spheres. Our findings – that the motile and sessile strategies are equivalent in terms of material transport to the cell surface– are thus robust to cilia perturbations. Additionally, we found that, for a given cilia coverage, nutrient uptake is maximized when the absorption surface coincides with the cilia coverage area. This design – cilia collocated with the cell feeding apparatus – is abundant in sessile protists (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Our findings open new venues for investigating the functional advantages of optimal cilia designs (cilia number and distribution) that maximize not only locomotion performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] but also feeding rates and for evaluating the interplay between cell design and feeding strategies (sessile versus motile). These future directions will enrich our understanding of the complexity of feeding strategies in ciliates and how strategy and design have evolved to provide behavioral advantages to these microbes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript studies nutrient intake rates for stationary and motile microorganisms to assess the effectiveness of swim vs. stay strategies. This work provides valuable insights on how the different strategies perform in the context of a simplified mathematical model that couples hydrodynamics to nutrient advection and diffusion. The swim and stay strategies are shown to yield similar nutrient flux under a range of conditions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Strengths of the work include (i) the model prediction in Fig. 3 of nutrient flux applied to a range of microorganisms including an entire clade that are known to use different feeding strategies and (ii) a study of the interaction between cilia and absorption coverage showing the robustness of their predictions provided these regions have sufficient overlap.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: To improve the work, the authors should further expand their discussion of the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The authors comment that a number of species alternate between sessile and motile behavior. It would be helpful to discuss what is known about what causes switching between these modes and whether this provides insights regarding the advantages of the different behaviors.</p>
<p>(2) An encounter zone of R=1.1a appears be used throughout the manuscript, but I could not find a biological justification for this particular value. This results appear to be quite sensitive to this choice, as shown in Supplement Fig. 3(B). In the Discussion, it is mentioned that using a much larger exclusion zone leads to significantly different nutrient flux, and it is implied that such a large exclusion zone is not biologically plausible, but this was not explained sufficiently.</p>
<p>(3) In schematic of the in Fig. 2(B) it was unclear if the encounter zone in the envelope model is defined analogously to the Stokeslet model or if a different formulation is used.</p>
<p>(4) The force balance argument should be clarified. Equation (3) of the supplement gives the force-velocity relation in the motile case. Since equation (4), which the authors state is the net force in the sessile case, seems to involve the same expression, would it not follow from U=0 in the sessile case that one would simply obtain quiescent flow with Fcilia=0?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have collected a significant amount of data from the literature on the flow regimes associated with microorganisms whose propulsion is achieved through the action of cilia or flagella, with particular interest in the competition between sessile and motile lifestyles. They then use several distinct hydrodynamic models for the cilia-driven flows to quantify the nutrient uptake and clearance rate, reported as a function of the Peclet number. Among the interesting conclusions the authors draw concerns the question of whether, for certain ciliates, there is a clear difference in nutrient uptake rates in the sessile versus motile forms. The authors show that this is not the case, thereby suggesting that the evolutionary pressure associated with such a difference is not present. The analysis also includes numerical calculations of the uptake rate for spherical swimmers in the regime of large Peclet numbers, where the authors note an enhancement due to advection-generated thinning of the solutal boundary layer around the organism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In addressing the whole range of organism sizes and Peclet numbers the authors have achieved an important broad perspective on the problem of nutrient uptake of ciliates, with implications for understanding evolutionary driving forces toward particular lifestyles (e.g. sessile versus motile).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors appear to be unaware of rather similar calculations that were done some years ago in the context of Volvox, in which the issue of the boundary layer size and nutrient uptake enhancement were clearly recognized [M.B. Short, et al., Flows Driven by Flagella of Multicellular Organisms Enhance Long-Range Molecular Transport, PNAS 103, 8315-8319 (2006)]. This reference also introduced the model of a fixed shear stress at the surface of the sphere as a representation of the action of the cilia, which may be more realistic than the squirmer-type boundary condition, although the two lead to similar large-Pe scalings.</p>
<p>The findings reported in Figure 4, that the uptake rate is robust to variations in cilia coverage and absorption fraction, are similar in spirit to an observation made recently in the context of the somatic cell neighbourhood areas in Vovox [Day, et al., eLife 11, e72707 (2022)]. There, it was found that while there is a broad distribution of those areas, and hence of the coarse-grained tangential flagellar force acting on the fluid, the propulsion speed is rather insensitive to those variations.</p>
