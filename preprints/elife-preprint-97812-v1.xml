<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Fertilization occurs before completion of oocyte meiosis in the majority of animal species and sperm contents move long distances within zygotes of mouse and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. If incorporated into the meiotic spindle, paternal chromosomes could be expelled into a polar body resulting in lethal monosomy. Through live imaging of fertilization in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we found that the microtubule disassembling enzymes, katanin and kinesin-13 limit long range movement of sperm contents and that maternal ataxin-2 maintains paternal DNA and paternal mitochondria as a cohesive unit that moves together. Depletion of katanin or double depletion of kinesin-13 and ataxin-2 resulted in capture of the sperm contents by the meiotic spindle. Thus limiting movement of sperm contents and maintaining cohesion of sperm contents within the zygote both contribute to preventing premature interaction between maternal and paternal genomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reproduction by most animal species requires expulsion of chromosomes into polar bodies during oocyte meiosis to reduce chromosome number and fertilization by sperm to restore a diploid chromosome number. Because fertilization occurs during oocyte meiosis in most animal species, there is an inherent risk of sperm DNA being incorporated into the meiotic spindle and being expelled into a polar body. In some species, the first line of defense against this hypothetical calamity is ensuring that sperm does not fuse with the oocyte plasma membrane directly over the meiotic spindle. A Ran-GTP gradient emanating from the mouse metaphase II meiotic spindle excludes the fusion proteins Juno and CD9 from the oocyte plasma membrane over the spindle. When this mechanism was bypassed by injecting demembranated sperm adjacent to the spindle, the sperm DNA was ejected into a polar body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the nucleus is positioned away from the site of future fertilization so that the meiosis I spindle assembles at the opposite end of the ellipsoid zygote from the site of fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>However, simply controlling the site of fertilization is not sufficient to maintain a distance between the meiotic spindle and the sperm DNA because cytoplasmic streaming can move the sperm DNA long distances in both mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Meiotic cytoplasmic streaming in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos requires microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), and reticulons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), but both mechanism and purpose are not completely understood. In addition to meiotic spindle microtubules, <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiotic embryos have cytoplasmic microtubules around the cortex and throughout the cytoplasm of the entire embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). These microtubules are thought to drive meiotic cytoplasmic streaming because depletion tubulin stops cytoplasmic streaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) and depletion of the microtubule-severing protein katanin by RNAi results in an increased mass of cortical microtubules and an increase in cytoplasmic streaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to paternal DNA, <italic>C. elegans</italic> sperm introduce centrioles, SPE-11 protein, membranous organelles (MOs) and paternal mitochondria into the zygote. Paternal centrioles are silenced during meiosis by maternal KCA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), which is also required to pack yolk granules inward from the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) and the meiotic spindle outward toward the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). SPE-11 is an RNA-binding protein in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) that is required paternally for polar body extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) and proper embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). MOs are membrane vesicles in sperm that fuse with the sperm plasma membrane before fertilization during sperm activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). However, a subset of MOs that do not fuse with the sperm plasma membrane are introduced to the zygote at fertilization and are ubiquitinated with maternal ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Paternal mitochondria are labelled with maternal autophagy machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Whereas both MOs and paternal mitochondria are eventually destroyed during embryogenesis, during meiosis they remain in a tight cloud around the sperm DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). The mechanisms holding the sperm contents together in the zygote during cytoplasmic streaming have not been explored.</p>
<p>In this study we monitored the cloud of paternal mitochondria after increasing cytoplasmic streaming or disrupting the integrity of the cloud of paternal organelles. Our results suggest that both limiting cytoplasmic streaming and maintaining the integrity of the paternal organelle cloud contribute to preventing capture of the sperm contents by the meiotic spindle.</p>

<title>Sperm derived DNA and mitochondria are maintained in a volume that excludes maternal mitochondria and yolk granules but allows penetration by maternal ER during meiosis</title>
<p>Time-lapse in utero imaging of the meiotic spindle and an endoplasmic reticulum marker (ER) revealed that the ER is distributed throughout the zygote but appears as undulating lines during metaphase I (n=8), changes to a dispersed appearance during anaphase I (n=9), transitions back to undulating lines interspersed with large blobs during metaphase II (n=6), then changes to a dispersed pattern during anaphase II (n=5)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; Video S1). Previous electron microscopy studies have indicated that the undulating lines correspond to sheet-like ER and the dispersed appearance corresponds to tubular ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>); Gong et al., 2024). In striking contrast with the ER filling the entire zygote, yolk granules are packed inward, away from the cortex (n = 9 metaphase I; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). When Mitotracker-treated males were mated to hermaphrodites expressing GFP-labeled yolk granules, the paternal mitochondria were found in a discrete cloud around the paternal DNA (n = 34; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Both the cloud of paternal mitochondria (n=19) and the meiotic spindle (n= 9 metaphase I) were observed in cortical regions that are free of yolk granules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Maternal mitochondria labeled with COX-4::GFP were also packed inward, away from the cortex, and were excluded from the cloud of paternal mitochondria and excluded from the spindle (n = 5 metaphase I; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). In contrast with maternal yolk granules and maternal mitochondria, maternal ER was observed penetrating into the cloud of paternal mitochondria and enveloping the paternal DNA in a shell that appeared as a ring in confocal sections both live (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, arrow at 9:20) and fixed (n = 10; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Time-lapse imaging (n=21) revealed that the cloud of paternal mitochondria remained together and separate from maternal yolk granules even when moving long distances with cytoplasmic streaming (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>Because yolk granules and maternal mitochondria are packed inward during meiosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, D</xref>) and sperm must enter from the outside, it is possible that the exclusion of maternal yolk granules from the volume of paternal mitochondria might simply be a consequence of inward packing. In <italic>kca-1(RNAi)</italic> meiotic embryos, yolk granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) and mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) do not pack and instead extend to the plasma membrane.

<title>Maternal ER invades the volume of paternal organelles shortly after fertilization</title>
<p>To elucidate how the maternal ER enters the ball of paternal organelles, we monitored 7 instances of sperm egg fusion by time-lapse microscopy. Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>C. elegans</italic> sperm fuse with the egg as opposed to being phagocytosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Mitotracker-labeled males were mated with hermaphrodites with a maternally-expressed ER marker and a maternally-expressed plasma membrane marker (mCherry::PH). 20 seconds after the apparent entry of paternal mitochondria into the egg (0:20 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), a sperm-sized volume devoid of maternal ER was observed within the maternal plasma membrane. One minute after apparent sperm-egg fusion, the maternal ER had moved into the plasma membrane behind the sperm (1:25 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>; 1:00 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The maternal ER ring enveloping the sperm DNA was not discernible until 7 min after apparent sperm-egg fusion (7:24 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), although it might form earlier because the zygote undergoes dramatic movement through two sequential sphincters into the spermatheca then into the uterus during this time. These results suggest that all maternal membranes are initially excluded from the sperm at fusion. The plasma membrane marker diffuses in behind the sperm first, followed by plasma-membrane associated ER, followed by envelopment of the sperm DNA by maternal ER by 7 min after fusion. Maternal yolk granules and maternal mitochondria, however, are excluded from the sperm volume for much longer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<title>The maternal ER envelope around the sperm DNA is permeable to proteins</title>
<p>If the maternal ER envelope around sperm DNA was sealed and impermeable during meiosis, this could both prevent the sperm DNA from inducing ectopic spindle assembly and prevent the sperm DNA from interacting with meiotic spindle microtubules. BAF-1 is a chromatin-binding component of the inner nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). GFP::BAF-1 was not detected on maternal or paternal chromatin during metaphase I or metaphase II but labelled the surface of both maternal and paternal chromatin during anaphase I and anaphase II (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A, B, C</xref>). Because BAF-1 is a chromatin-binding protein, this result indicates that BAF-1 can pass freely through holes in the ER envelope surrounding the sperm DNA.</p>

<title>Movement of sperm contents within the zygote is limited by katanin and kinesin-13 and this limitation prevents capture of the sperm DNA by the meiotic spindle</title>
<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> meiotic cytoplasmic streaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) has the potential to bring the sperm contents into close proximity with the meiotic spindle, however, a previous study found that the male pronucleus very rarely forms at the same end of the embryo as the female pronucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). This indicates that limitations on cytoplasmic streaming might be involved in maintaining distance between the sperm contents and meiotic spindle. We therefore asked whether increasing cytoplasmic streaming would cause collisions between the meiotic spindle and sperm contents. Meiotic cytoplasmic streaming requires microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) and kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Depletion of katanin by <italic>mei-1(RNAi)</italic> increases the mass of cortical microtubules and the extent of yolk granule streaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) and depletion of kinesin-13 by <italic>klp-7(RNAi)</italic> also increases the mass of cortical microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). We found that <italic>mei-1(RNAi)</italic> or <italic>klp-7(RNAi)</italic> increased the maximum displacement of the sperm contents in both the long and short axes of the ellipsoid embryo relative to control L4440(RNAi) embryos (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B, C, D</xref>; Videos S2, S3, S4).</p>

<p>Among 15 control L4440(RNAi) time-lapse sequences, the closest center to center distance between spindle and sperm contents was 18 um. In contrast, among 51 time-lapse sequences of <italic>mei-1(RNAi)</italic> meiotic embryos, the sperm came within 5.5 um center to center distance of the spindle in 12 cases and in 12/12 of these cases, the sperm stopped moving relative to the spindle indicating a capture event (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>; Video S3). Among a subset that could be tracked through pronuclear stage, a single male pronucleus formed adjacent to multiple small female pronuclei. Among 25 time-lapse sequences of <italic>klp-7(RNAi)</italic> embryos, the sperm DNA became stuck against the meiotic spindle (4.6 um center to center distance) in only one case. In all other cases, the sperm streamed past a stationary spindle. However, the closest sperm to spindle distance was 7.7 um in one case. These results indicate that limiting cytoplasmic streaming is important for maintaining a distance between spindle and sperm and thus preventing capture of the sperm by the meiotic spindle. However, <italic>mei-1(RNAi)</italic> spindles are apolar and do not undergo normal polar body extrusion and the single capture event in a <italic>klp-7(RNAi)</italic> embryo resulted in cell cycle arrest. These results therefore do not reveal what would happen to paternal DNA captured by a normal meiotic spindle during polar body extrusion.</p>
<p>An important question is why the sperm contents move more than the meiotic spindle. During metaphase I, when the ER is sheet-like, movement of the sperm contents is limited. When the ER disperses during anaphase I, the spindle rotates and one pole is moved closer to the cortex by cytoplasmic dynein (Video S1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>)). In contrast, the distance of the sperm contents from the cortex (Fig. S1) and movement of the sperm contents both increase when the ER disperses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>; Video S5).</p>

<title>Ataxin-2 is required to maintain cohesion of paternal mitochondria</title>
<p>Because maternal ER penetrates the sperm contents and envelops the sperm DNA, and because the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of ataxin-2, ATX-2, affects ER organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), we analyzed the contribution of ATX-2 to cohesion of the sperm contents in meiotic embryos. We first introduced an auxin-induced degron and GFP tag to the 3’end of th endogenous <italic>atx-2</italic> gene. Endogenously tagged ATX-2 was observed throughout oocytes and meiotic embryos without partial co-localization with ER.

<p>The extent of scattering of paternal mitochondria was analyzed in Z-stacks of fixed meiotic embryos depleted of ATX-2 by each of the 3 methods. This analysis was restricted to embryos from anaphase I through anaphase II because our streaming data and that of Kimura 2020 indicate that the sperm contents have not moved significantly before anaphase I. Example Z-projections are shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. Mitochondria can exist as a tubular network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) and tubules in close proximity cannot always be resolved by light microscopy. To account for the apparent heterogenous sizes of foci of paternal mitochondria, the fluorescence intensity of larger foci was divided by the fluorescence intensity of the smallest foci such that a focus with 3 times the fluorescence intensity was counted as 3 “mitochondria”. ATX-2 depletion by each of the 3 methods resulted in a significantly increased mean distance of paternal mitochondria from the sperm DNA (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>) as well as significantly increased standard deviation of individual distances (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Standard deviation is an important measure because an increase in the number of mitochondria both closer and further from the sperm DNA would result in no change in the mean. It remains possible that paternal mitochondria scatter is caused by pressure applied during fixation, pressure resulting from ovulation through the spermatheca valves, or cytoplasmic streaming. We were not able to unambiguously track scattering by live imaging because significant movement occurs during acquisition of a complete z stack and because the embryos cannot withstand the additional photodamage. These results still support the hypothesis that ATX-2 is required to maintain the integrity or cohesiveness of the ball of paternal mitochondria that surrounds the sperm DNA to resist external forces.</p>

<title>Double depletion of KLP-7 and ATX-2 results in capture of the sperm DNA by the spindle</title>
<p>Because we observed increased cytoplasmic streaming in <italic>klp-7(RNAi)</italic> and disruption of the integrity of the sperm contents after ATX-2 depletion, we hypothesized that double depletion of KLP-7 and ATX-2 would result in an increased frequency of spindle microtubules capturing the sperm DNA. Among 24 time-lapse sequences of <italic>atx-2(AID+auxin) klp-7(RNAi)</italic> meiotic embryos, the ER envelope around the sperm DNA moved extensively in all cases but came within a threshold distance of 5.5 um (center to center) of the meiotic spindle in only 5 cases. In 5/5 of these cases, a bundle of microtubules extended from the meiotic spindle into the ER envelope around the sperm DNA and the sperm DNA became stuck in this position (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9B</xref>). In one case, the ER envelope around the sperm DNA was transiently captured by the meiosis I spindle and stretched in the direction of streaming (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>). The sperm DNA then released, continued streaming and was captured by the meiosis II spindle. All cases of stable capture caused a cell-cycle arrest so that the consequences on polar body extrusion could not be determined.</p>

<p>Because ATX-2 depletion alters ER morphology, we were not able to score cytoplasmic streaming with the cell-cycle accuracy shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. However, the maximum long axis and short axis displacement at any cell-cycle time was increased in <italic>atx-2(AID)</italic> with auxin vs without auxin (Fig. S3). No spindle capture events were observed, however, among 15 ATX-2 single depletion time-lapse sequences and the closest distance between sperm and spindle was 8.2 um with 1 hr auxin and 19.3 um without auxin. These results overall indicate that limiting cytoplasmic streaming and maintaining the integrity of the ball of paternal mitochondria are both important for preventing capture events between the meiotic spindle and sperm DNA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mechanism excluding maternal yolk granules and mitochondria from the volume of sperm cytoplasm introduced to the egg at fertilization is not clear. The simplest explanation is that cytoplasm does not mix during the 45 min from GVBD to pronucleus formation due to the high viscosity of cytoplasm. Attempts at measuring cytoplasmic viscosity of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote have revealed values from 0.67 – 1.0 Pa s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) which are similar to the viscosity of 100% glycerol. Alternatively, the sperm contents might be held together by a cytoskeleton-like matrix as proposed for the Balbiani body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). In either case, an active process appears to allow the maternal ER to penetrate into the paternal cytoplasm to envelope the sperm DNA. The higher frequency of capture of the sperm DNA by the meiotic spindle in ATX-2 KLP-7 double depleted embryos compared with either single depletion suggests that the integrity of the exclusion zone around the sperm DNA may insulate the sperm DNA from spindle microtubules.</p>
<p>ATX-2 is required to maintain the integrity of the ball of paternal mitochondria around the sperm DNA, but the mechanism is unknown. Because the paternal mitochondria observed to scatter are from wild-type males, the effect of ATX-2 depletion must be on the egg and not on the sperm. Although ATX-2 depletion alters ER morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) we still observed a maternal ER envelope around the sperm DNA in all ATX-2-depleted embryos. ATX-2 also plays roles in translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), germline proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), centrosome size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), and fat metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Thus the effects of ATX-2 could be extremely indirect. Because <italic>C. elegans</italic> ovulate every 23 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), however, our rapid 1 hr depletion would only affect the three most mature oocytes.</p>
<p>In control embryos, the sperm contents rarely came near the meiotic spindle in agreement with a previous study that found that male and female pronuclei rarely form next to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Streaming of the sperm contents was most commonly restricted to a jostling motion with little net displacement, circular streaming in the short axis of the embryo, or long axis streaming in which the sperm turned away from the spindle before the halfway point of the embryo. Depletion of MEI-1 or KLP-7 resulted in longer excursions of the sperm contents in the long axis of the embryo toward the spindle but frequent capture of the sperm by the spindle was only observed in <italic>mei-1(RNAi)</italic>. This may be because <italic>mei-1(RNAi)</italic> affects positioning of the spindle within the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) or because the altered structure of the <italic>mei-1(RNAi)</italic> spindle allows spindle microtubules to capture chromosomes further from the spindle center. In capture events observed after double depletion of ATX-2 and KLP-7, a bundle of microtubules was discernible extending from the spindle into the ER envelope surrounding the sperm DNA. Such bundles were not observed in <italic>mei-1(RNAi)</italic> capture events, likely because of the previously reported low density of microtubules in <italic>mei-1(RNAi)</italic> spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>None of our time-lapse sequences of sperm capture by the meiotic spindle resulted in extrusion of paternal DNA into a polar body as was observed when sperm was injected next to the meiotic spindle of mouse oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), likely because of the pleiotropic affects of depleting MEI-1, KLP-7 or ATX-2. Future development of more specific perturbations of cytoplasmic streaming and the organelle exclusion zone around the sperm DNA should address this problem.</p>

For all time-lapse data, single-focal plane images were acquired with a Solamere spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with an Olympus IX-70 stand, Yokogawa CSU10, either Hamamatsu ORCA FLASH 4.0 CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) detector or Hamamatsu ORCA-Quest qCMOS (quantitative complementary metal oxide semiconductor) detector, Olympus 100x UPlanApo1.35 oil objective, 100-mW Coherent Obis lasers (405, 640, 488, 561 nm) set at 30% power, and MicroManager software control. Pixel size was 65nm for the ORCA FLASH 4.0 CMOS detector and 46nm for the ORCA-Quest qCMOS detector.

<title>Sperm ER Ring Filming</title>
<p>For sperm ER ring filming, the ring was observed throughout meiosis I and II and manually kept in the focal plane by adjusting the stage (z axis). Filming typically began at spermatheca exit or meiosis I and ended at pronuclear formation or cell arrest. Due to the rigors of filming an embryo with optimal orientation and positioning in the uterus, videos that started and ended mid phases were still filmed and included in measurements so long as a complete phase was included between starting and ending filming (e.g., AI and MII were measured in videos starting mid MI and ending mid AII). In these cases when filming started mid phase and/or ended prematurely mid phase, the incompletely filmed phases were not included in quantifications. The phases at which cell arrest occurred were not included in quantifications, but the phases prior were still used.</p>

<title>Sperm ER Ring Tracking</title>
<p>Measurements of the ER rings’ dynamics in videos of embryos were tracked manually using Fiji plugin MTrackJ. All embryos quantified were rotated such that at the beginning of each video the pole containing the meiotic spindle was at the left. Only embryos measured at &gt;35 um long were used for ER ring tracking. Embryos measured &lt;35 um were tilted and not ideal for tracking. The starting and ending frames of each cell phase were then determined based on ER morphology. Individual tracks for each phase were manually made by clicking on the center of the ER ring, or in cases when it was briefly out of focus, the mitochondria that most closely followed where the ER ring was previously seen. The following criteria was used for determining phases to be quantified by tracks:</p>
<p>Metaphase I: Starts when embryo becomes stationary after exiting spermatheca into uterus and ends when ER reticulation becomes dispersed.</p>
<p>Anaphase I: Starts when ER becomes dispersed and ends when it begins to reticulate. Metaphase II: Starts when ER begins to reticulate and ends when it becomes dispersed.</p>
<p>Anaphase II: Starts when ER becomes dispersed and ends at paternal pronuclear formation.</p>
<p>Maximum X-axis displacement was quantified by subtracting the minimum x-axis coordinate of a phase’s track from the maximum x-axis coordinate.</p>
<p>Maximum Y-axis displacement was quantified by subtracting the minimum y-axis coordinate of a phase’s track from the maximum y-axis coordinate.</p>
<p>Displacement was measured as the distance between the first point of a phase’s track and the last point.</p>
<p>Distance Traveled was measured as the the total length of the track that the sperm ring traveled.</p>
<p>Maximum Average Velocity was measured by taking the maximum of 3 point moving averages of velocities in each phase. MTrackJ was used to measure the velocity of the ER ring between each video frame.</p>
<p>Duration of Phases were calculated by subtracting the first frame number of a phase from the last one and multiplying by 5 due to the 5 second intervals.</p>

<title>Paternal Mitochondria Scattering Quantifications</title>
<p>Paternal mitochondrial scattering was calculated by using a circular ROI to measure the mean value fluorescence of Deep Red MitoTracker FM or Red MitoTracker CMXros labeling paternal mitochondria in meiotic embryos. Mean pixel values were taken using a circle ROI with an 18-pixel diameter to cover the entire area of a region of fluorescence that appeared as a punctum (unless specified otherwise due to a different resolution). This was repeated until all puncta fluorescence in an embryo were measured. For every embryo, a region of cytoplasm without mitochondria had its fluorescence measured. This value was subtracted from every mitochondrial measurement to correct for noise. The distances between the center of each punctum and the center of the paternal DNA were then recorded with a line tool. The Pythagorean theorem was used to determine the distance when the mitochondria were in a different z-stack than the paternal DNA. These distances were recorded in column scatter graphs to observe the distribution of mitochondrial distance from sperm DNA quantitatively. To measure large amorphous masses of mitochondria, the same sized ROI measuring fluorescence in distinct puncta was used to cover a portion of the mass, make measurements, and then moved to another portion to make more measurements. This was repeated until the entire area of the mass had its fluorescence measured. The corresponding distances to the paternal DNA were recorded for every ROI used. The mean value fluorescence of the amorphous masses were typically much greater than the distinct puncta and as such presumably had a greater density of mitochondria per ROI than the puncta. In order to account for this density, the mean values measured from the ROI’s over the masses were divided by the average of the mean values of all of the puncta in an embryo. This resulting number was then used to determine how many times the distance between the paternal DNA and the ROI was recorded in the column scatter graphs (e.g., if the rounded value was 2 then the distance was recorded twice). The averages and standard deviations of each distribution of mitochondrial distances from paternal DNA in the embryos were then measured in order to compare the scattering of mitochondria in different experimental treatments. Quantifications were done in meiotic embryos of all phases except metaphase I. Since this phase is right after fertilization, we believe embryos do not have the time to exhibit scattering as a phenotype.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper by Beath et. al. identifies a potential regulatory role for proteins involved in cytoplasmic streaming and maintaining the grouping of paternal organelles: holding sperm contents in the fertilized embryos away from the oocyte meiotic spindle so that they don't get ejected into the polar body during meiotic chromosome segregation. The authors show that by time-lapse video, paternal mitochondria (used as a readout for sperm and its genome) is excluded from yolk granules and maternal mitochondria, even when moving long distances by cytoplasmic streaming. To understand how this exclusion is accomplished, they first show that it is independent of both internal packing and the engulfment of the paternal chromosomes by maternal endoplasmic reticulum creating an impermeable barrier. They then test whether the control of cytoplasmic steaming affects this exclusion by knocking down two microtubule motors, Katanin and kinesis I. They find that the ER ring, which is used as a proxy for paternal chromosomes, undergoes extensive displacement with these treatments during anaphase I and interacts with the meiotic spindle, supporting their hypothesis that the exclusion of paternal chromosomes is regulated by cytoplasmic streaming. Next, they test whether a regulator of maternal ER organization, ATX-2, disrupts sperm organization so that they can combine the double depletion of ATX-2 and KLP-7, presumably because klp-7 RNAi (unlike mei-1 RNAi) does not affect polar body extrusion and they can report on what happens to paternal chromosomes. They find that the knockdown of both ATX-2 and KLP-7 produces a higher incidence of what appears to be the capture of paternal chromosomes by the meiotic spindle (5/24 vs 1/25). However, this capture event appears to halt the cell cycle, preventing the authors from directly observing whether this would result in the paternal chromosomes being ejected into the polar body.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a useful, descriptive paper that highlights a potential challenge for embryos during fertilization: when fertilization results in the resumption of meiotic divisions, how are the paternal and maternal genomes kept apart so that the maternal genome can undergo chromosome segregation and polar body extrusion without endangering the paternal genome? In general, the experiments are well-executed and analyzed. In particular, the authors' use of multiple ways to knock down ATX-2 shows rigor.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper makes a case that this regulation may be important but the authors should do some additional work to make this case more convincing and accessible for those outside the field. In particular, some of the figures could include greater detail to support their conclusions, they could explain the rationale for some experiments better and they could perform some additional control experiments with their double depletion experiments to better support their interpretations. Also, the authors' inability to assess the functional biological consequences of the capture of the sperm genome by the oocyte spindle should be discussed, particularly in light of the cell cycle arrest that they observe.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Beath et al. use primarily C. elegans zygotes to test the overarching hypothesis that cytoplasmic mechanisms exit to prevent interaction between paternal chromosomes and the meiotic spindle, which are present in a shared zygotic cytoplasm after fertilization. Previous work, much of which by this group, had characterized cytoplasmic streaming in the zygote and the behavior of paternal components shortly after fertilization, primarily the clustering of paternal mitochondria and membranous organelles around the paternal chromosomes. This work set out to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for that clustering and test the specific hypothesis that the &quot;paternal cloud&quot; helps prevent the association of paternal chromosomes with the meiotic spindle.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>This work is a collection of technical achievements. The data are primarily 3- and 4-channel time-lapse images of zygotes shortly after fertilization, which were performed inside intact animals. There are many instances in which the experiments show extreme technical skill, such as tracking the paternal chromosomes over large displacements throughout the volume of the embryo. The authors employ a wide variety of fluorescent reporters to provide a remarkably clear picture of what is going on in the zygote. These reagents and the novel characterization of these stages that they provide will be widely beneficial to the community.</p>
<p>The data provide direct visualization of what had previously been a mostly hypothetical structure, the &quot;paternal cloud,&quot; using simultaneous labeling of paternal DNA and mitochondria in combination with a variety of maternal proteins including maternal mitochondria, yolk granules, tubulin, and plasma membrane. Together, these images provided convincing evidence of the existence of this specified cytoplasmic domain. They go on to show that the knockdown of the ataxin-2 homolog ALX-2, a protein previously shown to affect ER dynamics, disrupted the paternal cloud, identifying a role for ER organization in this structure.</p>
<p>The authors then used the system to test the functional consequences of perturbing the cytoplasmic organization. Consistent with the paternal cloud being a stable structure, it stayed intact during large movements the authors generated using previously published knockdowns (of mei-1/katanin and kinesin-13/kpl-7) that increased cytoplasmic streaming. They used this data to document instances in which the paternal chromosomes were likely to have been attached to the spindle. They concluded with direct evidence of spindle fibers connecting to the paternal chromatin upon knockdown of ATX-2 in combination with increased cytoplasmic streaming, providing strong, direct support for their overarching hypothesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>While the data is convincing, the narrative of the paper could be streamlined to highlight the novelty of the experiments and better articulate the aims. For example, the cloud of paternal mitochondria and membranous organelles was previously shown, but Figures 1-2 largely reiterate that observation. The innovation seems to be that the combination of ER, yolk, and maternal mitochondrial markers makes the existence of a specified domain more concrete. There are also some instances where more description is needed to make the conclusions from the images clear.</p>
<p>The manuscript intersperses what read like basic characterizations of fluorescent markers that, as written, can distract from the main story. The authors characterized the dynamics of ER organization throughout the substages of meiosis and the permeability of the envelope of ER that surrounds the paternal chromatin, but it could be more clearly established how the ability to visualize these structures allowed them to address their aims. More background on what was previously known about ER organization in M-phase and the role of ataxin proteins specifically may help provide more continuity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Beath et al. investigated the mechanisms by which sperm DNA is excluded from the meiotic spindle after fertilization. Time-lapse imaging revealed that sperm DNA is surrounded by paternal mitochondria and maternal ER that is permeable to proteins. By increasing cytoplasmic streaming using kinesin-13 or katanin RNAi, the authors demonstrated that limiting cytoplasmic streaming in the embryo is an important step that prevents the capture of sperm DNA by the oocyte meiotic spindle. Further experiments showed that the Ataxin-2 protein is required to hold paternal mitochondria together and close to the sperm DNA. Finally, double depletion of kinesin-13 and Ataxin-2 suggested an increased risk of meiotic spindle capture of sperm DNA.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting finding that could provide a new understanding of how meiotic spindle capture of sperm DNA and its accidental expulsion into the polar body is prevented. However, some conceptual gaps need to be addressed and further experiments and improved data analyses would strengthen the paper.</p>
<p>• It would be helpful if the authors could discuss in good detail how they think maternal ER surrounds the sperm DNA and why is it not disrupted following Ataxin disruption.</p>
<p>• Since important phenotypes revealed in RNAi experiments (e.g. kinesin-13 and ataxin-2 double depletion) are not very robust, the authors should consider toning down their conclusions and revising some of their section headings. I appreciate that they are upfront about some limitations, but they do nonetheless make strong concluding sentences.</p>
<p>• The discussion section could be improved further to present the authors' findings in the larger context of current knowledge in the field.</p>
<p>• The authors previously demonstrated that F-actin prevents meiotic spindle capture of sperm DNA in this system. However, the current manuscript does not discuss how the katanin, kinesin-13 and Ataxin-2 mechanisms could work together with previously established functions of F-actin in this process.</p>
<p>• How can the authors exclude off-target effects in their RNAi depletion experiments? Can kinesin-13, katanin, and Ataxin phenotypes be rescued for instance?</p>
<p>• How are the authors able to determine if the paternal genome was actually captured by the spindle? Does lack of movement definitively suggest capture without using a spindle marker?</p>
