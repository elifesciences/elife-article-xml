<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Convergent extension (CE) is a fundamental morphogenetic process where oriented cell behaviors lead to polarized extension of diverse tissues. In vertebrates, regulation of CE requires both non-canonical Wnt, its co-receptor Ror, and several “core members” of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. PCP was originally identified as a mechanism to coordinate the cellular polarity in the plane of static epithelium, where core proteins Frizzled (Fz)/ Dishevelled (Dvl) and Van Gogh-like (Vangl)/ Prickle (Pk) partition to opposing cell cortex. But how core PCP proteins interact with each other to mediate non-canonical Wnt/ Ror signaling during CE is not clear. We found previously that during CE, Vangl cell-autonomously recruits Dvl to the plasma membrane and keeps Dvl inactive. In this study, we show that non-canonical Wnt induces Dvl to transition from Vangl to Fz. Pk inhibits the transition, and functionally synergize with Vangl to suppress Dvl during CE. Conversely, Ror is required for the transition, and functionally antagonizes Vangl. Biochemically, Vangl interacts directly with both Ror and Dvl. Ror and Dvl do not bind directly, but can be cofractionated with Vangl. Collectively, we propose that Pk assists Vangl to function as an unconventional adaptor that brings Dvl and Ror into a complex to serves two functions: 1) simultaneously preventing both Dvl and Ror from ectopically activating non-canonical Wnt signaling; and 2) relaying Dvl to Fz for signaling activation upon non-canonical Wnt induced dimerization of Fz and Ror.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Throughout the animal kingdom, convergent extension (CE) is a universal morphogenetic engine that reshapes tissues during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Davey and Moens, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huebner and Wallingford, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keller, 2002</xref>). Through polarized cell intercalation, directional cell migration or oriented cell division, CE generates powerful morphogenetic force to elongate a tissue in one direction while simultaneously narrowing it in the perpendicular direction. Disruption of CE can disturb normal embryogenesis from flies to mammals and causes various congenital disorders, including neural tube defects and skeletal disorders such as Robinow Syndrome and Brachydactyly type B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yang and Mlodzik, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>In vertebrates, CE is regulated by genes in the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. PCP refers to cell polarity orthogonal to that of apical-basal in epithelial cells. It was initially discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a signaling mechanism coordinating polarized cellular structures in the plane of the epithelium. The PCP pathway consists of six “core” proteins in flies, including three transmembrane proteins (the atypical cadherin Flamingo (Fmi), the receptor Frizzled (Fz), and the four-pass transmembrane protein Van gogh (Vang; Vangl in vertebrates)), and three cytoplasmic proteins (Dishevelled (Dsh; Dvl in mammals), Diego (Dgo), and Prickle (Pk)). A key feature of the core PCP proteins is that they assemble into two distinct complexes, those of Fmi/Fz/Dsh/Dgo and Fmi/Vang/Pk, that localize asymmetrically on opposing cell cortexes. Extensive genetic and imaging studies in flies, combined with computational modeling, have led to a model of feedback interaction in establishing core PCP protein distribution. The model proposes that Fmi on neighboring cells can establish homophilic interaction to facilitates cross talk between extracellular Fz and Vang in trans at the cell-cell junctions, with Dsh, Dgo and Pk function to stabilize the interacting complexes across the cell junctions. At the same time, these cytoplasmic proteins destabilize the juxtaposition of Fz and Vang in the same cell to segregate the complexes. Several mechanisms are used to facilitate both positive and negative feedback regulations, including selective interaction with partner proteins, post-translational modification of different components, stability of core proteins at cell junctions, transport of components along cytoskeleton, and membrane protein recycling and subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ressurreicao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shimada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Strutt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Warrington et al., 2017</xref>). These feedback mechanisms act together to promote asymmetric clustering of Fz/Dsh/Dgo and Vang/Pk complexes at the distal and proximal cell junctions, respectively, to regulate asymmetric cytoskeletal organization and to coordinate planar polarity across the entire epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amonlirdviman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Axelrod and Tomlin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Humphries and Mlodzik, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Strutt et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Though the PCP components are conserved in vertebrates, they coordinate cellular polarity not only in the plane of epithelial cells, but also in actively migrating cells, including neurons, neural crest, metastatic cancer cells, and cells undergoing CE. These cells share dynamic behaviors with constantly changing cell-cell contacts and interactions. Asymmetric localization of individual PCP proteins has been reported in a number of such cells, but the pattern varies and segregation of PCP complexes has not been consistently observed (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Davey and Moens, 2017</xref>)). Moreover, as the majority of these studies focus on the activities of individual PCP component in regulating polarized cell behaviors, less is known about how PCP proteins interact with each other to coordinately control the migratory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Davey and Moens, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Potential differences in PCP protein interaction and function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates have emerged from some recent studies. While mutual inhibition between <italic>Vangl</italic> and <italic>Fz/Dvl</italic> is expected based on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> work, a number of reports also reveal a functional synergy between these proteins in mice. For instance, simultaneous decrease in gene dosage of <italic>Vangl2</italic> and <italic>Dvl</italic> enhanced CE defects in neural tube closure and cochlea elongation, and compound mouse mutants in <italic>Vangl2</italic> and several <italic>Fz</italic> genes show similar more exacerbated defects than those with mutations in individual genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Etheridge et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Upstream of Fz, the requirement of Wnt ligand in fly PCP signaling was debated initially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), and disproved more recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ewen-Campen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, non-canonical Wnts, including Wnt5a and 11, are essential for CE in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grumolato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Heisenberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yamaguchi et al., 1999</xref>), and a functional synergy between Vangl2 and Wnt5a has been shown in development of multiple tissues in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Qian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sinha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). These findings, which collectively imply a positive role of Vangl in Wnt/Fz/Dvl mediated non-canonical Wnt signaling activation, bring up an essential question on how Vangl may both cooperate with and inhibit non-canonical Wnt/Fz/Dvl.</p>
<p>A further complication of non-canonical Wnt/ PCP signaling during vertebrate development is the involvement of several co-receptors including Ror1/2, Ptk7 and Ryk, whose functions are not linked to fly PCP ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ripp et al., 2018</xref>); reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Green et al., 2014</xref>)). For instance, Ror2 has been shown to bind to Wnt5a together with Fz and is required to mediate Wnt5a-induced phosphorylation of Dvl in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grumolato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nishita et al., 2010</xref>). Mouse mutants deficient in Ror1/2 phenocopy many defects of <italic>Wnt5a</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ho et al., 2012</xref>), demonstrating a critical function of this co-receptor family in Wnt5a/ PCP signaling. Intriguingly, reduced gene dosages of both <italic>Ror2</italic> and <italic>Vangl2</italic> can lead to more severe morphogenesis defects than mutants of each individual genes, revealing a functional synergy between Vangl2 and Ror2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). This is reminiscent of the functional synergy observed between Vangl2 and non-canonical Wnt/Fz/Dvl. Ror2 was reported to interact with Vangl2 biochemically, and proposed to form a receptor complex with Vangl2 in response to Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). However, the biochemical and cell biological activities of the Ror2/ Vangl complex and how this may affect Wnt/Fz/Dvl PCP signaling is not understood in detail.</p>
<p>To understand feedback regulation of core PCP proteins in vertebrate CE, we have used the mouse and the <italic>Xenopus</italic> models to investigate functional and biochemical interactions of these proteins. Our previous work suggested that Vangl2 has dual activity in modulating Dvl function: it binds and recruits Dvl to the plasma membrane cell-autonomously and keeps it inactive, but at the same time enriching Dvl at this subcellular domain for Fz signaling upon stimulation by the Wnt11 ligand, which triggers release of Dvl from Vangl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seo et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, we attempted to address two questions raised by this model: 1) how will Vangl’s molecular partner Pk modulate Vangl-Dvl interaction during CE; and 2) if Dvl is sequestered by Vangl, how can it gain access to Fz in the response to Wnt?</p>
<p>In flies, Pk clusters with Vang to the proximal cell junction and is required to generate feedback amplification for asymmetric localization of both Vang and Dsh/Fz. Pk is shown to stabilize Fz-clusters on the plasma membrane in neighboring cells, but destabilizes Fz-clusters in a Dsh-dependent manner through endocytosis in the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Warrington et al., 2017</xref>). Competitive binding of Pk to Dsh to prevent its plasma membrane recruitment by Fz has been proposed as a mechanism to destabilize Fz/Dsh clustering in the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tree et al., 2002</xref>). But binding between Pk and Dsh was reported to be quite weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bastock et al., 2003</xref>), and over-expressing Pk in <italic>Xenopus</italic> cannot effectively abolish Fz7-mediated recruitment of Dvl to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Takeuchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Veeman et al., 2003</xref>). These studies thus do not fully support the notion of competitive binding to Dvl as the underlying mechanism for Pk to destabilize Fz clusters or its action during CE.</p>
<p>In this study, we used gastrulating <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos as a CE model to carry out functional, biochemical and imaging studies, and found that Pk helps Vangl2 to sequester both Dvl2 and Ror2, whereas Ror2 is needed for Dvl to transition from Vangl to Fz in response to non-canonical Wnt. We propose a novel model in which Pk assists Vangl to function as an unconventional adaptor that brings Dvl and Ror2 into a complex to serves two functions: 1) simultaneously preventing both Dvl and Ror2 from ectopic activation; and 2) relaying Dvl to Fz via Ror2 upon non-canonical Wnt activation. We propose that these two actions together help to modulate the threshold and dynamics of signaling activation in response to non-canonical Wnt.</p>

<title>Pk synergizes with Vangl2 to suppress Dvl during CE</title>
<p>To probe the functional network of core PCP proteins during CE, we first studied how Pk interacts with Vangl2 and Dvl to regulate <italic>Xenopus</italic> body axis elongation in both gain- and loss-of-function scenarios. To overexpress Pk in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, we used two different mRNAs that encode either a GFP tagged mouse Pk2 (mPk2) or a Flag-tagged <italic>Xenopus</italic> Pk1 (XPk) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Takeuchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Vladar et al., 2012</xref>). Similar to the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Takeuchi et al., 2003</xref>), we found that injecting <italic>Xpk</italic> or <italic>mPk2</italic> mRNA into the dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) of 4-cell stage <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos can block CE in a dose dependent manner (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1a</xref>). Quantification of the length-to-width ratio (LWR) indicates that 1 and 2 ng <italic>pk</italic> mRNA injection can reproducibly cause moderate and severe CE defects, respectively, but 0.5 ng <italic>Xpk</italic> only results in a slight LWR reduction that is not statistically significant (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl.

<title>Vangl interaction with and recruitment of Pk to the plasma membrane is essential for their functional synergy</title>
<p>To understand how Pk synergizes with Vangl to represses Dvl, we first investigated whether they could modulate each other’s protein levels. It was reported that Vang could control Pk stability indirectly through ubiquitination in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Strutt et al., 2013</xref>), while in zebrafish Pk could down-regulate Dsh/Dvl protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carreira-Barbosa et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos or explants undergoing CE, however, we found that morpholino knockdown of <italic>Xvangl2</italic> or over-expression of <italic>mVangl2</italic> did not affect the protein level of co-injected mPk2 or XPk (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2a, b, c</xref>). In contrast, co-transfecting XPk with Vangl2 in cultured HEK293T cells did lead to significant reduction of XPk protein level (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2d</xref>, also see Pk2 down-regulation by Vangl2 in 293 cells in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nagaoka et al., 2019</xref>)). Therefore, Vang/Vangl2-modulation of Pk stability seems to be context-dependent, and does not account for the observed synergy between Vangl2 and Pk during <italic>Xenopus</italic> CE. Furthermore, over-expression of Pk does not alter the protein level of co-injected Vangl2 or Dvl2 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2a, b</xref>), indicating that during <italic>Xenopus</italic> CE Pk does not synergize with Vangl2 or antagonize Dvl2 by altering their protein levels.</p>
<p>To explore other mechanisms that may explain how Pk synergizes with Vangl2 to antagonize Dvl during CE, we examined the effect of Vangl2 on Pk’s sub-cellular localization. When EGFP tagged mPk2 is expressed in either the animal cap or DMZ, it displays diffused cytoplasmic distribution and variable enrichment at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 3a, c</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4a</xref>). Co-injection of mVangl2 significantly increased plasma membrane enrichment of mPk2 in both animal cap and DMZ explants (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 3b</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4b, e</xref>). On the other hand, morpholino knockdown of endogenous <italic>Xvangl2</italic> diminished mPk2 plasma membrane enrichment, which could be restored by co-injection of a small amount of mVangl2 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 3d, e</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4c, d</xref> and e). Together, these data indicate that Vangl2 is both necessary and sufficient to recruit Pk to the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>To test whether plasma membrane recruitment of Pk by Vangl is important for their functional synergy, we took advantage of a Vangl2 R177H variant identified in a patient with diastematomyelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kibar et al., 2011</xref>). This variant changes the highly conserved Arg177 to a histidine in the intracellular loop region between TM2 (transmembrane domain) and TM3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Importantly, this variant does not perturb Vangl2 plasma membrane trafficking/ localization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, b’</xref>), its protein level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 5e</xref>), or its ability to interact with and recruit Dvl to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 5a-d</xref>). The variant, however, reduced Vangl2 interaction with Pk and recruitment of Pk to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c-g</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Vangl2 RH variant diminishes membrane recruitment of Pk and reduces functional synergy with Pk</title>
<p>Schematic illustration showing the structure of Vangl2 and location of the R177H variant at the intracellular loop region between transmembrane domain 2 and 3 (a). When expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap cells, EGFP-Vangl2 RH displays plasma membrane localization indistinguishable from wild-type EGFP-Vangl2 (b, b’). Immunostaining shows that flag-XPk displays diffuse cytoplasmic localization with some membrane enrichment when expressed alone (c, c’). The plasma membrane localization of flag-XPk is enhanced significantly by co-expression of wild-type Vangl2 (d, d’), but only modestly by Vangl2 RH variant (e, e’). (f) Quantification of the ratio of plasma membrane vs. cytoplasmic flag-XPk signal intensity in (c), (d) and (e). Co-IP and western blot show that R177H mutation does not alter Vangl2 protein level, but reduces binding to flag-XPk (g, n=3 biological repeats). Functionally, co-injection of 0.05 ng <italic>Vangl2</italic> and 0.5 ng <italic>Xpk</italic> can strongly synergize to disrupt CE, but the synergy is significantly reduced when <italic>Vangl2 RH</italic> variant mRNA is co-injected with <italic>Xpk</italic> (h).

<p>Functionally, the R177H variant significantly reduced the synergy between Vangl2 and Pk during CE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h, i</xref>). Moreover, compared to wild-type Vangl2, Vangl2 R177H results in significantly less severe CE defects when over-expressed alone in the DMZ (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 6a, a’</xref>), and is less capable of suppressing Dvl-Fz mediated signaling activation during CE when co-expressed (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 6b, b’</xref>). We interpret these data to suggest that: 1) direct binding of Vangl2 to Pk, through which Pk is recruited to the plasma membrane, is crucial for their functional synergy during CE; and 2) direct binding of Vangl to Dvl alone may not be sufficient to suppress Dvl, and simultaneous interaction with Pk may be required for Vangl to efficiently inhibit Dvl during CE.</p>

<title>Pk synergizes with Vangl to sequester Dvl from Fz</title>
<p>To investigate how Pk may help Vangl to suppress Dvl during CE, we first tested whether Pk over-expression may disrupt Dvl interaction with Fz. In both animal cap and DMZ cells, Fz7 can recruit mCherry tagged Dvl2 (Dvl2-mCh) to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 7b, e</xref>). Co-expression of GFP-mPk2, however, does not perturb Fz7-mediated plasma membrane recruitment of Dvl2 (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 7c, f</xref>), suggesting that over-expression of Pk alone cannot effectively disrupt Dvl-Fz interaction in <italic>Xenopus</italic>.</p>
<p>We then investigated the alternative possibility that Pk may help Vangl to sequester Dvl, and thereby preventing Wnt-Fz-Dvl interaction to inhibit non-canonical Wnt signaling activation during CE. Our previous studies provided evidence that Vangl recruits Dvl into an inactive complex at the plasma membrane; and Wnt11 can induce dissociation of Dvl from Vangl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Angermeier et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seo et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore first tested whether Pk may reinforce Vangl-Dvl interaction to counter the dissociation effect by Wnt11. When co-injected into the DMZ, mPk2 significantly prevented Wnt11-induced dissociation of Flag-Dvl2 from EGFP-Vangl2, although in the absence of Wnt11 co-injection it did not substantially increase Dvl2-Vangl2 interaction (Suppl. Fig. 8). These data suggest that, at least under the condition of our co-IP experiment, Pk may not directly impact the steady-state binding between Vangl and Dvl, but may strengthen Dvl sequestration by Vangl to inhibit its response to non-canonical Wnt ligand.</p>
<p>To investigate how Pk may help Vangl to regulate Dvl’s response to non-canonical Wnt, we performed imaging studies. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish, Wnt11 can induce formation of Fz-Dvl complexes that cluster as patches at the cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Angermeier et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Witzel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yamanaka and Nishida, 2007</xref>). We therefore tested how Vangl/ Pk may affect formation of Wnt11-induced Fz-Dvl patches. In DMZ (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9a-c’</xref>) or animal cap (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-c’</xref>) explants, co-injection of <italic>Xenopus Wnt11</italic> can induce Dvl2-EGFP, Dvl2-mScarletI (Dvl2-mSc) or Dvl2-mCh to form distinct patches along cell-cell contacts. By separate injection of <italic>Dvl2-mSc</italic> and <italic>Dvl2-EGFP</italic> into two adjacent blastomeres, we found that the Wnt11-induced Dvl2-mSc and Dvl2-EGFP patches are aligned along the adjacent cell borders (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9a-c’</xref>). This result is consistent with the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Witzel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yamanaka and Nishida, 2007</xref>), and indicates that Wnt11 induces symmetric clustering of Dvl across the border of adjacent cells, a scenario that is different from the asymmetric clustering of Fz/Dvl and Vang/Pk complexes between adjacent cells commonly observed during PCP establishment in epithelial tissues.</p>

<p>When EGFP-tagged <italic>Xenopus</italic> Fz7 is co-injected in animal cap or DMZ explants, it exclusively forms membrane patches that completely overlapped with Dvl2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d-f’</xref>; <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9d-f’</xref>), consistent with clustering of Fz with Dvl. Co-injecting moderate level of EGFP-tagged mouse Vangl2 (0.1 ng) does not perturb Wnt11-induced Dvl2 patch formation. In contrast to Fz7, Vangl2 is distributed broadly on the plasma membrane, but to our surprise it also displays overlapping enrichment with Dvl2 patches (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g-i</xref>; <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9g-i</xref>). Close examination revealed that in most cases Vangl2 is enriched at the edges of Dvl2 patches, but diminished at the center (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g’-i’</xref> and <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9g’-i’</xref>, compare red arrows and arrowheads to green arrows and arrowheads). In 3-D reconstructed confocal images, enriched Vangl2 often forms rings that encircle Dvl2 patches (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 10c</xref>, white arrows; and enlarged views in a’-c’).</p>
<p>To quantitatively assess their spatial distribution, we measured and plotted the relative intensity of Dvl2 against Fz7, Vangl2 or membrane-GFP control along the length of ten representative patches in animal cap explants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3p-r</xref>). Our analyses revealed that membrane-GFP displayed no enrichment along Wnt11-induced Dvl2 patches (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3p</xref>). Fz7, however, showed enrichment that correlated strongly with Dvl2: their intensities follow a similar pattern of increasing sharply from the edge and peaking coincidentally at the center of the patches (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3q</xref>). In contrast, Vangl2 enrichment starts to appear slightly outside of Dvl2 patches (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g’</xref>, i’, r, green arrowheads), peaks at the edges as Dvl2 intensity begins to rise, and dips at the center where Dvl2 and Fz7 intensities reach the maximum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g’</xref>, i’, r, green arrows). Analyses of DMZ explants showed the same results (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9q, r</xref>). These imaging analyses are consistent with our co-IP data (Suppl. Fig. 8), and further suggest the possibility that Dvl may leave Vangl and transition to Fz upon Wnt11 induction.</p>
<p>We then tested whether addition of Pk can help Vangl2 to counter the effect of Wnt11. Indeed, co-injecting Pk with 0.1 ng Vangl2 effectively reduced Wnt11-induced Dvl2 patch formation, making Dvl2 more evenly distributed along the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3m-o</xref>; <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9m-o</xref>) and overlap with Vangl2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3m’-o’, t</xref>; <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9m’-o’, t</xref>). Similar reduction of Dvl patch formation can also be achieved, albeit less effectively, by over-expression of high level Vangl2 alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j-l’, s</xref>; <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9j-l’, s</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine how Vangl2 and Pk could affect Fz7 enrichment in the Wnt11-induced Fz/Dvl patches, we co-injected fluorescent protein-tagged Dvl2 and Fz7 in both animal cap and DMZ explants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>; Suppl. Fig. 11). In both cases, moderate over-expression of Vangl2 or Pk individually does not affect enrichment of Fz7 within Wnt11-induced Dvl2 patches (compare <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a-c’</xref> with d-i’; <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 11a-c’ with d-I’</xref>), but Vangl2 and Pk together not only perturb Dvl2 patches, but also disperse Fz7 into small puncta (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j-l’</xref>; <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 11j-l’</xref>). Close examination revealed that some of the Fz7 puncta are on the plasma membrane and largely co-localize with Dvl2. The rest of Fz7 puncta, however, are located in the cytoplasm near the plasma membrane and appear to be endocytosed vesicles (arrows in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4k’</xref>, l’ and <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Suppl.

Vangl2 and XPk co-expression, however, not only disrupt Dvl2-mCh patches but also disperse Fz7-EGFP patches into small puncta (j-l). Enlarged views revealed that some of the Fz7-EGFP puncta are on the plasma membrane and remain co-localized with Dvl2-mCh, while the others are located in the cytoplasm near the plasma membrane (k’’, l’, arrows) and contain only Fz7 but not Dvl2 (compare arrows in j’ to k’).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="555374v3_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To confirm that the cytoplasmic Fz7 puncta are endocytosed vesicles, we performed FM4-64 dye uptake experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Classen et al., 2005</xref>). FM4-64 is a membrane impermeable fluorescent dye that can only be internalized through endocytosis. When we incubated the explants with FM4-64, we found that many Fz7 puncta induced by Vangl2/Pk co-injection were also positive for FM4-64 (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 12d-f’</xref>), indicating that they are indeed endocytic vesicles.</p>
<p>These data imply that Pk may assist Vangl to sequester Dvl, thereby reducing the accessibility of Dvl to attenuate Fz-Dvl complex formation in response to Wnt11, and resulting in Fz destabilization at the plasma membrane. To test this idea, we reduced Dvl availability at the plasma membrane using another strategy. Over-expression of DshMA, a mitochondrial tethered Dvl, can sequester endogenous Dvl to the mitochondria (and away from the plasma membrane) through DIX-domain mediated oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park et al., 2005</xref>). We found that DshMA injection indeed mimicked the effect of Vangl2/Pk co-injection on Fz, resulting in reduced Fz7 clustering upon Wnt11 induction, formation of cytoplasmic puncta near the plasma membrane, and diminished plasma membrane localization (Suppl. Fig. 13).</p>
<p>To further test whether Vangl2 needs direct interaction with Pk in order to down-regulate Fz7 stability at the plasma membrane and Fz7 patch formation in response to Wnt11, we analyzed Vangl2 R177H variant that specifically reduces Vangl2-Pk interaction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref> and Suppl. Fig. 6). We found that unlike wild-type Vangl2, co-injecting Vangl2 R177H with Pk failed to significantly diminish Wnt11-induced Fz7 patch formation or cause cytoplasmic Fz7 puncta (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These data support the notion that direct Pk-Vangl2 interaction is required for efficient sequestration of Dvl from Fz, thereby reducing Fz stability on the plasma membrane.</p>

<p>As a final test for this idea, we examined Dvl phosphorylation known to be inducible by Fz and non-canonical Wnt signaling activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Axelrod, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Klein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rothbacher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shimada et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Strutt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Strutt et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Xenopus</italic> extract from embryos injected with <italic>flag-Dvl2</italic> in the DMZ often shows Dvl2 migrating as two bands.

The slower migrating form of Dvl2 is increased by Fz7 co-injection, but eliminated by phosphatase treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Conversely, high level Vangl2 over-expression reduces the phosphorylated form of Dvl2, while Fz7 can counter Vangl2’s effect to increase Dvl2 phosphorylation when co-injected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Furthermore, our co-IP experiment demonstrated that only the faster migrating, presumably unphosphorylated form of Dvl2 could be pulled down by Vangl2 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>), suggesting that Vangl2-bound Dvl2 may be shielded from Fz-induced phosphorylation.

Co-IP experiment indicates that only the faster migrating, presumably unphosphorylated form of Dvl2 can be co-immunoprecipitated by Vangl2 (d). High level <italic>Xpk</italic> (1 ng) or moderate <italic>Vangl2</italic> (0.25 ng) cannot significantly reduce phosphorylated form of Dvl2 when injected individually, but their co-injection can suppress Dvl2 phosphorylation (e).

<title>Ror2 facilitates transition of Dvl2 from Vangl2 to Fz complexes in response to non-canonical Wnt</title>
<p>The above results prompted us to ask that if Dvl is sequestered at the plasma membrane by Vangl2/Pk, how it may transition to form a complex with Fz in response to non-canonical Wnt? As Ror2 has been shown to act as a non-canonical Wnt co-receptor capable of interacting with both Fz and Vangl2 during CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grumolato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hikasa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wallkamm et al., 2014</xref>), we hypothesized that Ror2 may be a key component to shuttle Dvl between Vangl2 and Fz.</p>
<p>To test this idea, we first examined the functional relationship between Ror2 and Vangl2. Injecting moderate amount of <italic>Xenopus ror2</italic> mRNA (<italic>Xror2;</italic> 0.05-0.1 ng) can efficiently rescue the severe CE defects induced by 0.2 ng of <italic>Vangl2</italic> mRNA (Suppl. Fig.14a, b), supporting the idea that like Dvl2, Ror2 antagonizes Vangl2 to activate non-canonical Wnt signaling during CE.</p>
<p>Secondly, we tested that at the cellular level, how Wnt11 may induce Ror2 to cluster into patches and how Ror2 patches may correlate with Dvl2 and/or Vangl2 patches. Similar to Fz and Dvl, Ror2-EGFP can be induced to form patches on the plasma membrane by Wnt11 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a-f</xref>). Upon co-injection with Dvl2-mCh, the Ror2 patches are overlapped with Dvl2 patches (Fig.7g-i). Close examination of these patches revealed that Ror2, like Fz, accumulates with Dvl2 to high levels in the center of the patches (red arrowhead in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g’</xref>, j). But unlike Fz, Ror2 patches are slightly longer and extend outside of Dvl2 patches (green arrowheads in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g’</xref>, j). Quantification indicated that the signal intensity ratio between Ror2 and Dvl2 is increased over two folds at the border of the patches (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7j</xref>, bottom panel). This is reminiscent of Vangl2 enrichment at this region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g’-i’; r</xref>), and suggests that Ror2 and Vangl2 may accumulate together at the border of Dvl2 patches to form a complex with diminished amount of Dvl2. Also similar to Vangl2, Ror2 continues to display broad membrane distribution outside of Dvl2 patches (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d, g</xref>) in the presence of Wnt11, differing from Dvl2 and Fz that are localized exclusively within patches (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7h,i</xref>; Fig.3d-f). These results suggest that at least under the moderate over-expression condition for our imaging experiments, a portion of Ror2 may remain tethered to Vangl2 on the plasma membrane whereas most Dvl2 dissociates from Vangl2 to cluster with Fz in response to Wnt11.</p>

</fig>
<p>To test whether Ror2 is required for Dvl2 patch formation in response to Wnt11, we used a verified morpholino to knock down endogenous XRor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schambony and Wedlich, 2007</xref>) and found that Dvl2 patch formation is significantly diminished in Xror2 morphants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7k, l</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that Ror2, a molecular partner of Vangl2, is an obligatory component of the Fz/Dvl cluster induced by Wnt11.</p>
<p>To further scrutinize the molecular mechanism, we tested biochemically whether Ror2 is required for Dvl2 to dissociate from Vangl2 in response to Wnt11. Indeed, we found that Wnt11-induced dissociation of Dvl2 from Vangl2 was significantly reduced when endogenous Ror2 level was knocked down by <italic>Xror2</italic>-MO (Supplementary Fig. 15a, a’). Unexpectedly, the co-IP data also showed that the steady-state binding between Dvl2 and Vangl2 appeared to be reduced by XRor2 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 15a, a’). The reason for this is unclear and will need to be investigated in the future.</p>
<p>Together, these data support the notion that Ror2 is required for Dvl2 to transition from Vangl2 to Fz in response to Wnt11. To test how Ror2 may facilitate this transition, we performed co-IP experiment. Similar to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gao et al., 2011</xref>), our co-IP experiment detected Ror2 interaction with Vangl2 but not Dvl2 (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 15b</xref>), suggesting that Ror2 may bind directly to Vangl2 but not Dvl2. As Ror2 and Dvl2 can both bind to Vangl2, we reasoned that they could interact indirectly through their mutual binding with Vangl2. We thus performed fluorescence-detection size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) with protein extract from <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos injected with <italic>Xror2-EGFP</italic>, <italic>HA-Vangl2</italic> and <italic>Flag-Dvl2</italic>. The elution of Ror2-EGFP was monitored by a fluorescence detector following size exclusion chromatography. The fractions of different molecular size were collected and analyzed by western blot. We found co-fractionation of Ror2, Vangl2 and Dvl2 in fractions 14, 15 and16 (with the approximate molecular weight of 773-1717, 348-773 and 166-348 kD, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 15c). This result supports our hypothesis that Ror2, Vangl2 and Dvl2 form complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>. We envision a model in which an Ror2/Vangl2/Dvl2 complex serves two purposes during CE: it allows Vangl2 to simultaneously sequester both Ror2 and Dvl2 and keeps them inactive, while in response to non-canonical Wnt it enables Ror2 to shuttle Dvl to Fz (See <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> and Discussion below).</p>

<title>Bimodal regulation of Ror2 by Vangl2/Pk during non-canonical Wnt signaling</title>
<p>We used Wnt11-induced patch formation as a readout to test the above model. First, we tested whether Vangl2 may synergize with Pk to sequester Ror2 from Fz7 as it does to Dvl2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Suppl.

Fig. 16) explants, they form clusters that overlap. Moderate over-expression of Vangl2 or XPk individually does not affect Ror2/Fz7 co-clustering within Wnt11-induced patches (compare <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a-c’</xref> to d-i’, Supplementary Fig. 16a-c’ to d-i’). Vangl2 and Pk co-injection, however, significantly reduced Ror2/Fz7 patches induced by Wnt11 into small puncta (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8j-l</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 16j-l), and caused Fz7 to form intracellular puncta near the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8k’</xref>, l’, arrows; Supplementary Fig. 16k’, l’). Interestingly, like Dvl2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j’</xref>, k’), Ror2 is not present in these Fz7 puncta (compare arrows in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8j’</xref> to k’ and in Supplementary Fig. 16j’-k’) but remained on the plasma membrane, presumably with Dvl2 and Vangl.</p>
<p>We then tested whether Vangl2 may also be required for Ror2 to form Wnt11-induced patches with Fz7 since our model predicts that, by bridging Ror2 and Dvl into a complex, Vangl2 helps</p>

Collectively, these data support our model and suggest that with Pk, Vangl2 exerts bimodal regulation of Ror2 in non-canonical Wnt signaling.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Early fly studies identified six proteins that act as core members to coordinate cellular polarity across the plane of the epithelium. In-depth genetic, biochemical and imaging studies have subsequently elucidated how the six core PCP proteins interact within and between cells to establish feedback loops that partition Vang/Pk and Fz/Dsh/Dgo clusters on opposing cell cortexes to coordinate polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amonlirdviman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>). These studies establish a foundation to understand the action of PCP proteins in static epithelial cells. They do not, however, seem to provide direct explanation for how PCP proteins regulate polarized and dynamic cell behavior during CE, where asymmetric partitioning of core PCP proteins has not been consistently observed and non-core PCP proteins, including non-canonical Wnt ligands, co-receptors Ror1/2 and a cytoplasmic protein Dact1, are also critically involved. Furthermore, adopting core PCP proteins to regulate CE is likely a vertebrate-specific adaption during evolution, since fly germband extension, a CE-like morphogenetic event, does not involve core PCP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</xref>). We previously provided evidence for a model that during CE, Vangl exerts bimodal regulation of Dvl by cell-autonomously recruiting Dvl to the plasma membrane in an inactive state, and simultaneously poising Dvl for activation upon binding of Fz to non-canonical Wnt ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seo et al., 2017</xref>). Our recent work tested this model by studying how Dact1, a vertebrate specific protein, modulates Dvl-Vangl interaction during non-canonical Wnt signaling and CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Angermeier et al., 2025</xref>). In the current study, we further tested this model and demonstrated that Pk functionally synergizes with Vangl2 to inhibit Dvl2 during CE in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Mechanistically, Pk binding to Vangl2 helps Vangl2 to sequester Dvl and constrain its transition to Fz. Moreover, Pk seems to play a similar role in assisting Vangl2 to sequester Ror2, whereas Ror2 is required for Dvl2 to transition from Vangl to Fz in response to non-canonical Wnt. We propose an updated model for the bimodal regulation in which Vangl2/Pk bring both Dvl2 and Ror2 into an inactive complex that prevents ectopic non-canonical Wnt signaling. On the other hand, this complex can also be coupled with Fz upon non-canonical Wnt induced binding between Ror2 and Fz, delivering Dvl to Fz to initiate non-canonical Wnt signaling (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Therefore, Vangl mediated plasma membrane recruitment of Dvl and pre-assembly of Dvl/ Vangl/ Ror complex can also accelerate non-canonical Wnt signaling activation by facilitating Dvl presentation to ligand-bound Fz. Our model provides a new framework to decipher how core PCP proteins are integrated with non-core proteins to tightly control the threshold and dynamics of non-canonical Wnt/ PCP signaling during CE.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Regulation of Vangl-Dvl interaction by Pk to suppress non-canonical Wnt signaling</title>
<p>Our previous work proposed that Vangl-Dvl interaction provides a key switch to the central logic of non-canonical Wnt siganling by enriching Dvl around the plasma membrane for effective access to Fz, while at the same time keeping Dvl inactive to prevent ectopic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seo et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, we found that the Vangl2 R177H variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kibar et al., 2011</xref>), which can traffick properly and bind to and recruit Dvl2 to the plasma membrane like wild-type Vangl2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Suppl. Fig. 5), is less capable of inhibiting CE and rescuing Fz/Dvl over-expression induced CE defect (Suppl. Fig.5). The results suggest that binding to Dvl <italic>per se</italic> is not sufficient for Vangl2 to suppress Dvl during CE. Interestingly, Vangl2 R177H displays significantly reduced binding and functional synergy with Pk. We therefore reason that interaction with Pk is necessary for Vangl2 to efficiently sequester Dvl from Fz or downstream targets like Daam1. Our biochemical and imaging experiments provide supporting evidence to this idea (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Suppl. Fig. 8, 9, 11, 16).</p>
<p>There are at least three possibilities accounting for how Pk can assist Vangl2 to sequester Dvl. First, given that Dvl, Pk and Vang/Vangl can mutually interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bastock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Humphries et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jenny et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Takeuchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tree et al., 2002</xref>), Pk may stabilize a ternary Dvl/Pk/Vangl complex by simultaneously interacting with both Vangl and Dvl (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9a</xref>). We, however, do not favor this possibility because 1) the binding between Pk and Dvl was reported to be quite weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bastock et al., 2003</xref>); 2) our unpublished data show that ΔPL, a Pk mutant lacking the PET/LIM domains necessary for Dvl binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Takeuchi et al., 2003</xref>), can largely mimic wild-type Pk function. Furthermore, a recent study in flies showed that the phosphorylation status of a conserved tyrosine in the cytoplasmic tail of Vang provides opposite binding preference for Pk and Dsh, suggesting that simultaneous binding of both Pk and Dsh to the C-terminus of Vang may not be possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Humphries et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Secondly, Pk may regulate biochemical modification on Vangl2 to strengthen Vangl2-Dvl interaction. The best known modification on Vang/Vangl is phosphorylation at several N-terminal serine/ threonine residues in response to Wnt/ Fz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kelly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Whereas one study in flies reported that Pk can prevent Vang phosphorylation at these residues to decrease Vang turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Strutt et al., 2019</xref>), another study in fly S2 cells found that Pk over-expression does not alter Vang N-terminal phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kelly et al., 2016</xref>). In our current studies in <italic>Xenopus,</italic> we have not been able to detect Vangl2 phosphorylation consistently, but this possibility remains an interesting idea and should be tested in the future using the reported phosphomutant and phosphomimetic Vangl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue of Vang was recently reported to decrease its binding with Dsh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Humphries et al., 2023</xref>), and could therefore provide a mechanism to control Vangl-Dvl interaction. But the regulatory mechanism of this tyrosine phosphorylation is not clear and does not seem to depend on Fz. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the role of this tyrosine phosphorylation in vertebrate CE.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Pk binding may induce allosteric change or clustering of Vangl to increase the overall avidity for Dvl binding. Vang/Vangl was proposed to dimerize, and possibly oligomerize into larger cluster through their C-terminal tail and/or transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Belotti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jenny et al., 2003</xref>), and two recent cryo-EM studies revealed that Vangl1/2 can oligomerize into trimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Song et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhang et al., 2025</xref>). Interestingly, quantitative imaging studies in flies have revealed that in stable PCP clusters, the ratio between Vang and Pk is 6:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Strutt et al., 2016</xref>). In light of our data suggesting that the intracellular loop between TM2 and 3 in Vangl2 may impact Pk binding in addition to the canonical Pk binding domain at the C-terminal tail (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bastock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Humphries et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jenny et al., 2003</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that Pk may nucleate or stabilize Vangl oligomer formation through multimeric interactions with different domains on multiple Vangl proteins. Such oligomeric Vangl cluster may form a “cage” to more effectively sequester Dvl due to increased local concentration and/or higher binding affinity resulted from conformational change upon oligomerization or Pk binding.</p>
<p>Our above model seemingly contradicts with the fly studies showing that Vang/Pk clusters are partitioned to the opposite cell cortexes from Fz/Dsh clusters and are clearly devoid of Dsh. These segregated clusters, however, seem to form progressively from initial symmetrically distributed PCP proteins along cell-cell junctions at early stages where Vang does co-mingle with Dsh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bastock et al., 2003</xref>), and a new study further implicated the functional importance of Vang-Dsh binding in fly PCP establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Humphries et al., 2023</xref>). Persistent contact and stable junctions between neighboring cells may facilitate feedback interaction to partition Vang/Pk from Dsh/Fz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stahley et al., 2021</xref>). In dynamically moving cells during CE, intercellular feedback interactions are likely limited and transient, therefore posing challenges for stable segregation of distinct PCP clusters. Conversely, non-canonical Wnt ligands play a key role during vertebrate CE but not in fly PCP establishment. These differences may lead to some changes in the molecular actions of core PCP proteins (see below).</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>An Ror-dependent relay mechanism to deliver Dvl for non-canonical Wnt signaling</title>
<p>The premise of our model is that during CE, Vangl acts via a relay mechanism to first bring Dvl to the plasma membrane, and then releases Dvl to Fz. Pk may tighten up this relay mechanism, via regulating Vangl-Dvl interaction, to increase the efficiency of Dvl plasma membrane recruitment and the threshold at which Dvl can be released to Fz. While the detailed mechanisms for how Dvl can be released from Vangl and transitioned to Fz are yet to be elucidated in further details in the future, our studies identified several factors that contribute to the transition: non-canonical Wnt, the co-receptor Ror2 and Dvl phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Our co-IP and imaging studies showed that Wnt11 can trigger dissociation of Dvl2 from Vangl2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g-i’</xref>; Suppl. Fig. 8 and 9g-i’; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Angermeier et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seo et al., 2017</xref>)) and formation of Fz7-Dvl2 clusters at cell-cell contact (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d-f’</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9d-f’</xref>), indicating that non-canonical Wnt can act extracellularly to trigger the transition of Dvl from Vangl to Fz. It is possible that Wnt binding to Fz can directly induce events in favor of Fz-Dvl association. We, however, also consider the alternate possibility that Wnt binding to the co-receptors Ror1/2 to bring Dvl to Fz.</p>
<p>Like Fz, Ror1/2 also harbor the extracellular cysteine-rich domains known to interact with Wnts and have been shown to heterodimerize with Fz in response to non-canonical Wnt binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Griffiths et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grumolato et al., 2010</xref>). At the same time, like Dvl, Ror2 was reported to bind directly with Vangl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore postulate that Ror2 may shuttle between Vangl and Fz to deliver Dvl in a Wnt dependent manner. We note several intriguing links between Ror2 and Dvl2: 1) they both bind to Vangl2 yet display functional antagonism against Vangl2 during CE in over-expression assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; Suppl. Fig. 14); 2) they both cluster with Fz in response to Wnt11 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>; Suppl. Fig. 9, 16), and importantly Ror2 is required for Dvl2 to dissociate from Vangl2 and cluster with Fz in response to Wnt11 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7l</xref>; <xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 15a, a’</xref>). While Ror2 does not seem to bind Dvl directly in our experiment, they both interact with Vangl2 and our SEC data show that Ror2, Vangl2 and Dvl2 co-fractionate (Suppl. Fig. 15), suggesting that they may form complexes together. Therefore, we envision a model where Vangl acting as an adaptor to bring together Dvl and Ror, either through simultaneous binding of both Dvl and Ror to a single Vangl (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9a</xref>) or self-oligomerization of Vangl proteins bound separately to Dvl and Ror (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9b</xref>). When non-canonical Wnt induces Fz-Ror to heterodimerize, the complexes consisting of Ror/Vangl/Dvl can be brought close to Fz to deliver Dvl and initiate non-canonical Wnt signaling (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9a’</xref>,b’).</p>
<p>In this model, Vangl acts as an unconventional adaptor to simultaneously serve two critical functions: it pre-assembles Ror and Dvl into complexes at the plasma membrane ready to initiate non-canonical Wnt signaling, but at the same time keeps both inactive to prevent ectopic signaling activation. We previously demonstrated that Vangl2 can prevent Dvl from interacting with its downstream effector Daam1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seo et al., 2017</xref>), and our data in this study suggest that Vangl/Pk may act together to sequesters both Dvl and Ror from Fz as well (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>; Suppl. Fig. 11, 16). Based on this model, Vangl2 over-expression will exert excessive suppression to prevent non-canonical Wnt signaling during CE, which can be overcome by co-overexpressing Dvl2 or Ror2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; Suppl. Fig. 14). Conversely, reducing the dosage of endogenous Vangl2 may decrease the assembly of Ror/Vangl/Dvl complexes, compromising signaling activation in response to non-canonical Wnt (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8m-o’</xref>). Therefore, our model can explain how partial loss of Vangl2 can synergize with loss of positive non-canonical Wnt signaling regulators, including Ror2, Dvl2 and Wnt5a, to cause various severe CE defects reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Qian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sinha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, our data implicated an intriguing role for Dvl phosphorylation in the transition from Vangl to Fz. We found that flag-Dvl2 phosphorylation is increased as CE progresses in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and can be elevated by Fz7 but suppressed by Vangl2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b, c</xref>). In agreement with our over-expression data in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, loss of both Vangl1 and 2 leads to increased Dvl2 and 3 phosphorylation in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mentink et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, Vangl2 seems to bind only to unphosphorylated form Dvl2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). These observations suggest that either Dvl phosphorylation <italic>per se</italic> or another associated modification can be used as a mechanism to decouple Dvl from Vangl. In support of this view, the basic region and PDZ domain of Dsh/Dvl, which mediates Dvl-Vangl interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Angermeier et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Park and Moon, 2002</xref>), is a strong target of CK1 during PCP signaling in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Klein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Strutt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Strutt et al., 2006</xref>). Our recent work further revealed that Dvl oligomerization promotes its dissociation from Vangl possibly by occluding the PDZ domain, and Dvl mutants defective at oligomerization also fail to undergo phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Angermeier et al., 2025</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, we propose the second piece of our model (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9c</xref>, c’) that during CE, non-canonical Wnt triggers association of Ror1/2 and Fz to simultaneously accomplish two events: 1) bringing Vangl-sequestered Dvl close to Fz; and 2) activating CK1 or other kinases to phosphorylate Dvl. The combined effects lead to Dvl dissociation from Vangl and transition to Fz in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. On the other hand, by assisting Vangl to sequester Dvl, Pk may suppress the noise from basal CK1 activity, and allow cells to respond more specifically and dynamically to non-canonical Wnt singling during CE.</p>

<title><italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo manipulation and animal cap/DMZ explants</title>
<p>Embryos were acquired by superovulation, maintained in 0.1% MMR solution until the stages for microinjection. Morpholinos or <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized RNAs were injected into either the animal side of two-cell-stage embryos or the DMZ of four-cell-stage embryos. For phenotypic analysis, the DMZ-injected embryos were fixed at tailbud stages, and the dorsal view of embryos was captured using a Leica DFC 490 camera mounted on a Leica M205 FCA stereomicroscope. A Fiji macro was utilized to process the images and obtain the projected area and the length of each embryo. Briefly, the macro first extracts individual embryos from the images, measures the area of each embryo, and generates the smallest rectangle that fully encloses each embryo. The length of the rectangle is considered the length of the embryo, while the width is calculated by dividing the embryo’s area by its length. The LWR is then calculated in Excel. The length of the embryos with significant curved shape was correct manually by drawing a line along the anteroposterior axis to measure the maximal distance from the head to the tail of each embryo using the Leica LAS software with Interactive Measurement module. For animal cap elongation assay, ectodermal explants were isolated at stages 9-10 and incubated in 0.5 MMR solution containing 10 ng/ml of Activin B (R&amp;D cat# 659-AB-005). The CE phenotype was quantified by measuring the length of the resulting explants. For fluorescent imaging to determine protein localization, DMZ or animal cap explants from injected embryos were isolated at stage 10-10.5, coversliped and subjected to confocal imaging analysis as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Angermeier et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seo et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

Western blot detection of proteins was carried out with anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology GFP (B-2) (Cat# sc-9996)), anti-myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology myc Antibody(G-4) (Cat# sc-373712)), anti-Dvl2 (CST Cat.# 3224), anti-XRor2 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) or anti-flag antibody (Sigma Anti-flag M2 antibody (Cat# F1804)). We followed the protocol by Burckhardt et. al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burckhardt et al., 2021</xref>) and used FIJI to quantify the relative amount of co-IP. Briefly, the intensity values from the co-IP of any protein was divided by that from the IP of its presumptive partner under each control or experimental condition; the mean ratios from the controls was then used to normalize the ratios under each experimental condition to determine the “Relative Co-IP amount”.</p>

Alternatively, <italic>flag-Xpk</italic> injected animal caps were dissected and fixed in 4% PFA for immunofluorescence staining with an anti-flag antibody. Dissected animal cap or DMZ explants were imaged on an Olympus FV1000 with a 20x water immersion objective or a Zeiss LSM 900 equipped with Airyscan2 and a 20x air objective. Images were imported into ImageJ (NIH). Images from at least three different embryos collected on different days were analyzed per injection group.</p>
<p>The relative protein level between the plasma membrane and cytoplasm was quantified by comparing the fluorescent intensity. Briefly, regions corresponding to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm were defined, and the average fluorescence intensity within each region was measured using ImageJ. The ratio of plasma membrane to cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity was then calculated.</p>
<p>Protein enrichment pattern within clusters was analyzed using ImageJ. Briefly, the fluorescence intensity of each pixel along a defined cluster was measured. To account for differences in cluster size, pixels were sequentially numbered from one end of the cluster to the other. The total pixel count for each cluster was normalized to 100, and each pixel was assigned a relative position expressed as a percentile. Similarly, fluorescence intensity was normalized by setting the highest pixel intensity within each cluster to 100, and expressing all other pixel intensities as percentiles of that maximum. A scatter plot was generated with the x-axis representing the relative position and the y-axis representing the normalized fluorescence intensity of each pixel. The regression curve was then fitted to the data to characterize the distribution pattern of fluorescence intensity across the cluster. 10 clusters from 5-10 embryos were used for statistical analysis.</p>
<p>To analyze Fz7 endocytosis, vitelline membrane of injected embryos was removed at stage 10.5, and embryos were incubated in 0.1X MMR containing 5ug/ml FM4-64FX (Thermo Fisher, Cat# F34653) for 30min at room temperature before dissection in 0.1X MMR.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study addresses mechanisms of feedback inhibition between planar cell polarity protein complexes during convergent extension movements in Xenopus embryos. The authors propose a conceptually new model, in which non-canonical Wnt ligand stimulates transition of Dishevelled from its complex with Vangl to Frizzled, with essential roles of Prickle and Ror in this process. The main observations supporting molecular interactions are interesting and <bold>convincing</bold> but do not directly assess convergent extension, and the immunoprecipitations carried out with overexpressed proteins show subtle effects. With the analysis of cell intercalations supporting the main conclusions, this work would be significant and of broad interest to cell and developmental biologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Planar cell polarity core proteins Frizzled (Fz)/Dishevelled (Dvl) and Van Gogh-like (Vangl)/Prickle (Pk) are localized on opposite sides of the cell and engage in reciprocal repression to modulate cellular polarity within the plane of static epithelium. In this interesting manuscript, the authors explore how the anterior core proteins (Vangl/Pk) inhibit the posterior core protein (Dvl). The authors propose that Pk assists Vangl2 in sequestering both Dvl2 and Ror2, while Ror2 is essential for Dvl to transition from Vangl to Fz in response to non-canonical Wnt signaling. Nevertheless, there are several major and minor points that affect the strength of the author's proposed model (and are listed below).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the manuscript are found in the very interesting and new concept along with supportive data for a model of how non-canonical Wnt induces Dvl to transition from Vangl to Fz with an opposing role for PK and Vangl2 to suppress Dvl during convergent extension movements. Ror is key player required for the transition and antagonizes Vangl.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weaknesses are in the clarity and resolution of the data that forms the basis of the model. In addition to general whole embryo morphology that is used as evidence for CE defects, two forms of data are presented, co-expression and IP, as well as a strong reliance on IF of exogenously expressed proteins. Thus, it is critical that both forms of evidence be very strong and clear, and this is where there are deficiencies; 1) For vast majority of experiments general morphology and LWR was used as evidence of effects on convergent extension movements rather than keller explants or actual cell movements in the embryo. 2) the microscopy would benefit from super resolution microscopy since in many cases the differences in protein localization are not very pronounced. 3) the IP and Western analysis data often shows very subtle differences, and some cases not apparent.</p>
<p>Major points.</p>
<p>(1) Assessment of CE movement</p>
<p>The authors conducted an analysis of the subcellular localization of PCP core proteins, including Vangl2, Pk, Fz, and Dvl, within animal cap explants (ectodermal explants). The authors primarily used the length-to-width ratio (LWR) to evaluate CE movement as a basis for their model. However, LWR can be influenced by multiple factors and is not sufficient to directly and clearly represent CE defects. While the author showed that Prickle knockdown suppresses animal cap elongation mediated by Activin treatment, they did not test their model using standard assays such as animal cap elongation or dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) Keller explants. Furthermore, although various imaging analyses were performed in Wnt11-overexpressing animal caps and DMZ explants, the Wnt11-overexpressing animal caps did not undergo CE movement. Given that this study focuses on the molecular mechanisms of Vangl2 and Ror2 regulation of Dvl2 during CE, the model should be validated in more appropriate tissues, such as DMZ explants.</p>
<p>(2) Overexpression conditions</p>
<p>Another concern is that most analyses were performed with overexpression conditions. PCP core proteins (Vangl2, Pk, Dvl, and Fz receptors) are known to display polarized subcellular localization in both the neural epithelium and DMZ explants (Ref: PCP and Septins govern the polarized organization of the actin cytoskeleton during convergent extension, Current Biology, 2024). However, in this study, overexpressed PCP core proteins failed to show polarized localization. Previous studies, such as those from the Wallingford lab, typically used 10-30 pg of RNA for PCP core proteins, whereas this study injected 100-500 pg, which is likely excessive and may have created artificial conditions that confound the imaging results.</p>
<p>(3) Subtle and insufficient effects</p>
<p>Several of the reported results show quite modest changes in imaging and immunoprecipitation analyses, which are not sufficient to strongly support the proposed molecular model. For example, most Dvl2 remained localized with Fz7 even under Vangl2 and Pk overexpression (Fig. 4). Similarly, Wnt11 overexpression only slightly reduced the association between Vangl2 and Dvl2 (Sup. Fig. 8), and the Ror2-related experiments also produced only subtle effects (Fig. 8, Sup. Fig. 15).</p>

<p>The authors use Xenopus embryos to study feedback interactions between the planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins in the context of convergence and extension. They show that binding of the cytoplasmic polarity protein Pk2 to Vangl2 is needed for them to synergistically suppress defects in convergence and extension caused by Dvl overexpression. They then examine protein localizations in animal cap cells, and show that Wnt11-induced accumulation of Fzd7, Ror2 and Dvl into plasma membrane patches is disrupted by the functional Vangl2/Pk complex. This disperses Fzd and causes its endocytosis, while Dvl remains at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, Ror2 and Vangl2 tend to have a broader localization within the membrane patches than Fzd7/Dvl, leading to a model in which Ror2 mediates the transfer of Dvl from Vangl2/Pk to Fzd7 in response to Wnt11.</p>
<p>This work uses a mixture of biochemical approaches, phenotypic assays in Xenopus and imaging. The data is carefully quantitated and the imaging is high quality. This is an interesting paper, showing mechanisms by which Vangl2/Pk can functionally antagonize Fzd/Dvl during planar cell polarity.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review)</bold></p>
<p>The weaknesses are in the clarity and resolution of the data that forms the basis of the model. In addition to whole embryo morphology that is used as evidence for convergent extension (CE) defects, two forms of data are presented, co-expression and IP, as well as a strong reliance on IF of exogenously expressed proteins. Thus, it is critical that both forms of evidence be very strong and clear, and this is where there are deficiencies; 1) For vast majority of experiments general morphology and LWR was used as evidence of effects on convergent extension movements rather than Keller explants or actual cell movements in the embryo. 2) The study would benefit from high or super resolution microscopy, since in many cases the differences in protein localization are not very pronounced. 3) The IP and Western analysis data often show subtle differences, and not apparent in some cases. 4) It is not clear how many biological repeats were performed or how and whether statistical analyses were performed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) To more objectively assess the convergent extension phenotypes, we developed a Fiji macro to automatically quantify the LWR in various injected Xenopus embryos, as detailed in the Methods section. We acknowledge that a limitation in the current manuscript is how to link our mechanistic model at the molecular level with the actual cellular behavior during convergent extension, and we plan to perform cell biological studies in the future to elucidate the link;</p>
<p>(2) We have repeated some of the imaging experiments in DMZ explants using a Zeiss LSM 900 confocal equipped with Airyscan2 detector that can increase the resolution to ~100 nm. The new data are in Suppl. Fig. 4, 9, 11, 16;</p>
<p>(3) We have repeated all IP and western blots at least three times and provided quantification and statistical analyses;</p>
<p>(4) We have added the information on biological repeats and statistical analyses in all figures and figure legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The protein localization experiments in animal cap assays are for the most part convincing, but with the caveat that the authors assume that the proteins are acting within the same cell. As Fzd and Vangl2 are thought to localize to opposite cell ends in many contexts, can the authors be sure that the effects they observe are not due to trans interactions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our previous publication, we provided evidence that Vangl is necessary and sufficient to recruit Dvl to the plasma membrane within the same cell (Figure 3 in 10.1093/hmg/ddx095). In a more recent publication ( 10.1038/s41467-025-57658-0 ), we further elucidated a mechanism through which Dvl oligomerization switches its binding from Vangl to Fz, and determined that Dvl binding to Vangl and Fz are differentially mediated by its PDZ and DEP domain, respectively. In the current manuscript, we also performed co-IP experiment under various conditions to demonstrate binding between Dvl and Vangl. We feel that these evidences together provide a strong argument for our model where Vangl2 acts within the same cell to sequester Dvl from Fz.</p>
<p>In regards to the Dvl patches induced by Wnt11 (Fig. 3 and Suppl. Fig. 9), we performed separate injection of EGFP- and mSc-tagged Dvl into adjacent blastomeres, and demonstrated that the Wnt11-induced patches arise from symmetrical accumulation of Dvl at contact of two neighboring cells (Suppl. Fig. 9a-c’). This scenario is different from epithelial PCP where Fz/Dvl and Vangl/Pk are asymmetrically accumulated at the contact between two adjacent cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors propose a model whereby Vangl2 acts as an adaptor between Dvl and Ror, to first prevent ectopic activation of signaling, and then to relay Dvl to Fzd upon Wnt stimulation. This is based on the observation that Ror2 can be co-IPed with Vangl2 but not Dvl; and secondly that the distribution of Ror2 in membrane patches after Wnt11 stimulation is broader than that of Fzd7/Dvl, while Vangl2 localizes to the edges of these patches. The data for both these points is not wholly convincing. The co-IP of Ror2 and Vangl2 is very weak, and the input of Dvl into the same experiment is very low, so any direct interaction could have been missed. Secondly, the broader distribution of Ror2 in membrane patches is very subtle, and further analysis would be needed to firm up this conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) We repeated the co-IP experiment with Myc-tagged Vangl or Dvl. Using the same anti-Myc antibody and experimental condition (including the expression level of Vangl, Dvl and Ror2), we still found that Ror2 could be pulled down by Vangl but not Dvl (Suppl. Fig. 15b). Whereas this data confirms our previous conclusion, we acknowledge that a negative data does not fully exclude the possibility for direct biding between Ror and Dvl.</p>
<p>(2) We re-analyzed the signal intensity of Dvl and Ror in Wnt11-induced patches. By quantifying the intensity ratio between Ror and Dvl along the patches, we found an increase over two folds at the border of the patches (Fig. 7j, bottom panel). We interpret this data to suggest that Ror is accumulated to a higher level than Dvl at the patch borders.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A final caveat to these experiments is that in the animal cap assays, loss of function and gain of function both cause convergence and extension defects, so any genetic interactions need to be treated with caution i.e. two injected factors enhancing a phenotype does not imply they act in the same direction in a pathway, in particular as there are both cis/trans and positive/negative feedbacks between the PCP proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that a difficulty in studying PCP/ non-canonical signaling is that both loss and gain of function of any its components can cause convergence and extension defects. Genetic interactions, especially synergistic interactions, should be interpreted with caution. But we do want to point out that, in a number of case, we were also able to demonstrate epistasis. For instance, we found that Dvl2 over-expression induced CE defects can be rescued by Pk over-expression (Fig. 1e and f), whereas Vangl/ Pk co-injection induced severe CE defects can be reciprocally rescued by Dvl2 over-expression (Fig. 1g). Likewise, we showed that Fz2/ Dvl2 co-injection induced CE defects can be rescued by wild-type Vangl2 but not Vangl2 RH mutant (Suppl. Fig. 6b), and Ror2 can rescue Vangl2 overexpression induced CE defect (Suppl. Fig. 14). Collectively, these functional interaction data consistently demonstrate an antagonism between Dvl/ Fz/ Ror2 and Vangl2/ Pk, which is correlated with our imaging and biochemical studies.</p>

<p>As you can see from the reviews, the referees generally agree that your paper is a potentially valuable contribution to the field. Your observations are important because of the novel model based on the inhibitory feedback regulation between planar cell polarity (PCP) protein complexes. However, the reviewers also stated that the model is only partly supported by data because of insufficient clarity and missing controls in several experiments supporting the proposed model. The paper would be significantly improved if your conclusions are backed up by additional experimentation. Specifically, the referees wanted to see the reproducibility of the results shown in Figures 3, 4, 8, S3, S7, S12.</p>
<p>We hope that you are able to revise the paper along the lines suggested by the referees to increase the impact of your study on the current understanding of PCP signaling mechanisms.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for careful reading of our manuscript and for their constructive critiques and suggestions. We have repeated the animal cap studies in original Figures 3, 4, 8 and S3 with DMZ explants, and the new data are in Supplementary Fig. 9, 11, 16 and 4, respectively. We also repeated the biochemical studies in original Figure S 7and 12, and the new data are in Supplementary Fig. 8 and 15.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major points:(1) The author conducted an analysis of the subcellular localization of PCP core proteins, including Vangl2, Pk, Fz, and Dvl, within animal cap explants (ectodermal explants). To validate the model proposing that 'non-canonical Wnt induces Dvl to transition from Vangl to Fz, while PK inhibits this transition, and they function synergistically with Vangl to suppress Dvl during Convergent Extension (CE),' it is crucial to assess the subcellular localization of PCP core proteins in dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) cells, which are known to undergo CE. Notably, the overexpression of Wnt11 alone, as employed by the author, does not induce animal cap elongation. Therefore, the use of animal cap explants may not be sufficient to substantiate the model during Convergent Extension (CE). Indeed, previous knowledge indicates that Vangl2 and Pk localize to the anterior region in DMZ explants. However, the results presented in this manuscript appear to differ from this established understanding. Consequently, to provide more robust support for the proposed model, it is advisable to replicate the key experiments (Figures 3, 4, 8, and Figure S3) using DMZ explants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We repeated the experiments in Figure 3, 4, 8 and Figure S3 with DMZ explant and the new data are in new Supplementary Fig. 9, 11, 16 and 4, respectively.In regards to “previous knowledge indicates that Vangl2 and Pk localize to the anterior region in DMZ explants”, we are aware Vangl/ Pk localization to the anterior cell cortex in neural epithelium from the studies by the Sokol and Wallingford labs, but are not aware of similar reports in DMZ explants. When we examined the localization of small amount of injected EGFP-mPk2 (0.1 ng mRNA) in DMZ explants, we saw a somewhat uniform distribution on the plasma membrane (Suppl. Fig. 4). In addition, in a related recent publication, we examined endogenous XVangl2 protein localization in activin induced animal cap explants that do undergo CE. What we observed was that whereas low level injected Dvl2 and Fz form clusters on the plasma member, endogenous XVangl2 remains uniformly distributed on the plasma membrane (Suppl. Fig. 3S-Z in 10.1038/s41467-025-57658-0 ). These observations may suggest potential differences of PCP protein localization during neural vs. mesodermal convergence and extension.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The author suggests that 'Vangl2 and Pk together synergistically disrupt Fz7-Dvl2 patches.' As shown in Figure 4 (panels J' to I'), it is evident that the co-expression of Pk and Vangl2 increases Fz7 endocytosis. Nevertheless, a significant amount of Fz7 still co-localizes with Dvl2. To strengthen the author's hypothesis, additional clear assay is required such as Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this valuable advice. Since none of the tagged Fz/ Dvl/ Vangl proteins we had were suitable for FRET, we made proteins tagged with mClover and mRuby2, which were reported as optimized FRET pairs. But in our hands mRuby2 seems to require very long time (~2 days) to mature and become detectable at room temperature, and is not suitable for our Xenopus experiments. We are in the process of establishing a luciferase based NanoBiT system to detect Fz-Dvl and Dvl-Vangl interactions in live cells and cell lysates, and will use it in future studies to investigate their interaction dynamics.</p>
<p>For the current manuscript, we reason that a substantial reduction of Fz7-Dvl2 clusters with Vangl2/ Pk co-injection would still support our idea that Vangl2 and Pk act synergistically to sequester Dvl from Fz to prevent their clustering in response to non-canonical Wnt ligands.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The IP data is less clear and evident. A couple of examples are: a) Fig 2g where the authors report that the Vangl2 R177H variant reduced Vangl2 interaction with Pk and recruitment of Pk to the plasma membrane, but it appears that the variant interacts slightly better than WT Vangl2 with Pk. In Fig. S7a, the authors state that Pk overexpression can indeed significantly reduce Wnt11-induced dissociation of EGFP-Vangl2 and Flag-Dvl2 in the DMZ. However, there is a minimal impact when compared to the Wnt11 absent control. Based on the results presented in Fig S12a the authors indicate that Wnt11 reduces the association between Vangl2 and Dvl2, which can be discerned, but loss of Ror2 does not change this in any obvious way - but the authors indicate it does. In S12b, the authors have suggested that Ror and Dvl do not form a direct binding interaction. However, the interpretation of Figure S12b is not entirely convincing due to several issues. Notably, the expression levels of each protein appear inconsistent, the bands are not sufficiently clear, and there is the detection of three different tag proteins on a single blot. To strengthen the validity of these findings, it is advisable to repeat this experiment with improved quality.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We repeated all the co-IP and western blot analyses pointed out by the reviewer, and performed quantification and statistical analyses.</p>
<p>Fig 2g had a mistake in the labeling and is replaced with new Figure 2g;</p>
<p>Fig. S7a is replaced by new data in Supplementary Figure 8a and b;</p>
<p>Fig. S12a and 12b are replaced by new data in Supplementary Figure 15a, a’ and b, respectively. In 15a and a’, we noticed a consistent decrease of Dvl2-Vangl2 co-IP in Xror2 morphant. The reason for this is not yet clear and will need further study in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points: (1) In all the whole embryo injection assays examining morphology, no Western analysis is performed to show roughly equivalent and appropriate levels of the various proteins are being expressed. Differences will affect the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we did not do western analyses to examine the protein levels in various functional interaction assays, we did examine how co-expression of Vangl2, mPk2 or Dvl2 may impact each other’s protein levels in Supplementary Fig. 2, which did not reveal any significant change when co-injected in different combination.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The author's prior publication (Bimodal regulation of Dishevelled function by Vangl2 during morphogenesis, Hum Mol Genet. 2017) presented clear evidence of Vangl2 overexpression inducing Dvl2 membrane localization. However, Figure S4 in the current manuscript did not provide clear evidence of membrane localization. To strengthen the hypothesis that Vangl2-RH mutant also induces Dvl2 membrane localization, further comprehensive imaging analysis is needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We re-analyzed the imaging data and replaced old Figure S4 with a new Supplementary Fig. 5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Supplementary Figure 9, the authors propose that the overexpression of Vangl2/Pk induces Fz7 endocytosis, as indicated by its co-localization with FM4-64. However, it raises a question: how does the Fz7-GFP protein internalize into the cells without endocytosis, as seen in Figures S9a-c'? To enhance readers' understanding, a discussion addressing this point should be included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think that this might be a technical issue. As detailed in the Method section, we only incubated the embryos transiently with FM4-64 for 30 minutes, and the embryos were subsequently washed and dissected in 0.1X MMR without the dye. Therefore, only the Fz7-GFP protein endocytosed during the 30 minute-incubation would be labeled by FM-64, whereas that endocytosed before or after the incubation would not. Alternatively, the very few Fz7-GFP puncta occasionally observed in the absence of Vangl2/Pk overexpression could be vesicles trafficking to the plasma membrane.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) In all the convergence and extension assays, the authors should report n numbers (i.e. number of animals), what statistical test is used, and what the error bars show. Ideally dot-plots would be used instead of bar charts as they give a better insight into the data distribution. It might be useful to give a section on the statistical analyses used in the M&amp;M, including e.g. any power calculations carried out, as now required by many journals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have follow the advice to use dot-plots for all the quantification analyses in the manuscript. We include in the figure legends the statistical test used and what the error bars show. The number of embryos analyzed were included in each panel in the figures. We also provided more details in the Methods section on how the LWR quantification was carried out.</p>

<p>(2) I think Figure 2g is wrongly labelled? FLAG bands are in all three lanes in the western blot, but not labelled as such in the schematic.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We corrected the schematic labeling in Figure 2g, and thank the reviewer for catching this mistake.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure S7, the authors show that co-IP of Dvl and Vangl2 is reduced by Wnt11 and the effects of Wnt are blocked by Pk. Does Pk have any effect in the absence of Wnt?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We examined the effect of Pk over-expression on Dvl2-Vangl2 co-IP as advised, and did not see a significant impact in the absence of Wnt11 co-injection. The data is included in the new Supplementary Figure 8a. We interpret the data to suggest that “at least under the condition of our co-IP experiment, Pk may not directly impact the steady-state binding between Vangl and Dvl”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 3, the authors show (as published previously) that Wnt11 induces patches of Dvl at the plasma membrane. It would be useful to see Dvl in the absence of Wnt and Vangl2/Dvl in the absence of Wnt.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Dvl is widely known as a cytoplasmic protein and its localization has been published by many labs over the past 20-30 years. In our recent publication (10.1038/s41467-025-57658-0 ), we also re-examined Dvl localization when injected at various dosages. So we did not feel it was necessary to show its localization in the absence of Wnt11 again, but included a reference to our prior publication. In regards to Vangl/Dvl distribution in the absence of Wnt11, the readers can see Suppl. Fig. 5b as an example, in addition to our previous publications referenced in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In the review figures, the difference in Fz7-GFP patch formation in d' and e' (vs e.g. a') is not very clear. Could the images be improved or (better) quantified in some way?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We assume that “review figures” refer to Figure 3 or 4? If so, we felt that Fz7-GFP patch formation was clear in Fig. 3d’, e’ or Fig. 4d’, e’. Nevertheless, we repeated these experiments in DMZ explants as advised by Reviewer 1, and additional examples of Fz7-EGFP patch formation can be seen in the new Suppl. Fig. 9d-f’ and Suppl. Fig. 11d-f’.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure 6d, I'm concerned that the loss of flag-Dvl2 might occur via dephosphorylation in the IP reaction. Also the M&amp;M don't include methodological details about buffers and whether phosphatase inhibitors were used. A compelling control would be anti-FLAG pulldown showing retention of phosphorylation. Also Figure 6f shows a reduced ratio of fast-to-slow migrating bands of Dvl with Vangl2/Pk - unless I have misunderstood, is this ratio the wrong way round?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added co-IP buffer and protease inhibitor information in Methods.</p>
<p>We agree that the concern about dephosphorylation during IP reaction is valid, and that direct pull down of Dvl to show the phosphorylated form is a compelling control. We therefore note that in Suppl. Fig. 8a and 15b, direct pull down of Flag-Dvl or Myc-Dvl (with anti-Flag or anti-Myc) did show the slower migrating, phosphorylated form. Additional examples in which Vangl only co-IP the faster migrating unphosphorylated Dvl include Suppl. Fig. 15a, and in a related paper we published recently (Fig. 3R and R’ in 10.1038/s41467-025-57658-0 ).</p>
<p>Finally, we did wrongly label Figure 6f in the last submission, and the ratio should have been “slow/fast”. We have made the correction, and appreaicte the reviewer for the meticulousness in perusing our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Figure 7, what does Ror2 look like in the absence of Wnt11?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We included new Figure 7a-c to show that without Wnt11 co-injection, Ror2 is uniformly distributed on the plasma membrane.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Also in Figure 7, Ror2 patches are said to be slightly wider than Dvl2 patches &quot;reminiscent of Vangl2&quot; - I wouldn't describe them as being similar. Vangl2 shows a distinct dip in the center of the Dvl patches, Ror2 does not show a dip, and is only (at best) in a slightly wider patch, and I would want to see further examples to be convinced that the localization domain is reproducibly wider. The merge of many samples in 7d may actually be making the distribution harder to see and if the Xror2 and Dvl2 intensities were normalized I'm not sure how different the curves would appear. (i.e. the Xror2 curve looks like a flattened version of the Dvl2 curve).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added an additional panel in the new Figure 7j to compare the intensity ratio of Ror/ Dvl2 along the patches, and this analysis reveals an over two folds increase of the ratio at the border region. This quantification may make a more convincing argument that at the patch border region, Dvl is diminished whereas Ror2 accumulate with Vangl2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) In Figure S12a, the authors suggest Wnt11 induced dissociation of Dvl from Vangl2 (by co-IP), and this is reduced after Ror2 MO. This would be more convincing with replicates and quantitation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have repeated this experiment with Vangl2 pull down and added quantification. The data is in the new Suppl. Fig. 15a.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) In Figure S12b, the authors suggest Ror2 can co-IP Vangl2 but not Dvl. This is not very convincing, as the Dvl input band is very weak, and the Vangl2 co-IP band is very weak.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We repeated the co-IP experiment with Myc-tagged Vangl or Dvl. Using the same anti-Myc antibody and experimental condition (including the expression level of Vangl, Dvl and Ror2), we still found that Ror2 could be pulled down by Vangl but not Dvl (Suppl. Fig. 15b).</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) Quite a lot of interesting observations are in supplemental figures. Normally it might be expected that extra data supporting a conclusion would be in supplemental, but here some of the supplemental data feels like it is more than simply additional evidence. For instance supplemental Figures 2 and 3 feel more than just supplemental (and Supplemental Figure 3 if merged with Figure 2 would make it easier for the reader). Moreover, for example, the description of the results in Figure 2 is punctuated by references to supplemental Figures 4 and 5 that contain key data to support the conclusions, which means the reader has to flick backwards and forwards from place to place in the manuscript to follow the argument. It is of course up to the authors, but in some cases putting supplemental data back into the main figures (for which there is no size or number limit) would increase clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These are excellent points; in the resubmitted manuscript we have a total of 24 data figures, and we used 8 as main figures since we felt that they provide the most relevant and conclusive evidence to our model. We will consult the copy editors at eLife on how to arrange the rest as main vs. supporting figures when requesting publication as version of record.</p>
