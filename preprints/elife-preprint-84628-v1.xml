<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Norepinephrine (NE) neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) project widely throughout the central nervous system, playing critical roles in arousal and mood, as well as various components of cognition including attention, learning, and memory. The LC-NE system is also implicated in multiple neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Importantly, LC-NE neurons are highly sensitive to degeneration in both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Despite the clinical importance of the brain region and the prominent role of LC-NE neurons in a variety of brain and behavioral functions, a detailed molecular characterization of the LC is lacking. Here, we used a combination of spatially-resolved transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to characterize the molecular landscape of the LC region and the transcriptomic profile of LC-NE neurons in the human brain. We provide a freely accessible resource of these data in web-accessible formats.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small bilateral nucleus located in the dorsal pons of the brainstem, which serves as the brain’s primary site for production of the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE). NE-producing neurons in the LC project widely to many regions of the central nervous system to modulate a variety of highly divergent functions including attention, arousal, and mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The LC, translated as “blue spot”, comprises merely 3,000 NE neurons in the rodent (∼1500-1600 each side of the brainstem) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], and estimates in the human LC range from 19,000-46,000 total NE neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Despite its prominent involvement in a number of critical brain functions and its unique capacity to synthesize NE, the LC’s small size and deep positioning within the brainstem has rendered it relatively intractable to a comprehensive cellular, molecular, and physiological characterization.</p>
<p>The LC plays important roles in core behavioral and physiological brain function across the lifespan and in disease. For example, there is strong evidence for age-related cell loss in the LC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], and the LC-NE system is implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The LC is one of the earliest sites of degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), and profound loss of LC-NE neurons is evident with disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Moreover, maintaining the neural density of LC-NE neurons prevents cognitive decline during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. In addition, primary neuropathologies for AD (hyperphosphorylated tau) and PD (alpha-synuclein) can be detected in the LC prior to other brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms rendering LC-NE neurons particularly vulnerable to age-related decline and neurodegeneration are not well-understood. In addition to its role in aging, the LC-NE system plays a critical role in mediating sustained attention, and its dysregulation is associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Of note, the NE reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine is the first non-stimulant medication that is FDA-approved for ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Better understanding the gene expression landscape of the LC and surrounding region and delineating the molecular profile of LC-NE neurons in the human brain could facilitate the ability to target these neurons for disease prevention or manipulate their function for treatment.</p>
<p>The recent development of single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technological platforms provides an opportunity to investigate transcriptome-wide gene expression scale with cellular and spatial resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. SRT has recently been used to characterize transcriptome-wide gene expression within defined neuroanatomy of cortical regions in the postmortem human brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], while snRNA-seq has been used to investigate specialized cell types in a number of postmortem human brain regions including medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens and dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Importantly, snRNA-seq and SRT provide complementary views: snRNA-seq identifies transcriptome-wide gene expression within individual nuclei, while SRT captures transcriptome-wide gene expression in all cellular compartments (including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell processes) while retaining the spatial coordinates of these measurements. While not all SRT platforms achieve single-cell resolution, depending on the technological platform and tissue cell density, spatial gene expression has been resolved at, for example, ∼1-10 cells per spatial measurement location with a diameter of 55 μm in the human brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. These platforms have been successfully used in tandem to spatially map single-nucleus gene expression in several regions of both neurotypical and pathological tissues in the human brain including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] and the dopaminergic substantia nigra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>
<p>In this report, we characterize the gene expression signature of the LC and surrounding region at spatial resolution, and identify and characterize a population of NE neurons at single-nucleus resolution in the neurotypical adult human brain. In addition to NE neurons, we identify a population of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) neurons, which have not previously been characterized at the molecular level in human brain samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. We observe expression of cholinergic marker genes within NE neurons, and confirm that this is due to co-expression within individual cells using fluorescent labeling with high-resolution imaging. We compare our findings from the human LC and adjacent region to molecular profiles of LC and peri-LC neurons that were previously characterized in rodents using alternative technological platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], and observe partial conservation of LC-associated genes across these species.</p>

<title>Experimental design and study overview of postmortem human LC</title>
<p>We selected 5 neurotypical adult human brain donors to characterize transcriptome-wide gene expression within the LC at spatial and single-nucleus resolution using the 10x Genomics Visium SRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] and 10x Genomics Chromium snRNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] platforms (see <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold> for donor demographic details). In each tissue sample, the LC was first visually identified by neuroanatomical landmarks and presence of neurons containing the pigment neuromelanin on transverse slabs of the pons (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Prior to SRT and snRNA-seq assays, we ensured that the tissue blocks encompassed the LC by probing for known LC marker genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Specifically, we cut 10 μm cryosections from tissue blocks from each donor and probed for the presence of a pan-neuronal marker gene (<italic>SNAP25</italic>) and two NE neuron-specific marker genes (<italic>TH</italic> and <italic>SLC6A2</italic>) by multiplexed single-molecule fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (smFISH) using RNAscope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). Robust mRNA signal from these markers, visualized as puncta on imaged tissue sections, was used as a quality control measure in all tissue blocks prior to proceeding with inclusion in the study and performing SRT and snRNA-seq assays.</p>

</fig>
<p>For tissue blocks included in the study, we cut additional 10 μm tissue sections, which were used for gene expression profiling at spatial resolution using the 10x Genomics Visium SRT platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Fresh-frozen tissue sections were placed onto each of four capture areas per Visium slide, where each capture area contains approximately 5,000 expression spots (spatial measurement locations with diameter 55 μm and 100 μm center-to-center, where transcripts are captured) laid out in a honeycomb pattern. Spatial barcodes unique to each spot are incorporated during reverse transcription, thus allowing the spatial coordinates of the gene expression measurements to be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Visium slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), followed by high-resolution acquisition of histology images prior to on-slide cDNA synthesis, completion of the Visium assay, and sequencing. For our study, 10 μm tissue sections from the LC-containing tissue blocks were collected from the 5 brain donors, with assays completed on 2-4 tissue sections per donor. Given the small size of the LC compared to the area of the array, tissue blocks were scored to fit 2-3 tissue sections from the same donor onto a single capture area to maximize the use of the Visium slides, resulting in a total of <italic>N</italic>=9 Visium capture areas (hereafter referred to as samples).</p>
<p>For 3 of the 5 donors, we cut additional 100 μm sections from the same tissue blocks to profile transcriptome-wide gene expression at single-nucleus resolution with the 10x Genomics Chromium single cell 3’ gene expression platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Prior to collecting tissue sections, the tissue blocks were scored to enrich for NE neuron-containing regions. Neuronal enrichment was employed with fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting (FANS) prior to library preparation to enhance capture of neuronal population diversity, and snRNA-seq assays were subsequently completed. <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold> provides a summary of SRT and snRNA-seq sample information and demographic characteristics of the donors.</p>

<title>Spatial gene expression in the human LC</title>
<p>After applying the 10x Genomics Visium SRT platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], we executed several analyses to characterize transcriptome-wide gene expression at spatial resolution within the human LC. First, we manually annotated spots within regions identified as containing LC-NE neurons, based on pigmentation, cell size, and morphology from the H&amp;E stained histology images (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref></bold>). Next, we performed additional sample-level quality control (QC) on the initial <italic>N</italic>=9 Visium capture areas (hereafter referred to as samples) by visualizing expression of two NE neuron-specific marker genes (<italic>TH</italic> and <italic>SLC6A2</italic>) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>), which identified one sample (Br5459_LC_round2) without clear expression of these markers (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A-B</xref></bold>). This sample was excluded from subsequent analyses, leaving <italic>N</italic>=8 samples from 4 out of the 5 donors. For the <italic>N</italic>=8 Visium samples, the annotated regions were highly enriched in the expression of the NE neuron marker genes (<italic>TH</italic> and <italic>SLC6A2</italic>) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref></bold>), confirming that these samples captured dense regions of LC-NE neurons within the annotated regions. We performed spot-level QC to remove low-quality spots based on QC metrics previously applied to SRT data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] (<bold>Methods</bold>). Due to the large differences in read depth between samples (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>, Supplementary Table 1, Methods</bold>), we performed spot-level QC independently within each sample. After filtering low-expressed genes (<bold>Methods</bold>), this resulted in a total of 12,827 genes and 20,380 spots across the <italic>N</italic>=8 samples used for downstream analyses (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To investigate whether the LC regions could be annotated in a data-driven manner, we applied a spatially-aware unsupervised clustering algorithm (BayesSpace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]) after applying a batch integration tool (Harmony [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]) to remove sample-specific technical variation in the molecular measurements (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref></bold>). The spatially-aware clustering using <italic>k</italic>=5 clusters identified one cluster that overlapped with the manually annotated LC regions in several samples. However, the proportion of overlapping spots between the manually annotated LC region and this data-driven cluster (cluster 4, colored red in <bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref></bold>) was relatively low and varied across samples. We quantitatively evaluated the clustering performance by calculating the precision, recall, F1 score, and adjusted Rand index (ARI) for this cluster in each sample (see <bold>Methods</bold> for definitions). We found that while precision was &gt;0.8 in 3 out of 8 samples, recall was &lt;0.4 in all samples, the F1 score was &lt;0.6 in all samples, and the ARI was &lt;0.5 in all samples (<bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref></bold>). Therefore, we judged that the data-driven spatial domains identified from BayesSpace were not sufficiently reliable to use for the downstream analyses, and instead proceeded with the histology-driven manual annotations for all further analyses. In addition, we note that using the manual annotations avoids potential issues due to inflated false discoveries resulting from circularity when performing differential gene expression testing between sets of cells or spots defined by unsupervised clustering, when the same genes are used for both clustering and differential testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Next, in addition to the manually annotated LC regions, we also manually annotated a set of individual spots that overlapped with NE neuron cell bodies identified within the LC regions, based on pigmentation, cell size, and morphology from the H&amp;E histology images (<bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref></bold>). However, we observed relatively low overlap between spots with expression of NE neuron marker genes and this second set of annotated individual spots. For example, out of 706 annotated spots, only 331 spots had &gt;=2 observed UMI counts of <italic>TH</italic> (<bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref></bold>). We hypothesize that this may be due to technical factors including sampling variability in the gene expression measurements, partial overlap between spots and cell bodies, potential diffusion of mRNA molecules between spots, as well as biological variability in the expression of these marker genes. Therefore, we instead used the LC region-level manual annotations for all further analyses.</p>
<p>Next, to identify expressed genes associated with the LC regions, we performed differential expression (DE) testing between the manually annotated LC and non-LC regions by pseudobulking spots, defined as aggregating UMI counts from the combined spots within the annotated LC and non-LC regions in each sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. This analysis identified 32 highly significant genes at a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 10<sup>−3</sup> and expression fold-change (FC) threshold of 3 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7A</xref></bold>). This includes known NE neuron marker genes including <italic>DBH</italic> (the top-ranked gene by FDR within this set), <italic>SLC6A2</italic> (ranked 6th), <italic>TH</italic> (ranked 7th), and <italic>SLC18A2</italic> (ranked 14th). Out of the 32 genes, 31 were elevated in expression within the LC regions, while one (<italic>MCM5</italic>) was depleted. The set includes one long noncoding RNA (<italic>LINC00682</italic>), while the remaining 31 genes are protein-coding genes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>). Alternatively, using standard significance thresholds of FDR &lt; 0.05 and expression FC &gt; 2, we identified a total of 437 statistically significant genes (<bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>).</p>
<p>As a second approach to identify genes associated with LC-NE neurons in an unsupervised manner, we applied a method to identify spatially variable genes (SVGs), nnSVG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. This method ranks genes in terms of the strength in the spatial correlation in their expression patterns across the tissue areas. We ran nnSVG within each contiguous tissue area containing an annotated LC region for the <italic>N</italic>=8 Visium samples (total 13 tissue areas, where each Visium sample contains 1-3 tissue areas) and combined the lists of top-ranked SVGs for the multiple tissue areas by averaging the ranks per gene. In this analysis, we found that a subset of the top-ranked SVGs (11 out of the top 50) were highly-ranked in samples from only one donor (Br8079), which we determined was due to the inclusion of a section of the choroid plexus adjacent to the LC in these samples (based on expression of choroid plexus marker genes including <italic>CAPS</italic> and <italic>CRLF1</italic>) (<bold><xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8A-C</xref></bold>). In order to focus on LC-associated SVGs that were replicated across samples, we excluded the choroid plexus-associated genes by calculating an overall average ranking of SVGs that were each included within the top 100 SVGs in at least 10 out of the 13 tissue areas, which identified a list of 32 highly-ranked, replicated LC-associated SVGs. These genes included known NE neuron marker genes (<italic>DBH, TH, SLC6A2</italic>, and <italic>SLC18A2</italic>) as well as mitochondrial genes (<bold><xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We also compared the expression of LC-associated genes previously identified in the rodent LC from two separate studies. The first study used translating ribosomal affinity purification sequencing (TRAP-seq) using an <italic>SLC6A2</italic> bacTRAP mouse line to identify gene expression profiles of the translatome of LC neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. The second study used microarrays to assess gene expression patterns from laser-capture microdissection of individual cells in tissue sections of the rat LC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. We converted the lists of rodent LC-associated genes from these studies to human orthologs and calculated average expression for each gene within the manually annotated LC and non-LC regions. A small number of genes from both studies were highly associated with the manually annotated LC regions in the human data, including <italic>DBH, TH</italic>, and <italic>SLC6A2</italic> from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], and <italic>DBH</italic> and <italic>GNAS</italic> from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. However, the majority of the genes from both studies were expressed at low levels in the human data, which may reflect species-specific differences in biological function of these genes as well as differences due to the experimental technologies employed (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-G</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Single-nucleus gene expression of NE neurons in the human LC</title>
<p>To add cellular resolution to our spatial analyses, we characterized gene expression in the human LC and surrounding region at single-nucleus resolution using the 10x Genomics Chromium single cell 3’ gene expression platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] in 3 of the same neurotypical adult donors from the SRT analyses.</p>
<p>Samples were enriched for NE neurons by scoring tissue blocks for the LC region and performing FANS to enhance capture of neurons. After raw data processing, doublet removal using scDblFinder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], and standard QC and filtering, we obtained a total of 20,191 nuclei across the 3 samples (7,957, 3,015, and 9,219 nuclei respectively from donors Br2701, Br6522, and Br8079) (see <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold> for additional details). For nucleus-level QC processing, we used standard QC metrics including the sum of UMI counts and detected genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] (see <bold>Methods</bold> for additional details). We observed an unexpectedly high proportion of mitochondrial reads in nuclei with expression of NE neuron marker genes (<italic>DBH, TH</italic>, and <italic>SLC6A2</italic>), which represented our rare population of interest, and hence we did not remove nuclei based on proportion of mitochondrial reads (<bold><xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 9</xref>-<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We identified NE neuron nuclei in the snRNA-seq data by applying an unsupervised clustering workflow adapted from workflows used for snRNA-seq data in the human brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], using a two-stage clustering algorithm consisting of high-resolution <italic>k</italic>-means and graph-based clustering that provides sensitivity to identify rare cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The unsupervised clustering workflow identified 30 clusters, including clusters representing major neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations, which we labeled based on expression of known marker genes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref></bold>). This included a cluster of NE neurons consisting of 295 nuclei (168, 4, and 123 nuclei from donors Br2701, Br6522, and Br8079, respectively), which we identified based on expression of NE neuron marker genes (<italic>DBH, TH</italic>, and <italic>SLC6A2</italic>). In addition to the NE neuron cluster, we identified clusters representing excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, endothelial and mural cells, macrophages and microglia, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), as well as several clusters with ambiguous expression profiles including pan-neuronal marker genes (<italic>SNAP25</italic> and <italic>SYT1</italic>), which may represent damaged neuronal nuclei (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To validate the unsupervised clustering, we also applied a supervised strategy to identify NE neuron nuclei by simply thresholding on expression of NE neuron marker genes (selecting nuclei with &gt;=1 UMI counts of both <italic>DBH</italic> and <italic>TH</italic>). As described above, we noted a higher than expected proportion of mitochondrial reads in nuclei with expression of <italic>DBH</italic> and <italic>TH</italic>, and did not filter on this parameter during QC processing, in order to retain these nuclei (<bold><xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 10A-B</xref></bold>). This supervised approach identified 332 NE neuron nuclei (173, 4, and 155 nuclei from donors Br2701, Br6522, and Br8079, respectively), including 188 out of the 295 NE neuron nuclei identified by unsupervised clustering (<bold><xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 10C</xref></bold>). We hypothesized that the differences for nuclei that did not agree between the two approaches were due to sampling variability in the snRNA-seq measurements for these two marker genes. To confirm this, we used an alternative method (smFISH RNAscope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]) to assess co-localization of three NE neuron marker genes (<italic>DBH, TH</italic>, and <italic>SLC6A2</italic>) within individual cells on additional tissue sections from one additional independent donor (Br8689). Visualization of high-magnification confocal images demonstrated clear co-localization of these three marker genes within individual cells (<bold><xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11</xref></bold>). Since the unsupervised clustering is based on expression of a large number of genes and is therefore less sensitive to sampling variability for individual genes, we used the unsupervised clustering results for all further downstream analyses.</p>
<p>We performed DE testing between the neuronal clusters and identified 327 statistically significant genes with elevated expression in the NE neuron cluster, compared to all other neuronal clusters captured in this region, at an FDR threshold of 0.05 and FC threshold of 2. These genes include known NE neuron marker genes (<italic>DBH, TH, SLC6A2</italic>, and <italic>SLC18A2</italic>) as well as the 13 protein-coding mitochondrial genes, which are highly expressed in large, metabolically active NE neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 12A</xref></bold>, and <bold>Supplementary Table 4</bold>). Compared to the LC-associated genes identified in the SRT samples, differences are expected since the snRNA-seq data contains measurements from nuclei at single-nucleus resolution, while the SRT samples contain reads from nuclei, cytoplasm, and cell processes from multiple cell populations within the annotated LC regions.</p>
<p>To compare with previous results in rodents, we evaluated the expression of the rodent LC marker genes from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] in the NE neuron cluster compared to all other neuronal clusters in the human snRNA-seq data (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref></bold>). Consistent with the SRT samples, we observed that several genes were conserved across species. However, compared to the SRT samples, we observed relatively higher expression of the conserved genes within the NE neuron cluster, which is expected since the NE neuron cluster contains reads from individual nuclei from this population only.</p>
<p>We note that a recent publication using snRNA-seq in mice found that LC-NE neurons were highly enriched for <italic>Calca, Cartpt, Gal</italic>, and <italic>Calcr</italic> in addition to canonical NE neuron marker genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. In the human data, we noted significant enrichment of <italic>GAL</italic> and <italic>CARTPT</italic> in DE testing between the manually annotated LC and non-LC regions in the SRT samples (<bold>Supplementary Table 2)</bold>. While visualization of the snRNA-seq clustering suggests that <italic>CARTPT</italic> is expressed in the NE neuron cluster in the snRNA-seq data (<bold><xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>)</bold>, it was not identified as statistically significant in the DE testing between the NE cluster compared to all other neuronal clusters (<bold>Supplementary Table 4</bold>).

<title>Identification of 5-HT neurons and diversity of inhibitory neuron subpopulations in single-nucleus data</title>
<p>In addition to NE neurons, we identified a cluster of likely 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) neurons in the unsupervised clustering analyses of the snRNA-seq data (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref></bold>) based on expression of 5-HT neuron marker genes (<italic>TPH2</italic> and <italic>SLC6A4</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. This cluster consisted of 186 nuclei (145, 28, and 13 nuclei from donors Br2701, Br6522, and Br8079, respectively). DE testing between the neuronal clusters identified 361 statistically significant genes with elevated expression in the 5-HT neuron cluster, compared to all other neuronal clusters captured in this region, at an FDR threshold of 0.05 and FC threshold of 2. These genes included the 5-HT neuron marker genes <italic>TPH2</italic> and <italic>SLC6A4</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 12B</xref></bold>, and <bold>Supplementary Table 5</bold>). To investigate the spatial distribution of this population, we visualized the spatial expression of the 5-HT neuron marker genes <italic>TPH2</italic> and <italic>SLC6A4</italic> in the <italic>N</italic>=9 initial Visium samples, which showed that this population was distributed across both the LC and non-LC regions (<bold><xref rid="figS14" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 14A-B</xref></bold>). Similarly, we did not observe significant spatial enrichment of <italic>TPH2</italic> and <italic>SLC6A4</italic> expression within the manually annotated LC regions (<bold><xref rid="figS14" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 14C</xref></bold>). To further confirm this finding, we applied RNAscope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] to visualize expression of an NE neuron marker gene (<italic>TH</italic>) and 5-HT neuron marker genes (<italic>TPH2</italic> and <italic>SLC6A4</italic>) within additional tissue sections from donor Br6522, which demonstrated that the NE and 5-HT marker genes were expressed within distinct cells and these neuronal populations were not localized within the same regions (<bold><xref rid="figS15" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 15</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We also investigated the diversity of inhibitory neuronal subpopulations within the snRNA-seq data from the human LC and surrounding region by applying a secondary round of unsupervised clustering to the inhibitory neuron nuclei identified in the first round of clustering. This identified 14 clusters representing inhibitory neuronal subpopulations, which varied in their expression of several inhibitory neuronal marker genes including <italic>CALB1, CALB2, TAC1, CNR1</italic>, and <italic>VIP</italic> (additional marker genes shown in <bold><xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 13</xref>, <xref rid="figS16" ref-type="fig">16</xref></bold>). In addition, similar to recently published results from mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], we found that expression of neuropeptides <italic>PNOC, TAC1</italic>, and <italic>PENK</italic> varied across the individual inhibitory neuronal populations (<bold><xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>In order to integrate the single-nucleus and spatial data, we also applied a spot-level deconvolution algorithm, cell2location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], to map the spatial coordinates of NE and 5-HT neurons within the Visium samples. This algorithm integrates the snRNA-seq and SRT data by estimating the cell abundance of the snRNA-seq populations, which are used as reference populations at cellular resolution, at each spatial location (spot) in the Visium samples. This successfully mapped the NE neuron population from the snRNA-seq data to the manually annotated LC regions in the Visium samples (<bold><xref rid="figS17" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 17A</xref></bold>). Similarly, for the 5-HT neurons, this population was mapped to the regions where this population was previously identified based on expression of marker genes (<bold><xref rid="figS17" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 17B</xref></bold>). However, the estimated absolute cell abundance of these neuronal populations per spot was higher than expected, which may be due to their relatively large size and high transcriptional activity, especially for NE neurons, compared to other neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Due to the small size and inaccessibility of the LC within the brainstem, this region has been relatively understudied in the human brain, despite its involvement in numerous functions and disease mechanisms. Our dataset provides the first transcriptome-wide characterization of the gene expression landscape of the human locus coeruleus (LC) using spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq). Analysis of these data identified a population of norepinephrine (NE) neurons as well as a population of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) neurons, and spatially localized them within the LC and surrounding region. We evaluated expression of previously known marker genes for these populations and identified novel sets of significant differentially expressed (DE) genes, and assessed how their expression varies in space across the neuroanatomy of the region. We compared our findings from the human LC to molecular profiles of LC and peri-LC neurons that were previously characterized in rodents using alternative technological platforms, which confirmed partial conservation of LC-associated genes across these species. Finally, we validated our results using smFISH RNAscope to assess co-localization of marker genes on independent tissue sections.</p>
<p>Identifying genes whose expression is enriched in NE neurons is important because the LC-NE system is implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], and prominent loss of NE cells in the LC occurs in neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Unbiased analysis of the snRNA-seq and SRT data identified a number of genes that are enriched in the human LC region and in LC-NE neurons themselves. As expected, these analyses validated enrichment of genes involved in NE synthesis and packaging (<italic>TH, SLC18A2, DBH</italic>) as well as NE reuptake (<italic>SLC6A2</italic>). We also noted expression selectively in LC-NE neurons of a number of genes whose expression is altered in animal models or in human disease in the LC (<italic>SSTR2, PHOX2A, PHOX2A</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. We identified LC enrichment of a number of genes that have been associated at the cellular level with apoptosis, cell loss, or pathology in the context of neurodegeneration (<italic>RND3, P2RY1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. We also noted enrichment of <italic>NT5DC2</italic> in LC, a gene which has been associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and regulates catecholamine synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Localization of these genes to the LC in humans, and LC-NE neurons in particular, may provide important biological insights about physiological function of these neurons and provide context about underlying mechanistic links between these genes and disease risk. Future work using the transcriptome-wide molecular expression profiles of NE neurons at single-nucleus resolution and the LC region at spatial resolution generated here could investigate associations with individual genes and gene sets from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for these disorders as well as genes more generally associated with aging-related processes.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. The SRT data using the 10x Genomics Visium platform captures around 1-10 cells per measurement location in the human brain, and future studies could apply a higher-resolution platform to characterize expression at single-cell or sub-cellular spatial resolution. In the single-nucleus data, we identified a relatively small number of NE neurons, which may be related to technical factors that affect the recovery of this population due to their relatively large size and fragility. These technical factors may have also contributed to the unexpectedly high proportion of mitochondrial reads that we observed in NE neurons in the snRNA-seq data. While mitochondrial reads are not expected in the nuclear compartment, recent studies reported contamination of nuclear preparations in snRNA-seq data with ambient mRNAs from abundant cellular transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Given the relatively elevated energy demand and increased metabolic activity of NE neurons, higher than expected mitochondrial contamination in the nuclear preparation of LC tissue may be plausible. Because NE neurons were the population of highest interest to profile in this dataset, we opted not to perform QC filtering on the proportion of mitochondrial reads, in order to retain this population. Further optimizing technical procedures for cell sorting and cryosectioning to avoid cellular damage, as well as for straining for large cells, could enhance recovery of this population for future, larger-scale snRNA-seq studies in this brain region.</p>
<p>Since the identification of 5-HT neurons in the single-nucleus data was an unexpected finding, the experimental procedures were not designed to optimally recover this population, and the precise anatomical origin of the 5-HT neurons recovered in this dataset is not entirely clear. It is possible that these cells were close to the borders of the LC dissections, residing within the dorsal raphe nucleus, which is neuroanatomically adjacent to the LC. Supporting this hypothesis, RNAscope data in <bold><xref rid="figS15" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 15</xref></bold> from an independent tissue section shows that <italic>TPH2</italic> and <italic>SLC6A4</italic> expression appears to be distinct from the LC region containing a high density of NE cells. However, there is some evidence for expression of serotonergic markers within the LC region in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>], and our SRT data does support this possibility in the human brain, although further characterization is needed. Comprehensively understanding the full molecular diversity of 5-HT neurons in the human brain would require dissections that systematically sample across the extent of the dorsal raphe nucleus. Similarly, the identification of cholinergic marker gene expression, particularly the robust expression of <italic>SLC5A7</italic> within NE neurons, was unexpected. While previous studies have identified small populations of cholinergic interneurons within or adjacent to the LC in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], analysis of our data did not classify any of the other neuronal populations as cholinergic per se.</p>
<p>However, both the SRT and RNAscope data (<bold><xref rid="figS18" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 18</xref></bold>) supports the hypothesis that expression of cholinergic markers occurs in NE cells themselves, as well as in sparse populations of cholinergic neurons adjacent to the LC region that do not express NE marker genes. We note that our snRNA-seq data may be underpowered to fully identify and classify these sparse populations, and future experiments designed to specifically investigate this finding in more detail could lead to a better understanding of cholinergic signaling within the LC of the human brain. Similarly, our snRNA-seq may be underpowered to perform gene set enrichment studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>] to identify whether the NE and 5-HT neurons harbor aggregated genetic risk for psychiatric disorders, but these data could be aggregated with future snRNA-seq data generated from the LC to address this question. To facilitate further exploration of these data, we provide a freely accessible data resource that includes the snRNA-seq and SRT data in both web-based and R-based formats, as well as reproducible code for the computational analysis workflows for the snRNA-seq and SRT data.</p>

<title>Postmortem human brain tissue samples for RNAscope, SRT, and snRNA-seq assays</title>
<p>Brain donations in the Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD) Human Brain Repository were collected from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of the State of Maryland under the Maryland Department of Health’s IRB protocol #12-24, and from the Western Michigan University Homer Stryker MD School of Medicine, Department of Pathology, and the Department of Pathology, University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, both under WCG IRB protocol #20111080. Clinical characterization, diagnoses, and macro- and microscopic neuropathological examinations were performed on all samples using a standardized paradigm, and subjects with evidence of macro- or microscopic neuropathology were excluded. Details of tissue acquisition, handling, processing, dissection, clinical characterization, diagnoses, neuropathological examinations, RNA extraction, and quality control measures have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. We obtained tissue blocks from 5 male neurotypical brain donors of European ancestry. To select tissue blocks for study inclusion, we identified the LC in transverse slabs of the pons from fresh-frozen human brain. The LC was identified through visual inspection of the slab, based on neuroanatomical landmarks and the presence of neuromelanin pigmentation. For each donor, a tissue block was dissected from the dorsal aspect of the pons, centered around the LC, using a dental drill. The tissue block was taken at the level of the motor trigeminal nucleus and superior cerebellar peduncle. Tissue blocks were kept at -80 °C until sectioning for experiments. We cut 10 μm tissue sections for performing SRT assays using the 10x Genomics Visium SRT platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. High-resolution images of the H&amp;E stained histology were acquired prior to on-slide cDNA synthesis and completing the Visium assays. Assays were performed on 2-4 tissue sections collected from each of the 5 donors, and the tissue blocks were scored to fit 2-3 tissue sections from the same donor onto a single Visium capture area to maximize the use of the Visium slides. This resulted in a total of <italic>N</italic>=9 Visium capture areas (hereafter referred to as samples) in the SRT dataset. For 3 of the 5 donors, we cut additional 100 μm cryosections for snRNA-seq assays using the 10x Genomics Chromium snRNA-seq platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold> provides information on brain donor demographics as well as sample information for the SRT and snRNA-seq datasets.</p>

<title>Multiplexed smFISH using RNAscope</title>
<p>For RNAscope experiments, tissue blocks were sectioned at 10 μm and single-molecule fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization assays were performed with RNAscope technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] using the Fluorescent Multiplex Kit v.2 and 4-plex Ancillary Kit (catalog no. 323100, 323120 ACD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 10 μm tissue sections (2-4 sections per donor) were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin solution (catalog no. HT501128, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at room temperature, series dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol (50%, 70%, 100%, and 100%), pretreated with hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at room temperature and treated with protease IV for 30 min. For QC experiments to confirm LC inclusion in the tissue block (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold> showing example for additional independent donor Br8689), tissue sections were incubated with 3 different probes (2 LC-NE neuron markers and one pan-neuronal marker): <italic>SLC6A2</italic> (catalog no. 526801-C1, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) encoding the norepinephrine transporter, <italic>TH</italic> (catalog no. 441651-C2, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) encoding tyrosine hydroxylase, and <italic>SNAP25</italic> (catalog no. 518851-C3, Advanced Cell Diagnostics). To confirm co-expression of LC-NE marker genes within individual cells (<bold><xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11</xref></bold>), we used <italic>SLC6A2</italic> (catalog no. 526801-C1, Advanced Cell Diagnostics), <italic>TH</italic> (catalog no. 441651-C2, Advanced Cell Diagnostics), and <italic>DBH</italic> (catalog no. 545791-C3, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) encoding dopamine beta-hydroxylase. To localize serotonergic and cholinergic markers within the LC (<bold><xref rid="figS15" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 15</xref></bold>), we used <italic>TH</italic> (catalog no. 441651-C2, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) encoding tyrosine hydroxylase, <italic>TPH2</italic> (catalog no. 471451-C1, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) encoding tryptophan hydroxylase 2, <italic>SLC6A4</italic> (catalog no. 604741-C3, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) encoding the serotonin transporter, and <italic>SLC5A7</italic> (catalog no. 564671-C4, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) encoding the high-affinity choline transporter. After probe labeling, sections were stored overnight in 4x saline-sodium citrate buffer (catalog no. 10128-690, VWR). After amplification steps (AMP1-3), probes were fluorescently labeled with Opal Dyes 520, 570, and 690 (catalog no. FP1487001KT, FP1488001KT, and FP1497001KT, Akoya Biosciences; 1:500 dilutions for all the dyes) and counter-stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to label cell nuclei. Lambda stacks were acquired in <italic>z</italic>-series using a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope equipped with 20x, 0.8 numerical aperture (NA) and 63x, 1.4 NA objectives, a GaAsP spectral detector, and 405-, 488-, 561- and 633-nm lasers. All lambda stacks were acquired with the same imaging settings and laser power intensities.</p>
<p>After image acquisition, lambda stacks in <italic>z</italic>-series were linearly unmixed using Zen Black (weighted; no autoscale) using reference emission spectral profiles previously created in Zen for the dotdotdot software (git hash v.4e1350b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], stitched, maximum intensity projected, and saved as Carl Zeiss Image (.czi) files.</p>

<title>Visium SRT with H&amp;E staining data generation and sequencing</title>
<p>Tissue blocks were embedded in OCT medium and cryosectioned at 10 μm on a cryostat (Leica Biosystems). Briefly, Visium Gene Expression Slides were cooled inside the cryostat and tissue sections were then adhered to the slides. Tissue sections were fixed with methanol and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) according to manufacturer’s staining and imaging instructions (User guide CG000160 Rev C). Images of the H&amp;E stained slides were acquired using a CS2 slide scanner (Leica Biosystems) equipped with a color camera and a 20x, 0.75 NA objective and saved as a Tagged Image File (.tif). Following H&amp;E staining and acquisition of images, slides were processed for the Visium assay according to manufacturer’s reagent instructions (Visium Gene Expression protocol User guide CG000239, Rev D) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. In brief, the workflow includes permeabilization of the tissue to allow access to mRNA, followed by reverse transcription, removal of cDNA from the slide, and library construction. Tissue permeabilization experiments were conducted on a single LC sample used in the study and an optimal permeabilization time of 18 minutes was identified and used for all sections across donors. Sequencing libraries were quality controlled and then sequenced on the MiSeq, NextSeq, or NovaSeq Illumina platforms. Sequencing details and summary statistics for each sample are reported in <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>.</p>

<title>snRNA-seq data generation and sequencing</title>
<p>Following SRT data collection, three tissue blocks (Br6522, Br8079, and Br2701) were used for snRNA-seq. Prior to tissue collection for snRNA-seq assays, tissue blocks were further scored based on the RNAscope and SRT data to enrich tissue collection to the localized site of LC-NE neurons. After scoring the tissue blocks, samples were sectioned at 100 μm and collected in cryotubes. The sample collected for Br6522 contained 10 sections, weighing 51 mg, and the samples from Br8079 and Br2701 each contained 15 sections, weighing 60.9 mg and 78.9 mg, respectively. These samples were processed following a modified version of the ‘Frankenstein’ nuclei isolation protocol as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Specifically, chilled EZ lysis buffer (MilliporeSigma) was added to the LoBind microcentrifuge tube (Eppendorf) containing cryosections, and the tissue was gently broken up, on ice, via pipetting. This lysate was transferred to a chilled dounce, rinsing the tube with additional EZ lysis buffer. The tissue was then homogenized using part A and B pestles, respectively, for ∼10 strokes, each, and the homogenate was strained through a 70 μm cell strainer. After lysis, the samples were centrifuged at 500 g at 4 °C for 5 min, supernatant was removed, then the sample was resuspended in EZ lysis buffer. Following a 5 min incubation, samples were centrifuged again. After supernatant removal, wash/resuspension buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, and 0.2 U/uL RNasin), was gently added to the pellet for buffer interchange. After a 5 min incubation, each pellet was again washed, resuspended and centrifuged three times.</p>
<p>For staining, each pellet was resuspended in a wash/resuspension buffer with 3% BSA, and stained with AF488-conjugated anti-NeuN antibody (MiliporeSigma, catalog no. MAB377X), for 30 min on ice with frequent, gentle mixing. After incubation, these samples were washed with 1 mL wash/resuspension buffer, then centrifuged, and after the supernatant was aspirated, the pellet was resuspended in wash/resuspension buffer with propidium iodide (PI), then strained through a 35 μm cell filter attached to a FACS tube. Each sample was then sorted on a Bio-Rad S3e Cell Sorter on ‘Purity’ mode into a 10x Genomics reverse transcription mix, without enzyme. A range of 5637-9000 nuclei were sorted for each sample, aiming for an enrichment of ∼60% singlet, NeuN+ nuclei. Then the 10x Chromium reaction was completed following the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v3.1 (Dual Index) revision A protocol, provided by the manufacturer (10x Genomics) to generate libraries for sequencing. The number of sequencing reads and platform used per sample are shown in <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>.</p>

<title>Analysis of Visium SRT data</title>
<p>This section describes additional details on the computational analyses of the Visium SRT data that are not included in the main text.</p>
<p>Manual alignment of the H&amp;E stained histology images to the expression spot grid was performed using the 10x Genomics Loupe Browser software (v. 5.1.0). The raw sequencing data files (FASTQ files) for the sequenced library samples were processed using the 10x Genomics Space Ranger software (v. 1.3.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] using the human genome reference transcriptome version GRCh38 2020-A (July 7, 2020) provided by 10x Genomics. Sequencing summary statistics for each sample are provided in <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>.</p>
<p>For spot-level QC filtering, we removed outlier spots that were more than 3 median absolute deviations (MADs) above or below the median sum of UMI counts or the median number of detected genes per spot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. We did not use the proportion of mitochondrial reads per spot for spot-level QC filtering, since we observed a high proportion of mitochondrial reads in the NE nuclei in the snRNA-seq data (for more details, see <bold>Results</bold> and <bold><xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9</xref></bold>), so using this QC metric would risk removing the rare population of NE nuclei of interest in the snRNA-seq data. Therefore, for consistency with the snRNA-seq analyses, we did not use the proportion of mitochondrial reads for spot-level QC filtering in the SRT data. Due to the large differences in read depth between samples (e.g. median sum of UMI counts ranged from 118 for sample Br6522_LC_2_round1 to 2,252 for sample Br6522_LC_round3; see <bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold> for additional details), we performed spot-level QC independently within each sample. The spot-level QC filtering identified a total of 287 low-quality spots (1.4% out of 20,667 total spots) from the <italic>N</italic>=8 Visium samples that passed sample-level QC. These spots were removed from subsequent analyses (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref></bold>). For gene-level QC filtering, we removed low-expressed genes with a total of less than 80 UMI counts summed across the <italic>N</italic>=8 Visium samples.</p>
<p>For the evaluation of the spatially-aware clustering with BayesSpace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] to identify the LC regions in a data-driven manner, precision is defined as the proportion of spots in the selected cluster that are from the true annotated LC region, recall is defined as the proportion of spots in the true annotated LC region that are in the selected cluster, F1 score is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall (values ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 representing perfect accuracy), and the adjusted Rand index is defined as the percentage of correct assignments, adjusted for chance (values ranging from 0 for random assignment to 1 for perfect assignment).</p>
<p>For the pseudobulked DE testing, we aggregated the reads within the LC and non-LC regions using the scater package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], and then used the limma package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] to calculate empirical Bayes moderated DE tests.</p>

<title>Analysis of snRNA-seq data</title>
<p>This section describes additional details on the computational analyses of the snRNA-seq data that are not included in the main text.</p>
<p>We aligned sequencing reads using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>] (version 6.1.1, cellranger count, with option --include-introns), using the human genome reference transcriptome version GRCh38 2020-A (July 7, 2020) provided by 10x Genomics. We called nuclei (distinguishing barcodes containing nuclei from empty droplets) using Cell Ranger (“filtered” outputs), which recovered 8,979, 3,220, and 10,585 barcodes for donors Br2701, Br6522, and Br8079, respectively. We applied scDblFinder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] using default parameters to computationally identify and remove doublets, which removed 1,022, 205, and 1,366 barcodes identified as doublets for donors Br2701, Br6522, and Br8079, respectively.</p>
<p>We performed nucleus-level QC processing by defining low-quality nuclei as nuclei with outlier values more than 3 median absolute deviations (MADs) above or below the median sum of UMI counts or the median number of detected genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], which did not identify any low-quality nuclei, so all nuclei were retained. We did not use the proportion of mitochondrial reads for QC processing, since we observed a high proportion of mitochondrial reads in nuclei with expression of NE neuron markers (<italic>DBH</italic> and <italic>TH</italic>) (for more details, see <bold>Results</bold> and <bold><xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 10</xref></bold>). Therefore, QC filtering on the proportion of mitochondrial reads would risk removing the rare population of NE neuron nuclei of interest. We performed gene-level QC filtering by removing low-expressed genes with less than 30 UMI counts summed across all nuclei. After doublet removal and QC processing, we obtained a total of 7,957, 3,015, and 9,219 nuclei from donors Br2701, Br6522, and Br8079, respectively.</p>
<p>For the unsupervised clustering, we used a two-stage clustering algorithm consisting of high-resolution <italic>k</italic>-means and graph-based clustering that provides sensitivity to identify rare cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. For the first round of clustering (results in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>, <xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 13</xref></bold>), we used 2,000 clusters for the <italic>k</italic>-means step, and 10 nearest neighbors and Walktrap clustering for the graph-based step. For the secondary clustering of inhibitory neurons (<bold><xref rid="figS16" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 16</xref></bold>), we used 1,000 clusters for the <italic>k</italic>-means step, and 10 nearest neighbors and Walktrap clustering for the graph-based step. We did not perform any batch integration prior to clustering, since batch integration algorithms may strongly affect rare populations but these algorithms have not yet been independently evaluated on datasets with rare populations (&lt;1% of cells). We calculated highly variable genes, log-transformed normalized counts (logcounts), and performed dimensionality reduction using the scater and scran packages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>].</p>
<p>For the DE testing, we performed pairwise DE testing between all neuronal clusters, using the findMarkers() function from the scran package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. We tested for genes with log<sub>2</sub>-fold-changes (log<sub>2</sub>FC) significantly greater than 1 (lfc = 1, direction = “up”) to identify genes with elevated expression in any of the neuronal clusters compared to all other neuronal clusters.</p>
<p>For the spot-level deconvolution using cell2location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], we used the following parameters for human brain data from the Visium platform: detection_alpha = 20, N_cells_per_location = 3.</p>

<p>This is a <bold>valuable</bold> initial study of cell type and spatially resolved gene expression in and around the locus coeruleus, the primary source of the neuromodulator norepinephrine in the human brain. The data are generated with cutting-edge techniques, and the work lays the foundation for future descriptive and experimental approaches to understand the contribution of the locus coeruleus to healthy brain function and disease. However, due to small sample size and the need for additional confirmatory data, the data only <bold>incompletely</bold> support the main conclusions presented here. With the strengthening of the analyses, this paper, and the associated web application, will be of great interest to neuroscientists working on arousal-based behaviors and neurological and neuropsychiatric phenotypes.</p>

<p>Weber et al. collect locus coeruleus (LC) tissue blocks from 5 neurotypical European men, dissect the dorsal pons around the LC and prepare 2-3 tissue sections from each donor on a slide for 10X spatial transcriptomics. From three of these donors, they also prepared an additional section for 10x single nucleus sequencing. Overall, the results validate well-known marker genes for the LC (e.g. DBH, TH, SLC6A2), and generate a useful resource that lists genes which are enriched in LC neurons in humans, with either of these two techniques. A comparison with publicly available mouse and rat datasets identifies genes that show reliable LC-enrichment across species. Their analyses also support recent rodent studies that have identified subgroups of interneurons in the region surrounding the LC, which show enrichment for different neuropeptides. In addition, the authors claim that some LC neurons co-express cholinergic markers, and that a population of serotonin (5-HT) neurons is located within or near the LC. These last two claims must be taken with great caution, as several technological limitations restrict the interpretation of these results. Overall, there is limited integration between the spatial and single-nucleus sequencing, thus the data does not yet provide a conclusive list of bona fide LC-specific genes. The authors transparently present limitations of their work in the discussion, but some points discussed below warrant further attention.</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>1. snRNAseq:</p>
<p>a. Major concerns with the snRNAseq dataset are A) the low recovery rate of putative LC-neurons in the snRNAseq dataset, B) the fact that the LC neuron cluster is contaminated with mitochondrial RNA, and C) that a large fraction of the nuclei cannot be assigned to a clear cell type (presumably due to contamination or damaged nuclei). The authors chose to enrich for neurons using NeuN antibody staining and FACS. But it is difficult to assess the efficacy of this enrichment without images of the nuclear suspension obtained before FACS, and of the FACS results. As this field is in its infancy, more detail on preliminary experiments would help the reader to understand why the authors processed the tissue the way they did. It would be nice to know whether omitting the FACS procedure might in fact result in higher relative recovery of LC-neurons, or if the authors tried this and discovered other technical issues that prompted them to use FACS.</p>
<p>b. It is unclear what percentage of cells that make up each cluster.</p>
<p>c. The number of subjects used in each analysis was not always clear. Only 3 subjects were used for snRNAseq, and one of them only yielded 4 LC-nuclei. This means the results are essentially based on n=2. The authors report these numbers in the corresponding section, but the first sentence of the results section (and Figure 1C specifically!) create the impression that n=5 for all analyses. Even for spatial transcriptomics, if I understood it correctly, 1 sample had to be excluded (n=4).</p>
<p>1. Spatial transcriptomics:</p>
<p>a. It is not clear to me what the spatial transcriptomics provides beyond what can be shown with snRNAseq, nor how these two sets of results compare to each other. It would be more intuitive to start the story with snRNAseq and then try to provide spatial detail using spatial transcriptomics. The LC is not a homogeneous structure but can be divided into ensembles based on projection specificity. Spatial transcriptomics could - in theory - offer much-needed insights into the spatial variation of mRNA profiles across different ensembles, or as a first step across the spatial (rostral/caudal, ventral/dorsal) extent of the LC. The current analyses, however, cannot address this issue, as the orientation of the LC cannot be deduced from the slices analyzed.</p>
<p>b. Unfortunately, spatial transcriptomics itself is plagued by sampling variability to a point where the RNAscope analyses the authors performed prove more powerful in addressing direct questions about gene expression patterns. Given that the authors compare their results to published datasets from rodent studies, it is surprising that a direct comparison of genes identified with spatial transcriptomics vs snRNAseq is lacking (unless this reviewer missed this comparison). Supplementary Figure 17 seems to be a first step in that direction, but this is not a gene-by-gene comparison of which analysis identifies which LC-enriched genes. Such an analysis should not compare numbers of enriched genes using artificial cutoffs for significance/fold-change, but rather use correlations to get a feeling for which genes appear to be enriched in the LC using both methods. This would result in one list of genes that can serve as a reference point for future work.</p>
<p>c. Maybe the spatial transcriptomics could be useful to look at the peri-LC region, which has generated some excitement in rodent work recently, but remains largely unexplored in humans.</p>
<p>1. The comparison of snRNAseq data to published literature is laudable. Although the authors mention considerable methodological differences between the chosen rodent work and their own analyses, this needs to be further explained. The mouse dataset uses TRAPseq, which looks at translating mRNAs associated with ribosomes, very different from the nuclear RNA pool analyzed in the current work. The rat dataset used single-cell LC laser microdissection followed by microarray analyses, leading to major technical differences in terms of tissue processing and downstream analyses. The authors mention and reference a recent 10x mouse LC dataset (Luskin et al, 2022), however they only pick some neuropeptides from this study for their analysis of interneuron subtypes (Figure S13). Although this is a very interesting part of the manuscript, a more in-depth analysis of these two datasets would be very useful. It would likely allow for a better comparison between mouse and human, given that the technical approach is more similar (albeit without FACS), and Luskin et al have indicated that they are willing to share their data.</p>
<p>2. Statements in the manuscript about the unexpected identification of a 5-HT (serotonin) cell-cluster seem somewhat contradictory. Figure S14 suggests that 5-HT markers are expressed in the LC-regions just as much as anywhere else, but the RNAscope image in Figure S15 suggests spatial separation between these two populations. And Figure S17 again suggests almost perfect overlap between the LC and 5HT clusters. Maybe I misunderstood, in which case the authors should better clarify/explain these results.</p>

<p>The data generated for this paper provides an important resource for the neuroscience community. The locus coeruleus (LC) is the known seed of noradrenergic cells in the brain. Due to its location and size, it remains scarcely profiled in humans. Despite the physically minute structure containing these cells, its impact is wide-reaching due to the known neuromodulatory function of norepinephrine (NE) in processes like attention and mood. As such, profiling NE cells has important implications for most neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. This paper generates transcriptomic profiles that are not only cell-specific but which also maintain their spatial context, providing the field with a map for the cells within the region.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Using spatial transcriptomics in a morphologically distinct region is a very attractive way to generate a map. Overlaying macroscopic information, i.e. a region with greater pigmentation, with its corresponding molecular profile in an unbiased manner is an extremely powerful way to understand the specific cellular and molecular composition of that brain structure.</p>
<p>The technologies were used with an astute awareness of their limitations, as such, multiple technologies were leveraged to paint a more complete and resolved picture of the cellular composition of the region. For example, the lack of resolution in the spatial transcriptomic platform was compensated by complementary snRNA-seq and single molecule FISH.</p>
<p>This work has been made publicly available and accessible through a user-friendly application such that any interested researcher can investigate the level of expression of their gene of interest within this region.</p>
<p>Two important implications from this work are 1) the potential that the gene regulatory profiles of these cells are only partially conserved across species, humans, and rodents, and 2) that there may be other neuromodulatory cell types within the region that were otherwise not previously localized to the LC</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given that the markers used to identify cells are not as specific as they need to be to definitively qualify the desired cell type, the results may be over-interpreted. Specifically, TH is the primary marker used to qualify cells as noradrenergic, however, TH catalyzes the synthesis of L-DOPA, a precursor to dopamine, which in turn is a precursor for epinephrine and norepinephrine suggesting some of the cells in the region may be dopaminergic and not NE cells. Indeed, there are publications to support the presence of dopaminergic cells in the LC (see Kempadoo et al. 2016, Takeuchi et al., 2016, Devoto et al. 2005). This discrepancy is further highlighted by the apparent lack of overlap per given Visium spots with TH, SCL6A2, or DBH. While the single-nucleus FISH confirms that some of the cells in the region are noradrenergic, others very possibly represent a different catecholamine. As such it is suggested that the nomenclature for the cells be reconsidered.</p>
<p>The authors are unable to successfully implement unsupervised clustering with the spatial data, this greatly reduces the impact of the spatial technology as it implies that the transcriptomic data generated in the study did not have enough resolution to identify individual cell types.</p>
<p>The sample contribution to the results is highly unbalanced, which consequently, may result in ungeneralizable findings in terms of regional cellular composition, limiting the usefulness of the publicly available data.</p>
<p>This study aimed to deeply profile the LC in humans and provide a resource to the community. The combination of data types (snRNA-seq, SRT, smFISH) does in fact represent this resource for the community. However, due to the limitations, of which, some were described in the manuscript, we should be cautious in the use of the data for secondary analysis. For example, some of the cellular annotations may lack precision, the cellular composition also may not reflect the general population, and the presence of unexpected cell types may represent the accidental inclusion of adjacent regions, in this case, serotonergic cells from the Raphe nucleus.</p>
<p>Nonetheless having a well-developed app to query and visualize these data will be an enormous asset to the community especially given the lack of information regarding the region in general.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors present the first comprehensive transcriptome map of the human locus coeruleus using two independent but complementary approaches, spatial transcriptomics and single nucleus RNA sequencing. Several canonical features of locus coeruleus neurons that have been described in rodents were conserved, but potentially important species differences were also identified. This work lays the foundation for future descriptive and experimental approaches to understand the contribution of the locus coeruleus to healthy brain function and disease.</p>
<p>This study has many strengths. It is the first reported comprehensive map of the human LC transcriptome, and uses two independent but complementary approaches (spatial transcriptomics and snRNA-seq). Some of the key findings confirmed what has been described in the rodent LC, as well as some intriguing potential genes and modules identified that may be unique to humans and have the potential to explain LC-related disease states. The main limitations of the study were acknowledged by the authors and include the spatial resolution probably not being at the single cell level and the relatively small number of samples (and questionable quality) for the snRNA-seq data. Overall, the strengths greatly outweigh the limitations. This dataset will be a valuable resource for the neuroscience community, both in terms of methodology development and results that will no doubt enable important comparisons and follow-up studies.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>Overall, the discovery of some cells in the LC region that express serotonergic markers is intriguing. However, no evidence is presented that these neurons actually produce 5-HT.</p>
<p>Concerning the snRNA-seq experiments, it is unclear why only 3 of the 5 donors were used, particularly given the low number of LC-NE nuclear transcriptomes obtained, why those 3 were chosen, and how many 100 um sections were used from each donor. It is also unclear if the 295 nuclei obtained truly representative of the LC population or whether they are just the most &quot;resilient&quot; LC nuclei that survive the process.</p>
<p>The LC displays rostral/caudal and dorsal/ventral differences, including where they project, which functions they regulate, and which parts are vulnerable in neurodegenerative disease (e.g. Loughlin et al., Neuroscience 18:291-306, 1986; Dahl et al., Nat Hum Behav 3:1203-14, 2019; Beardmore et al., J Alzheimer's Dis 83:5-22, 2021; Gilvesy et al., Acta Neuropathol 144:651-76, 2022; Madelung et al., Mov Disord 37:479-89, 2022). It was not clear which part(s) of the LC was captured for the SRT and snRNAseq experiments.</p>
<p>The authors mention that in other human SRT studies, there are typically between 1-10 cells per expression spot. I imagine that this depends heavily on the part of the brain being studied and neuronal density, but it was unclear how many LC cells were contained in each expression spot.</p>
<p>Regarding comparison of human LC-associated genes with rat or mouse LC-associated genes (Fig. 2D-F), the authors speculate that the modest degree of overlap may be due to species differences between rodents and human and/or methodological differences (SRT vs microarray vs TRAP). Was there greater overlap between mouse and rat than between mouse/rat and human? If so, that is evidence for the former. If not, that is evidence for the latter. Also would be useful for more in-depth comparison with snRNA-seq data from mouse LC:  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.30.498327v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.30.498327v1</ext-link>.</p>
<p>The finding of ACHE expression in LC neurons is intriguing, especially in light of work from Susan Greenfield suggesting that ACHE has functions independent of ACH metabolism that contributes to cellular vulnerability in neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p>High mitochondrial reads from snRNA-seq can indicate lower quality. It was not clear why, given the mitochondrial read count, the authors are confident in the snRNA-seq data from presumptive LC-NE neurons.</p>

<p>This is a valuable initial study of cell type and spatially resolved gene expression in and around the locus coeruleus, the primary source of the neuromodulator norepinephrine in the human brain. The data are generated with cutting-edge techniques, and the work lays the foundation for future descriptive and experimental approaches to understand the contribution of the locus coeruleus to healthy brain function and disease. However, due to small sample size and the need for additional confirmatory data, the data only incompletely support the main conclusions presented here. With the strengthening of the analyses, this paper, and the associated web application, will be of great interest to neuroscientists working on arousal-based behaviors and neurological and neuropsychiatric phenotypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the assessment and comments. Overall, the majority of the issues raised by the reviewers relate either directly or indirectly to limitations of the sample size that precluded further optimization of protocols and expansion of the dataset. We fully acknowledge the limited sample size in this dataset and aim to be transparent about the limitations of the study. This is the first report of snRNA-seq and spatially-resolved transcriptomics in the human locus coeruleus (LC). The LC is a very small nucleus, located deep within the brainstem, which is extremely challenging to study due to its small size, difficult to access location, and the very small number of norepinephrine (NE) neurons located within the nucleus, which were of prime interest for this study. We note that this study represents our initial attempt to molecularly and spatially characterize cell types within the human LC. We note that we did not have significant, established funding from extramural sources dedicated to this study, and tissue resources for the LC are difficult to ascertain, contributing to the small sample size in this initial study. We acknowledge that there are limitations in sample size as well as data quality. Findings from this study will be used to inform, improve, and optimize future and ongoing experimental design, as well as technical and analytical workflows for larger-scale studies. As brought up by one of the reviewers, this field is still in its infancy -- pilot experimentation in new brain regions is labor-intensive and these sequencing approaches remain costly. Moreover, due to the small size and difficulties in dissecting, tissue resources from the human brain in this area are a highly limited resource. Hence, notwithstanding limitations, in our view it is important to release the data for community access at this time. Specific responses to the reviewers’ comments are provided point-by-point in the following sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Weber et al. collect locus coeruleus (LC) tissue blocks from 5 neurotypical European men, dissect the dorsal pons around the LC and prepare 2-3 tissue sections from each donor on a slide for 10X spatial transcriptomics. […] The authors transparently present limitations of their work in the discussion, but some points discussed below warrant further attention.</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>1. snRNAseq:</p>
<p>a. Major concerns with the snRNAseq dataset are A) the low recovery rate of putative LC-neurons in the snRNAseq dataset, B) the fact that the LC neuron cluster is contaminated with mitochondrial RNA, and C) that a large fraction of the nuclei cannot be assigned to a clear cell type (presumably due to contamination or damaged nuclei). The authors chose to enrich for neurons using NeuN antibody staining and FACS. But it is difficult to assess the efficacy of this enrichment without images of the nuclear suspension obtained before FACS, and of the FACS results. As this field is in its infancy, more detail on preliminary experiments would help the reader to understand why the authors processed the tissue the way they did. It would be nice to know whether omitting the FACS procedure might in fact result in higher relative recovery of LC-neurons, or if the authors tried this and discovered other technical issues that prompted them to use FACS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these comments. We agree these are valid concerns in assessing the data quality and validity of the findings from the snRNA-seq dataset. We will respond to these concerns here to the best of our ability, but in some cases, we do not have definitive answers since comparison data are not yet available for this region. In particular, we were limited in resources for this initial study -- some of the results of the study and issues that we identified in attempting to molecularly profile cells in the human LC were surprising to us, and we intend to generate additional samples and troubleshoot these issues to improve data quality and increase recovery in future work. However, these experiments are (i) expensive, (ii) time- and labor-intensive, and (iii) the tissue for this region is limited and difficult to ascertain. Given the extremely small size of the LC, the tissue resource is quickly depleted. For this study, we had fixed resources and made best-guess decisions on how to proceed with the experimental design, based on our experience with snRNA-seq in other human brain regions (Tran and Maynard et al. 2021). However, the LC is a unique region, and our experiences with this dataset will guide us to make technical adjustments in future studies. Due to the limitations in the tissue resources and the lack of data currently available to the community, we wanted to share these results immediately while acknowledging the limitations of the study as we work to increase our resource availability to expand molecular and spatial profiling studies in this region of the human brain.</p>
<p>Regarding the reviewer’s concern that our choice to use FANS to enrich for neurons could have potentially led to more damage and contributed to the low recovery rate of LC-NE neurons and the mitochondrial contamination -- we do not have a definitive answer to this question, since we did not perform a direct comparison with non-sorted data. As noted above, our limited tissue resource dictated that we could not do both. We made the decision to enrich for neurons based on our previous experience with identifying relatively rare populations in other brain regions (e.g. nucleus accumbens and amygdala; Tran and Maynard et al. 2021). Based on this previous work, our rationale was that without neuronal enrichment, we could potentially miss the LC-NE population, given the relative scarcity of this neuronal population. The low recovery rate and relatively lower quality / contamination issues may be due to technical issues that lead to LC-NE neurons being more susceptible to damage during nuclear preparation and sorting. We agree that directly comparing to data prepared without NeuN labeling and sorting is reasonable, as the additional perturbations may indeed contribute to cell damage. As mentioned in the discussion, we do not have a definitive answer to the reasons for increased mitochondrial contamination and we suspect that multiple technical factors may contribute -- including the relatively large size and increased fragility of LC-NE neurons. We agree that systematically optimizing the preparation to attempt to increase recovery rate and decrease mitochondrial contamination are important avenues for future work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. It is unclear what percentage of cells that make up each cluster.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will add this information in the clustering heatmaps or as a supplementary plot in a revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c. The number of subjects used in each analysis was not always clear. Only 3 subjects were used for snRNAseq, and one of them only yielded 4 LC-nuclei. This means the results are essentially based on n=2. The authors report these numbers in the corresponding section, but the first sentence of the results section (and Figure 1C specifically!) create the impression that n=5 for all analyses. Even for spatial transcriptomics, if I understood it correctly, 1 sample had to be excluded (n=4).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is correct. We will update the figures and text in a revised version of the manuscript to make this limitation (small sample size) more clear, and to further emphasize that the intention of this study is to provide initial data to help determine next steps and best practices for a larger scale and more comprehensive study on this region, especially given the limited availability of tissue resources and currently limited data resources available for this region.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Spatial transcriptomics:</p>
<p>a. It is not clear to me what the spatial transcriptomics provides beyond what can be shown with snRNAseq, nor how these two sets of results compare to each other. It would be more intuitive to start the story with snRNAseq and then try to provide spatial detail using spatial transcriptomics. The LC is not a homogeneous structure but can be divided into ensembles based on projection specificity. Spatial transcriptomics could - in theory - offer much-needed insights into the spatial variation of mRNA profiles across different ensembles, or as a first step across the spatial (rostral/caudal, ventral/dorsal) extent of the LC. The current analyses, however, cannot address this issue, as the orientation of the LC cannot be deduced from the slices analyzed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the point of the reviewer. However, we structured the manuscript in this format due to our aims of creating a data resource for the community as well as being transparent about the limitations of our study. Our experiments began with the spatial experiments on the tissue blocks because this (i) helped orient ourselves to the region, and (ii) provided guidance for how best to score the tissue blocks for the snRNA-seq experiments to maximize recovery of LC-NE neurons. Therefore, we also decided to present the results in this sequence.</p>
<p>The spatial data also provides more information in that the measurements are from nuclei, cytoplasm, and cell processes (instead of nuclei only). This is one of the main differences / advantages between the platforms at this level of spatial resolution. As noted above, we were also working with a finite tissue resource -- if we ran snRNA-seq first and captured no neurons, the tissue block would be depleted. Due to the logistics / thickness of the required tissue sections for Visium and snRNA-seq respectively, running Visium first allowed us to ensure that we could collect data from both assays.</p>
<p>Regarding a point raised below on why we only ran snRNA-seq on a subset of the donors -- this was due to resource depletion and not enough available tissue remaining on the tissue blocks to run the assay. We have conducted extensive piloting in other brain regions on the amount (mg) of tissue that is needed from various sized cryosections, and the LC is particularly difficult since these are small tissue blocks and the extent of the structure is small. Hence, in some of the subjects, we did not have sufficient tissue available for the snRNA-seq assay.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that spatial studies could, in future work, offer needed and important information about expression profiles across the spatial axes (rostral/caudal, ventral/dorsal) of the LC. Our study provides us with insight about optimizing the dissections for spatial assays, as well as bringing to light a number of technical and logistical issues that we had not initially foreseen. For example, during the course of this study and parallel, ongoing work in other small, challenging brain regions, we have now developed a number of specialized technical and logistical strategies for keeping track of orientation and mounting serial sections from the same tissue block onto a single spatial array, which is extremely technically challenging. We are now well-prepared for addressing these issues in future studies with larger numbers of donors and samples, e.g. spaced serial sections across the extent of the LC to make these types of insights. Due to the rarity of the tissue, limited availability of information in this region, and high expense of conducting these studies, we want to share this initial data with the community immediately. We also note that in addition to the 10x Genomics Visium platform, which lacks cellular and sub-cellular resolution, many new and exciting spatial platforms are entering the market, which may be able to address questions in very small regions such as the LC at higher spatial resolution.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. Unfortunately, spatial transcriptomics itself is plagued by sampling variability to a point where the RNAscope analyses the authors performed prove more powerful in addressing direct questions about gene expression patterns. Given that the authors compare their results to published datasets from rodent studies, it is surprising that a direct comparison of genes identified with spatial transcriptomics vs snRNAseq is lacking (unless this reviewer missed this comparison). Supplementary Figure 17 seems to be a first step in that direction, but this is not a gene-by-gene comparison of which analysis identifies which LC-enriched genes. Such an analysis should not compare numbers of enriched genes using artificial cutoffs for significance/fold-change, but rather use correlations to get a feeling for which genes appear to be enriched in the LC using both methods. This would result in one list of genes that can serve as a reference point for future work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree this is a good suggestion, and will add additional computational analyses to address this point in a revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c. Maybe the spatial transcriptomics could be useful to look at the peri-LC region, which has generated some excitement in rodent work recently, but remains largely unexplored in humans.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree this is an excellent suggestion -- assessing cross-species comparisons related to convergence, especially, of GABAergic cell populations in the human LC is of high interest. We note that these types of extensions are exactly the reason why we have provided the publicly accessible web app (R/Shiny app, which includes the ability to annotate regions). We hope that others will use these apps for specialized topics they are interested in. As discussed above, we note that our initial dissections precluded the ability to keep track of the exact orientation of our tissue sections on the Visium arrays with respect to their location within the brainstem, so definitive localization of this region across subjects is difficult in our current study. However, it is possible, for example, to investigate whether there is a putative peri-LC region that is densely GABAergic that is homologous with the GABAergic peri-LC region in rodents. We also raise attention to a recent preprint by Luskin and Li et al. (2022), who apply snRNA-seq and spatially-resolved transcriptomics to molecularly define both LC and peri-LC cell types in mice -- in a revised version of our manuscript, we will extend our computational analyses of inhibitory neuronal subtypes in our data (Supplementary Figures 13, 16) to directly compare with those identified in this study in more detail. As noted above, we we have now developed a number of specialized technical and logistical strategies for keeping track of orientation of sections from the tissue block onto a single spatial array, and we feel that combined with optimized dissection strategies for this region and the guide of RNAscope for GABAergic markers on serial sections, that annotating the peri-LC region on spatial arrays in future studies will be possible.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The comparison of snRNAseq data to published literature is laudable. Although the authors mention considerable methodological differences between the chosen rodent work and their own analyses, this needs to be further explained. The mouse dataset uses TRAPseq, which looks at translating mRNAs associated with ribosomes, very different from the nuclear RNA pool analyzed in the current work. The rat dataset used single-cell LC laser microdissection followed by microarray analyses, leading to major technical differences in terms of tissue processing and downstream analyses. The authors mention and reference a recent 10x mouse LC dataset (Luskin et al, 2022), however they only pick some neuropeptides from this study for their analysis of interneuron subtypes (Figure S13). Although this is a very interesting part of the manuscript, a more in-depth analysis of these two datasets would be very useful. It would likely allow for a better comparison between mouse and human, given that the technical approach is more similar (albeit without FACS), and Luskin et al have indicated that they are willing to share their data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted above, we plan to extend our comparisons with the dataset from Luskin and Li et al. (2022) in a revised version of the manuscript, which will provide a more in-depth cross-species comparison. In addition, we also note that there are some additional recent studies using TRAPseq of LC-NE neurons in a functional context, i.e. treatment vs. control experiments or in model systems (e.g. Iannitelli et al. 2023), which provide new opportunities for understanding disease context using in-depth cross-species comparisons. By providing our dataset and reproducible code, we will enable others to adapt and extend these types of comparisons (i.e. TRAPseq of LC-NE neurons or LC snRNA-seq following functional manipulations or in the context of disease or behavioral models) in the future.</p>

<p>1. Statements in the manuscript about the unexpected identification of a 5-HT (serotonin) cell-cluster seem somewhat contradictory. Figure S14 suggests that 5-HT markers are expressed in the LC-regions just as much as anywhere else, but the RNAscope image in Figure S15 suggests spatial separation between these two populations. And Figure S17 again suggests almost perfect overlap between the LC and 5HT clusters. Maybe I misunderstood, in which case the authors should better clarify/explain these results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our view, the most likely scenario is that the 5-HT neurons come from contamination from the dorsal raphe nucleus based on spatial separation from the RNAscope images, which we agree are more definitive. As mentioned above, since we do not have definitive documentation for the tissue sections in terms of orientation, it is difficult to say with clarity that the regions are the dorsal raphe and which sub-portion of the dorsal raphe they are. This initial study has now allowed us to optimize and improve our dissection strategy and approaches for retaining documentation of the orientation of the tissue sections from their intact position within the brainstem as they move from cryosection to placement on the array, which will enable us to better annotate regions with definitive anatomical information with respect to the rostral/caudal and dorsal/ventral axes in future experiments. Given that there are reports in the rodent that 5-HT markers have been identified in LC-NE neurons (Iijima 1993; Iijima 1989), and taking into account the technical limitations in our study, we felt that it was premature to definitively conclude in the manuscript that we were sure these signals arose from the dorsal raphe. We will update this language in a revised version of the manuscript to ensure that these limitations are clear (referring to Supplementary Figures S14-15, S17).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The data generated for this paper provides an important resource for the neuroscience community. The locus coeruleus (LC) is the known seed of noradrenergic cells in the brain. Due to its location and size, it remains scarcely profiled in humans. Despite the physically minute structure containing these cells, its impact is wide-reaching due to the known neuromodulatory function of norepinephrine (NE) in processes like attention and mood. As such, profiling NE cells has important implications for most neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. This paper generates transcriptomic profiles that are not only cell-specific but which also maintain their spatial context, providing the field with a map for the cells within the region.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Using spatial transcriptomics in a morphologically distinct region is a very attractive way to generate a map. Overlaying macroscopic information, i.e. a region with greater pigmentation, with its corresponding molecular profile in an unbiased manner is an extremely powerful way to understand the specific cellular and molecular composition of that brain structure.</p>
<p>The technologies were used with an astute awareness of their limitations, as such, multiple technologies were leveraged to paint a more complete and resolved picture of the cellular composition of the region. For example, the lack of resolution in the spatial transcriptomic platform was compensated by complementary snRNA-seq and single molecule FISH.</p>
<p>This work has been made publicly available and accessible through a user-friendly application such that any interested researcher can investigate the level of expression of their gene of interest within this region.</p>
<p>Two important implications from this work are 1) the potential that the gene regulatory profiles of these cells are only partially conserved across species, humans, and rodents, and 2) that there may be other neuromodulatory cell types within the region that were otherwise not previously localized to the LC</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given that the markers used to identify cells are not as specific as they need to be to definitively qualify the desired cell type, the results may be over-interpreted. Specifically, TH is the primary marker used to qualify cells as noradrenergic, however, TH catalyzes the synthesis of L-DOPA, a precursor to dopamine, which in turn is a precursor for epinephrine and norepinephrine suggesting some of the cells in the region may be dopaminergic and not NE cells. Indeed, there are publications to support the presence of dopaminergic cells in the LC (see Kempadoo et al. 2016, Takeuchi et al., 2016, Devoto et al. 2005). This discrepancy is further highlighted by the apparent lack of overlap per given Visium spots with TH, SCL6A2, or DBH. While the single-nucleus FISH confirms that some of the cells in the region are noradrenergic, others very possibly represent a different catecholamine. As such it is suggested that the nomenclature for the cells be reconsidered.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment, and are aware of the reports suggesting the potential presence of dopaminergic cells in the LC. We initially had the same thought as the reviewer when we observed Visium spots in the spatial data with lack of overlap between <italic>TH</italic>, <italic>SLC6A2</italic>, and <italic>DBH</italic> as well as single nuclei in the snRNA-seq data with lack of overlap between <italic>TH</italic>, <italic>SLC6A2</italic>, and <italic>DBH</italic>. This surprising result was exactly why we performed the smFISH/RNAscope experiment with these three marker genes. Given known issues with read depth and coverage in the 10x Genomics assays, we wanted to better understand if this was a technical limitation in the sequencing coverage, or rather a true biological finding. The RNAscope data showed very clearly that nearly every cell body we looked at had co-localization of these three marker genes. We included an image from a single capture array of one tissue section in Supplementary Figure 11, but could, in a revised version of the manuscript, provide additional examples to illustrate how conclusive the images were by visualization. As such, we were quite convinced that the lack of overlap on Visium spots and in single nuclei in the snRNA-seq data was more likely related to technical issues with sequencing coverage, rather than a biological finding. We also note that we checked for the presence of the dopamine transporter, <italic>SLC6A3</italic>, and as can be appreciated in the iSEE web app for the snRNA-seq data or the R/Shiny web app for the Visium data, there is virtually no expression of <italic>SLC6A3</italic> in the dataset, which in our view provides additional evidence against the possibility that there are substantial quantities of dopaminergic cells in this human LC dataset. We will include supplementary plots showing the lack of <italic>SLC6A3</italic> expression in a revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors are unable to successfully implement unsupervised clustering with the spatial data, this greatly reduces the impact of the spatial technology as it implies that the transcriptomic data generated in the study did not have enough resolution to identify individual cell types.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct -- this is a fundamental limitation of the 10x Genomics Visium platform, i.e. the spatial resolution captures multiple cells per spot (e.g. around 1-10 cells per spot in human brain tissue). We note that new spatial platforms now provide cellular resolution (e.g. Vizgen MERSCOPE, 10x Genomics Xenium, 10x Genomics Visium HD), which will help address this in future work. However, many of these cellular-resolution in situ sequencing platforms have the limitation that they do not quantify genome-wide expression, and instead require users to select <italic>a priori</italic> gene panels to investigate. This is a problem if no genome-wide reference datasets are available. Hence, despite the limited spatial resolution of the Visium platform, this dataset is useful precisely for helping investigators choose gene panels for higher-resolution platforms or higher-order smFISH multiplexing.</p>
<p>We also applied spatial clustering (using BayesSpace; Zhao et al. 2021) to attempt to segment the LC regions within the Visium samples in a data-driven manner as an alternative to the manual annotations, which was unsuccessful (and hence we relied on the manually annotated regions for downstream analyses) (Supplementary Figure S5). However, this is a different application of unsupervised clustering, which is separate from the task of identifying cell types.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The sample contribution to the results is highly unbalanced, which consequently, may result in ungeneralizable findings in terms of regional cellular composition, limiting the usefulness of the publicly available data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the limitations of the work due to the small/unbalanced sample sizes. As mentioned above for Reviewer 1, this was an initial study in this region -- results of which will inform our (and hopefully others’) experimental design and approach to molecular profiling in this difficult to access brain region. Overall, this study was executed with finite tissue and financial resources and was intended to uncover limitations and help develop best practices and design workflows for future studies with larger numbers of donors and samples. Given the limited data availability for this brain region, we wanted to make this dataset available for the research community immediately. In addition, we note that making this genome-wide dataset available will help inform targeted gene panel design for higher-resolution platforms (e.g. 10x Genomics Xenium).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This study aimed to deeply profile the LC in humans and provide a resource to the community. The combination of data types (snRNA-seq, SRT, smFISH) does in fact represent this resource for the community. However, due to the limitations, of which, some were described in the manuscript, we should be cautious in the use of the data for secondary analysis. For example, some of the cellular annotations may lack precision, the cellular composition also may not reflect the general population, and the presence of unexpected cell types may represent the accidental inclusion of adjacent regions, in this case, serotonergic cells from the Raphe nucleus.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree, and have attempted to explain these limitations in the manuscript. We will clarify the language regarding the interpretation of the annotated cell populations and unexpected cell types, and the limited sample sizes, in a revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Nonetheless having a well-developed app to query and visualize these data will be an enormous asset to the community especially given the lack of information regarding the region in general.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>[…] This study has many strengths. It is the first reported comprehensive map of the human LC transcriptome, and uses two independent but complementary approaches (spatial transcriptomics and snRNA-seq). Some of the key findings confirmed what has been described in the rodent LC, as well as some intriguing potential genes and modules identified that may be unique to humans and have the potential to explain LC-related disease states. The main limitations of the study were acknowledged by the authors and include the spatial resolution probably not being at the single cell level and the relatively small number of samples (and questionable quality) for the snRNA-seq data. Overall, the strengths greatly outweigh the limitations. This dataset will be a valuable resource for the neuroscience community, both in terms of methodology development and results that will no doubt enable important comparisons and follow-up studies.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>Overall, the discovery of some cells in the LC region that express serotonergic markers is intriguing. However, no evidence is presented that these neurons actually produce 5-HT.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that we did not provide any additional evidence to show that these neurons actually produce 5-HT. As noted above in the response to Reviewer 1, in our view, the most likely explanation is that these neurons are from dorsal raphe contamination on the tissue section. However, due to technical and logistical limitations in this study, we could not definitively say this because we did not clearly track the orientation of the tissue sections, and we did not have remaining tissue sections from all donor tissue blocks to repeat RNAscope experiments. For some of the donors, where we had remaining tissue sections to go back to repeat RNAscope experiments after completion of the snRNA-seq and Visium assays, we could see clear separation of the LC region / LC-NE neuron core from where putative 5-HT neurons were located (Supplementary Figure 15). However, we did not have sufficient tissue resources to map this definitively in all donors, and the orientation and anatomy of each tissue block were not fully annotated.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of clarity, and the fact that there have been reports that LC-NE neurons express serotonergic markers (Iijima 1993; Iijima 1989), we felt that it was premature to definitively declare that these putative 5-HT neurons that we identified were definitively from the raphe. We will clarify the language around this discrepancy in a revised version of the manuscript to ensure that these limitations are clearly described.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Concerning the snRNA-seq experiments, it is unclear why only 3 of the 5 donors were used, particularly given the low number of LC-NE nuclear transcriptomes obtained, why those 3 were chosen, and how many 100 um sections were used from each donor. It is also unclear if the 295 nuclei obtained truly representative of the LC population or whether they are just the most &quot;resilient&quot; LC nuclei that survive the process.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed above for Reviewer 1, the reason we included only 3 of the 5 donors for the snRNA-seq assays was due to the tissue availability on the tissue blocks. We will clarify the language in a revised version of the manuscript to make this limitation more clear. We will also include additional details in the Methods section on the number of 100 μm sections used for each donor (which varied between 10-15, approximating 60-80 mg of tissue).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The LC displays rostral/caudal and dorsal/ventral differences, including where they project, which functions they regulate, and which parts are vulnerable in neurodegenerative disease (e.g. Loughlin et al., Neuroscience 18:291-306, 1986; Dahl et al., Nat Hum Behav 3:1203-14, 2019; Beardmore et al., J Alzheimer's Dis 83:5-22, 2021; Gilvesy et al., Acta Neuropathol 144:651-76, 2022; Madelung et al., Mov Disord 37:479-89, 2022). It was not clear which part(s) of the LC was captured for the SRT and snRNAseq experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed above for Reviewer 1, a limitation of this study was that we did not record the orientation of the anatomy of the tissue sections, precluding our ability to annotate the tissue sections with the rostral/caudal and dorsal/ventral axis labels. We agree with the reviewer that additional spatial studies, in future work, could offer needed and important information about expression profiles across the spatial axes (rostral/caudal, ventral/dorsal) of the LC. Our study provides us with insight about optimizing the dissections for spatial assays, as well as bringing to light a number of technical and logistical issues that we had not initially foreseen. For example, during the course of this study and parallel, ongoing work in other, small, challenging regions, we have now developed a number of specialized technical and logistical strategies for keeping track of orientation and mounting serial sections from the same tissue block onto a single spatial array, which is extremely technically challenging. We are now well-prepared for addressing these issues in future studies with larger numbers of donors and samples in order to make these types of insights.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors mention that in other human SRT studies, there are typically between 1-10 cells per expression spot. I imagine that this depends heavily on the part of the brain being studied and neuronal density, but it was unclear how many LC cells were contained in each expression spot.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that we did not include this information in the manuscript. We attempted to apply a computational method to count nuclei contained in each gene expression spot based on analyzing the histological H&amp;E images (<italic>VistoSeg</italic>; Tippani et al. 2022), which we have developed and previously applied in data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (Maynard and Collado-Torres et al. 2021). Based on the segmentation using this workflow we observe that the counts in this region are similar to what we observed in the DLPFC, i.e., typically between 1-10 LC cells per expression spot, with approximately 1-2 LC-NE neurons (which are characterized by their large size) per expression spot. However, these analyses had several technical issues related to the images themselves, the relatively large size and pigmentation of LC-NE neurons, and parameter settings that had been optimized for different brain regions. We are currently optimizing this analysis workflow for these images to provide more accurate estimates of cell counts per spot to give readers additional context on the number of nuclei per spot in the annotated LC regions and outside the LC regions in a revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Regarding comparison of human LC-associated genes with rat or mouse LC-associated genes (Fig. 2D-F), the authors speculate that the modest degree of overlap may be due to species differences between rodents and human and/or methodological differences (SRT vs microarray vs TRAP). Was there greater overlap between mouse and rat than between mouse/rat and human? If so, that is evidence for the former. If not, that is evidence for the latter. Also would be useful for more in-depth comparison with snRNA-seq data from mouse LC: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.30.498327v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.30.498327v1</ext-link>.</p>

<p>The finding of ACHE expression in LC neurons is intriguing, especially in light of work from Susan Greenfield suggesting that ACHE has functions independent of ACH metabolism that contributes to cellular vulnerability in neurodegenerative disease.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We were very surprised too by the observed expression of <italic>SLC5A7</italic> and <italic>ACHE</italic> in the LC regions (Visium data) and within the LC-NE neuron cluster (snRNA-seq data), coupled with absence of other typical cholinergic marker genes (e.g. <italic>CHAT</italic>, <italic>SLC18A3</italic>), and we do not have a compelling explanation or theory for this. Hence, the work of Susan Greenfield and colleagues suggesting non-cholinergic actions of <italic>ACHE</italic>, particularly in other catecholaminergic neurons (e.g. dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra) is very interesting. We will include references to this work and how it could inform interpretation of this expression in a revised version of the manuscript (Greenfield 1991; Halliday and Greenfield 2012).</p>

<p>High mitochondrial reads from snRNA-seq can indicate lower quality. It was not clear why, given the mitochondrial read count, the authors are confident in the snRNA-seq data from presumptive LC-NE neurons.</p>
