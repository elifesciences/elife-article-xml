<abstract><p>POU4 homologs are involved in the development of sensory cell types across diverse species, including cnidarians, ascidians, and mammals. Whether these developmental regulators are redeployed during adult tissue maintenance and regeneration is an open question in regenerative biology. Here, we investigate the role of the <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> BRN3/POU4 homolog, <italic>Smed-pou4-2</italic> (<italic>pou4-2</italic>), in the regeneration of mechanosensory neurons. We find that <italic>pou4-2</italic> is regulated by the SoxB1 homolog, <italic>soxB1-</italic>2, and is expressed in a distinct population of ciliated sensory cells that detect water flow. Transcriptomic analysis of <italic>pou4-2</italic>-deficient planarians reveals enrichment for conserved genes associated with human auditory and vestibular function, suggesting that planarian rheosensory neurons share molecular features with mammalian inner ear hair cells. Expression of these conserved genes is significantly reduced following RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>pou4-2</italic>. To determine whether these transcriptional changes have functional consequences for mechanosensory neuron identity or behavior, we assessed the impact of <italic>pou4-2</italic> knockdown on sensory function. <italic>pou4-2</italic> RNAi results in impaired mechanosensation in both uninjured and regenerating planarians. Together with the loss of terminal differentiation markers in mechanosensory neurons, these findings identify <italic>Smed-pou4-2</italic> as a key regulator of mechanosensory neuron identity in planarians and support the idea that conserved sensory specification programs are redeployed during adult tissue regeneration.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We have improved the presentation of our work and clarified imprecise statements. We also revised text involving comparisons between regeneration and development because our study did not directly compare these processes in planarians. In this revision, we have addressed the following:
1. We clarified statements comparing regeneration and developmental processes. We included a new supplemental figure with published data showing that the pou4-2 clone dd_Smed_v6_30562_0_1 (cross-referenced as SMED30002016) is expressed during stages corresponding to organ development in Schmidtea mediterranea (https://planosphere.stowers.org/feature/Schmidtea/mediterranea-sexual/transcript/SMED30002016).
2. We reorganized the figures by combining Figures 3 and 4 for improved clarity.
3. We addressed experimental and interpretive concerns regarding the role of atonal in the pou4-2 gene regulatory network.
We carefully edited the manuscript, including clarification of cell quantification methods already presented in the original version.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most animals, including mammals, have a limited capacity for neuronal regeneration. In contrast, organisms like fish and salamanders can effectively regenerate neurons, and some invertebrates are capable of dramatic whole-body regeneration. The freshwater planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> is among a handful of research organisms capable of restoring virtually any lost or damaged tissue and can regenerate entire animals from small body fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Goldstein and Srivastava, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ivankovic et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> possesses a population of adult pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts, which proliferate and differentiate to replace all missing tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baguñà, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Reddien, 2018</xref>). This stem cell population is postulated to include a heterogeneous pluripotent pool poised to acquire lineage-specific cell fates as needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Raz et al., 2021</xref>). One of the extraordinary properties of planarians is the capacity for constant neuronal turnover and regeneration of neuronal cell types, many of which are conserved with vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown and Pearson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Ross et al., 2017</xref>). Despite recent advances, much remains unknown about the molecular basis of neurogenesis and the signals that regulate neuronal turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lee, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies found that <italic>soxB1-2</italic>, a mammalian Sox1/2/3 homolog, regulates the regeneration of ectodermal cell type subsets in planarians, including many uncharacterized sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). One prominent population of <italic>soxB1-</italic>2-regulated sensory cells, organized in a striking dorsal stripe pattern, functions in mechanosensation and is marked by <italic>polycystic kidney disease-like</italic> homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ross et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ross et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In this study, we focused on identifying mechanisms downstream of <italic>soxB1-2</italic> that contribute to the specification of mechanosensory cells in the dorsal ciliated stripe.</p>

<p>POU transcription factor family genes play key roles in the development and function of many neuronal subtypes. To date, dozens of POU genes have been identified in vertebrates and invertebrates, and their roles in the differentiation and survival of diverse neuronal subtypes have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Leyva-Diaz et al., 2020</xref>). In many species, Brn3/POU4 transcription factors play important roles in specifying and maintaining the identities of various cell populations in the developing peripheral sensory nervous system. A notable example is <italic>Nematostella vectensis NvPOU4</italic>, which is required to maintain and differentiate cnidocytes, a population of mechanosensing cells exclusive to the phylum Cnidaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tourniere et al., 2020</xref>). The homologous role of <italic>NvPOU4</italic> in cnidarians suggests that the functional role of <italic>pou4</italic> is ancient and conserved across distantly related phyla. Additionally, <italic>pou4</italic> is part of a proneural regulatory cascade that produces epidermal sensory neurons in <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>; induction of ectopic <italic>pou4</italic> expression in the developing epidermis of <italic>Ciona</italic> larvae converts epidermal cells to sensory neurons, resulting in a striking hyper-ciliated phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In mice, <italic>Pou4f3</italic> is expressed in the inner ear sensory epithelia during embryonic development and is required for the survival of vestibular hair cells of the auditory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Erkman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Xiang et al., 1997</xref>) - its targeted deletion results in impaired hearing and balance. Hair cells of the inner ear are crosslinked by stereocilia on their apical ends that function as mechanosensors, converting vibration-induced mechanical force into signals carried by auditory nerve fibers to the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Goutman et al., 2015</xref>). Although a small number of hair cells differentiate in <italic>Pou4f3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, their failure to form stereociliary bundles leads to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Xiang et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, <italic>Pou4</italic> has conserved roles in the differentiation, maintenance, and survival of ciliated mechanosensory neurons. Unlike birds and fish, mammals lack the ability to regenerate hair cells after they are lost, resulting in permanent deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Edge and Chen, 2008</xref>). Recent studies show that POU4 can be used as a reprogramming co-factor to restore hair cells in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Iyer et al., 2022</xref>). However, whether developmental regulators like <italic>POU4</italic> play similar roles in adult tissue maintenance and regeneration remains to be fully resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Seifert et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>S. mediterranea,</italic> a search for candidate planarian OCT4 homologs, a gatekeeper of pluripotency also known as POU5F1 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zeineddine et al., 2014</xref>), revealed six genes containing a POU-specific domain and a POU-homeodomain, and the two genes most similar to hPOU4F3 were named <italic>Smed-pou4-1</italic> and <italic>Smed-pou4-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Önal et al., 2012b</xref>) (referred to as <italic>pou4-1</italic> and <italic>pou4-2</italic> hereon). <italic>pou4-1</italic> (also referred to as <italic>pou4-like and pou4-like-1</italic>) was identified as downstream of COE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cowles et al., 2014</xref>), a transcription factor required for neurogenesis widely conserved across metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Demilly et al., 2011</xref>), and is responsible for maintaining proper neuronal architecture in the cephalic ganglia as well as photoreceptor pigmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cowles et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, our lab and others observed robust sensory defects in <italic>pou4-2(RNAi)</italic> planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Elliott, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McCubbin, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wang, 2019</xref>). Under normal conditions, <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> worms display a stereotyped behavior by shortening their bodies in response to vibrations and water currents across their dorsal side (rheosensation). We found that <italic>pou4-2(RNAi)</italic> planarians failed to react to this sensory input, suggesting a critical role for <italic>pou4-2</italic> in mechanosensory neuron function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Elliott, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wang, 2019</xref>); however, its role in regenerative neurogenesis is not well understood. Here, we examined the function of <italic>pou4-2</italic> in mechanosensory neuron regeneration.</p>
<p>In this study, we mapped the expression of <italic>pou4-2</italic> and assessed its function through RNAi and RNA-seq. Loss of <italic>pou4-2</italic> expression coincides with loss of mechanosensation, which is not restored in regenerated <italic>pou4-2(RNAi)</italic> planarians. Analysis of the <italic>pou4-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cell gene expression profile uncovered that many genes regulated by Pou4-2 activity are necessary for proper mechanosensory neuron function and are homologs of human genes involved in hair cell function and auditory perception. In many organisms, the proneural <italic>atonal</italic> genes function in the same gene regulatory network as <italic>pou4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Leyva-Diaz et al., 2020</xref>). However, this relationship does not appear to be conserved in planarians. Our findings suggest that <italic>pou4-2</italic> participates in a regulatory cascade involved in the specification of distinct sensory neuron populations. This study demonstrates that <italic>pou4-2</italic> plays a key regulatory role in the differentiation, maintenance, and regeneration of ciliated mechanosensory neurons in planarians.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title><italic>Smed-pou4-2</italic> is expressed in planarian mechanosensory neurons</title>
<p>Our previous work demonstrated a key role for <italic>soxB1-2</italic> in the differentiation and function of sensory neuron subclasses in the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). A subset of <italic>soxB1-</italic>2-regulated genes are abundantly expressed in a discrete pattern called the dorsal and peripheral ciliated stripes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), which contain ciliated sensory neurons involved in detecting water flow (rheosensation). We took a candidate-based approach to gain mechanistic insight into how the sensory stripe cells are specified from a heterogeneous <italic>soxB1-2<sup>+</sup></italic> progenitor pool. POU4 genes are involved in the development of sensory organs detecting mechanical stimulation in divergent organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Manley and Ladher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, we investigated the expression and function of <italic>S. mediterranea pou4</italic> genes. The planarian genome encodes two POU4 homologs, <italic>pou4-1</italic> (also referred to as <italic>pou4</italic>-<italic>like</italic>) and <italic>pou4-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Önal et al., 2012a</xref>). In previous work, we found that <italic>pou4-1</italic> (<italic>pou4-</italic>like) is expressed in the planarian CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cowles et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, analysis of <italic>pou4-2</italic> using whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (WISH) showed expression localized in the dorsal head tip and dorsal and peripheral ciliated stripes of intact planarians (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>), a stereotyped pattern common to rheosensory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, <italic>pou4-2</italic> expression was detected in cells dispersed throughout the body in a subepidermal punctate pattern and in the cephalic ganglia and ventral nerve cords (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Because POU4 genes have been implicated as terminal selectors in diverse organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Leyva-Diaz et al., 2020</xref>), we examined the expression pattern of <italic>pou4-2</italic> in regeneration blastemas to determine whether its activation coincides with late differentiation stages. During the first 24 hours of regeneration, <italic>pou4-2</italic> expression was absent from the blastema. We first detected clear expression on day 3 of regeneration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The patterning of <italic>pou4-2</italic> expression in the blastema at day 3 was less organized and not confined to its normal spatial location, with <italic>pou4-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells sparsely scattered throughout the regeneration blastema. During days 4 and 5, <italic>pou4-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells began to repopulate the stereotypical stripe expression pattern, and by day 7, proper patterning was restored. In planarians, the regeneration blastema is populated by post-mitotic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Reddien, 2018</xref>). The delayed re-establishment of <italic>pou4-2</italic> expression suggests that it is required in the later stages of cell differentiation in regeneration. Interestingly, embryonic expression of <italic>pou4-2</italic> is predominantly detected during Stages 5 to 6, which coincide with organogenesis and nervous system development in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). While the functional role of <italic>pou4-2</italic> in embryogenesis remains unknown, these data suggest that its temporal dynamics are consistent with a role in late-stage differentiation, as observed in adult regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Davies et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>soxB1-2</italic> is expressed in and regulates transcription in dorsal and peripheral ciliated stripe neurons as well as in other neural populations, and the epidermis of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">King et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we searched the existing scRNA-seq data from the entire body and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fincher et al., 2018</xref>) to examine the potential relationship between <italic>soxB1-2</italic> and <italic>pou4-2</italic>. First, we extracted 1427 putative neuronal cells expressing <italic>soxB1-2</italic>. We resolved 19 distinct <italic>soxB1-2</italic><sup>+</sup> neuronal clusters (Supplementary File S1 and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), of which cluster 8 was marked by <italic>pou4-2</italic>. The presence of <italic>synapsin</italic> and <italic>synaptogamin</italic> (neural markers) in cluster 8 indicated that these cells are neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We combed through the dataset to identify genes that are differentially expressed in the <italic>pou4-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cluster (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; Supplementary File S2); highly enriched genes included <italic>pkd1L-</italic>2 and <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic>, which are highly enriched in the planarian rheosensory organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). Because <italic>pkd1L-</italic>2 and <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic> expression requires <italic>soxB1-2</italic> activity, we hypothesized that <italic>soxB1-2</italic> regulates <italic>pou4-2</italic> expression. Thus, we treated planarians with <italic>soxB1-2</italic> or <italic>pou4-2</italic> dsRNA (the RNAi treatment scheme is depicted in Supplemental Figure 2A) and processed them for WISH. We observed a significant reduction in mechanosensory neuron-patterned <italic>pou4-2</italic> expression in <italic>soxB1-2</italic>(<italic>RNAi</italic>) planarians, whereas <italic>pou4-2</italic> expression in the central nervous system remained unaltered (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Conversely, <italic>soxB1-2</italic> expression was downregulated in mechanosensory neuron-patterned areas important for rheosensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). However, other areas enriched with <italic>soxB1-2</italic> expression, such as the auricles - anteriorly-positioned lateral flaps involved in chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almazan et al., 2021</xref>), the pharynx - an organ serving as the entrance and exit to the digestive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ishii, 1962</xref>), and the epidermis, were unaffected by <italic>pou4-2</italic> RNAi. Together, these results support a model in which <italic>soxB1-2</italic> positively regulates <italic>pou4-2</italic> expression specifically in mechanosensory neurons, without affecting <italic>pou4-2</italic> expression in other neural or epidermal populations.</p>

<title><italic>Smed-pou4-2</italic> regulates genes involved in sensory neuron terminal fate</title>
<p>Based on known roles of Pou4 genes, we hypothesized that <italic>pou4-2</italic> is required for sensory neuron differentiation and function. To test our hypothesis, we performed RNAi of <italic>pou4-2</italic> and pinpointed time points wherein the <italic>pou4-2</italic> transcripts were robustly downregulated (not shown) and subsequently performed whole-animal RNA-seq on day 12 of the RNAi knockdown for <italic>pou4-2(RNAi)</italic> and control animals (see Methods). Analysis of the resulting data revealed downregulation of putative <italic>pou4-2</italic> target genes (Supplementary File S3). Because Pou4 genes are predicted to function as transcriptional activators, we focused further analyses on the downregulated gene set. <italic>pou4-2</italic> RNAi RNA-seq uncovered 72 significantly downregulated genes (FC ≥ 1.4, adjusted p-value &lt; 0.1,) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and Supplementary File S3). GO analysis of the <italic>pou4-</italic>2-downregulated gene set revealed significant enrichment in ‘Mechanosensation’ (Supplementary File S4), including previously characterized genes we assessed to have roles in planarian mechanosensory modalities like vibration sensation and rheosensation, such as the polycystic kidney disease gene homologs <italic>pkd1L-2</italic> and <italic>pkd2L-1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ross et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ross et al., 2018</xref>).

<p>The mechanosensory neurons in the rheosensory organ are distinguished by the expression of multiple sensory neural function genes and consist of at least two distinct populations, marked by the expression of terminal markers <italic>polycystic kidney disease 1 like-2</italic> (<italic>pkd1L-</italic>2) and <italic>hemicentin-1-like</italic> (<italic>hmcn-1-L</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). The evolutionarily conserved PKD1L-2 is a cation channel pore component required for mechanosensation and cilia function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Patel, 2015</xref>); <italic>pkd1L-2(RNAi)</italic> planarians exhibit prominent rheosensory defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ross et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic> is an extracellular matrix component involved in anchoring mechanosensory neurons to the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Vogel and Hedgecock, 2001</xref>); no detectable sensory defects are detected in <italic>hmcn-1-L(RNAi)</italic> planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with the scRNA-seq data, we found that a subset of <italic>pou4-2</italic>⁺ cells co-expressed <italic>pkd1L-2</italic> (74.8%) or <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic> (28.4%), representing two distinct mechanosensory neuron subtypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Supplementary File S7). We consistently observed variable expression levels; some cells showed high expression of <italic>pou4-2</italic> and low expression of terminal markers (arrows in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), while others showed lower expression of <italic>pou4-2</italic> but high expression of terminal markers (arrowheads in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), and some had high expression of <italic>pou4-2</italic> and the terminal markers (white dashed box in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We also observed <italic>pou4-2</italic>⁺ cells lacking detectable expression of either <italic>pkd1L-2</italic> or <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic>, which may represent late-stage progenitors that have not yet initiated terminal marker expression. Thus, the variable <italic>pou4-2</italic> and terminal marker expression could be due to <italic>pou4-2</italic> transcripts initially appearing at high levels in differentiating progenitor cells (initially terminal marker negative) to activate transcription of terminal markers and then persisting at lower levels in terminally differentiated cells.</p>
<p>Next, we asked if the function of <italic>pou4-2</italic> is required to maintain and regenerate <italic>pkd1L-2</italic> and <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic> expression in the dorsal and peripheral ciliated stripes. We conducted WISH on intact and regenerated planarians treated with dsRNA over a time course (Supplemental Figure 1A). Like <italic>pou4-2</italic>, in control intact or regenerated planarians, <italic>pkd1L-2</italic> and <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic> were expressed in the head tip, dorsal ciliated stripe, and dorsal and ventral peripheral stripes (controls in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In <italic>pou4-2(RNAi)</italic> animals, expression of both marker genes was strongly reduced, particularly in intact animals. In regenerating animals, expression was detected at lower levels and in scattered patterns. Interestingly, in the regenerates, minimal <italic>pkd1L-2</italic> and <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic> expression was observed in the regeneration blastema. We also detected lower levels of expression of <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic> at scattered locations near peripheral stripes that were unaffected by <italic>pou4-2</italic> RNAi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, dashed red boxes). These results indicate that <italic>pou4-2</italic> is necessary for maintaining <italic>pkd1L-2</italic> and <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic> expression in the most prominent dorsal and peripheral ciliated stripe cell populations. The persistence of <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic> expression in some peripheral cells may reflect partial knockdown efficiency or that <italic>pou4-2</italic> function is not required in all <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic>⁺ cells.</p>
<p>To test whether the population of <italic>pou4-2</italic><sup>+</sup>/terminal marker<sup>-</sup> cells in dorsal ciliated stripe constitutes sensory neuron progenitors that have yet to express terminal markers in support of our hypothesis above, wild-type planarians were X-ray-treated with ∼100 Gy, a dose reported to deplete early progenitors after 24 hours and late progenitors within 7 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>). We performed WISH analysis at 0, 3, 4, 4.5, 5, and 5.5 days post-irradiation (dpi). We quantified <italic>pou4-2</italic>⁺ cells lacking expression of <italic>pkd1L-2</italic> and <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic>, compared to <italic>pou4-2</italic>⁺ cells co-labeled using a single fluorophore mix of <italic>pkd1L-2</italic> and <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic> riboprobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). By 5.5 days post-irradiation (dpi), we noticed an obvious decrease in <italic>pou4-2</italic><sup>+</sup>/terminal marker<sup>-</sup> compared to the number of <italic>pou4-2</italic><sup>+</sup>/terminal marker<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure 4B-C</xref>). The temporal decline in <italic>pou4-2</italic>⁺ cells closely resembled that of <italic>agat-1</italic>⁺ late progenitors, suggesting a similar position within the differentiation trajectory. In contrast, <italic>piwi-1</italic>⁺ neoblasts and <italic>prog-1</italic>⁺ early progenitors were almost entirely depleted by 2–3 days dpi, supporting the idea that <italic>pou4-2</italic> marks a later-stage progenitor population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure 4D</xref>). These data support a model in which <italic>pou4-2</italic> expression is established in late-stage progenitor cells prior to the expression of terminal sensory neuron genes and remains expressed at lower levels to maintain expression of sensory function genes in terminally differentiated mechanosensory neurons.</p>

<title>Expression of <italic>Smed-pou4-2</italic> is required for mechanosensory neuron regeneration and function</title>
<p>Given that <italic>pou4-2</italic> expression is reduced in <italic>soxB1-2(RNAi)</italic> planarians (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) and that <italic>pou4-2(RNAi)</italic> animals show downregulation of mechanosensory and cilia-related genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), we reasoned that a subset of <italic>pou4-2</italic>⁺ cells represents terminally differentiated ciliated sensory neurons. Moreover, the requirement of <italic>soxB1-2</italic> for maintaining ciliated epidermal and sensory neuron populations supports the idea that <italic>pou4-2</italic> functions as a terminal selector in planarians. To assess the role of <italic>pou4-2</italic> in the dorsal and peripheral ciliated stripes, we first immunostained control and RNAi-treated planarians with anti-Acetylated-Tubulin to mark cilia. Compared to the controls, <italic>pou4-2(RNAi)</italic> planarians showed a disruption of the stereotypical banded pattern with decreased cilia labeling along the dorsal ciliated stripe, while ciliated lawns on the dorsal and ventral surfaces remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref>).

<title><italic>Smed-pou4-2</italic> plays a key role in the regulation of sensory system differentiation</title>
<p>The interplay between lineage-specifying transcription factors and their respective gene regulatory networks coordinates precise developmental processes and stem cell fate decisions. POU4 transcription factors are conserved terminal selectors of sensory neuron fate, but the role of <italic>Pou4</italic> has not been extensively characterized in regeneration. This study’s objective was to elucidate the role of <italic>Smed-pou4-2</italic> (<italic>pou4-2</italic>) in planarian sensory neuron regeneration and to identify gene regulatory network components responsible for maintaining mechanosensory neuron function. <italic>pou4-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells include ciliated mechanosensory neurons that allow planarians to detect water currents and vibrations (rheosensation), a function similar to <italic>POU4F3</italic> in hair cells of the mammalian inner ear sensory epithelium responsible for auditory perception and equilibrioception. We showed that <italic>pou4-2</italic> regulates the expression of genes homologous to those involved in stereocilium organization, cell adhesion, and nervous system development in other organisms. Several of these human homologs are implicated in sensorineural hearing loss. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying planarian regeneration and provide insight into the conserved role of POU4 transcription factors in sensory neuron development across divergent species.</p>
<p>Differential expression analysis following <italic>pou4-2</italic> knockdown revealed several genes homologous to those with known roles in mechanosensation in other organisms, including <italic>loxhd-1</italic>, <italic>cdh23</italic>, and <italic>myo7a</italic>. In vertebrate systems, mutations in these genes disrupt mechanosensory function and contribute to hearing loss. For example, a recent study has demonstrated that <italic>loxhd-1</italic> mutation in the inner hair cell does not affect the structural integrity of the hair cell bundle but rather prevents the activation of MET (mechanoelectrical transducer) channels, thereby contributing to progressive hearing loss in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Trouillet et al., 2021</xref>). Other interesting candidates included a planarian homolog of Ephrin receptors, <italic>EphR1,</italic> which was also expressed in <italic>soxB1-2<sup>+</sup>/pou4-2<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons and was downstream of these two transcription factors. This observation highlights the potential for planarians to serve as a discovery platform for conserved regulators of sensory neuron patterning. We discovered that <italic>EphR1</italic> is required for patterning of mechanosensory neurons in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McCubbin, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Warner, 2024</xref>), which led us to examine in detail how Ephrin signaling genes contribute to neural patterning in planarians (unpublished observations). Thus, as we demonstrated with <italic>soxB1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ross et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ross et al., 2018</xref>), planarians are also useful to analyze <italic>pou4-2-</italic>regulated genes and their roles in cell differentiation or mechanosensation. It will be important to perform a comparative analysis of Pou4-regulated genes gleaned from other animals, like sea anemones or vertebrates like birds and fish, which can regenerate hair cells or the lateral line, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tourniere et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). However, we found that our RNA-seq experimental design had limitations in detecting <italic>pou4-2</italic>-regulated transcripts, likely due to the use of systemic RNAi and bulk RNA extraction from whole animals. Before leveraging existing transcriptomic data on Pou4 homologs or hair cell or lateral line regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ku et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tourniere et al., 2020</xref>) for orthologous comparisons in other species to test to what extent the Pou4 gene regulatory network is conserved among these widely divergent animals, we have designed new experiments to enrich for <italic>pou4-2-</italic>expressing planarian tissues and have performed RNA-seq experiments producing a larger differentially expressed gene set (unpublished). In addition, ATAC-seq experiments could be performed to examine how <italic>pou4-2</italic> activity affects chromatin architecture. These future genomic experiments should build upon this work and improve the resolution of the <italic>pou4-2</italic> gene regulatory network implicated in sensory neuron regeneration.</p>
<p><italic>pou4-2</italic> function could encompass additional roles other than the ones identified in this study. In addition to the <italic>pkd1L-2</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic><sup>+</sup> populations present in the rheosensory organ, there is a population of <italic>pou4-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in the ventral nerve cords and cephalic ganglia, which are not regulated by SoxB1-2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Although the ventral nerve cords are populated by <italic>npp-3</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, Pou4-2 activity does not regulate <italic>npp-3</italic> expression in this region as it does in the rheosensory organ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), and it has not been confirmed whether any cells in the ventral nerve cords are <italic>pou4-2</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>npp-3</italic><sup>+</sup> co-expressing cells. While this study did not define the function of this <italic>pou4-2</italic>⁺ central nervous system population, it may be possible to mine new scRNA-seq datasets to uncover transcription factors, such as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">King et al. (2024)</xref>, to predict the identities of <italic>pou4-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells negative for expression of sensory neuron markers like <italic>pkd1L-2</italic> and <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic>.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that the regulatory relationship between <italic>pou4</italic> and <italic>atonal</italic> observed in other species does not appear to be conserved in planarians. The expression patterns of planarian <italic>atonal</italic> genes indicated that they represent completely different cell populations from <italic>pou4-2</italic>-regulated mechanosensory neurons. Although several <italic>pou4-2</italic>-regulated genes are also expressed outside the rheosensory organ, <italic>pou4-2</italic> appears to primarily regulate gene expression in mechanosensory neuron-enriched regions, consistent with prior observations in <italic>pou4-2(RNAi)</italic> planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Elliott, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">King et al., 2024</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Smed-pou4-2</italic> is required for the regeneration of mechanosensory function</title>
<p>RNAi of <italic>pou4-2</italic> substantially reduced the expression of the terminal mechanosensory markers <italic>pkd1L-2</italic> and <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic> in intact animals, whereas <italic>pou4-2(RNAi)</italic> regenerate animals had a markedly reduced, dispersed expression of these genes at the head tips and peripheral ciliated stripes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that following injury, <italic>pou4-2</italic>⁺ progenitors or committed precursors may still undergo limited differentiation into sensory neurons in response to injury and polarity cues. This is consistent with previous observations in animals treated with hydroxyurea (HU) to block stem cell progression through S-phase. In these experiments, <italic>Smed-APC-1(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>Smed-ptc(RNAi)</italic> HU-treated animals were still able to regenerate neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Evans et al., 2011</xref>). It is also consistent with the hypothesis that many planarian stem cells are already specialized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Raz et al., 2021</xref>) and may have been unaffected by our RNAi treatment scheme. Nevertheless, both <italic>pou4-2(RNAi</italic>) intact animals and regenerates exhibited a significant reduction in mechanosensory responses compared to controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-E</xref>). Moreover, the late re-expression of <italic>pou4-2</italic> during regeneration, combined with the more rapid depletion of <italic>pou4-2</italic>⁺ cells lacking <italic>pkd1L-2</italic> and <italic>hmcn-1-L</italic> expression compared to <italic>pou4-2</italic>⁺ cells co-expressing these terminal markers in irradiated animals, supports the idea that <italic>pou4-2</italic>⁺ progenitors give rise to terminally differentiated mechanosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>pou4-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in the dorsal head tip and peripheral and dorsal ciliated stripes (the planarian rheosensory organ) are downstream of SoxB1-2 activity, and RNAi and WISH experiments demonstrated that <italic>pou4-2</italic> expression is necessary for maintaining the functional properties of mechanosensory neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>). However, the planarian rheosensory organ is composed of both ciliated mechanosensory neuronal and epidermal populations. Since <italic>soxB1-2</italic> is a pioneer transcription factor of the ectodermal lineage, RNAi of <italic>soxB1-2</italic> resulted in the loss of both ciliated sensory neuronal and epidermal populations in the rheosensory organ of planarian; thus, the dorsal ciliated stripe observed in acetylated tubulin labeling disappeared entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>pou4-2(RNAi)</italic> animals, labeling of ciliated mechanosensory neurons was markedly reduced, but epidermal ciliated cells within the stripe appeared largely unaffected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A–B</xref>). These findings support the conclusion that <italic>pou4-2</italic>⁺ cells represent a subset of mechanosensory neurons within the rheosensory organ and that <italic>pou4-2</italic> is not required for the maintenance of ciliated epidermal cells, unlike <italic>soxB1-2</italic>, which has a broader role in ectodermal lineage regulation.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Despite molecular evidence indicating planarians possess ciliated mechanoreceptors sharing homology with mechanoreceptor function and development in other organisms, we have yet to fully resolve the cellular morphologies of the collection of cells comprising the ciliated stripes. Although it remains uncertain whether ciliated mechanoreceptors are products of convergent evolution or share a common cellular ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Manley and Ladher, 2008</xref>), the role of Pou4 appears to represent a critical component of an adaptable gene regulatory network that has been co-opted to manufacture mechanoreceptors in distinct cell types. In addition, the mechanisms that specify <italic>pou4</italic>⁺ progenitors in response to local cues remain unclear. Studies have implicated Notch signaling as the likely culprit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Elliott, 2016</xref>), and recent studies in <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> have elegantly demonstrated that Notch signaling plays a role in patterning neurons and glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Scimone et al., 2025</xref>). Together, our findings demonstrate that <italic>pou4-2</italic> is critical for the maintenance, regeneration, and function of ciliated mechanosensory neurons in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>. Future studies aimed at identifying additional <italic>pou4-2</italic> target genes and defining how <italic>pou4-2</italic> influences chromatin accessibility will provide deeper insight into the transcriptional regulation of mechanosensory regeneration in planarians.</p>

Cell quantification was represented as the number of positive cells per mm<sup>2</sup>, and graphs were made using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Boston, MA). Three to six biological replicates per group were used to quantify co-labeling. Cell quantification details and the total number of cells counted for <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure S4A-B</xref> are summarized in Supplementary Files S7 and S8, respectively.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The overall scope is relatively limited. The manuscript lacks clear organization, and many of the conclusions would benefit from additional experiments and more rigorous quantification to enhance their strength and impact.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewing Editor Comments:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Quantification of pou4-2(+) cells that express (or do not express) hmcn-1-L and/or pkd1L-2(-) is a common suggestion amongst reviewers. It is recognized that Ross et al. (2018) showed that pkd1L-2 and hmcn-1L expression is detected in separate cells by double FISH, and the analysis presented in Supplementary Figure S3 is helpful in showing that some cells expressing pou4-2 (magenta) are not labeled by the combined signal of pkd1L-2 and hmcn-1-L riboprobes (green). However, I am not sure that we can conclude that pkd1L-2 and hmcn-1-L are effectively detected when riboprobes are combined in the analysis. Therefore, quantification of labeled cells as proposed by Reviewers 1 and 2 would help.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Combining riboprobes is a standard approach in the field, and we chose this method as a direct way to determine which cells lack expression of both genes. We agree that providing the raw quantification data would be helpful for readers, and we included this data in Supplementary File S7; the file contains the quantification information for this dFISH experiment represented in Supplementary Figure 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It may be helpful to comment on changes (or lack of changes) in atoh gene RNA levels in RNAseq analyses of pou4-2 animals. As mentioned by one of the reviewers, in situs that don't show signal are inconclusive in this regard.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with both reviewers. Two of the planarian atonal homologs are difficult to detect and produce background signals, which we attempted and previously reported in Cowles et al. Development (2013). We conceived performing reciprocal RNAi/in situ experiments, born out of curiosity given the reported role of atonal in the pou4 cascade in other organisms. However, these exploratory experiments lacked a strong rationale for inclusion, particularly given that pou4-2 and the atonal homologs do not share expression patterns, co-expression, or differential expression in our RNA-seq dataset. Therefore, we decided to omit the atonal in situs following pou4-2 RNAi. We retained the experiments showing that knockdown of the atonal genes does not show robust effects on the mechanosensory neuron pattern, as expected. We thank the reviewing editor and reviewers for pinpointing the concern. We agree that additional experiments, such as qPCR experiments, would be needed. We reasoned that while these additional experiments could be informative, they are unlikely to alter the key conclusions of this study substantially.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) There seem to be typos at bottom of Figure 10 and top of page 11 when referencing to Figure 4B (should be to 5B instead): &quot;While mechanosensory neuronal patterned expression of Eph1 was downregulated after pou4-2 and soxB1-2 inhibition, low expression in the brain branches of the ventral cephalic ganglia persisted (Figure 4B).&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you! We have fixed those.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Typo (page 13; kernel?): &quot;...to test to what extent the Pou4 gene regulatory kernel is conserved among these widely divergent animals.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regulatory kernels are defined as the minimal sets of interacting genes that drive developmental processes and are the core circuits within a gene regulatory network, but we recognize that this might not be as well known, so we have changed the term to “network” for clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors indicate that they are interested in finding out whether POU4-2 is important in the creation of mechanosensory neurons in adulthood as well as in embryogenesis (in other words, whether the mechanism is &quot;reused during adult tissue maintenance and regeneration&quot;). The manuscript clearly shows that planarian POU4 -2 is important in adult neurogenesis in planarians, but there is no evidence presented to show that this is a recapitulation of embryogenesis. Is pou4-2 expressed in the planarian embryo? This might be possible to examine by ISH or through the evaluation of sequencing data that already exists in the literature.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that these statements should be precise. We have clarified when we make comparisons to the role of Pou4 in sensory system development in other organisms versus its role in the adult planarian. We examined its expression using the existing database of embryonic gene expression. Thanks for hinting at this idea. We performed BLAST in Planosphere (Davies et al., 2017) to cross-reference our clone matching dd_Smed_v6_30562_0_1, which is identical to SMED30002016. The embryonic gene expression for SMED30002016 indicates this gene is expressed at the expected stages given prior knowledge of the timing of organ development in Schmidtea mediterranea (a positive trend begins at Stage 5, with a marked increase by Stage 6 that remains comparable to the asexual expression levels shown). We thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight. We have incorporated this result in the paper as a Supplementary Figure and discuss how we can only speculate that it has a similar role as we detect in the adult asexual worms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Can it be determined whether the punctate pou4-2+ cells outside of the stripes are progenitors or other neural cell types? Are there pou4-2+ neurons that are not mechanosensory cell types? Could there be other roles for POU4-2 in the neurogenesis of other cell types? It might help to show percentages of overlap in Figure 4A and discuss whether the two populations add up to 100% of cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These are good questions that arise in part from other statements that need clarification in the text (pointed out by Reviewer 2). We think some of the dorsal pou4-2<sup>+</sup> might represent progenitor cells undergoing terminal differentiation (see Supplementary Figure 4). We attempted BrdU pulse chase experiments but were not successful in consistently detecting pou4-2 at sufficient levels with our protocol. In response to this helpful comment, we have included this question as a future direction in the revised Discussion. Finally, we have edited our description of the expression pattern. We already pointed out that there are other cells on the ventral side that are not affected when soxB1-2 is knocked down. We attempted to resolve the potential identity of those cells working with existing scRNA-seq data in collaboration with colleagues, but their low abundance made it difficult to distinguish other populations. While we acknowledge this interesting possibility, we have chosen to focus this report on the role of pou4-2 downstream of soxB1-2, as this represents the most well-supported aspect of the dataset and was positively highlighted by both the reviewer and editor.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors discuss many genes from their analysis that play conserved roles in mechanosensation and hearing. Were there any conserved genes that came up in the analysis of pou4-2(RNAi) planarians that have not yet been studied in human hearing and neurodevelopment? I am wondering the extent to which planarians could be used as a discovery system for mechanosensory neuron function and development, and discussion of this point might increase the impact of this paper or provide critical rationale for expanding work on planarian mechanosensation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, we agree that planarians could be used to identify conserved genes with roles in mechanosensation and have included this point in the Discussion. In this study, we have focused on demonstrating the conservation of gene regulation. While this study was initially based on a graduate thesis project, we have since generated a more comprehensive dataset from isolated heads, which we are currently analyzing. This has been emphasized in the revised Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>(1) For Figure 6E, the authors could consider showing data along a negative axis to indicate a decrease in length in response to vibration and to more clearly show that this decrease doesn't occur as strongly after pou4-2(RNAi).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We displayed this behavior as the percent change, as this is a standard way to represent this data. As the percent change is a positive value, we represent the data as these positive values.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors should consider quantifying the decrease of pou4-2 mRNA after atonal(RNAi) conditions, either by RT-qPCR or cell quantification. Visually, the signal in the stripes after atoh8-2(RNAi) seems lower, particularly in the tail. The punctate pattern outside the stripes may also be decreased after atoh8-1(RNAi). But quantification might strengthen the argument.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and acknowledge that we should have been more cautious in interpreting these results. Those two genes are difficult to detect and did not show specific patterns in Cowles et al. (2013). The reviewer is correct that additional experiments are necessary before reaching conclusions, but we do not think as discussed earlier we do not think new experiments would provide insights for the major conclusions. These experiments were exploratory in nature and tangential to our main conclusions, especially in the absence of reciprocal evidence (e.g., shared expression patterns, co-expression, or differential expression in our RNA-seq data. Therefore, we decided to eliminate the atonal in situs following pou4-2 RNAi.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>A. Expression of pou4-2 in ciliated mechanosensory neurons:</p>
<p>(1) The conclusion that pou4-2 is expressed in ciliated mechanosensory neurons is primarily based on co-expression analysis using a published single-cell dataset. Although the authors later show that a subset of pou4-2 cells also express pkd1L-2 (Figure 4A), a known marker of ciliated mechanosensory neurons, this finding is not properly quantified. I recommend moving Figure 4A to earlier in the manuscript (e.g., to Figure 2) and expanding the analysis to include additional known markers of this cell type. Proper quantification of the extent of co-localization is necessary to support the claim robustly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As pointed out by the reviewer, there is substantive evidence from our lab and other reports. King et al. also showed pou4-2 and pkd1L-2 ‘regulation’ by their scRNA-seq data, and this function is conserved in the acoel Hofstenia miamia (Hulett et al., PNAS 2024 ). Our analysis shows convincing co-localization by scRNA-seq and expression of soxB1-2 and neural markers in the respective populations. Furthermore, we included colocalization of pou4-2 with mechanosensory genes using fluorescence in situ hybridization (Figure 3B, Supplementary Figure 4, and Supplementary File S7). We are confident the data conclusively show pou4-2 regulates pkd1L-2 expression in a subset of mechanosensory neurons. Given the strength of existing observations and previously published data, we believe that additional staining experiments are not essential to support this conclusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) There appears to be a conceptual inconsistency in the interpretation of pou4-2 expression dynamics. On one hand, the authors suggest that delayed pou4-2 expression indicates a role in late-stage differentiation (p.6). On the other hand, they propose that pou4-2 may be expressed in undifferentiated progenitors to initiate downstream transcriptional programs (p.8). These interpretations should be reconciled. Additionally, claims regarding pou4-2 expression in progenitor populations should be supported by co-localization with established stem cell or progenitor markers, rather than inferred from signal intensity alone.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent point, and we agree with the reviewer that this section requires editing. As described in response to Reviewer 1, we attempted BrdU pulse chase experiments but were not successful in consistently detecting pou4-2 at sufficient levels with our protocol. Furthermore, we could not obtain strong signals in double labeling experiments in pou4-2 in situs combined with piwi-1 or PIWI-1 antibodies. We will include those experiments as a future direction and amend our conclusions accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The expression pattern shown in Figure 1B raises questions about the precise anatomical localization of pou4-2 cells. It is unclear whether these cells reside in the subepidermal plexus or the deeper submuscular plexus, which represent distinct neuronal layers (Ross et al., 2017). The observed signals near the ventral nerve cords could suggest submuscular localization. To clarify this, higher-resolution imaging and co-staining with region-specific neural markers are recommended.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Ross et al. (2018), we showed that the pkd1L-2<sup>+</sup> cells are located submuscularly. The pkd1L-2 cells express pou4-2, thus the pou4-2<sup>+</sup> cells are located in the same location. Based on co-expression data and co-expression with PKD genes, we are confident it is submuscular.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>B. The functional requirements of pou4-2 in the maintenance of mechanosensory neurons:</p>
<p>(1) To evaluate the functional role of pou4-2 in maintaining mechanosensory neurons, the authors performed whole-animal RNA-seq on pou4-2(RNAi) and control animals, identifying a significant downregulation of genes associated with mechanosensory neuron expression. However, the presentation of these findings is fragmented across Figures 3, 4, and 5. I recommend consolidating the RNA-seq results (Figure 3) and the subsequent validation of downregulated genes (Figures 4 and 5) into a single, cohesive figure. This would improve the logical flow and clarity of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have combined Figures 3 and 4 (new Figure 3), which we believe improves the flow. We decided to keep Figure 5 (new Figure 4) as a standalone because it focuses on the characterization of new genes revealed by RNAseq and scRNA-seq data mining that were not previously reported in Ross et al. 2018 and</p>
<p>1. </p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In pou4-2(RNAi) animals, pkd1L-2 expression appears to be entirely lost, while hmcn-1-L shows faint expression in scattered peripheral regions. The authors suggest that an extended RNAi treatment might be necessary to fully eliminate hmcn-1-L expression. However, an alternative explanation is that pou4-2 is not essential for maintaining all hmcn-1-L cells, particularly if pou4-2 expression does not fully overlap with that of hmcn-1-L. This possibility should be acknowledged and discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>(3) On page 9, the section title claims that &quot;Smed-pou4-2 regulates genes involved in ciliated cell structure organization, cell adhesion, and nervous system development.&quot; While some differentially expressed genes are indeed annotated with these functions based on homology, the manuscript does not provide experimental evidence supporting their roles in these biological processes in planarians. The title should be revised to avoid overstatement, and the limitations of extrapolating a function solely from gene annotation should be acknowledged.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Excellent point. We have edited the text to indicate that the genes were annotated or implicated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The cilia staining presented in Figure 6B to support the claim that pou4-2 is required for ciliated cell structure organization is unconvincing. Improved imaging and more targeted analysis (e.g., co-labeling with mechanosensory markers) are needed to support this conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have addressed this concern by adjusting the language to be more precise and indicate that the stereotypical banded pattern is disrupted with decreased cilia labeling along the dorsal ciliated stripe. Indeed, our conclusion overstated the observations made with the staining and imaging resolution. Thank you.</p>

<p>C. The functional requirements of pou4-2 in the regeneration of mechanosensory neurons:</p>
<p>To evaluate the role of pou4-2 in the regeneration of mechanosensory neurons, the authors performed amputations on pou4-2(RNAi) and control(RNAi) animals and assessed the expression of mechanosensory markers (pkd1L-2, hmcn-1-L) alongside a functional assay. However, the results shown in Figure 4B indicate the presence of numerous pkd1L-2 and hmcn-1-L cells in the blastema of pou4-2(RNAi) animals. This observation raises the possibility that pou4-2 may not be essential for the regeneration of these mechanosensory neurons. The authors should address this alternative interpretation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our interpretation is that there were very few cells expressing the markers compared to controls. The pattern was predominantly lost, which is consistent with other experiments shown in the paper. However, we have added the additional caveat suggested by the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(1) On p.8, the authors wrote &quot;every 12 hours post-irradiation&quot;. However, this is not consistent with the figure, which only shows 0, 3, 4, 4.5, 5, and 5.5 dpi.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We corrected this. Thank you for catching the mistake!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) On p.12, the authors wrote &quot;Analysis of pou4-2 RNAi data revealed differentially expressed genes with known roles in mechanosensory functions, such as loxhd-1, cdh23, and myo7a. Mutations in these genes can cause a loss of mechanosensation/transduction&quot;. This is misleading because, to my knowledge, the role of these genes in planarians is unknown. If the authors meant other model systems, they should clearly state this in the text and include proper references.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that we are referencing findings from other organisms. We have clarified this point in the revised text. The appropriate references were included and cited in the first version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) On p.7, the authors wrote, &quot;conversely, the expression of atonal genes was unaffected in pou4-2 RNAi-treated regenerates (Supplementary Figure S2B)&quot;. However, it is unclear whether the Atoh8-1 and Atoh8-2 signals are real, as the quality of the in situ results is too low to distinguish between real signals and background noise/non-specific staining.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This valid concern was addressed in our response to Reviewer 1. We have adjusted the figure and the text accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) On p.6 the authors wrote &quot;pinpointed time points wherein the pou4-2 transcripts were robustly downregulated&quot;. However, the current version of the manuscript does not provide data explaining why Pou4-2 transcripts are robustly downregulated on day 12.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we determined the appropriate time points using qPCR for all sample extractions. As an example, see the figure for qPCR validation at day 12 showing that pou4-2 and pkd1L2 are down.</p>

<p>(5) On p.13, the authors wrote &quot;collecting RNA from how animals.&quot; Is this a typo?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for catching the typo. It should read “whole” animals. We have corrected this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) On p.14, the authors wrote &quot;but the expression patterns of planarian atonal genes indicated that they represent completely different cell populations from pou4-2-regulated mechanosensory neurons&quot;. However, this is unclear from the images, as the in situ staining of Atoh8-1 and Atoh82 are potentially failed stainings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. We have edited accordingly.</p>
