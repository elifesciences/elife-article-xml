<title>Abstract</title><p>Sequence and structure comparisons between alpha and beta connexins, Cx43 and Cx26, revealed that Cx43 has a motif, the carbamylation motif, that confers CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity on a subset of beta connexins. By using a fluorescent dye loading assay, whole cell patch clamp recordings and real time measurement of ATP release via GRAB<sub>ATP</sub> we have demonstrated that Cx43 hemichannels open in a highly CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive manner over the range 20 to 70 mmHg. Mutational analysis confirms that the equivalent residues to those in Cx26 that have been shown to be involved in mediating the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> on gating of hemichannels and gap junction channels, also mediate Cx43 hemichannel gating. Our data predicts that Cx43 will be partially open and able to release ATP at resting physiological levels of PCO<sub>2</sub>. We have tested this prediction in acute hippocampal slices, by showing that CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission can be blocked by the Cx43-selective mimetic peptide Gap26. Our data resolves an inconsistency in the literature between <italic>in vivo</italic> studies suggesting that Cx43 hemichannels are at least partially open at rest, and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, performed in the absence of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>/CO<sub>2</sub> buffering that show Cx43 hemichannels are shut. Our evidence suggests that the ancestral gene that duplicated to give the alpha and beta connexin clades must have possessed the carbamylation motif. CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity is thus a fundamental ancient characteristic of several connexins that has been lost in more recently derived members of this gene family.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There are 21 connexin genes encoded in the human genome. Connexins are transmembrane proteins that can form hemichannels and gap junction channels. The existence of 21 isoforms suggests functional specialisation across the gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sohl &amp; Willecke, 2004</xref>). On the basis of molecular phylogeny, the connexins have been divided into 4 broad clades -the alpha, beta, and gamma and delta groupings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mikalsen <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Certain members of the β-clade, Cx26, Cx30 and Cx32, are directly sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Huckstepp <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dospinescu <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). The mechanism of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity has best been studied in Cx26. While Cx26 hemichannels are opened in response to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Huckstepp <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), CO<sub>2</sub> closes Cx26 gap junction channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nijjar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent gating of Cx26 hemichannels and gap junction channels involves carbamylation of a specific lysine, K125, which is part of a critical carbamylation motif, <sub>125</sub>KVRIEGS<sub>131</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Meigh <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). This motif is essential for the CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity of Cx26, as it allows the formation of a salt bridge between the carbamylated K125 and R104 of the neighbouring subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Meigh <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). The formation of this “carbamate” bridge induces conformational changes, ultimately leading to the opening of the hemichannel or closing of the gap junction channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Meigh <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nijjar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Brotherton <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Brotherton <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Mutation of K125 to arginine, an amino acid that cannot be carbamylated, or R104 to alanine so that it cannot form a carbamate bridge, removes the ability of CO<sub>2</sub> to open Cx26 hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Meigh <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) or close Cx26 gap junction channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nijjar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the introduction of the carbamylation motif into a CO<sub>2</sub>-insensitive connexin, Cx31, results in CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent hemichannel opening of Cx31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Meigh <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Other members of the β-clade, Cx30 and Cx32, are also CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive, but have different sensitivity profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Huckstepp <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dospinescu <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Evolutionary comparisons show that the carbamylation motif has been conserved over 400 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dospinescu <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) and appears to be a necessary and sufficient feature for the CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity of connexins.</p>
<p>Sequence comparisons of the β-connexins and α-connexins, revealed the presence of a potential carbamylation motif within the α-connexin, Cx43. Cx43 has a motif (<sub>144</sub>KVKMRGG<sub>150</sub>) homologous to the motif in Cx26 (<sub>125</sub>KVRIEGS<sub>131</sub>) suggesting that it might also be sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub>. In this study we show that Cx43 hemichannels are indeed directly sensitive to changes in the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PCO<sub>2</sub>) over the physiological concentration range. Unlike Cx26, the CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent opening mechanism of Cx43 is more complex, involving additional residues beyond the homologs of K125 and R104. Our discovery that Cx43 hemichannels are directly CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive has major physiological implications and may explain why Cx43 hemichannels appear to be open under physiological conditions but closed <italic>in vitro</italic> where they are usually studied in the absence of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> buffers.</p>

<title>Identification of a potential carbamylation motif in Cx43</title>
<p>Cx43, an alpha-connexin, possesses a carbamylation motif homologous to that of the beta-connexins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). AlphaFold3 (AF3) predicts a structure very close to the experimentally determined structures for Cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Qi <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) but has the advantage of including portions of the structure that have not been experimentally resolved. This is a valid approach, as the <italic>de novo</italic> predictions by AF3 for the cytoplasmic loop of Cx26 have been supported by a recent experimentally-derived structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Brotherton <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). By performing alignments of the Cx43 and Cx26 AF3 structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), we found that two residues in Cx43, K144 and K105, aligned with the residues in Cx26 that are essential for hemichannel opening to CO<sub>2</sub>, K125 and R104 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The predicted 3D orientation of the alpha-helices involved are positioned in a similar manner to allow potential interaction between K144 and K105 following carbamylation. Cx43 also presents another feature that is similar to Cx26: the high incidence of Lys residues. In Cx26, 5 lysine residues in the cytoplasmic loop can be carbamylated, suggesting an environment favourable for this to happen. The presence of multiple Lys residues in the cytoplasmic loop of Cx43 implies that the local environment may be conserved to facilitate the required pKa for CO<sub>2</sub> binding and carbamate bridge formation.</p>

<title>Cx43 hemichannels are opened by CO<sub>2</sub></title>
<p>We used an established dye-loading protocol, previously used for CO<sub>2</sub> connexin studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Huckstepp <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Meigh <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Meigh <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">de Wolf <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">de Wolf <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cook <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dospinescu <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">van de Wiel <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), to test whether Cx43 hemichannels are CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive. We observed significant dye-loading in Cx43-expressing cells when exposed to a high CO<sub>2</sub> stimulus (70 mmHg) when starting from a baseline of 20 mmHg (MW test, PCO<sub>2</sub> 20 vs 70 mmHg: p = 0.008, n=5, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). We used a zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> aCSF to unblock hemichannels as a positive control to demonstrate that for WT Cx43, the zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulus and 70 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub> gave a similar amount of dye loading (MW test: p-value = 0.726, n=5).</p>

</fig>
<p>To further support these findings, we next used whole cell patch clamp recordings from HeLa cells expressing Cx43 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). From a baseline of 35 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub>, an increase in an outward conductance was observed when switching to 55 or 70 mmHg aCSF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). On switching to 20 mmHg aCSF, a small conductance decrease was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Untransfected parental HeLa cells did not display an increase in outward current to changes in PCO<sub>2</sub>. However, some parental HeLa cells exhibited a slow increase in an inward current on transfer from 35 to 70 mmHg (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). This was quite distinct from the outward current observed in Cx43 expressing cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Overall, the patch clamp data predicted a dose response that could be fitted by the Hill equation with a Hill coefficient of 6 and an EC<sub>50</sub> of 43 mmHg.</p>
<p>To assess whether the CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent opening of Cx43 resulted in ATP release, we co-transfected HeLa cells with the genetically encoded ATP sensor - GRAB<sub>ATP</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> dependent increase in ATP release was indeed observed (n=22, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). We observed an increase in GRAB<sub>ATP</sub> fluorescence on going from 20 to 35 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub> and further to 55 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). While ATP release at 70 mmHg was slightly less than that at 55 mmHg, it remained markedly higher than at 35 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Cells transfected with GRAB<sub>ATP</sub> only, showed no release in response to any concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> applied (n=14, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Overall, our results show through three independent assays that Cx43 hemichannels are opened by modest changes in PCO<sub>2</sub> around the physiological norm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Once opened by CO<sub>2</sub>, Cx43 hemichannels display permeability to ATP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Gap Junction Channels (GJCs) of Cx26 are closed by CO<sub>2</sub> also acting via the carbamylation motif. We therefore tested whether Cx43 GJCs might also be CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive by using a dye transfer assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nijjar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Cx43 GJCs allowed equally fast permeation of dye at all levels of PCO<sub>2</sub> and therefore, unlike the hemichannel, were insensitive to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 2, figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Identifying the residues required for CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity of Cx43</title>
<p>Having established the dose-response characteristics of Cx43 to CO<sub>2</sub>, we next examined the potential underlying mechanisms for CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent gating via targeted mutagenesis of possible key residues, starting with the equivalents of those known to be involved in the CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity of Cx26 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutation of K144 to glutamine (K144Q), an amino acid that cannot be carbamylated, partially reduced the CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity of the channel: the 70 mmHg stimulus resulted in significantly less increase in dye loading than the zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> positive control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, MW test: p = 0.048, n=5). However, mutation of Lys105 to a non-charged residue (K105Q) resulted in hemichannels that gave a similar increase in dye loading to the zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> positive control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, MW test: p = 0.111, n=5). In Cx26, mutation of the residues involved in carbamylation (K125 and R104) results in complete loss of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Meigh <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nijjar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The lack of such a complete effect on the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx43 implies that the mechanism is more complex and may involve further residues.</p>

<p>We further inspected the AF3 structure prediction and identified two further lysine residues of interest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). K109 in Cx43 aligns with K108 of Cx26, a residue known to be carbamylated and required for Cx26 gap junction closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nijjar <italic>et al</italic>., 2025</xref>). AF3 also suggests that K109 could potentially interact with K234 following any carbamylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). We therefore mutated both residues to Gln to test their possible involvement in CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. The dye-loading assay showed that K109Q remained CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> MW test vs zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> control, p = 0.274, n=5). However, the mutation K234Q displayed impaired CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>, MW test vs zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> control: p = 0.016, n=5).</p>
<p>As the dye loading assay suggested that single mutations were on the whole rather ineffective in abolishing CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity, we assayed ATP release via GRAB<sub>ATP</sub> to gain further supporting evidence. We found that CO<sub>2</sub>-evoked ATP release remained dose dependent and very similar to the WT Cx43 in the K105Q (n=23) and K144Q (n=12) mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A, C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, figure supplement 1</xref>). Cx43 hemichannels with the K109Q mutation appeared to have their sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> shifted to lower values of PCO<sub>2</sub> (n=20), appearing to give maximal ATP release at 35 mmHg (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B,E</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 4 figure supplement 1</xref>). K234Q Cx43 hemichannels had greatly reduced sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> (n=15, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D, F</xref>).</p>

<title>Physiological role for CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent ATP release via Cx43 from astrocytes</title>
<p>Cx43 hemichannels are CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive and are likely to be partially open at typical levels of PCO<sub>2</sub> in mammalian tissue. They could thus be able to release ATP under physiological resting conditions (35 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Considering the ubiquitous distribution of Cx43 in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">de Ceglia <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) and the likely resting PCO<sub>2</sub> in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hogg <italic>et al</italic>., 1984</xref>), we postulated that, barring external modulatory influences, Cx43 hemichannels could continually release low levels of ATP in the hippocampus. Indeed, there exists compelling evidence for astrocytic Cx43 hemichannels being partially open under resting physiological conditions <italic>in vitro</italic> in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chever <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). In this study when Cx43 hemichannels were blocked by the mimetic peptide, Gap26, there was a decrease synaptic strength of about 30% that was occluded by targetted knock out of astrocytic Cx43 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chever <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>As many investigators state that Cx43 hemichannels are shut under physiological conditions, we tested whether the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chever et al (2014)</xref> could be explained by the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx43. We predicted that if PCO<sub>2</sub> were lowered sufficiently to largely close Cx43, when PCO<sub>2</sub> was returned to the physiological norm, Cx43 should re-open and result in an increase of synaptic strength, presumably downstream of Cx43-dependent ATP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chever <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Because ATP can be rapidly broken down to adenosine in the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Frenguelli <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wall &amp; Dale, 2013</xref>), which could then act at A1 receptors to inhibit transmission and give confounding effects, we used 8-CPT (8-cyclopentyltheophylline) to selectively block A1 receptors.</p>
<p>We preincubated hippocampal slices in 20 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub> aCSF for 30 mins prior to recording fEPSP in area CA1 evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer colaterals. At constant extracellular pH, in the presence of 8-CPT, elevation of PCO<sub>2</sub> from 20 to 35 mmHg resulted in a 26% increase in EPSP (n=6, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A</xref>). To test whether this effect was mediated via CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent opening of Cx43, we used 100 μM Gap26 to see whether this blocked the increase in fEPSP induced by 35 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub>. Once again the fEPSP increased by about 30% on transfer to 35 mmHg aCSF (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>), and application of Gap26 reduced the fEPSP to below its baseline value (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B, D</xref>, Friedmann 2 way ANOVA: p=0.006, n=6). This was an effect specific to the Gap26 peptide as 100 μM of the scrambled peptide did not have significant effects on the amplitude of the fEPSP (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10C, D</xref>, Friedmann 2 way ANOVA: p=0.55, n=5).</p>

<title>Hemichannels of Cx43 are CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive</title>
<p>In contrast to Cx26 expression, which is restricted to specific, small regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nagy <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rash <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nagy <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), Cx43 serves as the principal astrocytic connexin, exhibiting widespread presence throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schulz <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yin <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">de Ceglia <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). This widespread distribution, combined with our results, suggests that Cx43 gives the capacity for CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity across the entire brain.</p>
<p>Our data from three independent assays (dye loading, measurement of ATP release and whole cell recordings) show that hemichannels of Cx43 open to modest changes in PCO<sub>2</sub>. However, Cx43 gap junction channels are insensitive to these same changes in PCO<sub>2</sub>. At physiological levels of PCO<sub>2</sub> Cx43 hemichannels are partially open and able to release ATP. This observation potentially resolves a puzzling inconsistency in the literature. Many biophysical recordings of Cx43 hemichannels, performed in simplified HEPES buffered salines without appreciable dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> or HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, document Cx43 hemichannels as being shut. By contrast, under physiological conditions both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, which necessarily involve CO<sub>2</sub>-HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> buffering, the evidence suggests that Cx43 hemichannels are constitutively open to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chever <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guillebaud <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Turovsky <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Continual ATP release from astrocytes via Cx43 has been shown to give a tone of ATP that enhances the strength of synaptic transmission in the hippoampus by about 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chever <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Our data is highly complementary to these observations as we find an enhancement of fEPSP amplitude of about 30% when increasing PCO<sub>2</sub> from 20 to 35 mmHg. It is important to note that our experiments were performed under isohydric conditions and differ from a prior study that examined hypocapnia with simultaneous alkalinisation. This manipulation enhanced fEPSP strength through a reduction in extracellular adenosine and consequently less inhibition via A1 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dulla <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While our data suggests that Cx43 hemichannels are sensitive to PCO<sub>2</sub> over the range 20-70 mmHg, there is an indication that there may be some CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent inhibition of hemichannel opening above 55 mmHg. Slightly less ATP release was consistently seen at a PCO<sub>2</sub> of 70 mmHg compared to 55 mmHg. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that Cx43 hemichannels are completely shut at a PCO<sub>2</sub> of 20 mmHg, as it is not possible to reduce the PCO<sub>2</sub> further without changing to HEPES buffered salines. That Gap26 reduced synaptic transmission below the baseline amplitude recorded in slices bathed in 20 mmHg aCSF suggests that even under this condition there may still be a low level of Cx43 hemichannel gating at least in neural tissue which will continually generate CO<sub>2</sub> via oxidative phosphorylation.</p>

Both K125 and K108 in Cx26 are known to be carbamylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nijjar <italic>et al</italic>., 2025</xref>). Carbamylation of K125 is essential for hemichannel opening to CO<sub>2</sub>, whereas carbamylation of both K125 and K108 is required for GJC closure to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nijjar <italic>et al</italic>., 2025</xref>). R216 in Cx26 has been tentatively identified as a possible interacting partner for K108 but this could be indirect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nijjar <italic>et al</italic>., 2025</xref>). Crucially the spatial arrangements of K144, K105, K109 and K234 in AF3 predictions indicate that these residues are sufficiently close to interact across the subunit boundary.</p>
<p>In Cx26, K125 is proposed to interact with R104 following carbamylation, and interestingly mutation of either K125 or R104 is sufficient to abolish CO<sub>2</sub> dependent hemichannel opening and GJC closure. Mutation of K108 is also sufficient by itself to abolish GJC closure to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nijjar <italic>et al</italic>., 2025</xref>). By contrast single mutations to Gln of any of the 4 Lys residues identified in Cx43 as the equivalents to those involved in CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent gating of Cx26 were unable to completely abolish CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. Similarly the mutations K125E and R104E in Cx26 create consitutively open hemichannels. However single Lys to Glu mutations in Cx43 did not have this effect.</p>
<p>Our data show that in Cx43 at least 2 of the 4 identified residues must be mutated to completely abolish CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity or to give constitutively open hemichannels. For example mutation of any two Lys residues to Gln, completely abolishes CO<sub>2</sub> dependent ATP release and dye loading. Conversely the double mutation, K105E and K109E, is required for constitutively open hemichannels.</p>
<p>This suggests that in Cx43 there is some redundancy in the effect of CO<sub>2</sub>. One possible interpretation is that two carbamate bridges are formed: one being between K144 and K105 (the direct equivalent of K125-R104 in Cx26); and the second being between K109 and K234. There is certainly some data that support this: the double mutations K109Q-K144Q, K105Q-K234Q and K144Q-K234Q being completely insensitive to CO<sub>2</sub>. These double mutations would remove both of the proposed bridges. However our observation that the mutations K105Q-K144Q, K109Q-K234Q also completely remove CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity is inconsistent with a simple two bridge hypothesis as these double mutations would only affect one of the bridges and should therefore leave the other intact to give some degree of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. Instead, we favour a hypothesis in which any of these four residues could be carbamylated but that they all have potential to interact. Depending on which residues become carbamylated a bridge could form between K105 and K234 or between K109 and K144, and possibly even K144 and K234. There is some support for this idea from AF3 as K105 and K109 are only one turn distant in an alpha helix and both could therefore interact with either K144 or K234 following carbamylation. The residues in Cx43 that are involved in CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity are equivalent to those identified in Cx26, where they participate in both hemichannel and gap junction channel gating to CO<sub>2</sub>. However in Cx43 these residues are only involved in mediating the sensitivity of the hemichannel to CO<sub>2</sub>. In this respect it is interesting that mutations of the different Lys residues alter the dose-sensitivity of Cx43 to CO<sub>2</sub> in different ways (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 4, figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Physiological implications of the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx43</title>
<p>Cx43 is the most widely expressed connexin in the human body, being present in every organ system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lucaciu <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). In metabolically highly active organs such as liver, kidney and brain, ouir data suggest that the physiological PCO<sub>2</sub> will be sufficient to substantially open Cx43 hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hogg <italic>et al</italic>., 1984</xref>). In the context of the brain, Cx43 is the main astrocytic connexin and is expressed in all subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">de Ceglia <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). This would imply that CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity mediated via Cx43 will extend to potentially all brain regions. As astrocytes are non-excitable, they are unlikely to become sufficiently depolarised for Cx43 hemichannels to open via voltage dependent gating. We suggest therefore, in non-excitable cells such as astrocytes, that variations in PCO<sub>2</sub> may be the most important physiological regulator of Cx43 hemichannel gating. For astrocytes, CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent opening of Cx43 hemichannels is likely to result in the release of a mix of small, neurochemically significant molecules such as ATP, glutamate, D-serine and lactate, depending on their intracellular concentration.</p>
<p>Cx43 is also highly expressed in the heart, if a proportion of the population were to be in hemichannel form as opposed to GJCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">De Smet <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), the newly-discovered CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of hemichannels may have profound implications for heart function given that cardiomyocytes are highly active, and will thus generate high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> through oxidative phosphorylation. There is a long-established link between CO<sub>2</sub> and cardiac function with effects such as increased coronary blood flow in response to CO<sub>2</sub> as well as changes in myocardial contractile function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Crystal, 2015</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> can even cause arrythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>NF-kappa B and innate immunity exhibit sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cummins <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Keogh <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Macrophages are CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive, although at least some of this is indirect and via pH changes mediated by carbonic anhydrase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Strowitzki <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). However, a direct effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on components of the immune system cannot be excluded. In cell culture, when carbonic anhydrase activity is blocked in THP-1 monocytes, the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> are significantly diminished but not abolished, suggesting the existence of a pH-independent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Strowitzki <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). As Cx43 is expressed in monocytes it is a plausible candidate to mediate direct CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity in these cells. Furthermore, Cx43 function in macrophages is deemed critical for various physiological and pathophysiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rodjakovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The role of CO<sub>2</sub> on such pathways remains to be explored.</p>
<p>It is interesting that pathological mutations of Cx43 abrogate CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. This follows a pattern seen for Cx26, where a range of mutations linked to syndromic and non-syndromic hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Meigh <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">de Wolf <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cook <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), and for Cx32, where several mutations that cause X-linked Charcot Marie Tooth Disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Butler &amp; Dale, 2023</xref>) alter or completely block CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. Further studies are needed to see whether loss of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity from Cx43 does indeed contribute to pathology.</p>

<title>Evolution of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity in connexins</title>
<p>Our previous findings showed that a common carbamylation motif is prevalent across the beta-connexin clade and confers CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity on the connexins that possess it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dospinescu <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). This motif for example is present in shark Cx32 (which is CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive). Humans and sharks last shared a common ancestor about 400-450 MYA. Our discovery that a very similar carbamylation motif is present in Cx43 and confers CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity onto their hemichannels, suggests that this property must have been present in the ancestral connexin gene that predated the establishment of the alpha and beta connexin clades. Further work is needed to understand the evolution of the carbamylation motif and CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity, but our observations indicate that it is an ancient feature within the molecular phylogeny of the connexins, rather than being a more recently derived feature restricted to the beta connexins.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>HeLa DH cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/mL penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa DH cells were used for patch clamp studies on Cx43 and for the dye loading of all Cx43 variants. For dye loading experiments, cells were seeded onto coverslips at a density of 7.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well and transiently transfected with the Cx43 constructs following the PEI Transfection Reagent protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Dye-loading</title>
<p>Cell expressing the construct (48-72h) were given an initial 5-minute wash with control solution (artificial cerebrospinal fluid – aCSF, 20 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub>). Following this, the cells were exposed to either control solution, hypercapnic (70 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub>), or a zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> control (20 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub>) solution, all of which contained 200 µM 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (CBF) for 10 min. Next, cells were put into control solution with 200 µM CBF for 5 minutes to close any open channels and prevent dye loss in the next step. Then the coverslip was washed with control solution (without CBF) for another 30 min to remove extracellular dye. For each condition a different coverslip with HeLa cells was used. Cx43 was tagged with mCherry on the C-terminus using a short linker. Expression was verified using mCherry fluorescence. The experiments were replicated using independent transfections 5 times.</p>
<p>Following dye loading, HeLa cells were imaged by epifluorescence (Scientifica Slice Scope, Cairn Research OptoLED illumination, 60x water Olympus immersion objective, NA 1.0, Hamamatsu ImagEM EM-CCD camera, Metafluor software). CBFwas excited by a 470 nm LED, with emission captured between 504-543 nm. Cx43 constructs had a C-terminal mCherry tag, which was excited by a 535 nm LED and emission captured between 570-640 nm.</p>
<p>Following acquisition analysis was performed by a person blind to the experimental condition. ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, USA) was used to measure the extent of dye loading by drawing a region of interest (ROI) around each cell, and subsequently, the mean pixel intensity of the ROI was determined. The mean pixel intensity of a representative background ROI for each image was subtracted from each cell measurement from the same image. At least 40 cells were measured for each condition per experiment, and five repetitions of independently transfected HeLa cells were completed. The mean pixel intensities were plotted as cumulative probability distributions, and these graphs show every data point measured. To assess the effect of the 70 mmHg and zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> solutions on dye loading, the difference in the median pixel intensities between the 70mmHg and 20 mmHg conditions, and the zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 20 mmHg conditions was calculated for each transfection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>).</p>

<title>GRAB<sub>ATP</sub> recordings</title>
<p>Cells were transiently transfected with the pCAG-Cx43-mCherry construct and pDisplay-GRAB_ATP1.0-IRES-mCherry-CAAX (Addgene plasmid # 167582 ; RRID:Addgene_167582) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) 48 hours prior to imaging. Cells were perfused with control aCSF until a stable baseline was reached, before perfusion with either hypercapnic or high K<sup>+</sup> aCSF. Once a stable baseline was reached after solution change, cells were again perfused with control aCSF and when a stable baseline reached, recordings were calibrated by direct application of 3 μM of the corresponding analyte.</p>
<p>All cells were imaged by epifluorescence as above. The cpGFP in GRAB<sub>ATP</sub> was excited by a 470 nm LED, with emission captured between 504-543 nm. As the Cx43 constructs were mCherry tagged, we selected only cells that expressed both cpGFP and mCherry for recording. GRAB<sub>ATP</sub> fluorescence images were acquired every 4 seconds. For each condition, at least 3 independent transfections were performed with at least 2 coverslips per transfection.</p>
<p>Analysis of all experiments was carried out in ImageJ. Images were opened as a stack and stabilised. ROIs were drawn around cells co-expressing both sensor and connexin. Median pixel intensity was plotted as normalised fluorescence change (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) over time to give traces of fluorescence change. Amount of ATP release was quantified as concentration by normalising to the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> caused by application of 3 μM ATP.</p>

<title>Patch clamp recordings</title>
<p>Coverslips containing non-confluent HeLa cells were placed into a perfusion chamber at room temperature and superfused with control aCSF. An Axopatch 200B amplifier was used to make whole-cell recordings from single HeLa cells. The intracellular fluid in the patch pipettes contained: K-gluconate 60 mM, Cs-gluconate 50 mM, CsCl 10 mM, TEACl 10 mM, EGTA 10 mM, Na<sub>2</sub>ATP 3mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 3 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1 mM, HEPES 10 mM, sterile filtered, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. An agarose salt bridge was used to avoid solution changes altering the potential of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All whole-cell recordings were performed at a holding potential of -50 mV. Whole-cell conductance was measured by repeated steps to -40 mV. To allow for any drift in whole-cell conductance unrelated to the CO<sub>2</sub> stimulus, the maximal conductance during the CO<sub>2</sub> test stimulus was compared to the average of the conductance before the stimulus and after the stimulus had been fully washed off. Each whole cell recording was considered to be an independent statistical replicate.</p>

<title>Imaging assay of gap junction transfer</title>
<p>2-Deoxy-2-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]-D-glucose, NBDG, was included at 200 µM in the patch recording fluid, which contained: K-gluconate 130 mM; KCl 10 mM; EGTA 5 mM; CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2 mM, HEPES 10 mM, pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH to give a resulting final osmolarity of 295 mOsm. Cells were imaged on a Cleverscope (MCI Neuroscience) with a Photometrics Prime camera under the control of Micromanager 1.4 software. LED illumination (Cairn Research) and an image splitter (Optosplit, Cairn Research) allowed simultaneous imaging of the mCherry-tagged Cx43 subunits and the diffusion of the NBDG into and between cells. Coupled cells for intercellular dye transfer experiments were initially selected based on tagged Cx43 protein expression and the presence of a gap junctional plaque (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, figure supplement 1</xref>). Dye permeation between cells was measured at PCO<sub>2</sub> levels of 20, 55 and 70 mmHg. After establishing the whole cell mode of recording, images were collected every 10 seconds. The assay was performed as described by Nijjar et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nijjar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The start of recording was taken to be the first image following the establishment of a stable whole cell recording. For each gap junction recording (considered as an independent statistical replicate), analysis of the cell images was performed in ImageJ using an ROI drawn on each cell to measure the median pixel intensity of the donor and acceptor cells. The time for the median fluorescence of the acceptor cell to reach 10% of the donor cell was then determined and used as the value for statistical comparisons.</p>

For fEPSP recordings an individual slice was pre-incubated in 20 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub> aCSF for 30 mins, following which the slice was transferred to a recording chamber submerged in aCSF at 32°C. For stimulation, pulses were delivered by a stimulator via concentric bipolar metal stimulating electrode placed on the surface of CA3. For extracellular recordings, an aCSF-filled microelectrode was placed in CA1.</p>

<p>In the case of dye loading one transfection was considered one replicate. In the case of patch clamping and GRAB<sub>ATP</sub> experiments, one cell was considered one replicate. For dye-loading, to assess the effect a mutation would have on the protein, the difference in dye loading evoked by 70 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub> or 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions (from the 20 mmHg baseline) for each construct were compared, using the median value for each condition from each transfection. The Mann-Whitney U one-sided test was used for the comparison on the basis that <italic>a priori</italic> we expected mutations to either reduce CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity or have no effect. To compare the fEPSP size across different conditions, the non-parametric Friedman two way ANOVA was used. Statistical analysis was performed using the python language and SciPy library.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>important</bold> insights into the CO₂-dependent activation of Cx43 hemichannels through a well-defined carbamylation motif, supported by multiple independent assays and validation in hippocampal tissue. The evidence <bold>convincingly</bold> demonstrates that increased pCO₂ enhances Cx43 hemichannel activity, which has potential implications for cellular signaling in cardiomyocytes and astrocytes. While further investigation is needed to fully elucidate the structural mechanisms, the findings offer a foundation for future research in gap junction biology and CO₂ regulation of proteins.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study builds on previous work demonstrating that several beta connexins (Cx26, Cx30, and Cx32) have a carbamylation motif which renders them sensitive to CO2. In response to CO2, hemichannels composed of these connexins open, enabling diffusion of small molecules (such as ATP) between the cytosol and extracellular environment. Here, the authors have identified that an alpha connexin, Cx43, also contains a carbamylation motif, and they demonstrate that CO2 opens Cx43 hemichannels. Most of the study involves using transfected cells expressing wild-type and mutant Cx43 to define amino acids required for CO2 sensitivity. Hippocampal tissue slices in culture were used to show that CO2-induced synaptic transmission was affected by Cx43 hemichannels, providing a physiological context. The authors point out that the Cx43 gene significantly diverges from the beta connexins that are CO2 sensitive, suggesting that the conserved carbamylation motif was present before the alpha and beta connexin genes diverged.</p>

<p>(1) The molecular analysis defining the amino acids that contribute to the CO2 sensitivity of Cx43 is a major strength of the study. The rigor of analysis was strengthened by using three independent assays for hemichannel opening: dye uptake, patch clamp channel measurements, and ATP secretion. The resulting analysis identified key lysines in Cx43 that were required for CO2-mediated hemichannel opening. A double K to E Cx43 mutant produced a construct that produced hemichannels that were constitutively open, which further strengthened the analysis.</p>
<p>(2) Using hippocampal tissue sections to demonstrate that CO2 can influence field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) provides a native context for CO2 regulation of Cx43 hemichannels. Cx43 mutations associated with Oculodentodigital Dysplasia (ODDD) inhibited CO2-induced hemichannel opening, although the mechanism by which this occurs was not elucidated.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Cx43 channels are sensitive to cytosolic pH, which will be affected by CO2. Cytosolic pH was not measured, and how this affects CO2-induced Cx43 hemichannel activity was not addressed.</p>
<p>(2) Cultured cells are typically grown in incubators containing 5% CO2, which is ~40 mmHg. It is unclear how cells would be viable if Cx43 hemichannels are open at this PCO2.</p>
<p>(3) Experiments using Gap26 to inhibit Cx43 hemichannels in fEPSP measurements used a scrambled peptide as a control. Analysis should also include Gap peptides specifically targeting Cx26, Cx30, and Cx32 as additional controls.</p>
<p>(4) The mechanism by which ODDD mutations impair CO2-mediated hemichannel opening was not addressed. Also, the potential roles for inhibiting Cx43 hemichannels in the pathology of ODDD are unclear.</p>
<p>(5) CO2 has no effect on Cx43-mediated gap junctional communication as opposed to Cx26 gap junctions, which are inhibited by CO2. The molecular basis for this difference was not determined.</p>
<p>(6) Whether there are other non-beta connexins that have a putative carbamylation motif was not addressed. Additional discussion/analysis of how the evolutionary trajectory for Cx43 maintaining a carbamylation motif is unique for non-beta connexins would strengthen the study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper examines the CO2 sensitivity of Cx43 hemichannels and gap junctional channels in transiently transfected Hela cells using several different assays, including ethidium dye uptake, ATP release, whole cell patch clamp recordings, and an imaging assay of gap junctional dye transfer. The results show that raising pCO2 from 20 to 70 mmHg (at a constant pH of 7.3) causes an increase in opening of Cx43 hemichannels but does not block Cx43 gap junctions. This study also showed that raising pCO2 from 20 to 35 mm Hg resulted in an increase in synaptic strength in hippocampal rat brain slices, presumably due to downstream ATP release, suggesting that the CO2 sensitivity of Cx43 may be physiologically relevant. As a further test of the physiological relevance of the CO2 sensitivity of Cx43, it was shown that two pathological mutations of Cx43 that are associated with ODDD caused loss of Cx43 CO2-sensitivity. Cx43 has a potential carbamylation motif that is homologous to the motif in Cx26. To understand the structural changes involved in CO2 sensitivity, a number of mutations were made in Cx43 sites thought to be the equivalent of those known to be involved in the CO2 sensitivity of Cx26, and the CO2 sensitivity of these mutants was investigated.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study shows that the apparent lack of functional Cx43 hemichannels observed in a number of previous in vitro function studies may be due to the use of HEPES to buffer the external pH. When Cx43 hemichannels were studied in external solutions in which CO2/bicarbonate was used to buffer pH instead of HEPES, Cx43 hemichannels showed significantly higher levels of dye uptake, ATP release, and ionic conductance. These findings may have major physiological implications since Cx43 hemichannels are found in many organs throughout the body, including the brain, heart, and immune system.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Interpretation of the site-directed mutation studies is complicated. Although Cx43 has a potential carbamylation motif that is homologous to the motif in Cx26, the results of site-directed mutation studies were inconsistent with a simple model in which K144 and K105 interact following carbamylation to cause the opening of Cx43 hemichannels.</p>
<p>(2) Secondly, although it is shown that two Cx43 ODDD-associated mutations show a loss of CO2 sensitivity, there is no evidence that the absence of CO2 sensitivity is involved in the pathology of ODDD.</p>

<p>In this paper, the authors aimed to investigate carbamylation effects on the function of Cx43-based hemichannels. Such effects have previously been characterized for other connexins, e.g., for Cx26, which display increased hemichannel (HC) opening and closure of gap junction channels upon exposure to increased CO2 partial pressure (accompanied by increased bicarbonate to keep pH constant).</p>
<p>
The authors used HeLa cells transiently transfected with Cx43 to investigate CO2-dependent carbamylation effects on Cx43 HC function. In contrast to Cx43-based gap junction channels that are reported here to be insensitive to PCO2 alterations, they provide evidence that Cx43 HC opening is highly dependent on the PCO2 pressure in the bath solution, over a range of 20 up to 70 mmHg encompassing the physiologically normal resting level of around 40 mmHg. They furthermore identified several Cx43 residues involved in Cx43 HC sensitivity to PCO2: K105, K109, K144 &amp; K234; mutation of 2 or more of these AAs is necessary to abolish CO2 sensitivity. The subject is interesting and the results indicate that a fraction of HCs is open at a physiological 40 mmHg PCO2, which differs from the situation under HEPES buffered solutions where HCs are mostly closed under resting conditions. The mechanism of HC opening with CO2 gassing is linked to carbamylation, and the authors pinpointed several Lys residues involved in this process.</p>
<p>Overall, the work is interesting as it shows that Cx43 HCs have a significant open probability under resting conditions of physiological levels of CO2 gassing, probably applicable to the brain, heart, and other Cx43 expressing organs. The paper gives a detailed account of various experiments performed (dye uptake, electrophysiology, ATP release to assess HC function) and results concluded from those. They further consider many candidate carbamylation sites by mutating them to negatively charged Glu residues. The paper ends with hippocampal slice work showing evidence for connexin-dependent increases of the EPSP amplitude that could be inhibited by HC inhibition with Gap26 (Figure 10). Another line of evidence comes from the Cx43-linked ODDD genetic disease, whereby L90V as well as the A44V mutations of Cx43 prevented the CO2-induced hemichannel opening response (Figure 11). Although the paper is interesting, in its present state, it suffers from (i) a problematic Figure 3, precluding interpretation of the data shown, and (ii) the poor use of hemichannel inhibitors that are necessary to strengthen the evidence in the crucial experiment of Figure 2 and others.</p>
