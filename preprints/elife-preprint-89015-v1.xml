<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Rapid lymphocyte cell division places enormous demands on the protein synthesis machinery. Flow cytometric measurement of puromycylated ribosome-associated nascent chains after treating cells or mice with translation initiation inhibitors reveals that ribosomes in resting lymphocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> elongate at typical rates for mammalian cells. Intriguingly, elongation rates can be increased up to 30% by activation <italic>in vivo</italic> or fever temperature <italic>in vitro</italic>. Resting and activated lymphocytes possess abundant monosome populations, most of which actively translate <italic>in vivo</italic>, while <italic>in vitro</italic>, nearly all can be stalled prior to activation. Quantitating lymphocyte protein mass and translating ribosomes reveals a paradoxically high ratio of cellular protein to ribosomes insufficient to support their rapid <italic>in vivo</italic> division, suggesting that the activated lymphocyte proteome <italic>in vivo</italic> may be generated in an unusual manner. Our findings demonstrate the importance of a global understanding of protein synthesis in lymphocytes and other rapidly dividing immune cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Naïve lymphocytes are among the smallest nucleated cells in mammals – nearly devoid of cytoplasm, with few mitochondria – and have minimal metabolic activity, consistent with doubling times on the order of hundreds to thousands of days, respectively, for B cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Within a day of activation by cognate antigen, lymphocytes begin to divide rapidly, with reported doubling times as rapid as 2 hours <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Such Jekyll and Hyde behavior requires massive induction of DNA and protein synthesis to support daughter cell production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> as well as synthesizing large amounts of immune regulatory (e.g., cytokines) and effector molecules (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., antibody and cytokines) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Pioneering studies of protein synthesis regulation in lymphocytes utilizing radiolabeled amino acids on mitogen-activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) reported 7 to 20-fold increases in protein synthesis activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. While this is an impressive increase, it was assumed that sufficient protein was synthesized to enable the generation of daughter cells with the same protein content as their progenitor. Moreover, radiolabeling, like all methods, is imperfect, and its accuracy as a measure of protein synthesis rates depends on assumptions that are nearly impossible to definitively verify <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Applying new methods to old problems is a tried-and-true method for generating new insights and discoveries.</p>
<p>Indeed, newer methods, including ribosome profiling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, tRNA arrays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and tandem mass spectrometry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, are revolutionizing the field of protein translation. This includes extending classical methods. Puromycin (PMY) is an aminonucleoside antibiotic that mimics tyrosine-tRNA, binding the ribosome A site and causing rapid chain termination by covalently attaching to the C-terminus of the nascent chain. PMY was first applied in classical protein synthesis studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, and remains a workhorse in understanding ribosomal catalysis of protein synthesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We developed the ribopuromycylation method (RPM) to better localize and quantify protein translation. PM uses a brief pulse of PMY to label elongating nascent chains frozen on ribosomes by treating cells with a translation elongation inhibitor. Ribosome-bound nascent chains are then detected using a PMY-specific monoclonal antibody in fixed and permeabilized cells via standard immunofluorescence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> or flow cytometry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we use RPM, and the ribosome transit assay (RTA), an extension of RPM that measures elongation rates, in conjunction with classic techniques to quantify the number and protein synthesis activity of ribosomes in resting and activated human and mouse lymphocytes. Our findings reveal novel features of lymphocyte translation as well as a discrepancy in the protein synthesis capacity of T cells with respect to their rapid <italic>in vivo</italic> division rates, emphasizing the importance of quantitative accounting as a reality check for our limited understanding of fundamental aspects of cell biology and immunology.</p>

<title>Characterizing protein synthesis in human lymphocytes with flow RPM implicates widespread ribosome stalling</title>
<p>We first used flow RPM to compare translation in non-activated <italic>vs</italic>. PMA/ionomycin/IL-2-activated human lymphocyte subsets after 2 and 5 days in culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We devolved the total flow RPM signals into CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+,</sup> and B cell (CD19<sup>+</sup>) subsets to follow distinct patterns of protein synthesis in each population (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>). Comparing lymphocytes from 3 donors revealed considerable donor heterogeneity in RPM staining of day 2 activated cells and proliferation of various lymphocyte subpopulations.</p>

<p>(A) Primary human lymphocytes from three independent donors were cultured in PMA/ionomycin and IL2 (+PMA/I) or IL-2 only (-PMA/I) for up to 5 days. CD45<sup>+</sup> cells were processed for flow RPM. (B) Primary human lymphocytes were cultured <italic>ex vivo</italic> as indicated, followed by a 15 minute treatment with vehicle, harringtonin (HAR, 5μg/mL), pactamycin (PA, 10μM), emetine (EME, 25μg/mL), or cycloheximide (CHX, 200μg/ml).

</fig>
<p>We performed RPM on cells labeled with CFSE to track cell division by dye dilution (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>). On day 2, activated cells exhibited multiple populations, with nearly all divided cells showing a high RPM signal. We also detected increased flow RPM in a subset of non-divided cells relative to the low level of staining in day 2 non-activated cells. By day 5, many cells were CFSE<sup>lo</sup>, with the highest RPM signals exhibited by divided cells. Many divided cells exhibited near baseline RPM signals, however, consistent with their return to the resting state. Interestingly, although non-activated cells did not divide, ∼50% demonstrated increased RPM staining.</p>
<p>We noted that the RPM signal in activated cells was only 2-to 5-fold higher than in non-activated cells. This increase is modest compared to the ∼15-fold activation-induced increase in protein synthesis in original studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. To examine this discrepancy, we incubated cells for 15 min with harringtonin (HAR) or pactamycin (PA) to block translation initiation or emetine (EME) or cycloheximide (CHX) to block elongation. Elongation inhibitors had minor effects on RPM staining of activated or resting cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), as expected due to ribosome retention of nascent chains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Initiation inhibitors, however, clearly discriminated between day 1 resting and activated cells. RPM signal was diminished by up to 80-90% on day 5 post-activation. Note that at the standard translation rate of 6 amino acids/sec, 15 min is sufficient time to complete translation of all but the very longest transcripts.</p>
<p>We repeated this experiment using day 1 resting lymphocytes to directly compare flow RPM with classical metabolic radiolabeling with [<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>H]-Leucine ([<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>H]-Leu) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Again, mild effects on RPM signal were observed with the translation inhibitors. By contrast, each inhibitor nearly completely blocked incorporation of [<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>H]-Leu into proteins. We also performed a time course examining [<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>H]-Leu incorporation compared to flow RPM signal in day 1 resting, day 1 activated, and day 5 activated human lymphocytes. Plotting the ratios between activated and non-activated cells from RPM flow vs. [<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>H]-Leu incorporation revealed a substantial difference between the two methods (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, we cannot attribute the persistence of flow RPM staining in translation initiation inhibitor-treated cells to incomplete inhibition of protein synthesis. Instead, these data are consistent with a significant fraction of “stalled” ribosomes in cultured resting cells, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., ribosomes with nascent chains that are not actively translating. Stalled ribosomes would be labeled with PMY, as originally described in neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, but would not incorporate [<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>H]-Leu, just as we observe with resting lymphocytes.</p>

<title>Flow RPM measures ribosome elongation rates in live cells</title>
<p>To extend these findings, we developed a variation of approaches that use initiation inhibitors to measure ribosome transit times by conversion of polysomes to monosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> or ribosome profiling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. To derive a relative ribosome transit rate, we incubate cells with HAR for increasing times before shifting cells to 4°C to halt ribosome elongation prior to flow RPM processing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>RPM measures ribosome transit times in HeLa and human lymphocytes</title>
<p>(A) Schematic representation of the ribopuromycylation (RPM) Ribosome Transit Analysis (RTA) method. Translation initiation is blocked and the decrease in RPM is monitored by flow cytometry as the elongating ribosomes run off mRNA. (B) RPM-RTA in HeLa cells. Harringtonin (HAR, 5μg/mL) is used to inhibit new ribosome initiation; emetine (EME, 25μg/mL) is used to freeze ribosomes on mRNA; puromycin (PMY, 50μg/mL) generates RPM signal. Curve is fitted using one phase exponential decay, and ribosome transit times are expressed as RPM half-time to decay. (C) Same as B, but cells are instead lysed in the presence of MG-132 and subjected to anti-puromycin western blot analysis. (D) Representative plots of the RPM-RTA signal in resting and activated human CD45+ lymphocytes (left three panels). Far right, ribosome transit times determined from 3 independent donors. Each dot represents data from one individual donor; the horizontal bars indicate the mean. (E) Ribosome transit times as in A but determined by [<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>H]-Leu incorporation instead of RPM. After treatment with HAR or HAR plus EME, cells were labeled for 5 minutes in 0.25mCi/mL [<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>H]-Leu. Right panel, ribosome transit times determined by [<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>H]-Leu incorporation from three independent donors. Each dot represents data from one individual donor; the horizontal bars indicate the mean.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="514539v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We validated this approach in HeLa cells whose ribosome transit times are well characterized <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. This revealed a curve that follows one phase exponential decay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), with a calculated half-life to decay of 70-150 seconds. Including EME with HAR prevented decay of the RPM signal, as predicted, since EME blocks elongation while enabling (even enhancing) puromycylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Immunoblotting of puromycylated nascent chains validated the approach by showing a time-dependent decrease in puromycin signal and increased M<sup>r</sup> of nascent chains after blocking initiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This is expected since nascent chains present at later time points after blocking initiation will be longer. Incubation of EME with HAR greatly retarded the loss of signal and the shift to longer puromycylated nascent chains.</p>
<p>We applied this RPM-based “ribosome transit assay” (RTA) to investigate translational control in human lymphocytes. Day 5 activated lymphocytes behaved similarly to HeLa cells in their RTA half-life and EME sensitivity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). By contrast, in day 1 resting lymphocytes, there was a limited decay in the signal. Further, the decay was similar in EME-treated cells, consistent with the idea that the flow RPM signal in day 1 resting lymphocytes predominantly represents stalled ribosomes with bound nascent chains.</p>
<p>To independently measure ribosome transit times in day 1 resting <italic>vs</italic>. activated lymphocytes, we treated cells for increasing times with HAR and then pulse-labeled with [<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>H]-Leu (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). This showed that both resting and activated cells demonstrated a decay half-life of ∼90-100 seconds, similar to the RTA values for activated lymphocytes and HeLa cells.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, we conclude that:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A large fraction of ribosomes stalled in resting cultured lymphocytes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Elongation occurs at similar rates for HeLa cells and lymphocytes, with the active ribosomes in resting lymphocytes translating at a similar rate as fully activated lymphocytes.</p></list-item>

<title>Resting human lymphocytes have a dominant monosome population</title>
<p>Protein translation is thought to typically occur in polysomes, consisting of multiple ribosomes transiting a single mRNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Classic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and more recent studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> have established, however, that resting lymphocytes have few polysomes and provided evidence for active monosome translation by their stability in high salt, which dissociates non-translating ribosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Confirming these reports, we found that a large fraction of assembled ribosomes in resting human lymphocytes fractionate as monosomes in sucrose gradients (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>). Polysome abundance increases over two days post-activation. Treating freshly isolated human lymphocytes with CHX to freeze ribosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> did not increase polysome recovery (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2B</xref>). These findings, coupled with our RPM/RTA measurements, indicate that stalled ribosomes are likely monosomes.</p>

<title>Protein Synthesis in Mouse Lymphocytes <italic>ex vivo</italic></title>
<p>Working with human lymphocytes is problematic. Preparations between individuals vary considerably, and the manipulations required to isolate lymphocytes from donor blood, such as elutriation and Percoll gradient purification, increase the time cells spend outside their physiological environment.</p>
<p>Seeking a more reproducible system without the impact of potential artefactual stalling of the translation machinery, we turned to OT-I TCR transgenic mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. OT-I cells are CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for a defined cognate ligand (mouse K<sup>b</sup> MHC class I molecules bound to the ovalbumin-derived SIINFEKL peptide) that can be activated <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>. OT-I T cells can be obtained from spleen or lymph nodes (LNs) in reasonable numbers at ∼80% purity without further manipulation.</p>
<p>RTA analysis revealed that there was no decay in RPM signal for day 1 resting OT-I T cells, consistent with near total stalling of once-translating ribosomes, as we identified in human lymphocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, middle panel). By contrast, in freshly isolated OT-I cells, the RPM signal decays by 50%, consistent with active translation by 50% of the ribosomes. The signal decay t<sub>½</sub> of 40 seconds is consistent with translation of shorter than average mRNAs or stalling on partially translated mRNAs. Polysomes were a minor fraction in freshly isolated mouse lymphocytes, even when mice were pre-treated with CHX (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2C</xref>) (further addressed in the next section).</p>

<caption><title>RPM ribosome transit analysis in OT-I T cells <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>(A) Lymphocytes from spleens and lymph nodes from transgenic OT-I mice were isolated, and either used immediately, cultured for one day in the absence of PMA/ionomycin, or cultured for 2 days in the presence of PMA/ionomycin and IL2. RPM-RTA analysis was conducted to determine ribosome transit half-lives, both with and without EME. (B) Lymphocytes from spleens and lymph nodes from transgenic OT-I mice were isolated, labeled with CFSE, and cultured in the presence of IL-2 and PMA/ionomycin (+PI) or SIINFEKL, PMA/ionomycin, and IL2 (SIIN+PI) for either 24 or 48 hours. Cells were harvested, and RPM-RTA was performed at both 37ºC and 39.5 ºC. Half-life of RPM signal by RTA is plotted; p-values determined by paired t-test analysis.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="514539v1_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>By contrast, day 2 activated <italic>ex vivo</italic> OT-I T cells demonstrated a 20-fold increased RPM signal relative to resting cells, a near total signal decay with a t<sub>½</sub> of ∼70 seconds, and a preponderance of polysomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2D</xref>). This is consistent with the large fractional engagement of ribosomes upon activation. Notably, the decay rate is faster than observed in previous conditions and intriguingly, the rate increases by ∼20% at a “fever” temperature of 39.5 Cº (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This suggests that lymphocytes may be able to exceed the standard mammalian cell elongation rate of ∼6 residues/second <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, particularly under fever conditions, when maximizing T cell protein synthesis is likely at a premium to support their anti-viral activity by rapid division and production of effector molecules.</p>

<p>Mammalian cells evolved, of course, in mammals, not in plastic flasks nurtured by synthetic media in a 20% oxygen atmosphere. We, therefore, adapted the RTA assay to mice. To simultaneously measure resting and activated T cells, we adoptively transferred CFSE-labeled OT-I T cells into congenic B6 mice, which we infected with SIINFEKL-expressing vaccinia virus (VACV) to activate OT-I cells. We injected mice with HAR for 0-10 min, followed by PMY injection and flow RPM processing of harvested splenocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). With each mouse providing a single data point, we could generate RTA curves for non-activated host CD4 and CD8 cells as well as transferred OT-I cells activated by VACV infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). These curves show that nearly all ribosomes with nascent chains in both resting and activated lymphocytes are actively elongating proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

RTA analysis is performed by intravenous injection of HAR and PMY (+/-CHX to prevent leakiness from HAR inhibition alone). Spleens are harvested for RPM analysis on both endogenous and transferred T cells. (B) CFSE-labeled Ly5.2<sup>+</sup> (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>CD45.1<sup>-</sup>) OT-I T cells were adoptively transferred into Ly5.1 (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>CD45.2<sup>-</sup>) mice, which were then infected with VACV-SIINFEKL to activate the OT-I cells. Three days after infection, mice were intravenously injected with HAR simultaneously with PMY for 5 minutes (maximum signal), or first injected with HAR for ∼110, ∼275, or ∼575 seconds before being injected with PMY for 5 minutes. Splenocytes from mice were harvested, surface stained for gating and activation markers as indicated, fixed and permeabilized, and stained for RPM. Gates were CFSE<sup>lo</sup> OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to measure decay in activated cells, and CD44<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD44<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to measure decay in resting T cells. The curve was generated by fitting to a one phase exponential decay. Representative of two independent experiments, 2-4 mice per group, with the mean and standard deviation of the calculated half-life decays as indicated. (C) RTA, with CHX modification, of adoptively transferred OT-I T cells or un-activated host CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in mice infected for 2 or 3 days with VACV-SIINFEKL. 3-4 independent experiments combined, normalized by setting maximum background-subtracted signal to 100.</p></caption>

<p>The elongation rate <italic>in vivo</italic> is surprisingly slower than the <italic>in vitro</italic> rate. Notably, this experiment used our original protocol of PMY alone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) since EME, the inhibitor used to stabilize puromycylated polypeptides on ribosomes <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> was ineffective <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found, however, that CHX is active <italic>in vivo</italic>, arresting the accumulation of puromycylated polypeptides for at least 60 min after injecting PMY (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 3A</xref>). We, therefore, modified the RTA by simultaneously treating animals with CHX with PMY to determine the relative amount of ribosome-associated nascent chains <italic>in vivo</italic>. This enabled comparison of translation activity in various immune cell types using 15 min HAR pretreatment values to subtract the signal from stalled ribosomes. The number of translating ribosomes varies over a narrow range among resting splenic lymphocytes, NK cells, macrophages, and neutrophils (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Using this improved RPM protocol, one day after infecting mice with VACV we now measured a ∼15-fold increase in translating ribosomes in activated OT-I T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 3C</xref>) as compared to the 10-fold increase we previously reported using the original protocol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. As cell division progressed over the next two days, the signal from translating ribosomes decreased (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 3D-E</xref>). We next performed the modified RTA to measure translation rates in OT-I cells on D 2 and 3 post-infection with VACV-SIINFEKL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Ribosome transit times in activated OT-I cells were now in line with the <italic>in vitro</italic> rates, and were ∼20% faster than transit times in recipient (non-activated) T cells.</p>

<p>(A) OT-I mice were treated intravenously with CHX and PMY, and lymphocytes from the spleens and lymph nodes were isolated and subjected to polysome profiling by ultracentrifugation through 15-45% sucrose gradients (resting T cells). OT-I T cells activated <italic>in vitro</italic> for 2 days with PMA/ionomycin and IL2 (without cognate SIINFEKL peptide) were treated either with CHX alone (no PMY control) or CHX with PMY and subjected to polysome profiling. The indicated fractions were collected, pooled, and their ribosomes were re-isolated and dotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane for blotting with antibodies against PMY and RPL7. After subtraction of background signal from the anti-PMY antibody (middle panel), the PMY/RPL7 ratio of monosomes was expressed relative to that of polysomes, which we define as 100% translating.

For activated T cells, lymph node or splenic OT-I T cells were stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> for 2 days with PMA/ionomycin, IL2, and exogenous SIINFEKL, followed by treatment with CHX for 5 minutes. For both resting and activated cells, ribosome-containing lysates were fractionated via ultracentrifugation on 15-45% sucrose gradients.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="514539v1_fig5.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>After setting the puromycylation:RPL7 ratio in polysomes to 100% (assuming that all ribosomes in the polysome fraction are actively translating), we found that 33% of monosomes in resting <italic>in vivo</italic> OT-I T cells and 52% of monosomes in day 2 activated OT-I T cells were puromycylated. Since <italic>in vivo</italic> RTA indicates that there is essentially no stalling of puromycylated ribosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), these data demonstrate robust translation in T cell monosomes. Assuming equal elongation rates, ∼38% and ∼32% of overall translation would occur in monosomes of resting <italic>in vivo</italic> and activated <italic>in vitro</italic> cells, respectively. We note, however, that since PMY reduces the number of polysomes recovered from CHX-treated cells by 5-10%, a small fraction of translating monosomes probably derive from the polysome population.</p>
<p>The high fraction of monosome-based translation is surprising in activated cells. We noted that the activation protocol we used is far less effective than that published by Tan et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> which includes SIINFEKL antigenic stimulation. Direct comparison of the protocols confirmed the superiority of Tan <italic>et al</italic>., as shown by activation markers (CD69, CD25, CD44), cell size (measured by side scatter, which correlates well with automated diameter measurements), and cell division (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 4A-B</xref>). OT-I cells activated by this protocol yielded large increases in the observed polysome fractions of activated splenocytes, or lymph-node-derived lymphocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). This was also evident during high salt fractionation conditions, where we found that 500mM was necessary to fully dissociate non-translating ribosomes compared to the often used 300mM (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 5A</xref>). T cell ribosomes had quantifiable but low levels of monosomes under these high salt conditions (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 5B</xref>, note that we could not obtain enough activated OT-I cells <italic>in vivo</italic> for these experiments).</p>
<p>These findings indicate that monosomes make a major contribution to translation in resting T cells but are likely to make a minor contribution in fully activated cells.</p>

<title>Accounting for translation in lymphocytes: measuring the protein-to-ribosome ratio</title>
<p>Cells need to synthesize sufficient proteins to regenerate a complete proteome each division cycle. This number will depend on the division rate, cell size, protein concentration, and protein loss due to degradation and export (secretion, release of exosomes, loss of other cellular material). To understand how the protein synthesis apparatus enables T cell doubling as rapidly as 2h <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, we quantitated a number of critical protein synthesis parameters in resting and activated OT-I T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

<p>Automated microscope measurements revealed that OT-I T cells increase in diameter from the resting state to the day 1 and day 2 activated states, with a corresponding calculated volume increase (based on spherical geometry) of ∼2.9 fold (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). To quantify protein content, we determined total tryptophan (Trp) autofluorescence of fully denatured proteins in a total cell lysate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Protein content per T cell increases ∼5-fold following activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), from 421 million proteins per cell (assuming an average length of 472 aa and a proteome Trp content of 0.69% <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>) to 2.15 billion proteins per cell in day 2 activated cells, resulting in a net 1.7-fold increase in protein concentration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>We determined the number of ribosomes per cell using a Bioanalyzer electrophoresis device to measure the amount of 18S and 28S rRNA in purified total RNA based on staining with a RNA-binding dye and utilizing a spike-in standard mRNA to control for yield loss during RNA purification (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). The maximal number of translating ribosomes is limited by the less abundant subunit, which in all cases is the 60S subunit (typically 75-90% of the 40S subunit). 60S subunits increased both in absolute terms and per unit cell volume as T cells became activated, reaching a maximum of ∼3.6 million copies per T cell following 2d <italic>in vitro</italic> activation from 264,000 copies in resting T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F-G</xref>). These numbers are similar to those reported by Wolf <italic>et al</italic>. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, but should be more accurate since Wolf <italic>et al</italic>. used total cellular RNA content to estimated ribosome.</p>
<p>Could there be a significant pool of non-functional ribosomes in the nucleus, where initial assembly occurs, and which occupies nearly 50% of the volume of resting T lymphocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and 34% of activated T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>? Immunoblotting of fractionated nuclei shows that the distribution of ribosomes in lymphocytes is similar in resting and activated OT-I T cells and HeLa cells, with only a small fraction of total ribosomal subunits detected in nuclear lysates (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>The ratio of proteins to ribosomes is critical since it dictates the minimal time to replicate the proteome during cell division. This dropped up to 3-fold as T cells became activated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). Since mammalian ribosomes elongate at ∼6 residues per second <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, we calculated the minimal time for a ribosome to recreate the proteome based on the protein/maximally assembled ribosome ratios, not accounting for protein degradation/secretion.</p>
<p>For HeLa cells, it would take a ribosome 19.9 h to synthesize 910 “average” proteins of 472 amino acids, reasonably close to the reported doubling time of ∼24 hours. For OT-I T cells, with an <italic>in vitro</italic> doubling time of ∼9.7 h, the calculated minimal proteome duplication time is also within shouting distance – 10.1 h by day 2. Therefore, the division rates of <italic>in vitro</italic> activated OT-I T cells, and HeLa cells can be approximated from the number of proteins and functional ribosomes translating a full capacity.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>Paradoxical Discrepancy in OT-I Cell Division Rate and Protein Synthesis Capacity</title>
<p>We extended these findings to OT-I T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, determining first that adoptively transferred OT-I T cells divide most rapidly between day 1 and 2 of activation during acute viral infection, with an average doubling time of 6.8 h, slowing to approximately 7.7 h by day 2 post-infection. We sorted for transferred OT-I T cells on day 2 post-infection and measured cell size, protein, and ribosome numbers (“<italic>ex vivo</italic> day 2” measurements in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> graphs). Cells activated <italic>in vivo</italic> were similar in size and protein content to <italic>in vitro</italic> activated cells, but the protein-to-ribosome ratio was significantly higher than <italic>in vitro</italic> activated T cells due to the presence of 2.3 million <italic>vs</italic>. 3.6 million 60S subunits in maximally <italic>in vitro</italic> activated T cells.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the ratio of proteins to ribosomes (1017) at this juncture dictates a minimal proteome duplication time of 22.2 h, nearly 3x the measured doubling time of 7.7 h. While our RTA measurements support a higher elongation rate <italic>in vivo</italic> (t<sub>½</sub>=55 sec <italic>vs</italic>. 70 sec in HeLa cells), the 27% increase (7.6 residues per second) does not come close to accounting for the discrepancy. Thus, a paradox: protein synthesis activity or capacity of T cells does not support their doubling times. The imbalance is far worse in a published description of <italic>in vivo</italic> CD8+ T cell division as rapidly as 2 h <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, assuming that the transgenic T cells studied are similar to OT-I cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Lymphocytes protect jawed vertebrates against viral and cellular microbes and tumors. To counter the essentially infinite diversity of antigens expressed by pathogens, lymphocytes evolved to generate an enormous repertoire of specific antigen receptors. Hosts hope to never need the repertoire, and until a cognate antigen appears, metabolic processes, including protein synthesis, are minimized (this might also extend the life span of naive cells since the generation of DRiPs and other damaging chemical byproducts will also be minimized). Upon activation, lymphocytes can divide with yeast-like haste <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> to achieve numbers capable of exerting effective immunity. Here, we studied aspects of protein synthesis in lymphocytes, a field dormant since the pioneering studies by the Kay and Cooper laboratories in the 70’s but now experiencing a renaissance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To measure translation elongation rates <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, we developed flow RTA, which is far simpler and cheaper than original <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and recent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> methods and provides information at the level of individual cells simultaneously phenotyped by standard flow cytometry markers. While this work was in progress, the Pierre lab described “SunRiSE”, a nearly identical method, to measure elongation rates <italic>in vitro</italic>, observing similar puromycylation decay rates following HAR treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. While our findings are similar regarding the elongation rates of fibroblasts and lymphocytes, we note that our adding elongation inhibitors to the protocol (CHX or EME) increases elongation rate accuracy.</p>
<p>RTA revealed exciting facets of lymphocyte translation. We find that a significant fraction of <italic>ex vivo</italic> lymphocytes possess stalled/primed ribosomes that puromycylate nascent chains but do not transit mRNA. Graber <italic>et al</italic>. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> used the original RPM protocol to show that primary neurons possess substantial numbers of stalled ribosomes, apparently to facilitate rapid translation upon synaptic signaling. Otherwise, to our knowledge, such prolonged ribosomal stalling has not been described in mammalian cells.</p>
<p>Our improved RTA protocol reveals the dramatic upregulation of protein synthesis by OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activated <italic>in vivo</italic>, with a 15-fold increase in translation in day 1 activated OT-I T cells <italic>vs</italic>. resting OT-I T cells. Activated T cells divide every 6.8 h from d1 to d2 post-VACV-SIINFEKL infection. This is consistent with a prior OT-I study in mice infected with a different SIINFEKL expressing VACV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Importantly, by i.v. delivery of translation inhibitors, we show that RTA can be used to measure elongation rates <italic>in vivo</italic>. Though we focus on lymphocytes, <italic>in vivo</italic> RTA can be used to study any cell type in animals that can be analyzed <italic>ex vivo</italic> in suspension by flow cytometry.</p>
<p>Contrary to observations <italic>in vitro</italic>, ribosomes are not stalled in naïve mouse T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, as we show via RTA analysis of non-activated T cells. Importantly, ribosome transit times were up to ∼30% faster in activated cells, consistent with the idea that lymphocytes can accelerate translation to support activation and the rapid cell division that ensues. Similarly, OT-I T cells increased elongation rates <italic>in vitro</italic> when incubated at fever temperature (39.5 Cº). While such accelerated translation may decrease translational fidelity, the impact may be lessened by the terminal nature of lymphocyte division, since the vast majority of activated cells apoptose within a week of activation.</p>
<p>We additionally provide initial measurements of numbers of ribosomes and their protein synthesis activity, key values in accounting for the macroeconomics of T cell protein synthesis. Of particular importance is the ratio of cellular proteins to ribosomes; in conjunction with the elongation rate, this value dictates the minimal time (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., no protein degradation or secretion) for duplicating the proteome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Using the mammalian cell “speed limit” of 6 residues per second <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> mouse T cells do not possess sufficient ribosomes to support a 6-8 h division time, much less the 2h division time reported Yoon and Braciale <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, Even if ribosomes in <italic>in vivo</italic> activated T cells are translating at 7.8 residues per second, the time required to synthesize the proteome is 2.3x greater than the observed replication time (15.5 h vs. 6.8 h).</p>
<p>The discrepancy is further exacerbated when accounting for protein secretion and degradation of DRiPs (30% of nascent proteins) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and retirees (t<sub>½</sub> of ∼32 h over the entire proteome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>) and the presence of stalled and resting ribosomes. Together, this likely doubles the time required to synthesize the proteome.</p>
<p>Something is obviously wrong. T cell doubling times of 6.8 h are very likely to be accurate, as they are simple to measure and are routinely reported in mouse T cell studies. Quantitating proteins, however, is more challenging than it might seem. Where are the potential gremlins?</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Quantitating cellular protein</italic>. We initially used the various dye binding assays for quantitating cellular protein content. While these assays vary notoriously for quantitating different proteins, they provide similar values for the cellular proteome. Moreover, they were in good agreement with a completely independent method based on Trp fluorescence, which we consider the gold standard for protein quantitation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We use Wisniewski and Gaugaz’s value for Trp abundance in the proteome (0.69%) and note that this value is nearly identical to values obtained using the abundance of Trp toted up from proteomic analysis of 11 different human tumor cell lines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> as well as a transgenic T cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. One possible source of error is the free metabolic pool of tryptophan, but this is likely to be less than 5% of protein tryptophan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Another is the presence of serum proteins in cellular lysates. These are unlikely, however, to significantly contribute to our values since we fail to see FBS-derived-BSA in SDS-PAGE of total cell lysates.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Quantitating Ribosomes</italic>. We originally quantitated ribosomes using Abs specific for ribosomal proteins in immunoblots of total cell lysates with purified ribosomes as a standard. We eventually recognized, however, that this approach is limited by potential heterogeneity in ribosome composition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, as well as the presence of free pools of any given ribosomal subunit. It dawned on us that ribosomes are, in principle, simple to quantitate based on their RNA species, which account for &gt;80% of total cellular RNA. Though we initially quantitated rRNA species on agarose gels with purified ribosomes as a standard, we believe quantitation is more accurate using a Bioanalyzer with doped-in highly purified RNA as an absolute staining standard and a control for loss during purification of samples.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Ribosome Elongation Rates</italic>. The classical value of ∼6 or fewer residues per second for radiolabeling studies of cultured cells seems likely to be accurate based on ribosome profiling <sup><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></italic></sup>. A recent ribosome profiling study extends these findings to mice, with <italic>in vivo</italic> elongation rates of 6.8, 5.2, and 4.4 amino acids per second for liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> RTA data demonstrate that translation elongation in <italic>in vivo</italic> activated T cells is 30% faster than in cultured cells and thus is likely to be ∼ 7.8 residues/sec.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>While one or more of these values may yet be inaccurate, we note that Wolf <italic>et al</italic>.’s <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> mass spectrometric-based measurements of <italic>in vitro</italic> T cell protein synthetic capacity supports and even exacerbates the paradox. We must therefore consider the possibility that that lymphocytes are in such a hurry to divide that they resort to the extraordinary measure of acquiring proteins from resting lymphocytes or other cell types.</p>
<p>There are reports that neurons acquire ribosomes from Schwann cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> and that cancer cells acquire mitochondria from immune cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Further, through trogocytosis, lymphocytes acquire cell surface molecules from other cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. We are, however, proposing that lymphocytes acquire a significant fraction of their proteome, perhaps via something akin to emperipolesis or entosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, where cells actively enter homotypic cells and can even divide while residing inside <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In any event, our findings clearly indicate how much remains to be learned about basic lymphocyte cell biology and the importance of simple accounting in squaring our models of cell biology with reality.</p>

<p>Specific-pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory or from Taconic. OT-I TCR transgenic mice were acquired from the NIAID Intramural Research Repository. All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions (including murine norovirus, mouse parvovirus, and mouse hepatitis virus) and maintained on standard rodent chow and water supplied ad libitum. All animal studies were approved by and performed in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. For acute infections, and to generate memory T cells, CFSE-labeled Ly5.2+ (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>CD45.1<sup>-</sup>) OT-I T cells were adoptively transferred into Ly5.1 (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>CD45.2<sup>-</sup>) mice. A subset of these mice was infected with VACV-SIINFEKL for indicated times to activate OT-I T cells, with some mice left uninfected where specified. For experiments done directly on memory OT-I T cells, assays were done 8-9 weeks after infection.</p>

<p>Elutriated human lymphocytes were from healthy anonymous donors at the NIH Clinical Center Department of Transfusion Medicine. After collection, elutriated lymphocytes were purified on a discontinuous 35-70% Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) gradient and washed once with ACK lysing buffer (Life Technologies) to remove contaminating red blood cells. For time-course experiments, purified lymphocytes were resuspended in PBS and labeled with CFSE where indicated (as described above) to enable tracking of cell division over time. Lymphocytes were plated at 1-2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in RPMI: RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 15% FCS, 25mM HEPES (Corning Cellgro), 1mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), and 55uM BME (Gibco). Depending on the experiment, media was also supplemented with recombinant human IL-2 (BRB NCI Frederick, 25 U/mL), PMA (Sigma, 1ng/mL), and ionomycin (Sigma, 100ng/mL). For OT-I T cell cultures, PMA was added at 100ng/ml instead, and, where noted, SIINFEKL was added (100nM) for optimal activation. Lymphocytes were cultured in 6% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C and allowed to sit overnight prior to any experiments unless noted (noted as “freshly isolated”). For time-course experiments, lymphocytes were cultured for up to 5 days and resuspended in fresh media every 2 days.

<p>After lymphocyte isolation, the PBS-washed cell pellet was dissolved in TRIzol; a spike-in mRNA standard was added at this step (CleanCap EGFP mRNA from TriLink, L-7601) to account for RNA loss during processing. RNA purification was conducted as described in the manufacturer’s TRIzol protocol, with 5µg of glycogen used as carrier and the isopropanol precipitation step conducted overnight at -20ºC. The final RNA pellet was dissolved in 50µL of ultra-pure water and roughly quantified to determine appropriate range for the Agilent bioanalyzer chip. Samples, including fresh spike-in mRNA alone, were loaded and run on RNA Nano Bioanalyzer chips (Agilent RNA Nano 6000), with a 70ºC heating step and run on a 2100 Agilent Bioanalyzer. Bioanalyzer 2100 Expert software was used to determine total RNA concentration of each sample and percent area under curve of each peak (mRNA spike-in at approximately 1000 bp, 18S rRNA at around 1800 bp, 28S rRNA at around 4000 bp). The yield of the RNA prep was calculated as follows:</p>
<p>(mRNA spike-in standard peak from an RNA-purified sample) / (average of 2-3 standard peaks from 75ng/µL standard wells) = (fraction of RNA that remains after the purification process).

<p>This study addresses how protein synthesis in activated lymphocytes keeps up with their rapid division, with <bold>important</bold> findings that are of significance to cell biologists and immunologists endeavouring to understand the 'economy' of the immune system. The work is supported by <bold>solid</bold> data but because it proposes non-conventional mechanisms, it requires additional explanation and justification to align with the current understanding in the field.</p>

<p>The authors examine the fascinating question of how T lymphocytes regulate proteome expression during the dramatic cell state change that accompanies the transition from the resting quiescent state to the activated, dividing state. Orthogonal, complementary assays for translation (RPM/RTA, metabolic labeling) are combined with polyribosome profiling and quantitative, biochemical determinations of protein and ribosome content to explore this question, primarily in the OT-I T lymphocyte model system. The authors conclude that the ratio of protein levels to ribosomes/protein synthesis capacity is insufficient to support activation-coupled T cell division and cell size expansion. The authors hint at cellular mechanisms to explain this apparent paradox, focusing on protein acquisition strategies, including emperipolesis and entosis, though these remain topic areas for future study.</p>
<p>The strengths of the paper include the focus on a fundamental biological question - the transcriptional/translational control mechanisms that support the rapid, dramatic cell state change that accompanies lymphocyte activation from the quiescent to activated state, the use of orthogonal approaches to validate the primary findings, and the creative proposal for how this state change is achieved.</p>
<p>The weakness of the work is that several cellular regulatory processes that could explain the apparent paradox are not explored, though they are accessible for experimental analysis. In the accounting narrative that the authors highlight, a thorough accounting of the cellular process inventory that could support the cell state change should be further explored before committing to the proposal, provocative as it is, that protein acquisition provides a principal mechanism for supporting lymphocyte activation cell state change.</p>
<p>Appraisal and Discussion:</p>
<p>1. relating to the points raised above, two recent review articles explore this topic area and highlight important areas of study in RNA biology and translational control that likely contribute to the paradox noted by the authors: Choi et al. 2022,</p>
<p>2. The authors cite the Wolf et al. study from the Geiger lab (doi.org/10.1038/s41590-020-0714-5, ref. 41) though largely to compare determined values for ribosome number. Many other elements of the Wolf paper seem quite relevant, for example, the very high abundance of glycolytic enzymes (and whose mRNAs are quite abundant as well), where (and as others have reported) there is a dramatic activation of glycolytic flux upon T cell activation that is largely independent of transcription and translation, the evidence for &quot;pre-existing, idle ribosomes&quot;, the changes in mRNA copy number and protein synthesis rate Spearman correlation that accompanies activation, and that the efficiencies of mRNA translation are heterogeneous. These data suggest that more accounting needs to be done to establish that there is a paradox.</p>
<p>As one example, what if glycolytic enzyme protein levels in the resting cell are in substantial excess of what's needed to support glycolysis (likely true) and so translational upregulation can be directed to other mRNAs whose products are necessary for function of the activated cell? In this scenario, the dilution of glycolytic enzyme concentration that would come with cell division would not necessarily have a functional consequence. And the idle ribosomes could be recruited to key subsets of mRNAs (transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally upregulated) and with that a substantial remodeling of the proteome (authors ref. 44). The study of Ricciardi et al. 2018 (The translational machinery of human CD4+ T cells is poised for activation and controls the switch from quiescence to metabolic remodeling (doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2018.08.009) is consistent with this possibility. That study, and the short reviews noted above, are useful in highlighting the contributions of selective translational remodeling and the signaling pathways that contribute to the cell state change of T cell activation. From this perspective, an alternative view can be posited, where the quiescent state is biologically poised to support activation, where subsets of proteins and mRNAs are present in far higher levels than that necessary to support basal function of the quiescent lymphocyte. In such a model, the early stages of lymphocyte activation and cell division are supported by this surplus inventory, with transcriptional activation, including ribosomal genes, primarily contributing at later stages of the activation process. An obvious analogy is the developing Drosophila embryo where maternal inheritance supports early-stage development and zygotic transcriptional contributions subsequently assuming primary control (e.g. DOI 10.1002/1873-3468.13183 , DOI: 10.1126/science.abq4835). To pursue that biological logic would require quantifying individual mRNAs and their ribosome loading states, mRNA-specific elongation rates, existing individual protein levels, turnover rates of both mRNAs and proteins, ribosome levels, mean ribosome occupancy state, and how each of these parameters is altered in response to activation. Such accounting could go far to unveil the paradox. This is a considerable undertaking, though, and outside the scope of the current paper.</p>

<p>This paper takes a novel look at the protein economy of primary human and mouse T-cells - in both resting and activated state. Their findings in primary human T-cells are that:</p>
<p>1. A large fraction of ribosomes are stalled in resting cultured primary human lymphocytes, and these stalled ribosomes are likely to be monosomes.</p>
<p>
2. Elongation occurs at similar rates for HeLa cells and lymphocytes, with the active ribosomes in resting lymphocytes translating at a similar rate as fully activated lymphocytes.</p>
<p>They then turn their attention to mouse OT-1 lymphocytes, looking at translation rates both in vitro and in vivo. Day 1 resting T-cells also show stalling - which curiously wasn't seen on freshly purified cells - I didn't understand these differences.</p>
<p>In vivo, they show that it is possible to monitor accurate translation and measure rates. Perhaps most interestingly they note a paradoxically high ratio of cellular protein to ribosomes insufficient to support their rapid in vivo division, suggesting that the activated lymphocyte proteome in vivo may be generated in an unusual manner.</p>
<p>This was an interesting and provocative paper. Lots of interesting techniques and throwing down challenges to the community - it manages to address a number of important issues without necessarily providing answers.</p>

<p>This manuscript provides a more or less quantitative analysis of protein synthesis in lymphocytes. I have no issue with the data as presented, as I'm sure all measurements have been expertly done. I see no need for additional experimental work, although it would be helpful if the authors could comment on the possibility of measuring the rate of synthesis of a defined protein, say a histone, in cells prior to and after activation. The conclusion the authors leave us with is the idea that the rates of protein synthesis recorded here are incompatible with observed rates of T cell division in vivo. Indeed, in the final paragraph of the discussion, the authors note the mismatch between what they consider a requirement for cell division, and the observed rates of protein synthesis. They then invoke unconventional mechanisms to make up for the shortfall, without -in this reviewer's opinion- discussing in adequate detail the technical limitations of the methodology used.</p>
<p>A key question is the broad interest, novelty, and extension of current knowledge, in comparison with Argüello's (reference 27) 'SunRise' method. It would be helpful for the authors to stake out a clear position as to the similarities and differences with reference 27: what have we learned that is new? The authors could cite reference 27 in the introduction of their manuscript, given the similarity in approach. That said, the findings reported here will generate further discussion.</p>
<p>The manuscript would increase in impact if the authors were to clearly define why a particular measurement is important and then show the actual experiment/result. As an example, it would be helpful to explain to the non-expert why the distinction between monosomes, polysomes, and stalled versions of the same is important, and then explain the rationale of the actual experiment: how can these distinctions be made with confidence, and what are confounding variables? The initial use of human cells, later abandoned in favor of the OT-1 in vitro and in vivo models, requires contextualization. If the goal is to address the relationship between rates of translation and cell division of antigen-activated T cells in vivo, then a lot of the work on the human model and the in vitro experiments becomes more of a distraction, unless properly contextualized. Is there any reason to assume that antigen-specific activation in vivo will impact translation differently than the use of the PMA/ionomycin/IL2 cocktail? The way the work is presented leaves me with the impression that everything that was done is included, regardless of whether it goes to the core of the question(s) of interest.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if the authors made explicit some of the assumptions that underlie their quantitative comparisons. Likewise, the authors should discuss the limitations of their methods and provide alternative interpretations where possible, even if they consider them less/not plausible, with justification. As they themselves note, improvements in the RPM protocols raised the increase in translating ribosomes upon activation from 10-fold to 15-fold. Who's to say that is the best achievable result? What about the reliability/optimization of the other measurements?</p>
<p>The composition of the set of proteins produced upon activation will differ from cell to cell (CD4, CD8, B, resting vs. dividing). Even if analyses are performed on fixed cells, the ability of the monoclonal anti-puromycin antibody to penetrate the matrix of the various fixed cell types may not be equal for all of them, depending on protein composition, susceptibility to fixation etc. Is it possible for puromycin to occupy the ribosome's A site and terminate translation without forming a covalent bond with the nascent chain? This could affect the staining with anti-puromycin antibodies and also underestimate the number of nascent chains.</p>
<p>I believe that the concept of FACS-based quantitation also requires an explanation for the non-expert. For the FACS plots shown, the differences between the highest and lowest RPM scores for cells that divided and that have a similar CFSE score is at least 10-fold. Does that mean that divided cells can differ by that margin in terms of the number of nascent chains present? If I make the assumption that cells stimulated with PMA/ionomycin/IL2 respond more or less synchronously, why would there be a 10-fold difference in absolute fluorescence intensity (anti=puromycin) for randomly chosen cells with similar CFSE values? While the use of MFI values is standard practice in cytofluorimetry, the authors should devote some comments to such variation at the population level.</p>
<p>It is assumed that for cells to complete division, they must have produced a full and complete copy of their proteome and only then divide. What if cells can proceed to divide even when expressing a subset of the proteome of departure (=the threshold set required for initiation of division), only to complete synthesis of the 'missing ' portion once cell division is complete? Would this obviate the requirement for an unusual mechanism of protein acquisition (trogocytosis; other)?</p>
<p>Translation is estimated to proceed at a rate of ~6 amino acids per second, but surely there is variability in this number attributable to inaccuracies of the methods used, in addition to biological variability. Were these so-called standard values determined for a range of different tissues? It stands to reason that there might be variation depending on the availability of initiation/elongation factors, NTPs, aminoacyl tRNAs etc. What is the margin of error in calculating chain elongation rates based on the results shown here?</p>
