<title>Abstract</title><p>Exposure to exogenous and endogenous stress is associated with the intracellular accumulation of aberrant unfolded and misfolded proteins. In eukaryotic cells, protein homeostasis within membrane-bound organelles is regulated by specialized signaling pathways, with the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum serving as a foundational example. Yet, it is unclear if a similar surveillance mechanism exists in the nucleus. Here we leveraged engineered proteins called destabilizing domains to acutely expose mammalian cells to nuclear- or cytosolic- localized unfolded protein. We show that the appearance of unfolded protein in either compartment engages a common transcriptional response associated with the transcription factors Nrf1 and Nrf2. Uniquely, only in the nucleus does unfolded protein activate a robust p53-driven transcriptional response and a transient p53-independent cell cycle delay. These studies highlight the distinct effects of localized protein folding stress and the unique protein quality control environment of the nucleus.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The accumulation of misfolded proteins poses an intracellular threat to cell viability as it disrupts protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and normal biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). The accumulation of misfolded proteins and their subsequent transformation into insoluble aggregates is both a causative factor and symptomatic hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>). Since proteins can misfold at all stages of their life cycle, all living cells maintain evolutionarily conserved protein quality control (PQC) pathways to ensure chaperone-mediated folding and refolding, sequestration to protective inclusion bodies, and proteolytic degradation of terminally misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>). The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a highly conserved pathway in eukaryotes and is the primary proteolytic mechanism that targets both misfolded proteins for degradation as well as mature proteins for metabolic turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ciechanover and Brundin, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Proteostasis is disrupted when cells encounter stress or transition into pathogenic states. To address these challenges, cells have evolved stress response pathways that engage various proteins that function as sensors and effectors to mount coordinated transcriptional and translational remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Santiago et al., 2020</xref>). For example, in response to elevated temperatures that cause protein misfolding and damage to cellular components, the heat shock response (HSR) upregulates molecular chaperone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Richter et al., 2010</xref>). Additional PQC pathways exist and have been characterized for several specific types of stress, such as the oxidative stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Santiago et al., 2020</xref>), integrated stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>), unfolded protein response in the secretory pathway (erUPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hetz et al., 2020</xref>), and mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Shpilka and Haynes, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>One hallmark of eukaryotic cells is subcellular compartmentalization facilitated by membrane-bound organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>). These membranes serve as physical barriers that spatially and temporally sequester specialized cellular processes. In some cases, these barriers protect from intrusion by unrelated biochemical processes in addition to intracellular threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bar-Peled and Kory, 2022</xref>). The nucleus, for example, houses the genome and the nuclear envelope restricts the transport of genetic material, whether it is leakage of genomic DNA to the cytosol or invasion by viral genetic material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Maciejowski and Hatch, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). However, these membrane barriers also necessitate specialized pathways to maintain compartment-specific proteostasis and enable inter-organellar communication to coordinate transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>). The erUPR and mitoUPR are two such specialized PQC pathways that respond to acute and chronic stress. Like the ER and mitochondria, the nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle. Although recent work has begun to uncover the distinctive proteostatic challenges and functions of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buggiani et al., 2024</xref>), it remains unclear whether a unique nuclear unfolded protein response to acute proteotoxic stress exists.</p>
<p>Our lab previously investigated whether mammalian cells are sensitive to the appearance of a single species of unfolded protein expressed throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyazaki et al., 2015</xref>). When exposed to a single species of unfolded protein, mouse NIH3T3 cells mount a robust, cross-protective transcriptional response. Interestingly, this response engages the p53 pathway. In contrast, these same cells do not engage p53 when transiently exposed to heat shock to induce the HSR or treated with tunicamycin to induce the erUPR. The engagement of p53 by the appearance of unfolded protein, but not by these other protein folding stresses, suggested an unexplored role for p53 in PQC surveillance and regulation. The tumor suppressor p53 is an unstable protein with a half-life less than 20 min and is sensitive to disruptions of the UPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pant and Lozano, 2014</xref>). The p53 protein stabilizes in response to both specific perturbation (e.g., small molecule inhibition of E3 ligases) and global disruption of the UPS (e.g., proteasome inhibition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pant and Lozano, 2014</xref>). When stabilized, p53 protein transactivates target genes that induce cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kastenhuber and Lowe, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>While the distinct features of the HSR, erUPR, and mitoUPR have been characterized, the existence of a discrete PQC pathway specific to the nucleus is unknown. We sought to compare the response to unfolded protein in the nucleus to that of the same unfolded protein in the cytosol. Miyazaki et al. addressed this question by monitoring a select list of genes by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyazaki et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, we engineered mouse NIH3T3 cells to express a conditionally folded protein localized to either the nucleus or the cytosol. We then employed mRNA sequencing to capture the time-dependent global transcriptional response to compartment-specific unfolded protein. We identified a common set of stress response genes that is induced by both a nucleus-specific and cytosol-specific unfolded protein. Strikingly, we determined that only the nucleus-specific unfolded protein engages the p53 pathway and induces a transient cell cycle delay. Our work highlights the differing consequences of compartment-specific unfolded protein, particularly in the nucleus, and points to the possible role of p53 in a nucleus-specific unfolded protein response pathway in mammalian cells.</p>

<title>Creating compartment-specific unfolded proteins</title>
<p>Destabilizing domains (DDs) are engineered single-domain proteins whose folding state depends on binding to a high affinity cell-permeable ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Banaszynski et al., 2006</xref>). When ligand-bound, the DD adopts a folded conformation and is metabolically stable. In the absence of the ligand, the DD partially unfolds, leading to rapid ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Egeler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Iwamoto et al., 2010</xref>). The processivity of the proteasome ensures the complete degradation of the DD and any fused proteins-of-interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). In cell culture systems, ligand withdrawal is expedited by the addition of purified unliganded protein to the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Egeler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gottlieb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miyazaki et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">2012</xref>). The presence of excess extracellular protein acts a strong thermodynamic sink, facilitating intracellular ligand removal without the need for disruptive handling or media changes. In addition, this method rapidly triggers DD unfolding, leading to degradation of DDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyazaki et al., 2015</xref>) or aggregation of the AgDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gottlieb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miyazaki et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, fusion of a DD to a protein-of-interest enables reversible, tunable regulation of the protein-of-interest’s expression levels in living cells through titration of ligand concentration.</p>
<p>Previous work from our lab used the human <italic>FKBP1A</italic>-derived DD fused to superfolder green fluorescent protein (DD-sfGFP) as a single species of unfolded protein to probe the cellular response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyazaki et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, we began by creating DD-sfGFP constructs that differ in subcellular localization by adding localization signals to the C-terminus of sfGFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Nuclear localization signals are short amino acid sequences that are recognized by import and export factors that actively transport proteins across the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wing et al., 2022</xref>). We named these variants by their localization: throughout the cell (non-targeted DD, ntDD), in the nucleus (NucDD), and in the cytosol (CytoDD). We then stably expressed each construct in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts via viral transduction. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the expected subcellular localization of each DD-sfGFP construct in cells cultured with the stabilizing ligand Shield-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We used these engineered cell lines to induce and compare the cellular responses to compartment-specific unfolded protein. First, we compared key properties of the DD constructs. In the presence of 1 µM Shield-1, the maximal mean GFP fluorescence of each construct was similar (within 6% of the mean of means; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, compare at 0 min). After unfolding was triggered, total GFP fluorescence levels in all 3 cell lines decreased at similar rates (half-lives ranged from 57 to 76 min) and reached near minimal levels by 240 min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). These data indicate that the stability and degradation dynamics of the DD constructs in the engineered cell lines are similar despite differences in subcellular localization.</p>
<p>Next, we asked how the sudden appearance of unfolded DD affects UPS activity. Synthetic reporters of UPS activity have been utilized in a variety of cell culture models and model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bence et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bennett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dantuma et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gierisch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Work and Brandman, 2021</xref>). These reporters are typically comprised of a fluorescent protein fused to a degron, which is a conserved motif that targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Varshavsky, 2019</xref>). Degrons are targeted to the proteasome through either ubiquitin-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ella et al., 2019</xref>) or independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Erales and Coffino, 2014</xref>) mechanisms. When UPS functionality is impaired or demand exceeds available proteolytic capacity, proteasome substrates are transiently stabilized, leading to the accumulation of the fluorescent degron reporter proteins. As UPS functionality is restored or increased, levels of these reporters return to baseline. Therefore, degron reporters provide a quantitative and dynamic readout of UPS activity in living cells.</p>
<p>We generated two distinct UPS activity reporters consisting of mCherry (mCh) fused to a single degron sequence. The ubiquitin-dependent degron reporter (Ub<sup>G76V</sup>-mCh) is rapidly poly-ubiquitylated and degraded by the proteasome through the conserved ubiquitin-fusion degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dantuma et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Johnson et al., 1995</xref>). The ubiquitin-independent degron reporter (mCh-C21) utilizes a hydrophobic, proline-rich 21-amino acid sequence from the C-terminus of the transcription factor NKX3.1 that promotes proteasomal degradation without ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rao et al., 2012</xref>). Although these degrons are targeted by distinct pathways, both report on proteasome activity. We first generated NIH3T3 cells stably expressing a single degron reporter by viral transduction. We then introduced each DD-sfGFP variant through a second round of viral transduction. This resulted in six cell lines co-expressing each combination of a single degron reporter and a single DD-sfGFP variant.</p>
<p>When cultured with Shield-1, the degron reporters are maintained at low levels by constant proteasomal degradation. We quantified ‘proteasome activity’ as the inverse (1/x) of degron reporter fluorescence levels at each time point relative to the initial unstressed state (0 min). Decreases in proteasome activity correspond to increases in the levels of the degron reporters. These events can occur due to impaired UPS function or increased demand for proteasome capacity, resulting in inefficient clearance of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hanna et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kandel et al., 2024</xref>). Upon exposure to any unfolded DD variant, proteasome activity on the ubiquitin-dependent degron reporter steadily decreased, reaching a minimum between 120 and 240 min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, left). After 240 min, proteasome activity increased. Notably, 240 min coincides with the reduction of sfGFP-DD fluorescence signal to near basal levels (i.e., in the absence of stabilizing ligand) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). We observed similar effects of the unfolded DDs on proteasome activity quantified using the ubiquitin-independent degron reporter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, right). These data demonstrate that the appearance of the unfolded DD impacts UPS functionality similarly in terms of magnitude and timing despite differences in subcellular localization.</p>

<title>Global transcriptional profiling reveals common and distinct features</title>
<p>To compare the cellular responses to compartment-specific unfolded protein, we designed an mRNA-Seq experiment using the NucDD and CytoDD cell lines. We harvested cells grown in the presence of Shield-1 (0 min), and at five additional timepoints (15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min) after withdrawal of Shield-1 to trigger DD unfolding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We focused on these time points because the majority of unfolded DD was degraded during this interval (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), coinciding with a decrease in proteasome activity against the degron reporters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

NucDD and CytoDD cells were grown separately to log phase growth in the presence of Shield-1 in the media. Shield-1 was withdrawn to expose cells to unfolded DD for the indicated duration, then cells were harvested for total RNA. Each timepoint was prepared with 5 biological replicates.

</fig>
<p>We identified over 11,000 protein-coding genes with transcripts detected in both cell lines across all timepoints (Supplementary File 1). Using a fold change (FC) threshold of ± 1.5 at a false discovery rate (FDR) of &lt; 0.01, we found 1,442 differentially expressed genes (DEGs).</p>
<p>Lowering the threshold to 1.2 increased the count to 5,795 DEGs. To facilitate downstream analysis, we selected an intermediate FC threshold of 1.4, resulting in 2,199 DEGs. This choice balanced the need for a sufficient number of genes to identify relevant biological patterns and pathways while focusing on the most significantly altered genes. When grouped by time point, we observed DEGs that were commonly changed in both NucDD and CytoDD cell lines as well as those that were uniquely changed in only one of the cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Notably, NucDD exhibited a greater number of up- and down-regulated genes at the 120- and 240- min timepoints than CytoDD.</p>
<p>We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to explore the relationship between time and changes in gene expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). This analysis yielded four key observations. First, samples collected at the same time point cluster together, indicating a high concordance of data collected from each of the 5 biological replicates. Second, NucDD and CytoDD samples collected at the 0-min timepoint form neighboring clusters, indicating that the initial unstressed state is similar between these two cell lines. Third, tracing the samples in temporal sequence reveals similar cyclical paths (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, center and right). Fourth, although NucDD and CytoDD samples follow the same temporal sequence along PC1, they are vertically separated along PC2. This vertical separation is especially pronounced at the 120-min and 240-min timepoints. These data suggest that the cellular response to unfolded NucDD and CytoDD consists of common features that correlate with time (PC1) and distinct features that correlate with unfolded DD localization (PC2).</p>
<p>To identify specific patterns of expression, we employed a two-step clustering approach that simplified the complex three-dimensional relationship between DD localization, gene expression changes, and time. First, we applied k-medoids clustering (k=2) to the normalized fold change dataset. This step partitioned DEGs into two categories that we designated as either the “common set” (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, 1,148 genes) or the “distinct set” (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, 1,051 genes).</p>
<p>Second, we applied hierarchical clustering to each set to generate clusters, each representing a discrete pattern of expression. The common set yielded three major clusters, each exhibiting a visually distinguishable pattern shared across NucDD and CytoDD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). For example, cluster C1 is enriched for genes upregulated at 240 min. The distinct set resulted in three major clusters with markedly different patterns between NucDD and CytoDD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Notably, cluster D1 contains genes that are uniquely upregulated in NucDD at the 120- and 240- min timepoints, respectively, but not in CytoDD (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, top panel).</p>

<p>Beginning with the common set clusters, we performed overrepresentation analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Cluster C1, containing genes upregulated at 240 min in both NucDD and CytoDD, was enriched with ‘proteasome’ genes (<italic>Psma1/5/7</italic>, <italic>Psmb3</italic>, <italic>Psmc2/6</italic>, <italic>Psmd1/3/11/12</italic>, <italic>Psme4</italic>), ‘glutathione metabolism’ genes (<italic>Gclm</italic>, <italic>Ggct</italic>, <italic>Gsta4</italic>, <italic>Gsr</italic>, <italic>Pgd</italic>), and ‘protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum’ (<italic>Dnajb2</italic>, <italic>Hsph1</italic>, <italic>Man1a</italic>, <italic>Mapk9</italic>, <italic>Nploc4</italic>, <italic>Nsfl1c</italic>, <italic>Ube4b</italic>, <italic>Ubxn4</italic>, <italic>Vcp</italic>, <italic>Wfs1</italic>). C1 contained several additional categories related to neurodegenerative disease (spinocerebellar ataxia, prion disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, etc.) which were predominantly comprised of UPS genes. Additionally, we performed overrepresentation analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) terms for biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Both analyses yielded similar results, particularly highlighting the common upregulation of proteasome and UPS components in cluster C1 in response to both NucDD and CytoDD.</p>

<p>Using normalized row Z-scores to represent gene expression changes can obscure biologically meaningful differences in the scale of transcript abundance and magnitude of change. To confirm that our cluster analysis accurately identified comparable responses to NucDD and CytoDD, and to gain deeper insight into these DEGs, we examined the normalized counts for UPS and OSR genes in cluster C1. Normalized counts calculated by DESeq2 are well suited to comparing relative gene expression across samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Love et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Cluster C1 UPS genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) and OSR genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) exhibited similar responses to NucDD and CytoDD when measured by normalized counts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3A</xref> for additional genes identified in C1 enriched pathways).

<title>Unfolded protein in the nucleus robustly induces p53 activation</title>
<p>We next applied overrepresentation analysis to the distinct set of DEGs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Cluster D1 genes are overrepresented by the p53 pathway (<italic>Apaf1</italic>, <italic>Bbc3</italic>, <italic>Ccng1</italic>, <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>, <italic>Ei24</italic>, <italic>Fas</italic>, <italic>Gtse1</italic>, <italic>Mdm2</italic>, <italic>Pidd1</italic>, <italic>Ppm1d</italic>, <italic>Rrm2</italic>, <italic>Sesn2</italic>, <italic>Tnfrsf10b</italic>, <italic>Zfp385a</italic>, <italic>Zmat3</italic>) according to both KEGG and GO analyses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A and B</xref>).

</fig>
<p>This analysis of the distinct set DEGs revealed that upregulation of the p53 pathway distinguished the NucDD from the CytoDD response. However, when we examined the other enriched pathways, we did not identify any upregulated pathways that distinguished the CytoDD response from the NucDD. Therefore, we decided to concentrate our subsequent analysis on the cellular response to unfolded NucDD.</p>
<p>While overrepresentation analysis is useful for identifying enriched pathways within a predefined subset of genes (i.e. genes partitioned into clusters), it does not account for the strength of changes in gene expression. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a comprehensive approach that uses a ranked list of all detected genes in the dataset to identify pathways that are enriched or depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). To determine whether the p53 pathway is uniquely overrepresented in the cellular response to unfolded NucDD, we applied GSEA to each timepoint of the NucDD dataset using the MSigDB mouse hallmark gene set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Castanza et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). We ranked enriched pathways by highest median normalized enrichment score (NES) across all time points (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Out of 26 pathways with positive median NES, the p53 pathway ranked as one of the top enriched, a result consistent with our overrepresentation analysis.</p>
<p>To compare the strength of pathway enrichment, we ranked the pathways by summing the normalized enrichment scores for each pathway from the 60-, 120-, and 240- min timepoints. The ‘p53 pathway’ scored highest (6.86), followed by ‘xenobiotic metabolism’ (6.25), ‘mTorc1 signaling’ (6.21), and ‘fatty acid metabolism’ (5.95). The ‘xenobiotic metabolism’ category was enriched (p &lt; 1e-5) for glutathione metabolism/oxidative stress response genes (<italic>Gclc</italic>, <italic>Gsr</italic>, <italic>Gss</italic>, <italic>Gsta1</italic>, <italic>Gstm4</italic>, <italic>Gsto1</italic>, <italic>Idh1</italic>, <italic>Pgd</italic>). Strikingly, the ‘mTorc1 signaling’ category was enriched (p &lt; 1e-5) for proteasome genes (<italic>Psma3/4</italic>, <italic>Psmb5</italic>, <italic>Psmc2/4/6</italic>, <italic>Psmd12/13/14</italic>, <italic>Psme3</italic>). Taken together, these analyses show that the p53 transcriptional program is robustly activated by the sudden appearance of unfolded protein in the nucleus, but not in the cytosol. In addition, proteasome genes and oxidative stress response genes are highly upregulated, and this is a common feature in the cellular response to both unfolded NucDD and CytoDD.</p>

<title>Unfolded protein in the nucleus induces a transient p53-independent cell cycle arrest</title>
<p>Given the established link between p53 activation and cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kastenhuber and Lowe, 2017</xref>), we hypothesized that unfolded NucDD would induce cell cycle defects via p53 activation whereas CytoDD would not exhibit this effect. To test this, we assessed cell cycle profiles after exposure to unfolded protein by measuring total DNA content and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buck et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Salic and Mitchison, 2008</xref>).

</fig>
<p>Strikingly, we observed that exposure to unfolded NucDD for 240 min reduced the proportion of cells in G1 and increased the population in early S phase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, left). In contrast, exposure to unfolded CytoDD did not induce similar changes in G1 or early S (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, right). We did not observe significant changes in other phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5A</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we tested the involvement of p53 in mediating this cell cycle arrest. We analyzed cell cycle profiles of either wild-type or CRISPR-mediated <italic>Trp53</italic> (p53) knockout cells expressing NucDD. Consistent with previous experiments, exposure to unfolded NucDD induced an accumulation of cells in early S phase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Unexpectedly, this result was independent of p53 status since p53 knockout cells exhibited the same accumulation in early S phase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). In wild-type and knockout backgrounds, we observed that the accumulation of cells in early S phase was highest at 240 min and decreased by 360 min (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Notably, the 240 min timepoint also coincides with the timing of depleted unfolded DD fluorescence signal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Unfolded DDs induce compartment-specific demand on proteolytic capacity</title>
<p>p53 is a short-lived protein and its transcriptional activity is associated with increased stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kastenhuber and Lowe, 2017</xref>), therefore we immunoblotted cellular lysates for levels of p53 after Shield-1 withdrawal.

<p>The short-lived transcription factor Nrf1 is the primary regulator of proteasome genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Northrop et al., 2020</xref>) and Nrf2 regulates oxidative stress response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ngo and Duennwald, 2022</xref>). Similar to p53, their ability to induce transcription is associated with increased stability. Since the RNA-Seq analysis showed that both NucDD and CytoDD induced gene products of these transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ibrahim et al., 2020</xref>), we also immunoblotted for cellular levels of Nrf1 and Nrf2 following Shield-1 withdrawal (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Nrf1 was stabilized by both unfolded NucDD and CytoDD. Nrf2 was stabilized by unfolded NucDD and weakly stabilized by CytoDD.</p>
<p>The short-lived transcription factors we identified possess degron sequences and are known to be regulated by the UPS and maintained at low levels under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kobayashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Northrop et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pant and Lozano, 2014</xref>). Since the unfolded DDs are proteasome substrates and compete for proteasome capacity, we hypothesized that differences in increased stability of p53, Nrf1, and Nrf2 due to competition at the proteasome with the unfolded DD could partially be explained by localization. We wanted to test how compartment-specific proteasome capacity is affected by localized DDs. We designed localized versions of the degron reporters (Ub<sup>G76V</sup>-mCherry-NLS or Ub<sup>G76V</sup>-mCherry-NES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bennett et al., 2005</xref>), then co-expressed them with DDs in NIH3T3 cells. We observed that proteasome activity on the nuclear degron was more strongly affected by the presence of unfolded NucDD compared to CytoDD and ntDD (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, left). Conversely, proteasome activity on the cytosolic degron was more strongly affected by the presence of unfolded CytoDD and ntDD than by NucDD (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, right). We conclude that unfolded DD primarily attenuates proteasome capacity within the same cellular compartment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells, facilitated by membrane-bound organelles, confers tremendous advantages in the regulation and specialization of metabolic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bar-Peled and Kory, 2022</xref>). However, this spatial separation of cellular components also introduces challenges. Each compartment requires PQC surveillance as proteins are vulnerable to misfolding due to mutations, errors during synthesis, cellular stress, and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, researchers have made progress in characterizing PQC pathways specific to the mammalian nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Azkanaz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Frottin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Keiten-Schmitz et al., 2020</xref>). Various experimental approaches and perturbations have facilitated discoveries and informed our current understanding of nuclear PQC mechanisms.</p>
<p>Acute perturbations, such as heat shock or chemical stress, rapidly induce cellular responses but are non-specific, affecting many cellular compartments and biomolecules, thus triggering a wide range of downstream effects. Alternatively, using transgenes to express mutant misfolded proteins enables greater specificity over stress localization and impacted cellular components. However, mutant transgene-induced stress is typically not acute due to the required time for transcription, translation, and accumulation of misfolded products, limiting their effectiveness for probing the immediate kinetics of stress responses. Nuclear PQC studies face an additional challenge in targeting perturbations specifically within the nucleus, while maintaining nucleocytoplasmic transport and communication. Since transcription occurs in the nucleus and protein synthesis in the cytoplasm, intact nucleocytoplasmic transport is an essential element of a coordinated cellular response. These challenges have made it difficult to investigate whether the nucleus is surveilled by a unique PQC program, analogous to the erUPR.</p>
<p>DDs are conditionally folded proteins with features well-suited as molecular tools to address these challenges. First, as genetically encoded transgenes, ligand-stabilized DDs can be localized to compartments like the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyazaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sellmyer et al., 2012</xref>). Second, DD unfolding is rapidly triggered by withdrawal of the stabilizing ligand, as evidenced by their recognition and ubiquitylation by the UPS on the order of minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Egeler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gottlieb et al., 2019</xref>). Third, the sudden appearance of unfolded DD elicits a cellular response in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyazaki et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that the burden created by unfolded DD is substantial enough to exceed a threshold, triggering a cellular response analogous to the erUPR. In the erUPR, this threshold is the point at which levels of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen exceed the baseline capacity of the ERAD system mitigate unfolded protein stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hetz and Papa, 2018</xref>). Here we leveraged these features to investigate the response to the acute appearance of unfolded protein in the nucleus of mammalian cells.</p>
<p>Our lab previously identified the p53 pathway as a novel component of the cellular response to unfolded DD expressed throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyazaki et al., 2015</xref>). However, technical constraints limited us from determining whether unfolded DD in the nucleus and cytosol activate the p53 pathway and other identified genes to the same extent. In the present study, we designed new DD constructs that are matched in molecular size, sequential order of domains, strength of compartment-specific targeting signals, and expressed in cells at comparable total levels by fluorescence (overall lower than in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyazaki et al. 2015</xref>, <italic>data not shown</italic>). These engineered improvements enabled us to differentiate between commonly induced genes and genes that are distinctly induced by NucDD and CytoDD. Importantly, we found that the p53 pathway is uniquely activated by unfolded DD in the nucleus and that it stands out as the most significantly enriched upregulated pathway.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>How does nuclear unfolded protein activate p53?</title>
<p>p53 is a short-lived transcription factor whose stability is tightly regulated by multiple E3 ligases (e.g. Mdm2) leading to proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kastenhuber and Lowe, 2017</xref>). The mechanisms that stabilize and activate p53 are stress-dependent. For example, phosphorylation of p53 by DNA damage response kinases stabilizes p53 by blocking recognition by E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abuetabh et al., 2022</xref>). We have examined the DD-expressing cells but found no evidence that the unfolded DD activates markers of the DNA damage response pathway, suggesting that DNA damage is not the driver of p53 stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyazaki et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors (e.g. bortezomib) stabilizes p53 regardless of post-translational modification status by blocking proteasomal degradation. The stabilization and accumulation of p53 protein promotes its nuclear occupancy and tetramerization, and tetrameric p53 binds DNA with high affinity to drive the transcription of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chène, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>We hypothesize that nuclear unfolded protein stabilizes p53 by competing for proteasomal degradation capacity in the nucleus. Our results from using localized degron reporters demonstrate that unfolded DD promotes cis-compartment degron reporter stabilization more strongly than trans-compartment degron reporters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). In other words, due to increased competition for available local proteolytic capacity, short-lived proteins in the same compartment as unfolded DD are not efficiently degraded and thus transiently accumulate. As a transcription factor, p53 protein is synthesized by ribosomes in the cytosol and shuttled between the nucleus and cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">O’Keefe et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, p53’s NES becomes hidden in the tetrameric state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Foo et al., 2007</xref>), enhancing its retention in the nucleus. Acutely interfering with nuclear proteasome capacity to degrade constitutive substrates promotes p53’s stabilization and nuclear residency, promoting tetramerization and transactivation of target genes. Conversely, when cytosolic proteasomes are overburdened by cytosolic unfolded protein, p53 is still imported into the nucleus where it can be degraded by unburdened nuclear proteasomes. Future studies are needed to test these ideas.</p>

<title>Limitations and next steps</title>
<p>Our work reveals that p53 is sensitive to proteasome stress in the nucleus. While these studies suggest a possible role for p53 in nuclear protein quality control surveillance, it is important to acknowledge limitations stemming from the artificial nature of the DD system. Notably, it remains unclear whether the stress caused by the sudden appearance of an unfolded engineered protein is representative of natural stress. We speculate that biological stressors such as viral infection and aneuploidy might lead to a sudden accumulation of unfolded protein in the nucleus. For example, viral infection can trigger the production of viral proteins that perturb cellular proteostasis to promote aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Muscolino et al., 2021</xref>). Aneuploidy can result in aberrant gene balance, resulting in the production of protein complexes with unbalanced stoichiometry of subunits and orphan proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Oromendia and Amon, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Mislocalized and orphan proteins, especially ribosomal proteins and proteins with intrinsically disordered domains, are known to accumulate in the nucleus and resemble misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kong et al., 2021</xref>). Future work will dissect how our findings can help inform our understanding of cellular response to stress and its relevance to human health.</p>
<p>Our work identified a specific set of p53 genes that are induced by the unfolded DD over a period of four hours. However, not all experimentally validated p53 target genes in mouse models were upregulated according to our RNASeq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fischer, 2017</xref>). This selective gene activation highlights the complexity of p53 regulation and function. p53 regulates several transcriptional programs that can direct cell fate towards cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, survival or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fischer and Sammons, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kastenhuber and Lowe, 2017</xref>). There remain important open questions on how p53 integrates information from multiple signaling pathways and cellular context to direct cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fischer and Sammons, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Vousden, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Our studies shed new light on the shared and distinct protein quality control landscapes of the nucleus and cytosol. In particular, we highlight the specific sensitivity of p53 to nuclear proteasome stress, suggesting that p53 may play a role in nuclear protein quality control surveillance. Future work towards understanding the mechanisms underlying these responses could provide new insights into the cellular strategies for maintaining proteostasis, especially in the nucleus where protein quality control is critical for protecting genomic integrity.</p>

Constructs were cloned into the pBMN retroviral expression vector (Nolan Lab, Stanford University) using appropriate restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs), Phusion or Q5 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and NEBuilder HiFi (New England Biolabs). We used the c-Myc NLS sequence (PAAKRVKLD) for nuclear localized constructs (Ray et al. 2015). We used a synthetic NES sequence (VSSLAEKLAGLDID) for cytosolic localized constructs (Kosugi et al. 2014).</p>
<p>When designing DD constructs, the localization signals were fused at the C-terminus to minimize any potential effects on N-terminal DD folding. We incorporated the V206K mutation into sfGFP to promote monomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zacharias et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblast cells (ATCC CRL-1658) were cultured at 37°C in a standard incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated adult donor bovine serum (DBS, Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine (PSG, Gibco). Ecotropic Platinum-E (Plat-E) retroviral packaging cells (Cell Biolabs) were cultured at 37°C in a standard incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and PSG. Cells expressing DD constructs were cultured in the presence of the cognate stabilizing ligand: 1 µM Shield-1 for FKBPDD and 5 µM trimethoprim (TMP) for DHFRDD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5c">
<title>Cell line generation</title>
<p>Retrovirus was produced by transfecting Platinum-E (Plat-E) cells with pBMN plasmids using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) according to the manufacturer’s standard instructions. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 hours post-transfection and filtered (0.45 µm syringe filter, Fisher). NIH3T3 cells were incubated with retroviral supernatant supplemented with 4 µg/mL polybrene (MilliporeSigma) for 4 hours. Cells were washed once with PBS and then cultured in fresh media for 48 hours to allow for viral integration into the genome. Transduced cells were drug selected by passaging them for one week in 2 μg/ml puromycin or 5 μg/ml blasticidin.</p>

<title>Destabilizing Domain (DD) unfolding</title>
<p>To initiate DD unfolding, we added unliganded recombinant protein purified from BL21 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells to the cell culture media. For FKBPDD-expressing cells, we added purified His<sub>6</sub>-FKBP<sup>F36V</sup> in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of 5 µM. For DHFRDD-expressing cells, we added purified His<sub>6</sub>-ecDHFR<sup>WT</sup> to a final concentration of 50 µM. The presence of excess recombinant protein in the culture media creates a thermodynamic sink that facilitates the withdrawal of Shield-1 from cells without the need for a media change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyazaki et al., 2015</xref>).

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>Cells were plated on 96-well glass bottom plates (Cellvis) in DMEM lacking phenol red (Gibco) supplemented with 10% DBS and PSG. After 48 hours, live cells were imaged on a ImageXpress Micro XLS microscope (Molecular Devices) using the 10x lens (Nikon CFI Plan Fluor, NA 0.3) and Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera.</p>

<sec id="s5f">
<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>Live cells were trypsinized, resuspended in culture media, and kept on ice before flow cytometry analysis. Fixed cells were resuspended in PBS + 1% BSA (bovine serum albumin) and kept on ice. We collected flow cytometry data at the Stanford Shared FACS Facility using the Agilent NovoCyte Quanteon and NovoCyte Penteon flow cytometers. We conducted data analysis in R using the <italic>flowCore</italic> package in the Bioconductor project.</p>

<title>mRNA-Seq</title>
<p>We harvested total RNA using RNeasy kits (Qiagen), QIAShredder columns (Qiagen), and RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). Bioanalyzer (Agilent) was used to check total RNA quality and concentration. The cDNA library was prepared using the Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA kit with 96 unique indices according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 using an S2 flowcell with 2×100 bp paired-end reads.</p>

<title>RNA-Seq analysis</title>
<p>We performed transcript mapping and quantification using Salmon (Patro et al. 2017). We conducted differential gene expression analysis using R and DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Love et al. 2014</xref>). Genes were considered differentially expressed at absolute fold-change (FC) &gt;1.4 and FDR controlled at a Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjusted p-value &lt;0.01.</p>
<p>For the two-step clustering approach, we first calculated the distance metric using Dynamic Time Warping with the <italic>dtw</italic> R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Giorgino, 2009</xref>), followed by k-medoids clustering. We then applied hierarchical clustering using Ward’s method.</p>
<p>We used the <italic>clusterProfiler</italic> R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yu et al., 2010</xref>) to conduct overrepresentation analysis (ORA) with KEGG and GO, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with the mouse MSigDB hallmark gene set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Castanza et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dolgalev, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). For ORA, the background gene set consisted of all detected protein coding genes in the RNA-Seq data. For GSEA, we used the Wald test statistic (log fold change divided by the standard error) calculated by DESeq2 to pre-rank input genes.</p>

<title>Immunoblot</title>
<p>Cells were grown in 12-well plates, and washed with PBS before harvesting. Lysis buffer (1M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail (MilliporeSigma)) was directly added, to the cells before scraping and heating cells to 95°C for 5 minutes. We quantified the total protein concentration of lysate using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher) and normalized all samples to 2.5-5 µg total protein. Samples were run on NuPAGE Bis-Tris precast polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membranes (MilliporeSigma) using the Trans-Blot Turbo system (Bio-Rad). We visualized bands using horseradish peroxidase(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies and Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (MilliporeSigma).</p>

<title>RT-qPCR</title>
<p>Cells were harvested for total RNA using RNeasy kits (Qiagen), QIAShredder columns (Qiagen), and RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). For each reaction, 1.5 µg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription with random hexamer primers and the SuperScript IV First-Strand Synthesis kits (ThermoFisher) follow manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was mixed with primers and iTaq Universal SYBR Green (Biorad) and prepared in triplicate reactions. Quantitative PCR was conducted on a LightCycler 480 Instrument II (Roche). Primers against <italic>Gapdh</italic> were used as the reference.</p>

<title>Cell cycle analysis</title>
<p>Cells were plated in 6- or 12-well plates and the culture media was refreshed the next day. When cells reached 60% confluency, Shield-1 was withdrawn at various times. 10 µM EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) was added for 1 hour before cells were trypsinized and harvested. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and EdU incorporation was detected using Click-iT Plus EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (ThermoFisher), according to manufacturer’s instructions. DNA content was detected using 1 µg/µL FxCycle Violet Stain (ThermoFisher) added to cells 30 minutes prior to analysis. Fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry.</p>

<p>This paper presents <bold>useful</bold> findings that misfolded proteins in the nucleus can impair proteasomal degradation and activate p53. The results supporting the findings are largely <bold>solid</bold>, but <bold>incomplete</bold>. The manuscript could be strengthened by including more quantitative data analyses and additional experimentation/discussions on the mechanism of p53 activation by misfolded nuclear proteins. The work will be interesting primarily to scientists studying protein homeostasis.</p>

<p>Summary of the work:</p>
<p>This manuscript defines the differential stress response signaling induced by nuclear and cytoplasmic protein misfolding. To accomplish this, the authors used superfolder GFP fused to a destabilized FKBP protein-bearing targeting signal for cytosolic or nuclear localization. When cells were grown in the presence of the ligand Shield-1, this protein was stable, allowing fluorescence of the GFP protein. Upon removal of Shield-1, the FKBP protein is unfolded targeting the entire fusion protein to proteasomal degradation. Using this approach, they performed RNAseq to probe similarities and differences in transcriptional responses to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the cytosol or nucleus. As expected, many of the pathways upregulated in both datasets involved protein homeostasis pathways such as the proteasome and cytosolic chaperones. The increase in proteasome subunits correlated with the stabilization of Nrf1 under these conditions, suggesting that protein misfolding might induce proteasome subunits through an Nrf1-dependent mechanism, but this was not explicitly tested. In contrast, the authors report that the p53-dependent transcriptional response was selectively induced by protein misfolding stress in the nucleus, but not the cytosol. Deletion of p53 blocked this increase, indicating that this response is attributable to p53 stabilization. The increased p53 transcriptional activity corresponded with the stabilization of p53 and its target p21 in cells subjected to nuclear but not cytosolic protein misfolding stress. Using a reporter of nuclear proteasome activity, they show that nuclear proteasome activity is reduced in cells following protein misfolding stress in the nucleus, indicating that the stabilization of p53 (and other transcription factors such as NRF1) might be attributed to reduced proteasomal degradation. Additionally, the authors showed that nuclear misfolding stress also induces cell cycle arrest. However, this effect was not dependent on p53 deletion, indicating that this is mediated by other unknown mechanisms.</p>
<p>Major strengths and weaknesses of the methods and results:</p>
<p>The findings reported here define specific transcriptional outputs induced by targeted protein misfolding stress in the nucleus and cytosol, revealing new insights into the organelle-specific stress signaling. The approach is interesting and effective at revealing cellular responses induced by compartment-specific protein misfolding stress.</p>
<p>One major weakness of the study is the lack of mechanistic follow-up for the transcriptional study. For example, what is the mechanistic basis for p53 stabilization by nuclear-destabilized domain (Nuc DD)? Is this entirely caused by diminished nuclear degradation activity as shown in Figure 6 or are there additional factors to be considered? If limited proteasome degradation capacity is the main reason for p53 upregulation, wouldn't the authors also see stabilization of other short-lived transcription factors? The fact that Nrf1 and Nrf2 are also stabilized by Nuc DD is consistent with the authors' hypothesis. On the other hand, if Nuc DD also affects other short-lived transcription factors such as c-fos or c-myc via proteasome inhibition, why did the gene expression analysis only pick up the p53 pathway as the one differentially regulated by Nuc DD? Would this imply that only p53 is specifically targeted by the nuclear proteasome, whereas other short-lived transcription factors are degraded either by the cytosolic proteasome or by both nuclear and cytosolic proteasome like Nrf1? Is there any evidence in the literature that supports this speculation? Additionally, how does Nuc DD affect the UPS system in the nucleus? Does it clog the proteasome directly or affect other assisting factors like chaperones or ubiquitinating enzymes? Lastly, it isn't clear what the functional implications of p53 stabilization would be for cells subjected to nuclear protein misfolding stress, particularly as the small effect on cell cycle arrest is not dependent on p53. In the end, the lack of mechanistic and/or functional follow-up reduces the overall importance of this manuscript. While the reviewers do not expect the authors to answer all these questions by experiments, additional work/clarifications/discussions along these lines would significantly improve the paper (see the recommendations).</p>
<p>Another major weakness is the lack of statistical analysis (SA) to better support their conclusions. In fact, no SA was provided for many figures even though the authors tried to make many comparisons.</p>
<p>The failure of the DD reporter to mount a significant heat shock response was puzzling. The presence of non-native proteins is the primary trigger for the heat shock response, but the authors acknowledge that inducible chaperones such as Hspa1a/b and Hsp90aa1 were not significantly changed in their system (page 8). Could this suggest a problem with the approach? What exactly is the nature of the stress mounted by Nuc DD?</p>
<p>The cell cycle data presented in Figure 5 is less robust, particularly as the p53 data in panels C and D was collected only once.</p>
<p>The Western blot data shown in Figure 6 does not have quantification to show how representative the blot is and how robust the changes in protein levels are over time. Western blots are known to be variable with different replicates and therefore the authors need to mention the number of biological repeats represented by the blot.</p>
