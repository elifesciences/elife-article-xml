<title>Abstract</title>
<p>High-throughput transgenesis using synthetic DNA libraries is a powerful method for systematically exploring genetic function. Diverse synthesized libraries have been used for protein engineering, identification of protein-protein interactions, characterization of promoter libraries, developmental and evolutionary lineage tracking, and various other exploratory assays. However, the need for library transgenesis has effectively restricted these approaches to single-cell models. Here we present Transgenic Arrays Resulting in Diversity of Integrated Sequences (TARDIS), a simple yet powerful approach to large-scale transgenesis that overcomes typical limitations encountered in multicellular systems. TARDIS splits the transgenesis process into a two-step process: creation of individuals carrying experimentally introduced sequence libraries, followed by inducible extraction and integration of individual sequences/library components from the larger library cassette into engineered genomic sites. Thus, transformation of a single individual, followed by lineage expansion and functional transgenesis, gives rise to thousands of genetically unique transgenic individuals. We demonstrate the power of this system using engineered, split selectable TARDIS sites in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to generate (1) a large set of individually barcoded lineages and (2) transcriptional reporter lines from pre-defined promoter libraries. We find that this approach increases transformation yields up to approximately 1000-fold over current single-step methods. While we demonstrate the utility of TARDIS using <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the process is adaptable to any system where experimentally generated genomic loci landing pads and diverse, heritable DNA elements can be generated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transgenesis, which is the specific and heritable introduction of foreign DNA into genomes, has been a central tool for functional analysis and genetic engineering for nearly 40 years. The power of transgenesis is due in part to the wide variety of assays and techniques that are built upon controlled introduction of novel DNA sequences into a native genome. While there are many uses for transgenesis, in practice most can be grouped into those inserting a small number of known sequences (specific transgenesis) and those introducing many sequence variants from experimental libraries (exploratory transgenesis). While the ability to perform specific transgenesis has become a de facto requirement for all model organisms, exploratory transgenesis remains effectively limited to single-cell models (both prokaryotic and eukaryotic) caused by biological limitations generated by inheritance in multicellular organisms. In single-cell models, high-throughput transgenesis has been used for exploratory sampling of sequence space using protein interaction libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Joung et al., 2000</xref>), barcode-lineage tracking libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Levy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nguyen Ba et al., 2019</xref>), directed evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Packer and Liu, 2015</xref>), synthetic promoter library screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), and mutagenesis screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bock et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Erwood et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sánchez-Rivera et al., 2022</xref>). Despite the usefulness of such experiments in single-celled systems, either in microorganisms or in cell culture, increasing transgenic throughput in multicellular models holds the potential to expand the impact of exploratory transgenesis in functional domains, such as inter-tissue signaling, neuronal health, and animal behavior, that are dependent on multicellular interactions and therefore difficult to replicate in single-cell models.</p>
<p>Exploratory transgenesis in single-cell models has been facilitated by the availability of <italic>in-vitro</italic>-generated DNA libraries, selectable markers, plasmids, <italic>in vivo</italic> homologous recombination, and most importantly, the ability to massively parallelize transgenesis using microbial transformation or eukaryotic cell transfection/transduction. Currently, there is no practical means to make populations of uniquely transgenic individuals from sequence libraries at a similar scale in animal systems due to the Weismann Barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Weismann, 1893</xref>): the split between soma and germline. The requirement that the germline be accessible and editable has forced animal systems into a transgenic bottleneck compared to single-cell systems because it is very difficult to introduce exogenous DNA directly into the germline in a high-throughput manner, relying instead on injection, bombardment, or some other physical intervention. This low-throughput limitation in animals dramatically reduces the sequence diversity that can be sampled, effectively preventing large-scale exploratory experiments from being performed. Attempts have been made to parallelize transgenic creation in multicellular model organisms, for example, the development of Brainbow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Livet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Weissman and Pan, 2015</xref>), ifgMosaic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pontes-Quero et al., 2017</xref>), P[acman] libraries in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Venken et al., 2009</xref>), and multiple types of transformation in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ismagul et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, CRISPR technology combined with custom engineered sites within the genome (“landing pads”) has facilitated the generation of single-copy integrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nonet, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Silva-García et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stevenson et al., 2020</xref>), and attempts have been made to multiplex transgenesis using traditional integration methods in conjunction with specialized landing pad systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gilleland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kaymak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mouridi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Radman et al., 2013</xref>). While these efforts have increased throughput over standard single copy integration methods, throughput still remains too low for effective exploratory transgenesis, and in some cases requires significant additional labor, cost, equipment and/or expertise.</p>
<p>Here we present “Transgenic Arrays Resulting in Diversity of Integrated Sequences” (TARDIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Stevenson et al., 2021</xref>), a simple yet powerful alternative to traditional single-copy transgenesis. TARDIS greatly expands throughput by explicitly separating and reordering of the conceptual steps of transgenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To increase throughput, TARDIS begins with an <italic>in vitro</italic> generated DNA sequence library that is introduced into germ cells via traditional low throughput methods (i.e., germline transformation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). While traditional transgenesis typically couples the physical introduction of DNA into cells with the integration of a selected sequence from the original library, the injected DNA sequences in TARDIS are designed to be incorporated in large numbers into diverse, heritable sub-libraries (TARDIS libraries), rather than be directly integrated into the desired genomic locus. In addition to the sequence library, a functioning selectable marker is also included to stabilize the inheritance of the TARDIS library over generations. These TARDIS libraries function to create “metaploidy” – expanding the total number of alleles available for inheritance, essentially making the worm genetically “bigger on the inside.” TARDIS library-bearing animals are then allowed to propagate under selection to generate a large population of TARDIS library carriers. After population expansion, genome integration of a single sequence unit is performed by inducing a double strand break at a genetically engineered landing pad. This landing pad is designed to both integrate a sequence unit and act as a second selectable marker. We chose <italic>C. elegans</italic> to validate the TARDIS approach because <italic>C. elegans</italic> naturally form extrachromosomal arrays that can be several megabases in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carlton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mello et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stinchcomb et al., 1985</xref>) from injected DNA, which lends itself to generating heritable “TARDIS library arrays” (TLA) that encompass sequence significant diversity.</p>

<caption><title>Transformation compared to TARDIS.</title>
<p>For transformation, a large population of cells are individually transformed with a DNA library, resulting in a diverse population of individuals. TARDIS achieves a diversity of individuals by splitting transgenesis into two separate processes: (1) The introduction of a diverse library, which is formed into a TARDIS library array, passed down to future generations and thus replicated; and (2) an event that triggers the integration a sequence from the library at random, resulting in a diversity of integrated sequences.</p></caption>

<p>We demonstrate the functionality of TARDIS for two use cases: unique animal barcoding and promoter library transgenesis. Barcoding has been widely adopted in microbial systems for evolutionary lineage tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Levy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nguyen Ba et al., 2019</xref>) and for developmental lineage tracking in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kebschull and Zador, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">McKenna et al., 2016</xref>). In microbial systems, barcode libraries have relied on highly diverse randomized oligo libraries, as compared to animal systems, which have relied on CRE recombinases or randomized Cas9-induced mutations. Here we present a novel TARDIS barcoding system for an animal model which mimics the scope and diversity previously only possible using microbial systems. Our results show that large, heritable libraries containing thousands of barcodes can be created and maintained as extrachromosomal arrays. Individual sequences are selected and removed from the library upon experimental induction of Cas9 in a proportion consistent with the composition of the TLA with rare overrepresented sequences. We found that TARDIS is also compatible with the integration of large promoters and can be used to simultaneously integrate promoters into multiple genomic locations, providing a tool for multiple insertions at defined locations across the genome. While we demonstrate the system’s advantages in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the system is highly adaptable for any situation where the sequences for integration can be introduced with high diversity and heritability, and where a genomic site for integration can be made or is available.</p>

<title>Generation of barcode landing pad</title>
<p>We designed a specific landing pad for the introduction and selection of small barcode fragments from high-diversity, multiplexed barcode libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This landing pad was designed to be targeted by Cas9 and requires perfect integration on both the 5’ and 3’ ends of a synthetic intron for functional hygromycin B resistance. Current split selection landing pads only provide selection on one side of the double-strand break, which can result in a small percentage of incomplete integrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stevenson et al., 2020</xref>). To fully test a large library approach, the requirement of genotyping to identify correct integrations must be overcome. A split-selection, hygromycin resistance system was chosen for its simplicity and integration-specific selection. A unique synthetic CRISPR guide RNA target sequence was created by removing coding sequence on both sides of an artificial intron, resulting in a non-functional hygromycin B resistance gene. By removing critical coding sequence on both sides of the gene, only ‘perfect’ integration events will result in hygromycin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The synthetic landing pad was integrated at Chromosome II: 8,420,157, which has previously been shown to be permissive for germline expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dickinson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Frøkjær-Jensen et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Generation of high diversity donor library and TARDIS arrays</title>
<p>Transgenes or DNA sequences can be cloned into plasmid vectors for injections in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, the cloning process is laborious, and the plasmid vector is unnecessary for integration into an array or the genome. We sought to provide a protocol for library generation that maximized diversity and eliminated the requirement of cloning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Oligo libraries have been used for barcoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Levy et al., 2015</xref>) and for identification of promoter elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">de Boer et al., 2020</xref>) in yeast, but practical implementation of large synthetic libraries for transgenesis has never been performed in an animal system. We used randomized synthesized oligos to build a highly diverse library of barcodes, similar to the one described by Levy et. al. (2015), via complexing PCR. Given randomized bases present at the 11 nucleotide positions centrally located within the barcode, our base library can yield a theoretical maximum of approximately 4.2 million sequences. Our overlap PCR approach achieves high levels of diversity with minimal ‘jackpotting’ — sequences with higher representation than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3a">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>With low coverage sequencing, we found almost 800,000 unique barcode sequences, providing a large pool of potential sequences that can be incorporated into TARDIS arrays. Only 472 sequences were overrepresented (counts greater than 50), accounting for approximately 6.7% of the total reads and only approximately 0.06% of the unique barcodes detected.</p>
<p>We injected our complexed barcodes and isolated individual TARDIS array lines, each containing a subset of the barcode library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Individual injected worms were singled, and we identified four arrays from three plates. Arrays 1 and 2 were identified on separate plates, and were therefore derived from independent array formation events, while array 3, profile 1 and array 3, profile 2 were both identified on the same plate. Analysis of array diversity within these lines shows, somewhat unexpectedly, that during array formation a subset of barcode sequences tended to increase in frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">B</xref>). Higher frequency barcodes in arrays tend to be independent of the jackpotted sequences of the injection mix as very few are represented in the set of high frequency barcodes from the injection mix. The high frequency barcodes also varied between arrays.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="514301v1_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We found that array formation does not seem to favor any particular barcode sequence motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and that arrays can range considerably in diversity. Array 1 had 1,319 unique barcode sequences, array 2 had 3,001 unique barcode sequences, array 3 profile 1 had 91 unique barcode sequences, and array 3 profile 2 had 204 unique barcode sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3b">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Across the four arrays, we found a total of 4,395 unique barcode sequences. When we compared the individual sequences incorporated during the three independent injections, we found little overlap. 96.5% (4395/4553) of the identified sequences were unique to one injection, 3.0% (136) were incorporated twice, and 0.5% (22) were recovered from all three injections. In contrast to the diversity between injection events, a similar comparison of the two profiles derived from a single injection for array 3 showed considerable overlap, with 68% (62/91) of the profile 1 sequences also being present in profile 2. Overall, our results suggest our complexing PCR oligo library can produce a highly diverse library and that arrays can store a large diversity of unique sequences.</p>
<p>The distribution of element frequency within a given array follows a clear Poisson distribution. Arrays 1 and 2 show more diversity, with barcode frequencies more similar to one another than the two profiles isolated from array 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3b">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The null assumption is that the array is formed from a simple sample of the injected barcodes in equal proportions. However, arrays have been already reported to jackpot certain sequences. For example, when Lin et. al. (2021) injected fragmented DNA, they found that larger fragments were favored in the assembly. In our case, we find some barcode sequences become jackpotted, despite being identical in size. A possible explanation is that early in formation, arrays are replicating sequences, possibly to reach a size threshold. Consistent with this hypothesis, arrays with higher barcode diversity had frequencies closer to one another, while arrays with lower diversity had wider frequency ranges.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Integration from TARDIS array to F1</title>
<p>Our primary motivation in developing the TARDIS method was to utilize individual sequences from the TARDIS array as integrated barcodes. To assay the integration efficiency, we performed TARDIS integration on two biological replicates from a synchronized TARDIS array line (PX786). We found that a portion of the initially plated worms die, likely due to lack of array inheritance. Out of 100 initially plated L1’s, an average of 41 worms (<italic>N</italic>=255 plates) for replicate one, and 62 worms for replicate two (<italic>N</italic>=125 plates), survived to the next day from the initial 100 per plate. Replicate one produced 104 hygromycin resistant individuals and replicate two produced 71. These results suggest that approximately 100-200 worms need to be heat shocked to obtain an integrated line when using 150bp homology arms and relatively small inserts such as the barcodes. To assay the integration frequency from the array to the F1, we performed TARDIS integration on four biological replicates derived from PX786. We found that frequency of integration for barcodes in F1 individuals was strongly correlated with the barcodes’ frequency in the TLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), (<italic>R</italic> ≈ 0.96, <italic>p</italic> ≈ 5.7×10<sup>−154</sup>). Notably, there are two replicated outliers across the four biological replicates. One barcode (TTAAATTATCACATG), tended to integrate more often than would be predicted by its frequency in the array, while barcode (GCTCATTCTGACGTA) integrated less frequently than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In general, however, we did not observe any noticeable bias in sequence motif selection following integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Several individual lineages were isolated from the population with hygromycin selection, validating functional restoration of the hygromycin gene, and three were randomly chosen for Sanger sequencing to confirm perfect barcode integration. As expected, these sequenced barcodes were also found amongst the barcode sequences of the array.</p>

<title>Generation and integration of TARDIS promoter library</title>
<p>For testing insertion of promoter libraries via TARDIS, two separate landing pad sites utilizing split selection were engineered in chromosome II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The first contained the 3’ portions of both the mScarlet-I and the hygromycin resistance genes in opposite orientation to each other and separated by a previously validated synthetic Cas9 target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stevenson et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, the second landing pad site contained 3’ portions of mNeonGreen and <italic>Cbr-unc-119(+)</italic> separated by the same synthetic Cas9 target, allowing both sites to be targeted by the same guide. These landing pads were engineered into an <italic>unc-119(ed3)</italic> background to allow for selection via rescue of the Uncoordinated (Unc) phenotype. A strain containing only the split mScarlet-I/split hygromycin resistant landing pad was also constructed, in which case a copy of <italic>Cbr-unc-119(+)</italic> was retained at the landing pad site. Repair templates contained the 5’ portion of the respective selective gene, a lox site allowing for optional removal of the selective gene after integration (by expression of Cre) and the chosen promotors in front of the 5’ portion of the respective fluorophore. The selective gene and fluorophore fragments contained &gt;500bp overlaps with the landing pad to facilitate homology directed repair. Correct homology directed repair at both junctions resulted in worms that were fluorescent, hygromycin resistant and had wild type movement.</p>

<p>The initial promoter library tested was composed of 13 promoters targeted to a single landing pad site with split mScarlet-I and split hygromycin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These promoters ranged in size from 330-5545bp (total repair template length of 2238-7453bp). Two different array lines were generated which exhibited distinct profiles when probed by PCR as a crude measure of array composition and diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For the selected line, 12 of 13 injected promoters were incorporated into the TARDIS array as confirmed by PCR. From this line, approximately 200 G-418 resistant L1s (ie. those containing the array) were plated onto each of 60 plates and then heat shocked as L2/L3s to initiate integration. Hygromycin resistant individuals were recovered from 59 of the 60 plates, indicating one or more integration events on each of those plates. Four individuals were singled from each of these plates, with the intent of maximizing the diversity of fluorescent profiles and analyzed by PCR to identify the integrated promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on the banding patterns, 83 of these PCR products were sequenced with nine different promoters confirmed as integrated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This included both the smallest (<italic>aha-1p</italic>) and the largest promoter (<italic>nhr-67p</italic>) in the set. Notably, two of the three promoters that were in the array but not recovered as integrants were found to be integrated in a subsequent experiment (see below), suggesting the failure to be recovered in this case was likely due to the array composition rather than any properties of these particular promoters. For approximately half of the plates, two or more promoters were identified from the four worms chosen. Of the 83 PCR products sequenced, five had incorrect sequences and/or product sizes inconsistent with the promoter identified and three failed to prime. Additionally, several samples failed to amplify or gave a non-specific banding pattern and likely also represent incorrect integrations.</p>

<p>To test if TARDIS could be used to target multiple sites simultaneously, a second promoter library containing seven promoters targeted to each site (<italic>ahr-1p, ceh-10p, ceh-20p, ceh-40p, ceh-43p, hlh-16p, mdl-1p</italic>) was injected into worms containing both landing pad sites. Five plates of mixed stage worms were heat shocked, and worms that were both hygromycin resistant and had wild-type movement were found on three of those plates. Worms that were hygromycin resistant but retained the Unc phenotype were also observed on some plates, representing individuals with integrations at a single site. For two of the plates a single pair of integrations was observed, in both cases being <italic>ahr-1p::mScarlet</italic> plus <italic>hlh-16p::mNeonGreen</italic>. For the third plate, two different combinations were recovered: <italic>ahr-1p::mScarlet</italic> plus <italic>mdl-1p::mNeonGreen</italic> and <italic>ceh-40p::mScarlet</italic> plus <italic>ceh-10p::mNeonGreen</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). While multi-site CRISPR is known to be possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arribere et al., 2014</xref>), these results suggest that TARDIS provides a unique way to engineer multiple locations using a single injection.</p>
<p>When transcriptional reporter lines were examined by fluorescent microscopy, expression of the fluorophores was concentrated in but not exclusive to the nucleus, consistent with the presence of nuclear localization signals (NLS) on the fluorophores. For all promoters, expression was seen in at least one previously reported tissue (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) but was absent in one or more tissues for several of the promoters. Expression of single copy reporters is frequently more spatially restricted than that from integrated or extrachromosomal arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aljohani et al., 2020</xref>). The differences in expression pattern may also reflect differences in the region used as the promotor or the fact that only a single developmental stage (late L4/early adult) was examined. Overall, we find that TARDIS can be used to screen functional libraries, either individually or in combination.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we present the first implementation of a practical approach to large-scale library transgenesis in an animal system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Building on over a half century of advancements in <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetics, we can now make thousands of specific, independent genomic integrations from single microinjection events that traditionally yield at most a small handful of transgenic individuals. Increasing transgenesis throughput has long been desired, and in <italic>C. elegans</italic> several attempts have been made to multiplex transgenic protocols. Library mosSCI and RMCE, which both introduce a multiplexed injection mixture and do indeed achieve multiple integrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kaymak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nonet, 2020</xref>). However, just as in the case of standard mosSCI or single donor injections for RMCE, anti-array screening, genotyping, and the direct integration of the process limit the multiplex potential substantially. One group has adopted arrays with small pools of guides coupled with heatshock inducible Cas9 to produce randomized mutations at targeted locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Froehlich et al., 2021</xref>). This protocol shares similarities with TARDIS, in that diverse arrays are coupled with inducible Cas9. However, the focus of that technology was to produce randomized genomic edits, and it does not produce precise, library integrations into the genome. Recently, another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mouridi et al., 2022</xref>) built on the utility of heatshock Cas9 and integrated three individual sequences from an array. While these prior multiplexed methods made substantial contributions in improving the efficiency of specific transgenesis, none have yet demonstrated multiplexing beyond tens of unique sequences—orders of magnitude below what would be needed for exploratory transgenesis. TARDIS therefore provides the first true library-based approach for multiplexing transgenesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

<title>TARDIS as a method for creating barcoded individuals</title>
<p>Genetic barcode libraries have been applied to many high-throughput investigations to reduce sequencing costs and achieve a higher resolution within complex pools of individuals. By focusing the sequencing reads on a small section of the genome, a larger number of individual variants can be identified or experimentally followed. This critical advancement has led to the widespread use of barcoding for evolutionary lineage tracking in microbial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blundell and Levy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Levy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Levy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nguyen Ba et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Venkataram et al., 2016</xref>)–uncovering the fitness effects of thousands of individual lineages without requiring large coverage depth of the whole genome. In addition to this application, using barcoded individuals can be used to facilitate any application that involves screening a large pool of diverse individuals within a shared environment. For example, barcodes have been used in microbial studies investigating pharmaceutical efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Smith et al., 2011</xref>) and barcoded variant screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Emanuel et al., 2017</xref>). The TARDIS-based system presented here provides an approximately 1,000X fold increase in barcoding throughput in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, making it a unique resource among multicellular models that allows the large diversity pool and design logic of microbial systems to be adapted to animal models.</p>
<p>While we designed our barcode sequence units for the purpose of barcoding individuals, this approach could also prove useful in future optimization and functional understanding of array-based processes. In particular, the high sequence diversity but identical physical design of the synthetic barcode library may provide a unique window into extrachromosomal array biology that would be helpful in optimizing sequence units for incorporation into heritable TLAs. For example, an unexpected result of the barcoding experiment was the discovery that a small minority of sequences were overrepresented, or ‘jackpotted,’ in the TLA relative to their frequency in the injection mix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3a">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our expectation was that arrays would form in an equal molar fashion proportional to the injection mix based on the model that arrays are formed by physical ligation of the injected DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mello et al., 1991</xref>). Deviations from random array incorporation have been observed before, and a bias for incorporating larger fragments has been proposed as an explanatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lin et al., 2021</xref>). Our results suggest that the ultimate array composition is not directly proportional to the molarity of the injected fragments, or strictly weighted towards the size of the fragment as has been suggested. In contrast, we propose that array size affects the maintenance of extrachromosomal arrays. As such, selection can act to increase the rate of recovery for arrays that have increased their size through random amplification of some sequences by an unknown process early in the formation of the array or by expansion of similar sequences by DNA polymerase slippage during replication, as has been well documented for native chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Levinson and Gutman A., 1987</xref>). These hypotheses would be consistent with observations of Lin et. al. (2021), if the underlying mechanism for their observation is that inclusion of larger fragments tends to be positively correlated with ultimate array size, and therefore likelihood of maintenance.</p>

<title>TARDIS as a method for the introduction of promoters and other large constructs</title>
<p>While the barcode approach demonstrates the potential for using TARDIS to integrate large numbers of 433bp PCR products, previous work using CRISPR/Cas9 initiated homology directed repair has suggested that integration efficiencies decrease with the size of the insert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dickinson and Goldstein, 2016</xref>). We therefore implemented TARDIS for integrating promoters cloned into a vector backbone and ranging in size from 330bp to 5.5kb, to determine TARDIS functionality under a physically different use case directed specifically at functional analysis. We found that promoter libraries could be integrated into either single sites or two sites simultaneously. Unsurprisingly, the frequency at which various promoters were recovered varied from array to array (for example <italic>ahr-1p</italic> was never recovered in the single site integration experiment, despite being present in the array, while it was the most common promoter recovered in the two-site integration experiment) and likely reflects the same relationship between integration frequency and prevalence in the array, as was seen with the distribution of insert abundance for the barcodes. While we showed that plasmid donors can be used in the TARDIS pipeline, neither of our two arrays contained all 13 plasmids. Given that the estimated 1-13MB size of arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carlton et al., 2022</xref>) would be adequate to hold copies of each of the plasmids, as well as the extreme diversity obtained when using smaller DNA fragments, differential presence of a given promotor fragment was somewhat unexpected. This may reflect a preferential use of linear fragments in the <italic>in-situ</italic> assembly of arrays. Future use of linear fragments where feasible may increase incorporation and overall diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Priyadarshini et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>For both the one and two site promoter library integrations, transgenic individuals were readily detected, suggesting the TARDIS method for integration was highly efficient. It has long been understood that successful CRISPR editing at one site significantly increases the chances of successful editing at a second site. This is the premise behind commonly used co-conversion screening strategies (also referred to as co-CRISPR), such as the <italic>dpy-10</italic> screen commonly used in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arribere et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ward, 2015</xref>). However, to our knowledge, existing co-conversion strategies are based on at least one of the edits being a “small” (&lt;1kb) repair template to generate either an indel or a single nucleotide variation. Here we show that same type of co-conversion also occurs when using only “large” (&gt;1kb), plasmid-based repair templates containing gene-sized repair constructs. Additionally, we have simultaneously targeted the same two landing pads presented here using standard CRISPR techniques and find that approximately half of hygromycin resistant individuals also have rescue of the Unc phenotype (i.e. editing has occurred at both sites; data not shown). Given the high rate of co-conversion, this work demonstrates multiplex integrations are possible not only by targeting multiple repair templates to a single site but also by simultaneously utilizing multiple insertion sites.</p>
<p>In order to recover individual edits most efficiently, given the high frequency of integration using TARDIS, we recommend to either heat shock small cohorts of array bearing individuals, such that most cohorts only yield one edited individual or to screen multiple individuals per cohort. Additionally, while split-selection methods allow for direct verification of integration, depending on the downstream use case, integrations should be confirmed by sequencing as errors can still occur, including internal deletions within the insert.</p>

<title>Expansion of TARDIS to other multicellular systems</title>
<p>Unlocking the investigative potential of transgenesis in animal systems would enable exploratory experiments normally restricted to single-cell models. For example, alanine scanning libraries and protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cunningham and Wells, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Matthews, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wells, 1991</xref>), CRISPR library screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bock et al., 2022</xref>), and promoter library generation (Delvigne et al., 2015; Zaslaver et al., 2006). While we demonstrate the use of TARDIS in <italic>C. elegans</italic> here, the intellectual underpinnings of the approach are agnostic to the research model used. Conceptually, TARDIS facilitates high-throughput transgenesis by using two engineered components: a heritable TARDIS Library containing multiplexed transgene-units and a genomic split selection landing pad that facilitates integration of single sequence units from the library. To generate the first TARDIS libraries, we capitalized on the endogenous capacity of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to assemble experimentally provided DNA into heritable extrachromosomal arrays. Extrachromosomal arrays are formed from exogenous DNA, are megabases in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Woglar et al., 2020</xref>), do not require specific sequences to form and replicate, and can be maintained in a heritable manner via selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mello et al., 1991</xref>). These qualities make them suitable for use as a heritable library upon which TARDIS can be based. To adopt TLAs in systems beyond <italic>C. elegans</italic>, methods must be adopted to introduce large heritable libraries into the germline, as most systems do not maintain extrachromosomal arrays. In mice, the locus <italic>H11</italic> has been used for large transgenic insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), while in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the use of PhiC31-mediated transgenesis coupled with bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) have allowed for many approximately 10kb+ sized fragments to be integrated into their respective genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Venken et al., 2006</xref>). Each of these large integration strategies can provide a vehicle for stable inheritance of a TLA.</p>
<p>The second component of the TARDIS integration system is a pre-integrated landing pad sequence. We have generally favored split selectable landing pads (SSLPs) that use Hygromycin B resistance for its effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mouridi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stevenson et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">2021</xref>). The SSLPs are engineered to accept experiment-specific units from the array. For example, here we used SSLPs designed to accept barcodes for experimental lineage tracking and promoters for generation of transcriptional reporters. To translate TARDIS to other systems, a genomic site needs to be engineered to act as a landing pad that can utilized sequence units from the TLA and can be customized to the specific system and use. Because TLAs allow the experimenter to design the library of interest and the landing pad to recapitulate the strengths of single-cell systems, adoption of TARDIS in multicellular animal experiments can leverage the high-resolution, high-diversity exploratory space of DNA synthesis. In addition to adapting assays currently restricted to single-cell models, TARDIS also opens the door to animal-specific uses, such as developmental biology, neurobiology, endocrinology, and cancer research.</p>
<p>In developmental genetics, the lack of large-library transgenesis has resulted in ‘barcode’ libraries in a different form, utilizing randomized CRISPR-induced mutations to form a unique indel. For example, GESTALT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">McKenna et al., 2016</xref>) creates a diversity of barcodes <italic>in-vivo</italic> via random indel formation at a synthetic target location. LINNAEUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Spanjaard et al., 2018</xref>) similarly utilizes randomized targeting of multiple RFP transgenes to create indels, allowing for cells to be barcoded for single cell sequencing. TARDIS barcodes do not rely on randomized indel generation and thus can be much simpler to implement with sequencing approaches outlined above.</p>
<p><italic>In-vivo</italic> cancer models have also adopted the high-resolution, high-variant detection of barcodes for the study of tumor growth and evolution. Rogers at al., developed Tuba-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rogers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Winslow, 2022</xref>), a pipeline that takes advantage of small barcodes allowing for <italic>in-vivo</italic> quantification of tumor size. In Tuba-seq, barcodes are introduced via lentiviral infection, leading to the barcoding of individual tumors. TARDIS brings the multiplexed library into the animal context without requiring viral vectors or intermediates, thereby allowing large <italic>in-vivo</italic> library utilization and maintenance. Capitalizing on the large sequence diversity possible within synthesized DNA libraries with a novel application in multicellular systems generates new opportunities for experimental investigation in animal systems heretofore only possible within microbial models.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In summary, here we have presented Transgenic Arrays Resulting in Diversity of Integrated Sequences (TARDIS), a simple yet powerful approach to transgenesis that overcomes the limitations of multicellular systems. TARDIS uses synthesized sequence libraries and inducible extraction and integration of individual sequences from these heritable libraries into engineered genomic sites to increase transgenesis throughput up to 1000-fold. While we demonstrate the utility of TARDIS using <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the process is adaptable to any system where experimentally generated genomic loci landing pads and diverse, heritable DNA elements can be generated.</p>

<title>Construction of landing pad for barcodes</title>
<p>To create the barcode landing pad, an intermediate Chr. II insertion vector, pZCS30 was built from pMS4 by using PCR to remove the <italic>let-858</italic> terminator. pZCS30 served as the vector backbone for pZCS32. To assist in cloning, the backbone was split into two PCR fragments. The broken hygromycin resistance gene was amplified in two parts, <italic>rsp-0p::5’ΔHygR</italic> and <italic>3’Δ HygR::unc-54</italic> 3’ UTR, from pCFJ1663 (Addgene ID51484). Overlapping PCR was used to fuse both hygromycin fragments. The resulting broken hygromycing resistance cassette removed the intron found in pCFJ1663 as well as four codons from exon one and three codons from exon two, while also creating +1 frameshift and a reverse orientation guide RNA target for pZCS41. A second overlapping PCR was performed to fuse the broken hygromycin cassette to backbone fragment two. The resulting two-part clone was then assembled to give pZCS32.</p>
<p>The barcode landing pad TARDIS strain, PX740 was created by injecting a mixture of 10ng/μl pZCS32, 50ng/μl pMS8, and 3ng/μl pZCS16 (Addgene ID154824) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stevenson et al., 2020</xref>) into the gonad of young adult N2-PD1073 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Teterina et al., 2022</xref>) hermaphrodites.

<title>Design and construction of barcode donor library</title>
<p>Oligo ZCS422 was ordered with 11 randomized N’s (hand mixed bases) [Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), Iowa, USA] and has the following sequence: CTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT NNNCNNTNTNANNNNAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTG. Four ‘hard-coded’ base pairs were included within the randomized sequence. ZCS422 was used as the core for the generation of two separate complexing PCR barcode homologies referred to as “barcode-15X” and “barcode-20X” to denote the number of complexing cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). All PCRs were performed using the high-fidelity Q5 polymerase (NEB) as per manufacture instructions. All primers used for barcode synthesis can be found in Supplemental Table 3. For both “barcode-15X” and “barcode-20X, the left and right homology arms were generated separately by PCR and purified by gel extraction. An initial 10 cycle PCR was performed to convert the oligo into a 201bp double stranded product which was gel extracted with Zymo clean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Cat. No.: D4008) following manufacture protocol. The low cycle number was done to retain diversity and avoid possible PCR jackpotting.</p>
<p>For “barcode-15X”, to generate the complete donor homology, the double stranded barcode template was combined with both the left and right homology arms for a three-fragment overlap PCR. The reaction contained 325.6ng of barcode template, 107.2ng of left arm, and 102.4ng of right arm. A total of 15 cycles were performed. The lower cycle was again done to reduce PCR jackpotting. The single product was gel extracted as a 433bp fragment. The final donor fragment is referred to as ‘barcode-15X.’</p>
<p>To generate “barcode-20X” a similar three-fragment overlap PCR was used. 162ng of barcode template, 432ng of left arm, and 186ng of right arm were combined and a total of 20 cycles were performed.

<title>Estimation of barcode integration frequency population sample preparation</title>
<p>PX786 was grown to gravid adults in the presence of G-418 with concentrated NA22 transformed with pUC19 for ampicillin resistance as a food source. Once gravid, the strain was hypochlorite synchronized and grown overnight in 15ml NGM buffer with G-418 at 15°C with nutation. For each of the four replicates, a synchronized L1 population was divided in half. The first half was pelleted by centrifugation (2,400g for two minutes) and frozen (−20°C) until processed. These samples represented the array-bearing samples. Another sample of approximately 150,000 L1s was plated to large NGM and subjected to the standard TARDIS heat shock and grown until the population was primarily gravid adults. Then, this population was hypochlorite synchronized and grown in NGM buffer at 15°C with Hygromycin B (250 μg/ml). These entire samples were pelleted and frozen, representing the F1 samples.</p>

<title>PCR for barcode quantification</title>
<p>Several different PCRs were performed depending on the intended downstream sequencing quantification. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref> for a schematic layout of the different PCR steps. The primers used for barcode quantification are given in Supplemental Table 4. To quantify the diversity of arrays from either a bulk population or individual worms, two separate PCRs were performed to quantify the diversity of arrays.</p>
<p>The first PCR (Amplicon one-array) was performed for three cycles to add Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI), allowing for downstream de-duplication. For each sample either 100ng of genomic DNA (bulk samples) or the entirety of the worm lysate (single worms) was used as the template. PCR samples were then purified using the Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit (Cat. No.: D4004) following manufacture protocol and eluted with 24μl water. Samples were not quantified prior to the next step as most DNA will not be from the target PCR product. A second PCR (Amplicon two) using the entire 24μl of the extract from the previous step was performed for 24 cycles to added indices. In some cases, a smaller, non-specific product was also formed, so each sample was run on a 2% agarose gel and extracted for the 169bp size product.</p>
<p>Two separate PCRs were performed to quantify the diversity of integrated barcode sequences. The first PCR (Amplicon one-integrant) was performed for three cycles to add UMI sequences. For each sample, 100ng of genomic DNA was used as the template. PCR products were then purified as described above and followed the Amplicon two protocol. Each product was quantified on a Synergy H1 plate reader using software Gen 5 3.11. Samples were mixed at an equal molar ratio for a 20nM final concentration for Illumina Sequencing.</p>

<title>Illumina sequencing and data processing for barcode characterization</title>
<p>To quantify the diversity of barcodes in each sample, PCR products were sequenced on either a single NextSeq 500 lane or NovaSeq SP, with single read protocols performed by the Genomics and Cell Characterization Facility (GC3F) at the University of Oregon. Compressed fastq files were processed with cutadept 4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Martin, 2011</xref>) to remove low quality reads (quality score &lt; 30, max expected error=1, presence of ‘N’ within the read) and trimmed to 87bp. For the NextSeq lane the specific nextseq trim=30 command was used. The sequences were then demultiplexed using cutadept. For duplicate removal, AmpUMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Clement et al., 2018</xref>) in “processing mode” was used with umi regex “CACIIIIIIIIIIGAC” for individual index files. Deduplicated reads were then trimmed to 15 base pairs with cutadapt for each file. Starcode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zorita et al., 2015</xref>) was then used for mutation correction and counting of each barcode sequence. Each unique sequence was only kept if its final length was 15 base pairs. For the injection mix, each unique barcode was kept regardless of total reads. For all TARDIS arrays and F1 integrations, we used the observed plateau in the number of observed unique barcodes for various count cutoffs to establish a conservative threshold of five or more reads for true barcode sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3c">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Visualizations were created with Python 3.7.13 (Guido <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">van Rossum, 1991</xref>) and matplotlib 3.5.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hunter, 2007</xref>). Sequence logos were created with Logomaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Tareen and Kinney, 2020</xref>).

<title>Design of landing pads for transcriptional reporters</title>
<p>The utilized fluorophores, mScarlet-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bindels et al., 2017</xref>) and mNeonGreen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Shaner et al., 2013</xref>) were synthesized with the desired modifications as genes incorporated into the pUCIDT-KAN plasmid (IDT). First, a SV40 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) was added after the 13<sup>th</sup> codon of the mScarlet-I gene. This same 66bp sequence was also used in place of the first four codons of the mNeonGreen gene. Secondly, a PEST domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Li et al., 1998</xref>) flanked by MluI restriction endonuclease sites and an additional NLS from the <italic>egl-13</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lyssenko et al., 2007</xref>) were added to the 3’ end of the gene. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> Codon Adapter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://worm.mpi-cbg.de/codons/cgi-bin/optimize.py">https://worm.mpi-cbg.de/codons/cgi-bin/optimize.py</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Redemann et al., 2011</xref>) was used to codon optimize both modified fluorophore sequences and to identify locations for three synthetic introns. The first two introns contained 10-base pair periodic A<sub>n</sub>/T<sub>n</sub>-clusters (PATCs), which have been shown to reduce rates of transgene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Frøkjær-Jensen et al., 2016</xref>), while the third was a standard synthetic intron. Finally, the 3’ UTR of the <italic>tbb-2</italic> gene, which is permissive for germline expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Merritt et al., 2008</xref>), was added to the end of fluorophore genes. The modified mScarlet-I and mNeonGreen genes were PCR amplified and assembled into NotI and SnaBI linearized pDSP1, a standard backbone vector derived from pUCIDT-KAN. The resulting mScarlet-I-containing plasmid was designated pDSP6 and the mNeonGreen containing plasmid was designated pDSP7. In addition, pDSP9, a version of mScarlet-I lacking the PEST destabilization sequence was generated by PCR amplifying the shared <italic>egl-13</italic> NLS and <italic>tbb-2</italic> 3’ UTR sequence from pDSP6 and then assembling this fragment into MluI and SnaBI linearized pDSP6.</p>
<p>Landing pads were built using a modification of our previous split landing pad strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stevenson et al., 2020</xref>). Each landing pad contained the 3’ portion of a selectable marker followed by a validated guide sequence and the 3’ portion of a fluorophore. The guide sequence (GGACAGTCCTGCCGAGGTGG<underline>AGG</underline>) has no homology in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome and has been previously shown to allow for efficient editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stevenson et al., 2020</xref>). This sequence was targeted by the plasmid pMS84 which was made from pZCS2, a plasmid made in the same manner as pZCS11 but which is missing a segment of the plasmid backbone, using the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (NEB). mScarlet-I was paired with a hygromycin resistance marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dickinson et al., 2013</xref>) while mNeonGreen gene was paired with the <italic>Cbr-unc-119(+)</italic> rescue cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Frøkjær-Jensen et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Construction of split hygromycin resistance (HygR) /mScarlet-I landing pads</title>
<p>The split HygR/mScarlet-I landing pad was inserted into the well-characterized <italic>ttTi5605</italic> Mos1 site on Chromosome II (Frokjaer-Jensen <italic>et al</italic>., 2008). pQL222 (a gift from Dr. QueeLim Ch’ng), a modified version of the pCFJ350 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Frøkjær-Jensen et al., 2012</xref>) in which the original resistance marker was changed to a kanamycin and zeocin cassette, was digested with BsrGI to provide a linear vector backbone. The <italic>Cbr-unc-119</italic> gene, with a lox2272 sequence added to the 5’ end, and a multiple cloning site (MCS) with a lox2272 site added to the 3’ end were PCR amplified from pQL222. These two fragments were assembled into the linearized backbone to yield pDSP2.</p>
<p>Next, the 3’ 949 bases of the HygR marker were amplified along with the <italic>unc-54</italic> 3’UTR from pDD282 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dickinson et al., 2015</xref>). The primers used were designed to invert the loxP sequence at the 3’ end of <italic>unc-54</italic> 3’UTR from its original orientation in pDD282 and to add the guide sequence to the 5’ end of the HygR fragment. The 3’ 821 bases of the mScarlet-I gene along with the tbb-2 3’ UTR were amplified from pDSP6. These these two amplicons were assembled into a SbfI/SnaBI digested pDSP2 vector to yield pDSP61. Similarly, the mScarlet-I gene was amplified from pDSP9 and assemble into pDSP2 along with the HygR fragment to give pDSP62, a PEST-less version of the landing pad construct. Both the PEST-containing and PEST-less versions of the split HygR/mScarlet-I landing pads were integrated into QL74, a 6x outcross of EG4322 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Frøkjær-Jensen et al., 2008</xref>), using the standard MosSCI technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Frøkjær-Jensen et al., 2012</xref>) to yield strains GT331 and GT332.</p>

<title>Construction of Split Cbr-unc-119(+)/mNeonGreen landing pad</title>
<p>To construct the <italic>Cbr-unc-119(+)</italic>/mNeonGreen landing pad, we wanted to find a genomic safe harbor site permissive to germline expression of transgenes. The <italic>oxTi179</italic> universal MosSCI site on Chromosome II permits germline expression but interrupts <italic>arrd-5</italic>, an endogenous <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene. Therefore, CRISPR-mediated genome editing was used to place the landing pad between <italic>ZK938.12</italic> and <italic>ZK938.3</italic>, two genes adjacent to <italic>arrd-5</italic> whose 3’ UTRs face each other. The genomic sequence CATGGTATAAAGTGAATCA<underline>AGG</underline> was targeted by the plasmid pDSP45 which was made from pDD162 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dickinson et al., 2013</xref>) using the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (NEB).</p>
<p>Chromosomal regions II:9830799-9831548 and II:9831573-9832322 were amplified from genomic DNA for use as homology arms. The self-excising cassette (SEC) was PCR amplified from pDD282 such that the loxP sites were replaced by lox2272 sites. A MCS was amplified from pDSP2 while a linear vector backbone fragment was amplified from pDSP1. All five of these PCR fragments were assembled into a circular plasmid, which was immediately used as a template for seven synonymous single-nucleotide substitutions into the terminal 21bp of the <italic>ZK938.12</italic> gene fragment by Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (NEB). The resultant plasmid was named pDSP47.</p>
<p>The 3’ 846 based of the <italic>Cbr-unc-119(+)</italic> rescue cassette plus the 3’ UTR were amplified from pDSP2 such that the lox2272 sequence after the 3’ UTR was replaced with a loxN site and the guide site GGACAGTCCTGCCGAGGTGGAGG was added upstream of the coding sequence. The 3’ 818 bases of mNeonGreen plus the tbb-2 3’ UTR were amplified from pDSP7. These two amplicons were assembled into StuI/AvrII digested pDSP47 to yield pDSP63.</p>
<p>Following the protocol from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dickinson et al. (2015)</xref>, the landing pad from pDSP63 was integrated into the GT331 strain using pDSP45 as the guide plasmid. Upon integration, this yielded strain GT336. Activation of the Cre recombinase within the SEC by heat shock caused both the removal of the SEC from the mNeonGreen landing pad and the <italic>Cbr-unc-119(+)</italic> cassette from the mScarlet-I landing pad. The combined effect of this double excision event was to yield strain GT337 which has an Unc phenotype and no longer has the hygromycin-resistance and Rol phenotypes.</p>

<title>Design and construction of promoter library</title>
<p>Targeting vectors were constructed to provide the 5’ portions of each split gene pairing. Both targeting vectors had the same multiple cloning site, allowing promoter amplicons to be assembled into either vector using the same set of primers. In addition, each selectable marker gene is flanked by a lox site that matches the sequence and orientation of the lox site flanking the 3’ portion of the marker in the genomic landing pad, allowing for the optional post-integration removal of the selectable marker gene using Cre recombinase.</p>
<p>To construct the split HygR/mScarlet-I targeting vector, the <italic>rps-0</italic> promoter plus the 5’ 627 bases of the HygR gene were amplified from pDD282 such that a loxP site was added in front of the promoter sequence The MCS was amplified from pDSP2 and the 5’ 803 bases of the mScarlet-I gene were amplified from pDSP6. All three of these amplicons were assembled into NotI/SnaBI digested pDSP1 to yield pDSP15.</p>
<p>To construct the split <italic>Cbr-unc-19(+)</italic>/mNeonGreen targeting vector, the promoter and the 5’ 515 bases of the <italic>Cbr-unc-19(+)</italic> were amplified from pDSP2 such that a loxN site was added prior to the promoter. The MCS was amplified from pDSP2 and the 5’ 830 bases of the mNeonGreen gene were amplified from pDSP7. All three of these amplicons were assembled into NotI/SnaBI digested pDSP1 to yield pDSP16.</p>

<p>This manuscript describes an approach for efficiently integrating diverse libraries into the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome. The method is a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution for researchers carrying out experiments that would benefit from easy generation of such libraries, and the data for the effectiveness of the method is <bold>solid</bold>. The relative advantages of this approach in terms of ease and effectiveness relative to others with similar aims will emerge as they are put to more general use in addressing biological problems.</p>

<p>This work describes a novel high-throughput approach to diverse transgenesis which the authors have named TARDIS for Transgenic Arrays Resulting in Diversity of Integrated Sequences. The authors describe the general approach: the generation of a synthetic 'landing pad' for transgene insertion (as previously reported by this group) that has a split selection hygromycin resistance gene, meaning that only perfect integration with the insert confers resistance to the otherwise lethal hygromycin drug. The authors then demonstrate two possible applications of the technology: individually barcoded lineages for lineage tracing and transcriptional reporter lines generated by inserting multiple promoters. In both cases, the authors did a limited 'proof of concept' study including many important controls, showcasing the potential of the method. The conclusions for applications of this method in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are supported by the data and the authors discuss important observations and considerations. In the discussion, the authors expand the application of the method beyond <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which is speculative at this point given that a nontrivial aspect of the success of the method in worms is the self-assembly of DNA into heritable extrachromosomal arrays (a feature that is absent in most other systems).</p>

<p>This paper explores the possibility of integrating diverse and multiple DNA fragments in the genome taking advantage of plasmids in arrays, and CRISPR-Cas.</p>
<p>Since the efficiency of integration in the genome is low, they, as others in the field, use selection markers to identify successful events of integration. The use of these selection markers is common and diverse, but they use a couple of distinct strategies of selection to:</p>
<p>– Introduce bar codes in the genome of individuals at one specific genomic site (gene for Hygromycin resistance with bar code in an intron with homology arms to complete a functional gene);</p>
<p>– Introduce promoters at two specific genomic landing pads downstream of fluorescent reporters.</p>
<p>The strengths of the study rely on the clever design of the selection markers, which enrich the collection of this type of markers. The weaknesses are the lack of novelty in the field in theoretical or practical terms. In fact, they do not show any innovative application of these approaches. Moreover, they show a limited number of experiments in the manuscript, or at least insufficient in my opinion for an article that is based on a methodology.</p>
<p>This work adds to other recent studies, e.g. from Nonet, Mouridi et al., and Malaiwong et al, that use the integration of single and multiple/diverse DNA sequences in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome, and thus is not as groundbreaking as claimed. The real test of this method will be its use to address biological questions.</p>
