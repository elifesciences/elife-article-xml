<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Delineating the complex network of interactions between antigen-specific T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) is crucial for effective precision therapies against cancer, chronic infections, and autoimmunity. However, the existing arsenal for examining antigen-specific T cell interactions is restricted to a select few antigen-T cell receptor pairs, with limited in situ utility. This lack of versatility is largely due to the disruptive effects of reagents on the immune synapse, which hinder real-time monitoring of antigen-specific interactions. To address this limitation, we have developed a novel and versatile immune monitoring strategy by adding a short cysteine-rich tag to antigenic peptides that emits fluorescence upon binding to thiol-reactive biarsenical hairpin compounds. Our findings demonstrate the specificity and durability of the novel antigen-targeting probes during dynamic immune monitoring in vitro and in vivo. This strategy opens new avenues for biological validation of T-cell receptors with newly identified epitopes by revealing the behavior of previously unrecognized antigen-receptor pairs, expanding our understanding of T cell responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The interactions between T cells and APCs form the cornerstone of adaptive immunity. Within the intricate milieu of lymphoid tissue, T cell priming stands out as a discrete and precise process, occurring amidst the multitude of dynamic cellular interactions. Multimerized peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) labeling has been the gold standard tool for capturing antigen-specific T cells from a polyclonal repertoire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. However, such multimers, most commonly tetramers, have limitations in monitoring dynamic interactions of antigen-specific T cells in real-time due to their blocking effect on the immune synapse. Likewise, currently available T cell receptor like (TCRL), also known as peptide-in-groove (PIG), antibodies that detect pMHC complexes are known to disrupt the immune synapse, making them unsuitable for real-time monitoring of antigen-specific T cell interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Although alternative approaches for labeling antigenic peptides with conventional tags such as fluorescent proteins, fluorophores, and biotin-streptavidin have been used, these tags have limitations such as size constraints, membrane impermeability, and photophysically unstable nature, which restrict their use in applications for dynamic monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>To overcome these drawbacks, we have developed a highly specific and minimally disruptive labeling strategy for studying antigen-specific T cell-APC interactions. Our approach involves introducing a six-amino acid tetracysteine tag (CCPGCC) on antigenic peptides and inducing fluorescence using membrane permeable thiol-reactive Arsenical Hairpin (AsH) probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. We have engineered the OVA<sub>(323−339)</sub> peptide by placing the tetracysteine tag at either the amino or the carboxy terminus, away from the TCR and MHC binding sites, to avoid disrupting T cell-APC synapse in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Owing to these modifications, our labeling strategy preserves the T cell priming ability and allows for the detection of the fluorescent signal on the surface of APCs in a MHCII-dependent manner. Using flow cytometry and live microscopy, we found that the labeled peptide is readily taken up by the cognate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with precise specificity in vivo, as previously shown for pMHC complexes taken up from the immune synapse via processes such as trogocytosis and transendocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, we have created new variants of the tetracysteine-tagged OVA<sub>(323−339)</sub> peptide with altered TCR-binding sites and have shown that the AsH probe labeling can track the TCR mediated uptake of nuanced pMHC complexes. This indicates that our labeling strategy is highly robust and forges a novel path for investigating immune responses against altered antigens such as those derived from self, microbiota and tumor microenvironment. Overall, AsH probe mediated immune monitoring offers significant advantages over existing methods, making it a versatile tool for in vitro and in vivo applications including live imaging of the T cell synapse within intact tissue architecture. This novel approach will further our understanding of T cell-mediated immune responses by also complementing tetramers for sorting antigen-specific T cells with precision and extending it to newly discovered epitopes.</p>

<sec id="s2.1">
<title>Signal intensity is determined by the sequence and placement of tetracysteine tag</title>
<p>We first generated OVA<sub>323 − 339</sub> variants by placing a tetracysteine tag “CCPGCC” at amino or carboxy termini, either consecutively or via a flexible ε-amino-caproic acid (ε-ACA) linker to prevent endosomallysosomal enzymatic digestion to the tag. This yielded four variant peptides named as C- (carboxy terminus without linker), N- (amino terminus without linker), NACA- (amino terminus with ε-ACA) and CACA- (carboxy terminus with ε-ACA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We used these variants to load mature C57BL/6 CD11c<sup>+</sup> splenic DCs from C57BL/6 mice and induced fluorescence by treating cells with Fluorescein-AsH (FlAsH) probe. Flow cytometry analysis showed that CACA- peptide combination but not the other tested variants induced a distinguished fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Cysteine is naturally oxidation prone and this may reduce FlAsH binding to tetracysteine tag. We addressed this problem by pre-treating OVA<sub>CACA</sub> with tris-2-carboxyethylphosphine (TCEP), an irreversible reducing agent that blocks cystine disulfide bridge formation and elicited a consistent FlAsH signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Moreover, we used another AsH probe excitable by 561 nm laser, called ReAsH, to occupy non-specific cysteine residues that would otherwise attract FlAsH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Pre-incubation of DCs with ReAsH improved signal to noise ratio significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>). We have created additional OVA variants to enhance signal intensity. These variants include one with two tetracysteine residues and another with a longer tetracysteine tag that withstands the British anti-Lewisite (BAL) wash, a crucial step to reduce background labeling by removing excess AsH probe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. However, new variants provided FlAsH intensity comparable to the original CACA variant, indicating no additional benefit for longer tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>

<title>Tetracysteine tag does not alter the immunogenicity of peptide</title>
<p>Next, we sought to compare the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell priming ability of four tetracysteine-tagged OVA<sub>323 − 339</sub> variants and that of native peptide in vitro. To do so, naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated from OVA<sub>323 − 339</sub> specific TCR transgenic OTII mice, labelled with a proliferation dye and cocultured with mature CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs that were pre-loaded with equimolar amount peptides for three days. Proliferation and activation status of OTII T cells were not altered by the presence or placement of the tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a-d</xref>). Subsequently, DCs were pulsed with OVA<sub>CACA</sub> vs. native peptide, treated with FlAsH and cocultured with fluorescently labeled OTII T cells for live confocal microscopy imaging. Within the first hours of coculture, OTII T cells established stable contact with OVA<sub>CACA</sub>-pulsed DCs and FlAsH-labeled peptide gradually concentrated at the contact site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e</xref>). At 24 hours after treatment, OTII T cells in the peptide-treated groups exhibited increased volume and a shift towards a less spherical shape, indicative of T cell blasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction of T cells with OVA<sub>CACA</sub> and native OVA<sub>323 − 339</sub> pulsed DCs resulted in a comparable decrease in T cell motility, suggesting that the tag had no impact on their dynamics in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2g</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we performed a series of adoptive transfers to measure immunogenicity and signal persistence of tetracysteine-tagged peptides in vivo using two-photon microscopy and flow cytometry. Splenic DCs from β-Actin DsRed mice were pulsed with a peptide mix comprised of equimolar amounts of OVA-Biotin and OVA<sub>CACA</sub>, where OVA-Biotin served as a positive control for flow cytometry. This was followed by ReAsH and optimized FlAsH treatments as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and adoptive transfer into C57BL/6 recipients via footpad injection. Naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated from OTII and WT C57BL/6 spleens, labelled with distinct cell-tracker dyes, mixed 1:1 and transferred into recipients via retroorbital i.v. injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>). As previously demonstrated, adoptively transferred DCs were detectable in the popliteal lymph node 18–24 h post-transfer and they largely disappeared by 48 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. FlAsH signal remained stable on DCs for the entire duration DCs were present in the lymph node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Strikingly, FlAsH was picked up by the cognate OTII T cells, suggestive of an antigen-specific peptide major histocompatibility complex II (pMHCII) trogocytosis in-vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c, d</xref>). Antigen-specific transfer was also confirmed by OVA-Biotin staining on OTII T cells by fluorochrome conjugated streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c, d</xref>). We had previously shown that antigen-specific Treg cells trogocytose pMHCII from DC synapse more efficiently than their effector CD4 + T cell counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. To quantify FlAsH signal picked up by OVA<sub>323 − 339</sub>-specific Treg cells, naïve OTII T cells were differentiated into induced Treg (iTreg) cells. While iTreg cells cocultured with antigen-pulsed DCs performed greater MHCII trogocytosis than naïve T cells at 18 h in vitro, peptide-specific trogocytosis was indiscernible within this time frame (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data1">Supplementary Fig. 1a-b</xref>). Similar to naïve OTII T cells, OTII iTreg cells acquired OVA<sub>CACA</sub> and OVA-Biotin, with distinct peptide-specific signal and proliferative response on day 2 post-adoptive transfer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data1">Supplementary Fig. 1c-f</xref>).</p>

<p>Intravital two-photon microscopy of the popliteal lymph node further confirmed the antigenicity of OVA<sub>CACA</sub> in vivo by revealing the morphological changes compatible with T cell priming such as increased T cell volume and decreased sphericity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3e</xref>). OTII-DC synapses had greater 3D volume and duration and harbored more FlAsH than surrounding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3g-h</xref>). Overall, FlAsH signal was exclusively picked up by OTII T cells imaged, as early as 18 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid1">Supplementary video 1</xref>).</p>

<title>AsH-probe robustly tracks pMHCII complexes</title>
<p>To delineate whether FlAsH labeling reports free vs. MHCII-bound peptide in cells, we initially assessed how surface MHCII expression of cells correlates with the OVA<sub>CACA</sub>-FlAsH signal. C57BL/6 splenocytes were incubated with OVA-Biotin or OVA<sub>CACA</sub> and peptide distributions among the T cells, B cells and DCs were quantified by flow cytometry using streptavidin or FlAsH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Both streptavidin and FlAsH signals correlated significantly with MHCII expression, providing the strongest signal in DCs, where CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells served as a negative control due to lack of MHCII expression in mouse T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>). It is worth mentioning that streptavidin detection of biotinylated peptide is a viable option for quantifying peptide loading on cells. However, size and membrane impermeable nature of streptavidin make it unsuitable for assays that include live monitoring of the T-DC interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Next, we addressed whether FlAsH labeling of OVA<sub>CACA</sub>-pulsed DCs is dependent on the MHC expression. CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs were isolated from MHCII single knockout or MHCI and II double knockout (KO) mice, labeled with tracking dyes and mixed 1:1 with WT C57BL/6 DCs. Subsequently, they were incubated with OVA<sub>CACA</sub> and treated with ReAsH and FlAsH as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4e</xref>). To make a fair comparison between WT and KO DCs and minimize autofluorescence, we performed adoptive transfers, aiming to facilitate in vivo elimination of apoptotic and possibly defective KO DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Flow cytometry analysis of the draining lymph node demonstrated that WT DCs, but not MHCII KO DCs, harbored FlAsH. Two-photon microscopy of the lymph node further confirmed these findings, indicating that FlAsH robustly marks OVA<sub>CACA</sub>-MHCII complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4e-h</xref>).</p>

<p>To address how FlAsH acquisition from synapse marks antigen-specific vs. bystander T cells, DCs were labeled with ReAsH and cell membrane dye PKH-26, pulsed with OVA<sub>CACA</sub>, Eα<sub>(52−68)</sub> or left unpulsed. Next, they were treated with FlAsH and injected into the recipient mice via footpad. Subsequently, 1:1 mixture of labeled naïve OTII and Eα-specific T cells were adoptively transferred into via retroorbital sinus i.v. and the popliteal lymph nodes of the recipients were removed 18 h after the transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis showed that OTII and Eα-specific T cells both acquired PKH-26 from double-pulsed DCs, indicating that they captured DC cell membrane from synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5b</xref>). This process is termed as TCR-mediated trogocytosis and has previously been described as a feature of the DC-T cell synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Although both T cell types trogocytosed double-pulsed DC cell membrane, FlAsH signal was picked up only by OTII T cells, suggesting that FlAsH tracks pMHCII mobility with a high precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>

<title>Tetracysteine-tagging of peptides provides a sensitive tool to visualize interactions with altered TCR affinity</title>
<p>The lack of adaptable antigen-targeted probes presents a significant obstacle in the dynamic visualization of antigen-specific immunity. To address this gap, we sought to determine robustness of tetracysteine tagging in visualizing nuanced pMHCII variants. We created three variants by introducing alanine mutations at the TCR binding residues 331, 333, and 335 of OVA<sub>CACA</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6a</xref>). The mutations at 331 and 333, depicted as variants 1 and 2 respectively, were previously reported to abolish the binding of OTII TCR to OVA<sub>323 − 339</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Although the residue 335 is flanked between the core OTII TCR binding residues 333 and 336, mutant 335 was shown to elicit normal proliferative response in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. We addressed how pMHCII uptake by T cells is influenced by the mutation of TCR binding residues of OVA<sub>CACA</sub>. DCs were isolated from CD45.1 congenic mice, loaded with variant peptides and cocultured with naïve CD45.2 OTII T cells for three days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6b-e</xref>). In line with earlier observations, variants 1 and 2 interrupted T cell priming while variant 3 led to a proliferative response similar to native peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6c-d</xref>). TCR mediated uptake of the FlAsH-labeled pMHCII complexes followed the same pattern and only variant 3 complexes produced a comparable signal to that of OVA<sub>CACA</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6e</xref>). These suggest that AsH-probe labeling can be a sensitive method to track low affinity/ nuanced pMHCII complexes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dynamic monitoring of antigen-specific T cell responses in vivo poses challenges due to the limited availability of reagents and the size constraints of the immune synapse. Here, we address this issue by presenting a novel strategy for visualizing T cell-APC interactions via tetracysteine tagging of antigenic peptides. While tetracysteine tagging has been previously applied in cell biology and virology, these applications have been mostly limited to cell lines and in vitro studies in immunology unrelated experimental settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. On the other hand, our technique labels antigenic peptides and tracks pMHCII complexes in primary APCs during their interactions with T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our approach is superior as compared to other strategies for monitoring T cell-DC interactions, in the way it robustly targets specific pMHCII complexes in real time in vivo. There is no need for special organisms or genetic modifications, and the technique can easily be expanded to new antigens and T cell-APC pairs from both mice and humans. This strategy can, for instance, be integrated into validation efforts for antigen discovery and utilized in the investigation of the synapses of newly deorphanized human T cells, a largely unexplored area where tools are scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Given that is a two-part system (tag and FlAsH), it also carries the added capability of being inducible at different time points to allow for increased flexibility in interrogating pMHCII-TCR interactions over time. Our experiments demonstrate that tetracysteine-tagged peptides can be transferred from DCs to T cells via synaptic processes, such as antigen-specific pMHCII trogocytosis/transendocytosis, marking acceptor T cells for several days. Although the turnover of pMHCII in acceptor T cells requires further elucidation, our visualization of tetracysteine-tagged pMHCII can complement tetramers in detecting antigen-specific T cells in vivo. Additionally, we show that tetracysteine tagging of pMHCII does not broadly alter or disturb T cell-DC synapse. Therefore, our approach offers an advantage over tetramers in that it is suitable for real-time monitoring of the immune synapse. Finally, it is worth noting that tetracysteine tags can be visualized as electron-dense particles by Transmission Electron Microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], providing potential for the detailed investigation of T-DC synapse and subcellular localization of pMHCII complexes. Although TEM application was out of scope for this study, it offers a promising avenue for future research. In conclusion, the tetracysteine labeling approach described here provides a powerful and unique tool to advance our understanding of T cell-APC interactions, offering new opportunities to investigate the immune response and develop improved immunotherapies.</p>

All mice were maintained in Ohio State University ULAR and National Institutes of Health (NIH) animal facilities in compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee standards.</p>
<p>Cell cultures were maintained in sterile complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) media. The RPMI 1640 medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 μM streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For magnetic separations, cells were maintained in filtered and degassed magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) buffer. The MACS buffer consisted of PBS (Lonza) supplemented with 0.5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich). For splenic dendritic cell (DC) isolation, Liberase TM (Blendzyme) and DNase I were purchased from Roche. 50 mg Liberase was dissolved in complete RPMI, resulting in a final concentration of 5 mg/mL. The solution was kept on ice, stirred gently every 5 minutes for 30 minutes and aliquoted into 1 mL portions. 10 mg/mL DNAse stock solution was prepared with 0.15 M NaCl and divided into 500 μL aliquots. Both enzymes were stored at -20ºC.</p>
<p>Samples were stained for flow cytometry using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (either PBS or Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 1% HEPES, and 10 mM sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich)). For confocal microscopy, PBS supplemented with 1% BSA was used. The antibodies used for flow cytometry are as follows: anti-CD4-efluor450 (clone GK1.5), anti-B220-PE (clone RA3-6B2), anti-CD11c-AF700 (clone N418), anti-CD45.1-PE.Cy7 (clone A20, Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-CD45.2-AF700 (clone 104), anti-CD44-BUV395 (clone IM7, BD Biosciences), anti-I-A/I-E-BV605 (clone M5/114.15.2), anti-I-A/I-E-BV785 (clone M5/114.15.2), streptavidin-BV650, streptavidin-AF647 and purified anti-CD16/32 (clone 93). The antibodies were purchased from BioLegend unless stated otherwise. All peptides used in the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) were obtained from the NIH Research Technologies Branch, NIAID Peptide Core Facility.</p>
<p>For AsH probe labeling, peptides were pre-treated with fresh Tris Carboxy Ethyl Phosphene (TCEP, Sigma-Aldrich) to protect tetracysteine residues from oxidation. 10 mM ReAsH stock solution was prepared by adding 45 μL sterile cell-culture grade DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) to 250 μg solid ReAsH (Cayman Chemical) and 10 mM FlAsH solution was prepared by adding 150uL DMSO to 1 mg FlAsH powder (Cayman Chemical). British Anti-Lewisite (BAL, Alfa Aesar) and HBSS with Ca<sup>++</sup> and Mg<sup>++</sup> (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to wash excess FlAsH off the cells. BAL is resuspended in sterile degassed water to obtain 8 mM stock solution. FlAsH, ReAsH and BAL are highly sensitive to oxidation, therefore their activity may decline in subsequent uses. This may be averted, at least in part, by quickly purging stock solution containers with 4M Argon gas (Sigma-Aldrich, 501247), placing container in a 50mL tube, purging again with Argon before storing FlAsH and ReAsH at -20ºC, BAL at 4ºC. We do not recommend storage longer than one month or repeated use of the same reagent stock.</p>

<p>This study describes a method to track MHC class II binding peptides on dendritic cell (DC) surfaces using a tetracystein tag and a thiol-reactive dye, which can then be investigated in vitro and in vivo. This is a <bold>valuable</bold> study for the impact on immunology and potentially other areas where the detection of cell-associated peptides is required. The methods are <bold>convincing</bold> based on the use of MHC class I/II deficient mice that have significantly reduced signal, but the non-zero background is detected, and it is not clear that this is lower than if the peptides were directly labelled with fluorophores.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors develop a method to fluorescently tag peptides loaded onto dendritic cells using a two-step method with a tetracystein motif modified peptide and labelling step done on the surface of live DC using a dye with high affinity for the added motif. The results are convincing in demonstrating in vitro and in vivo T cell activation and efficient label transfer to specific T cells in vivo. The label transfer technique will be useful to identify T cells that have recognised a DC presenting a specific peptide antigen to allow the isolation of the T cell and cloning of its TCR subunits, for example. It may also be useful as a general assay for in vitro or in vivo T-DC communication that can allow the detection of genetic or chemical modulators.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study includes both in vitro and in vivo analysis including flow cytometry and two-photon laser scanning microscopy. The results are convincing and the level of T cell labelling with the fluorescent pMHC is surprisingly robust and suggests that the approach is potentially revealing something about fundamental mechanisms beyond the state of the art.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The method is demonstrated only at high pMHC density and it is not clear if it can operate at at lower peptide doses where T cells normally operate. However, this doesn't limit the utility of the method for applications where the peptide of interest is known. It's not clear to me how it could be used to de-orphan known TCR and this should be explained if they want to claim this as an application. Previous methods based on biotin-streptavidin and phycoerythrin had single pMHC sensitivity, but there were limitations to the PE-based probe so the use of organic dyes could offer advantages.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors here develop a novel Ovalbumin model peptide that can be labeled with a site-specific FlAsH dye to track agonist peptides both in vitro and in vivo. The utility of this tool could allow better tracking of activated polyclonal T cells particularly in novel systems. The authors have provided solid evidence that peptides are functional, capable of activating OTII T cells, and that these peptides can undergo trogocytosis by cognate T cells only.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
-An array of in vitro and in vivo studies are used to assess peptide functionality.</p>
<p>
-Nice use of cutting-edge intravital imaging.</p>
<p>
-Internal controls such as non-cogate T cells to improve the robustness of the results (such as Fig 5A-D).</p>
<p>
-One of the strengths is the direct labeling of the peptide and the potential utility in other systems.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. What is the background signal from FlAsH?</p>
<p>
The baselines for Figure 1 flow plots are all quite different. Hard to follow. What does the background signal look like without FLASH (how much fluorescence shift is unlabeled cells to No antigen+FLASH?). How much of the FlAsH in cells is actually conjugated to the peptide? In Figure 2E, it doesn't look like it's very specific to pMHC complexes. Maybe you could double-stain with Ab for MHCII. Figure 4e suggests there is no background without MHCII but I'm not fully convinced. Potentially some MassSpec for FLASH-containing peptides.</p>
<p>2. On the flip side, how much of the variant peptides are getting conjugated in cells? I'd like to see some quantification (HPLC or MassSpec). If it's ~10% of peptides that get labeled, this could explain the low shifts in fluorescence and the similar T cell activation to native peptides if FlasH has any deleterious effects on TCR recognition. But if it's a high rate of labeling, then it adds confidence to this system.</p>
<p>3. Conceptually, what is the value of labeling peptides after loading with DCs? Why not preconjugate peptides with dye, before loading, so you have a cleaner, potentially higher fluorescence signal? If there is a potential utility, I do not see it being well exploited in this paper. There are some hints in the discussion of additional use cases, but it was not clear exactly how they would work. One mention was that the dye could be added in real-time in vivo to label complexes, but I believe this was not done here. Is that feasible to show?</p>
<p>4. Figure 5D-F the imaging data isn't fully convincing. For example, in 5F and 2G, the speeds for T cells with no Ag should be much higher (10-15micron/min or 0.16-0.25micron/sec). The fact that yours are much lower speeds suggests technical or biological issues, that might need to be acknowledged or use other readouts like the flow cytometry.</p>
