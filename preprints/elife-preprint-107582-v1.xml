<title>Abstract</title><p>ATAD2, a conserved protein which is predominantly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells and spermatogenic cells, emerges as a crucial regulator of chromatin dynamics. Our previous parallel studies in both ES cells and <italic>S. pombe</italic> highlighted the key role of ATAD2 in facilitating chromatin-bound histone chaperone turnover. Focusing on spermatogenesis, we demonstrate here that ATAD2 regulates the HIRA-dependent localization of H3.3 on the genome and influences H3.3-mediated gene transcription. Moreover, by modulating histone eviction and the assembly of protamines, ATAD2 ensures proper chromatin condensation and genome packaging in mature sperm. Disruption of <italic>Atad2</italic> function in mice leads to abnormal genome organization in mature spermatozoa. Together, these findings establish a previously overlooked level of chromatin dynamic regulation, governed by ATAD2’s interaction with histone chaperones and chromatin, which controls the balance between histone deposition and removal.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spermatogenesis involves unique and dramatic chromatin remodelling and genome reorganization events that take place in preparation for a shift from the universal nucleosome-based eukaryotic genome organization into a unique nucleoprotamine-based structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gaucher et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bao and Bedford 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Le Blevec et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Okada 2022</xref>). During the last decade, important information on the molecular basis of the nucleosome-to-nucleoprotamine transition during the postmeiotic phases of spermatogenesis became available. Several testis-specific H2A, H2B and H3 histone variants replace the canonical histones, locally or globally, at different stages, starting early during the commitment of cells into meiotic and post-meiotic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hoghoughi et al. 2018</xref>). Most of this nucleosome dismantlement and assembly occurs in the absence of DNA replication. In other words, the replication-independent nucleosome assembly pathways, such as the well-documented HIRA-dependent H3.3 assembly, are expected to be critical in ensuring the necessary chromatin dynamics in these cells. Finally, hints to the functions of transition proteins (TPs), and their functional relationship with protamines (PRMs) were proposed based on the study of a specific late-expressing H2A variant, H2A.L.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barral et al. 2017b</xref>). In the proposed model we suggest that TPs do not directly replace histones, but rather could be loaded on open H2A.L.2-containing nucleosomes to control PRM assembly. Nucleosome-to-nucleoprotamine transition also includes a TP-dependent pre-PRM2 processing, histone displacement by PRMs and the structuration of the nucleoprotamine-based genome organization in the mature spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barral et al. 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Rezaei-Gazik et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Taking into account this unique dynamic of post-meiotic cells’ nucleosomes, it is expected that these cells massively express generic or germline-specific factors that act on chromatin, including histone acetylating machineries, acetylated histone readers and histone variants and their chaperones, all of which mediate histone and non-histone protein exchanges. More specifically, the replication-independent nature of nucleosome assembly, both in cells undergoing meiosis and in post-meiotic cells, strongly suggests the involvement of the chaperone / histone substrate couple, HIRA and H3.3.</p>
<p>An important part of this replication-independent histone assembly and transitions in the genome organizations occurs in the context of a massive histone H4 hyperacetylation in the haploid spermatogenic cells, spermatids, mediated by NUT-p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Shiota et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rousseaux et al. 2022</xref>). Hyperacetylation of histone H4, especially, the double acetylation on H4K5K8 in these cells, leads to the binding of H4 by the first bromodomain of BRDT and to histone replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Moriniere et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gaucher et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Goudarzi et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Shiota et al. 2018</xref>). Additionally, Histone H4 hyperacetylation, especially at K5, could also be recognized by another bromodomain-containing factor of unknown function in spermatogenic cells, ATAD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Caron et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Morozumi et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>ATAD2 is a highly conserved bromodomain-containing factor harbouring, in addition, an AAA ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boussouar et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cattaneo et al. 2014</xref>). Our early work showed that Atad2 is predominantly expressed in embryonic stem cells (ES cells), as well as in spermatogenic cells, and is aberrantly activated in virtually all solid cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Caron et al. 2010</xref>). Although ATAD2’s function in cancer prompted many investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al. 2022</xref>), its function in its physiological context of expression has remained largely overlooked. We reported the first investigations of ATAD2’s function in embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Morozumi et al. 2016</xref>). These studies in ES cells showed that ATAD2 is recruited into acetylated transcriptionally active chromatin and is critical to keep the chromatin of ES cells highly dynamic, as illustrated by an ATAD2-dependent high rate of histone exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Morozumi et al. 2016</xref>). Later parallel studies by our laboratory, in ES cells and in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, deciphered the molecular basis of this activity of ATAD2, which relies on its capacity to ensure the turnover of the chromatin-bound histone chaperone, HIRA and FACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wang et al. 2021</xref>). In addition to ES cells, <italic>Atad2</italic> is also highly expressed in male germ cells, pointing to its potential role in the regulation of HIRA -dependent H3.3 assembly in these cells, especially, in post-meiotic cells. Indeed, previous published works have highlighted the important function of H3.3 assembly in meiotic and post-meiotic male genome programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">van der Heijden et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yuen et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Tang et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fontaine et al. 2022</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that ATAD2-controlled HIRA-H3.3 activity would also be a critical player in post-meiotic male genome reorganization, as HIRA has been shown to be essential post-fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lin et al. 2014</xref>) and during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nashun et al. 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Using a lacZ reporter <italic>Atad2</italic> KO mouse model, we could show that <italic>Atad2</italic>’s expression is dramatically enhanced in post-meiotic male germ cells, ensuring a proper dynamics of histone H3.3, including on the sex chromosomes. More remarkably, our data demonstrate that ATAD2 controls the appropriate expression of a series of genes whose activity is known to be H3.3-dependent in post-meiotic cells. Additionally, in the absence of ATAD2, perturbed nucleosome dynamics leads to a delayed histone-to-PRM-replacement, leading to a defective global final male genome compaction. Although this defective mature spermatozoon genome compaction has little effect on male fertility following natural reproduction, it impacts the success of <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization using spermatozoa from <italic>Atad2</italic> KO mice pointing to a more fragile genome in these cells.</p>
<p>In summary, our work identified a yet unknown level of the regulation of chromatin plasticity, that involves the control of histone chaperone dynamics, particularly that of HIRA, controlling the proper male germ cell transcriptional regulation, genome compaction and optimal male fertility.</p>

<title>Atad2 is predominantly expressed in haploid male germ cells</title>
<p><italic>Atad2</italic> is normally expressed in ES and spermatogenic cells and remains silent in the majority of adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Morozumi et al. 2016</xref>). Therefore, in addition to ES cells, male germ cells constitute the second cell type where the molecular basis of the physiological ATAD2 activity could be investigated.</p>
<p>To decipher the function of ATAD2 during spermatogenesis, we used a mouse model harboring an insertion of a <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter cassette between exons 11 and 12 that enables fusion of the <italic>lacZ</italic> transgene with exon 11 of the long form of <italic>Atad2</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>) and production of a non-functional ATAD2-lacZ fusion protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), referred to as ATAD2 KO in this study. Furthermore, we crossed these mice with transgenic mice expressing ubiquitously Cre recombinase under <italic>CMV</italic> promoter, in order to remove the <italic>neo</italic> cassette and to delete <italic>Atad2’s</italic> exon 12 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition to the long somatic form of ATAD2, ATAD2L, the mouse testis encodes a short germ-cell specific isoform that we previously named ATAD2S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Caron et al. 2010</xref>). The combined LacZ fusion and <italic>Cre recombinase-</italic>dependent deletion of <italic>Atad2’s</italic> exon 12 make both ATAD2L and ATADS indetectable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>ATAD2 controls HIRA accumulation</title>
<p>In our previous work performed in both <italic>S. pombe</italic> and mouse ES cells, we demonstrated the crucial role for ATAD2 in HIRA-dependent histone dosage as well as in HIRA-chromatin interaction. Among other discoveries, this work showed that in the absence of ATAD2, HIRA becomes trapped on chromatin leading to its accumulation in ES cells, as well as in a variety of cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wang et al. 2021</xref>). Because of this very conserved action of ATAD2 in controlling the HIRA activity, we reasoned that the ATAD2-dependent HIRA activity should be particularly active during spermatogenic cell differentiation, especially, in post-meiotic cells, when ATAD2 expression is highly induced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). To test if the absence of ATAD2 could lead to the accumulation of HIRA, as we previously reported in other systems, we quantified HIRA in spermatogenic cells from both wild-type and <italic>Atad2</italic> KO mice. These investigations revealed an accumulation of HIRA protein in <italic>Atad2</italic> KO spermatogenic cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), consistent with its increased association with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wang et al. 2021</xref>). We have also monitored HIRA accumulation as a function of spermatogenic cells stages. Because of the dramatic activation of <italic>Atad2</italic> after meiosis, in spermatids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>), the ATAD2-dependent accumulation of HIRA was expected to mostly occur in post-meiotic cells. Accordingly, we also compared HIRA accumulation in fractionated spermatogenic cell extracts. This experiment demonstrated that, in the absence of functional ATAD2, the accumulation of HIRA primarily occurs in round spermatids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). This finding is consistent with the post-meiotic activation of Atad2 and its role in regulating the turnover of chromatin-bound HIRA.</p>

<title>ATAD2 controls HIRA-dependent H3.3 localization and H3.3-dependent transcription</title>
<p>We speculated that an increased presence of HIRA on chromatin in the absence of ATAD2, should also be associated with increased amounts of deposited histones. Indeed, we have demonstrated previously in <italic>S. pombe</italic> that histone gene inactivation could rescue the growth arrest due to the absence of <italic>Atad2</italic>/<italic>Abo1.</italic> In parallel, we found that in ES cells, in the absence of ATAD2, an increased nucleosome assembly occurs, even on the so-called nucleosome-free region (NFR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wang et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, visualization of H3.3, the major target of HIRA by immunofluorescence in <italic>Atad2</italic> KO round spermatids, displayed a diffuse, intense staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), which is normally concentrated on the sex chromosomes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">van der Heijden et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fontaine et al. 2022</xref>). Indeed, as expected and previously reported, in the wild-type round spermatids, H3.3 was mostly observed in a single domain, close to the unique chromocenter in these cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, left panels). In the absence of ATAD2, in agreement with an increased residence time of HIRA on chromatin in general and a reduced H3.3 turnover, an increased level of H3.3 could be observed on the sex chromosome (adjacent to the chromocenter), and more interestingly, on all over the genome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, right panels).</p>

<p>H3.3 is known to be dynamically incorporated on a group of active genes, especially around their transcriptional start sites (TSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">de Dieuleveult et al. 2016</xref>). We therefore predicted that the observed increased H3.3 residence time in the absence of ATAD2 would decrease TSS regions’ accessibility specially those of highly active genes. To verify this prediction, we purified round spermatid fractions from wild-type and <italic>Atad2</italic> ko mice testes and measured the general chromatin accessibility following an ATAC-seq approach. Chromatin accessibility was then assessed around the TSS of genes, which were categorized into four groups based on the quartile of their mean expression from three independent transcriptomes of wild-type round spermatids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), from the top 25% most highly expressed genes (group 1) to the 25% least expressed genes (group 4). As predicted, the absence of ATAD2 was associated with a significant decrease in TSS region accessibility of the most active genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>), supporting a role for ATAD2 in maintaining chromatin dynamics at the most highly active chromatin regions.</p>

<p>To visualize the genes more sensitive to ATAD2-mediated chromatin dynamics affecting transcription, we monitored whole genome transcriptional activity during the first spermatogenic wave at day 20 post-partum (PP), when meiosis is complete, and the first post-meiotic cells appear on 22-, 24- and 26-days PP.</p>
<p>In order to definitively confirm our working hypothesis on the ATAD2-HIRA-H3.3 functional interaction, we took advantage of published H3.3-dependent transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fontaine et al. 2022</xref>). Indeed, the authors of this publication identified a series of genes that are mis-regulated in cells with inactivated <italic>H3.3b</italic> gene. Because of the post-meiotic major activation of <italic>Atad2</italic>, we specifically focussed on the gene lists that show a H3.3-dependent deregulated expression in post-meiotic round spermatids.</p>
<p>In these transcriptomes, we specifically followed the expression of the published lists of genes that are downregulated or upregulated in the absence of H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fontaine et al. 2022</xref>). Very interestingly, we observed that the majority of genes that were reported to be down-regulated in the absence of H3.3 (H3.3-activated genes), are upregulated in the absence of ATAD2, particularly at day 26 PP, when a significant number of post-meiotic cells are present in the testes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, left and middle panels). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) applied to genes that are differentially expressed between wild-type and Atad2 KO cells at day 20 PP, confirmed that the “H3.3-activated” gene set (corresponding to the published list of H3.3-activated genes) are clearly enriched in Atad2 KO cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, right panel).</p>

</fig>
<p>This regulation can also be observed when we considered the published list of genes that were up-regulated in the absence of H3.3 (H3.3-repressed genes). In this case, the absence of ATAD2 led to the enhancement of their down-regulation. In other words, the absence of ATAD2 led to an enhancement of H3.3-dependent gene repression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Fontaine and colleagues also reported that sex chromosome-linked genes that normally undergo Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation (MSCI), were up-regulated in the absence of H3.3, indicating that H3.3 is required for their repression. We also investigated these genes and showed that they present an enhancement of repression in the absence of ATAD2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>These analyses clearly indicate that the absence of ATAD2 enhances H3.3 functions in agreement with increased residence time of H3.3 in nucleosomes. Genes that require H3.3 to be repressed or activated present an enhanced repression or activation, respectively, in the absence of ATAD2. Overall, these investigations remarkably confirmed a role for ATAD2 in regulating H3.3 function.</p>

<title>ATAD2 is required for controlled histone eviction and PRM assembly</title>
<p>ATAD2’s involvement in HIRA-chromatin interaction dynamics and its role in H3.3 assembly in post-meiotic cells, along with its similar function in the dynamics of other histone chaperones like FACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wang et al. 2021</xref>), led us to investigate whether ATAD2 participates in controlling the histone-to-protamine replacement occurring later in these cells. The histone eviction process involves a genome-wide histone H4 hyperacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Shiota et al. 2018</xref>) and a TP-mediated PRMs assembly, which directs histone eviction and the final packaging of the male genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barral et al. 2017a</xref>). To test the involvement of ATAD2 in spermatogenic cell chromatin reorganization, we sought to co-detect testis-specific H2B variant, TH2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Montellier et al. 2013</xref>), along with transition protein 1 (TP1) and protamine 1 (PRM1). TH2B is first expressed at the commitment of spermatogenic cells into meiotic divisions and progressively becomes the major H2B species of spermatogenic cell chromatin in the subsequent stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Montellier et al. 2013</xref>). As expected, the accumulation of TP1 and PRM1 in wild-type cells is associated with the eviction of the majority of histones, reflected by the mutually exclusive labelling of TH2B and TP1/PRM1 in distinct cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, Atad2 wild-type mice). In contrast, in <italic>Atad2</italic> KO cells, TH2B and TP1/PRM1 were co-detected in a significant number of cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>), suggesting that the process of histone eviction is disturbed. However, in Atad2 KO cells, the initial delay in histone removal is transient, as spermatids with high levels of transition protein TP1 and PRM1 eventually appear (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>These observations strongly suggest that, in the absence of ATAD2, the process of histone eviction is also slowed down or delayed, allowing for the simultaneous detection of histones and histone-replacing proteins in the same cells.</p>
<p>Given that NUT-CBP/p300-dependent H4 hyperacetylation, along with the expression of H2A.L.2, TPs, and PRMs, is essential for histone removal, we also investigated whether the observed delay in histone removal is due to defective histone acetylation, particularly at H4K5, as well as disrupted cell type-specific expression and localization of H2A.L.2, TPs, and PRMs. Immunohistochemical detection of H4K5ac, TP2, PRM1, and PRM2 revealed a similar pattern and cell type-specific expression of the investigated proteins when comparing Atad2 KO and wild-type post-meiotic cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p>These data support the idea that the perturbed modified dynamics of histone/TP/PRM chaperones does not grossly affect the other molecular events involved in the histone-to-PRM replacement.</p>

<title>Perturbed pre-PRM2 processing in the absence of ATAD2</title>
<p>We have shown previously that the H2A.L.2-dependent process of incorporation of TPs into nucleosomes is required for the proper processing of pre-PRM2. The abnormal overlapping staining of histones, TP and protamines observed by immunofluorescence in <italic>Atad2</italic> KO cells, suggested that TPs may not effectively mediate the pre-PRM processing. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of our specific pre-PRM2 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Rezaei-Gazik et al. 2022</xref>) to investigate pre-PRM2 maturation and assembly. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> shows that although pre-PRM2 is present in both wild-type and <italic>Atad2</italic> KO elongating spermatids, in the absence of ATAD2, pre-PRM2 tends to form dense aggregates as well as fragmented genomic domains.

<p>We show that although the <italic>Atad2</italic> KO post-meiotic cells’ defective chromatin organization does not affect the testis histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1</xref> and data not shown), it impairs testis weight and sperm count, which are significantly reduced in <italic>Atad2</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
<p>As expected, the impact of ATAD2 on HIRA function and TP/PRM assembly also has an impact on proper sperm genome compaction.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Taking advantage of the very conserved structural features of ATAD2 and relying on the power of yeast genetics, we previously discovered that ATAD2’s function is mostly to control major histone chaperone functions. Using a screen of the Abo1/ATAD2-dependent arrest of <italic>S. pombe</italic> cell growth, we found that impressively, 11 of the 14-growth arrest suppressor strains that we isolated, impacted histone chaperones or histones themselves, with 8 distinct inactivating mutations in the histone chaperone HIRA complex. Furthermore, investigation of ATAD2-depleted mouse ES cells showed that HIRA accumulates and remains bound to nucleosomes, leading to nucleosome overloading around active gene TSSs and on the normally nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) of these genes.</p>
<p>Here, we showed that <italic>Atad2</italic> is highly expressed in post-meiotic spermatogenic cells and that in its absence, as in ES cells and in different cancer cells, HIRA accumulates. Our new data suggest that in the absence of ATAD2 activity, HIRA residency time on chromatin increases leading to decreased dynamics and overloading of its substrate, the histone variant H3.3. This replication-independent histone has been first shown to assemble on the transcriptionally inactive meiotic cell sex chromosomes by Peter de Boer’s laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">van der Heijden et al. 2007</xref>). Subsequent studies showed that H3.3 remained enriched on the sex chromosomes also in early post-meiotic cells, usually localized close to the unique large chromocenter in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fontaine et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In agreement with the proposed role for ATAD2 in the control of HIRA-dependent dynamics of H3.3, we observed a more intense labelling of H3.3 on the sex bodies in round spermatids and impressively, an increase in the genomic background detection of H3.3 in these cells.</p>
<p>The role of ATAD2 in the HIRA/H3.3 functions is further clearly supported by comparing the reported H3.3-dependent transcriptome with the ATAD2-dependent transcriptome identified here.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the absence of ATAD2, we observed an enhancement of H3.3-dependent gene regulatory events (activation or repression), in agreement with an increased H3.3 presence and hence function, in the chromatin of <italic>Atad2</italic> KO post-meiotic cells.</p>
<p>These investigations on ATAD2’s role in post-meiotic spermatogenic cells built upon our previous findings in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and ES cells, uncover an additional level of regulation of histone dynamics, that relies on the dynamics of histone chaperone - chromatin interaction. Previously, A. Groth’s laboratory discovered that histone chaperone DNAJC9 recruits the ATPase HSP70 to provide the necessary energy to release the chaperone from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hammond et al. 2021</xref>). Considering our data on the role of the ATPase ATAD2 with respect to HIRA and that of HSP70 with respect to DNAJC9, it is tempting to propose that ATP energy is required for the proper function of histone chaperones in controlling histone turnover.</p>
<p>Interestingly, very recently, Song laboratory demonstrated that the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Abo1/ATAD2, is required for ATP-dependent dissociation of the histone chaperone FACT from chromatin, particularly at TSSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jang et al. 2024</xref>). In line with this conclusion, ChIP-seq mapping of FACT in Atad2-depleted ES cells revealed an accumulation of nucleosome-bound FACT at the TSSs of active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wang et al. 2021</xref>), supporting the idea that ATAD2 not only regulates the dynamics of histone-bound HIRA but also that of other histone chaperones such as FACT</p>
<p>In addition to histones, many chromatin-bound regulatory factors also need to dynamically interact with chromatin and hence ATAD2 could also be involved in mediating the dynamic interactions of such chromatin-bound factors. In agreement with this hypothesis, using proteomics of ATAD2-bound nucleosomes in ES cells, we previously co-purified various chromatin bound factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Morozumi et al. 2016</xref>). Other AAA ATPase factors such as p97/VCP, have also demonstrated actions in the dynamics of chromatin-bound factors. Indeed, the AAA ATPase factor, p97/VCP, has been shown to remove H3 variant CENP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">van den Berg et al. 2023</xref>), the chromatin trapped PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Krastev et al. 2022</xref>), trapped Ku70/80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">van den Boom et al. 2016</xref>), DNA damage sensors, DDB2 and XPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Puumalainen et al. 2014</xref>), RNA pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lafon et al. 2015</xref>), and other chromatin interacting factors. Similarly, ATAD2 AAA ATPase very likely acts on other chromatin-bound factors than histone chaperones. However, in contrast to p97/VCP, and due to its bromodomain, ATAD2 would preferentially act on H4K5 acetylated chromatin regions and would specifically ensure the dynamics of H4 acetylated chromatin-bound factors. Based on the data presented here, we can also include, a role for ATAD2 to streamline steps involving the H2A.L.2-dependent recruitment of TPs and protamine assembly and the final histone displacement in spermatids. The chaperones responsible for TP/PRM assembly are not yet identified, but it is possible that ATAD2 plays a role in dissociating these chaperones from their substrate proteins after the assembly process. That is why in our <italic>Atad2</italic> KO spermatids, we observed an overlap between TP/PRM and histones. This could be due to the delayed removal of chaperones bound to TPs and PRMs and the inability of pre-PRM2 to be processed and hence of PRMs to efficiently replace histones. Since histone replacement still occurs in the absence of ATAD2, it suggests that other AAA ATPases, such as p97/VCP, may compensate for its function. However, under these conditions, although most of the histone replacement takes place, our functional tests such as <italic>in vitro</italic> chromatin decompaction and <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization, strongly suggest that mature spermatozoa genome organization is not fully complete and the spermatozoa nuclei remain fragile and sensitive to external assaults.</p>
<p>In summary, the functional analysis of ATAD2 during its physiological expression in the post-meiotic phases of spermatogenesis supports our previous conclusions regarding its role in ES cells and its conserved activity in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. Together, these studies reveal a novel layer of regulation in histone turnover and chromatin dynamics, based on the control of histone-bound histone chaperone release.</p>

<title>X-Gal staining</title>
<p>Male mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Testes were dissected out, drilled in 3 points and incubated overnight at 4℃ under agitation in fixative solution (0.5% glutaraldehyde, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 mM EGTA in PBS). After incubation until equilibration in an equilibration buffer (30% sucrose, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5mM EGTA in PBS), testes were frozen individually in OCT on dry ice. Frozen blocks were sectioned at 10 µm slices on Superfrost<sup>TM</sup> slides and let dry overnight. Slides were fixed with fixation buffer (0.2% glutaraldehyde, 100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 mM EGTA in PBS) for 10 min, washed with washing buffer (PBS, 0.02% NP-40, 0.01% Sodium deoxycholate and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) for 5min and incubated three times in 50% Ethanol for 5 min each. Then the slides were stained with staining solution (2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.02% NP-40, 0.01%Na Doc, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 10 mM potassium ferrocyanide and 0.5 mg/ml X-gal) in a wet chamber for several hours at 37℃. The slides were then washed with washing buffer for 5 min and with distilled water, and a counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. Finally, the slides were washed with running tap water for several minutes and mounted with Dako fluorescent mounting medium.</p>

<p>Spermatozoa from wild type and <italic>Atad2</italic> KO males were harvested by dilaceration of the cauda epididymis and allowed to swim in 1 mL M2 medium for 10 min at 37°C. The sperm-containing suspension was transferred into a 1.5 ml tube and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 8 min in 4℃. The sperm pellets were resuspended in PBS and dropped onto glass slides to spread and dry at RT. The decompaction mix (50 mM DTT, 400 IU/ml heparin, 0.2% Triton in PBS) was added to each dried sperm drop for 2 min and the decompaction was stopped by placing the slides in 4% PFA for 15 min. After washing with PBS for 5 min, the slides were stained with DAPI and mounted using Dako fluorescent mounting medium. Fluorescent images were captured by a Zeiss inverted microscope under a 63X numeric aperture oil-immersion lens (Carl Zeiss). The size of spermatozoa heads was calculated with ImageJ software.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study explores the role of the chromatin regulator ATAD2 in mouse spermatogenesis. It <bold>convincingly</bold> demonstrates that ATAD2 is essential for proper chromatin remodeling in haploid spermatids, influencing gene accessibility, H3.3-mediated transcription, and histone eviction. Using Atad2 knockout (KO) mice, the authors link ATAD2 to the DNA-replication-independent incorporation of sperm-specific proteins like protamines and histone H3.3. Although the findings highlight chromatin abnormalities and impaired in vitro fertilization in KO mice, natural fertility remains unaffected, suggesting possible in vivo compensatory mechanisms. However, in its current form, the study lacks mechanistic insight and provides only partial evidence for ATAD2's molecular role, limiting its functional conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors analyzed the expression of ATAD2 protein in post-meiotic stages and characterized the localization of various testis-specific proteins in the testis of the Atad2 knockout (KO). By cytological analysis as well as the ATAC sequencing, the study showed that increased levels of HIRA histone chaperone, accumulation of histone H3.3 on post-meiotic nuclei, defective chromatin accessibility and also delayed deposition of protamines. Sperm from the Atad2 KO mice reduces the success of in vitro fertilization. The work was performed well, and most of the results are convincing. However, this manuscript does not suggest a molecular mechanism for how ATAD2 promotes the formation of testis-specific chromatin.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper describes the role of ATAD2 AAA+ ATPase in the proper localization of sperm-specific chromatin proteins such as protamine, suggesting the importance of the DNA replication-independent histone exchanges with the HIRA-histone H3.3 axis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Some results lack quantification.</p>
<p>(2) The work was performed well, and most of the results are convincing. However, this manuscript does not suggest a molecular mechanism for how ATAD2 promotes the formation of testis-specific chromatin.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Liakopoulou et al. presents a comprehensive investigation into the role of ATAD2 in regulating chromatin dynamics during spermatogenesis. The authors elegantly demonstrate that ATAD2, via its control of histone chaperone HIRA turnover, ensures proper H3.3 localization, chromatin accessibility, and histone-to-protamine transition in post-meiotic male germ cells. Using a new well-characterized Atad2 KO mouse model, they show that ATAD2 deficiency disrupts HIRA dynamics, leading to aberrant H3.3 deposition, impaired transcriptional regulation, delayed protamine assembly, and defective sperm genome compaction. The study bridges ATAD2's conserved functions in embryonic stem cells and cancer to spermatogenesis, revealing a novel layer of epigenetic regulation critical for male fertility.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The MS first demonstration of ATAD2's essential role in spermatogenesis, linking its expression in haploid spermatids to histone chaperone regulation by connecting ATAD2-dependent chromatin dynamics to gene accessibility (ATAC-seq), H3.3-mediated transcription, and histone eviction. Interestingly and surprisingly, sperm chromatin defects in Atad2 KO mice impair only in vitro fertilization but not natural fertility, suggesting unknown compensatory mechanisms in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: The MS is robust and there are not big weaknesses</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors generated knockout mice for Atad2, a conserved bromodomain-containing factor expressed during spermatogenesis. In Atad2 KO mice, HIRA, a chaperone for histone variant H3.3, was upregulated in round spermatids, accompanied by an apparent increase in H3.3 levels. Furthermore, the sequential incorporation and removal of TH2B and PRM1 during spermiogenesis were partially disrupted in the absence of ATAD2, possibly due to delayed histone removal. Despite these abnormalities, Atad2 KO male mice were able to produce offspring normally.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript addresses the biological role of ATAD2 in spermatogenesis using a knockout mouse model, providing a valuable in vivo framework to study chromatin regulation during male germ cell development. The observed redistribution of H3.3 in round spermatids is clearly presented and suggests a previously unappreciated role of ATAD2 in histone variant dynamics. The authors also document defects in the sequential incorporation and removal of TH2B and PRM1 during spermiogenesis, providing phenotypic insight into chromatin transitions in late spermatogenic stages. Overall, the study presents a solid foundation for further mechanistic investigation into ATAD2 function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the manuscript reports the gross phenotype of Atad2 KO mice, the findings remain largely superficial and do not convincingly demonstrate how ATAD2 deficiency affects chromatin dynamics. Moreover, the phenotype appears too mild to elucidate the functional significance of ATAD2 during spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>(1) Figures 4-5: The analyses of differential gene expression and chromatin organization should be more comprehensive. First, Venn diagrams comparing the sets of significantly differentially expressed genes between this study and previous work should be shown for each developmental stage. Second, given the established role of H3.3 in MSCI, the effect of Atad2 knockout on sex chromosome gene expression should be analyzed. Third, integrated analysis of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data is needed to evaluate how ATAD2 loss affects gene expression. Finally, H3.3 ChIP-seq should be performed to directly assess changes in H3.3 distribution following Atad2 knockout.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 3: The altered distribution of H3.3 is compelling. This raises the possibility that histone marks associated with H3.3 may also be affected, although this has not been investigated. It would therefore be important to examine the distribution of histone modifications typically associated with H3.3. If any alterations are observed, ChIP-seq analyses should be performed to explore them further.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 7: While the authors suggest that pre-PRM2 processing is impaired in Atad2 KO, no direct evidence is provided. It is essential to conduct acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE) followed by western blotting, or a comparable experiment, to substantiate this claim.</p>
<p>(4) HIRA and ATAD2: Does the upregulation of HIRA fully account for the phenotypes observed in Atad2 KO? If so, would overexpression of HIRA alone be sufficient to phenocopy the Atad2 KO phenotype? Alternatively, would partial reduction of HIRA (e.g., through heterozygous deletion) in the Atad2 KO background be sufficient to rescue the phenotype?</p>
<p>(5) The mechanism by which ATAD2 regulates HIRA turnover on chromatin and the deposition of H3.3 remains unclear from the manuscript and warrants further investigation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors analyzed the expression of ATAD2 protein in post-meiotic stages and characterized the localization of various testis-specific proteins in the testis of the Atad2 knockout (KO). By cytological analysis as well as the ATAC sequencing, the study showed that increased levels of HIRA histone chaperone, accumulation of histone H3.3 on post-meiotic nuclei, defective chromatin accessibility and also delayed deposition of protamines. Sperm from the Atad2 KO mice reduces the success of in vitro fertilization. The work was performed well, and most of the results are convincing. However, this manuscript does not suggest a molecular mechanism for how ATAD2 promotes the formation of testis-specific chromatin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to take this opportunity to highlight that the present study builds on our previously published work, which examined the function of ATAD2 in both yeast S. pombe and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (Wang et al., 2021). In yeast, using genetic analysis we showed that inactivation of HIRA rescues defective cell growth caused by the absence of ATAD2. This rescue could also be achieved by reducing histone dosage, indicating that the toxicity depends on histone over-dosage, and that HIRA toxicity, in the absence of ATAD2, is linked to this imbalance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, HIRA ChIP-seq performed in mouse ES cells revealed increased nucleosome-bound HIRA, particularly around transcription start sites (TSS) of active genes, along with the appearance of HIRA-bound nucleosomes within normally nucleosome-free regions (NFRs). These findings pointed to ATAD2 as a major factor responsible for unloading HIRA from nucleosomes. This unloading function may also apply to other histone chaperones, such as FACT (see Wang et al., 2021, Fig. 4C).</p>
<p>In the present study, our investigations converge on the same ATAD2 function in the context of a physiologically integrated mammalian system—spermatogenesis. Indeed, in the absence of ATAD2, we observed H3.3 accumulation and enhanced H3.3-mediated gene expression. Consistent with this functional model of ATAD2— unloading chaperones from histone- and non-histone-bound chromatin—we also observed defects in histone-toprotamine replacement.</p>
<p>Together, the results presented here and in Wang et al. (2021) reveal an underappreciated regulatory layer of histone chaperone activity. Previously, histone chaperones were primarily understood as factors that load histones. Our findings demonstrate that we must also consider a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism that controls assembled histone-bound chaperones. This key point was clearly captured and emphasized by Reviewer #2 (see below).</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Liakopoulou et al. presents a comprehensive investigation into the role of ATAD2 in regulating chromatin dynamics during spermatogenesis. The authors elegantly demonstrate that ATAD2, via its control of histone chaperone HIRA turnover, ensures proper H3.3 localization, chromatin accessibility, and histone-toprotamine transition in post-meiotic male germ cells. Using a new well-characterized Atad2 KO mouse model, they show that ATAD2 deficiency disrupts HIRA dynamics, leading to aberrant H3.3 deposition, impaired transcriptional regulation, delayed protamine assembly, and defective sperm genome compaction. The study bridges ATAD2's conserved functions in embryonic stem cells and cancer to spermatogenesis, revealing a novel layer of epigenetic regulation critical for male fertility.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The MS first demonstration of ATAD2's essential role in spermatogenesis, linking its expression in haploid spermatids to histone chaperone regulation by connecting ATAD2-dependent chromatin dynamics to gene accessibility (ATAC-seq), H3.3-mediated transcription, and histone eviction. Interestingly and surprisingly, sperm chromatin defects in Atad2 KO mice impair only in vitro fertilization but not natural fertility, suggesting unknown compensatory mechanisms in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The MS is robust and there are not big weaknesses</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors generated knockout mice for Atad2, a conserved bromodomain-containing factor expressed during spermatogenesis. In Atad2 KO mice, HIRA, a chaperone for histone variant H3.3, was upregulated in round spermatids, accompanied by an apparent increase in H3.3 levels. Furthermore, the sequential incorporation and removal of TH2B and PRM1 during spermiogenesis were partially disrupted in the absence of ATAD2, possibly due to delayed histone removal. Despite these abnormalities, Atad2 KO male mice were able to produce offspring normally.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript addresses the biological role of ATAD2 in spermatogenesis using a knockout mouse model, providing a valuable in vivo framework to study chromatin regulation during male germ cell development. The observed redistribution of H3.3 in round spermatids is clearly presented and suggests a previously unappreciated role of ATAD2 in histone variant dynamics. The authors also document defects in the sequential incorporation and removal of TH2B and PRM1 during spermiogenesis, providing phenotypic insight into chromatin transitions in late spermatogenic stages. Overall, the study presents a solid foundation for further mechanistic investigation into ATAD2 function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the manuscript reports the gross phenotype of Atad2 KO mice, the findings remain largely superficial and do not convincingly demonstrate how ATAD2 deficiency affects chromatin dynamics. Moreover, the phenotype appears too mild to elucidate the functional significance of ATAD2 during spermatogenesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the statement that our findings are largely superficial. Based on our investigations of this factor over the years, it has become evident that ATAD2 functions as an auxiliary factor that facilitates mechanisms controlling chromatin dynamics (see, for example, Morozumi et al., 2015). These mechanisms can still occur in the absence of ATAD2, but with reduced efficiency, which explains the mild phenotype we observed.</p>
<p>This function, while not essential, is nonetheless an integral part of the cell’s molecular biology and should be studied and brought to the attention of the broader biological community, just as we study essential factors. Unfortunately, the field has tended to focus primarily on core functional actors, often overlooking auxiliary factors. As a result, our decade-long investigations into the subtle yet important roles of ATAD2 have repeatedly been met with skepticism regarding its functional significance, which has in turn influenced editorial decisions.</p>
<p>We chose eLife as the venue for this work specifically to avoid such editorial barriers and to emphasize that facilitators of essential functions do exist. They deserve to be investigated, and the underlying molecular regulatory mechanisms must be understood.</p>

<p>(1) Figures 4-5: The analyses of differential gene expression and chromatin organization should be more comprehensive. First, Venn diagrams comparing the sets of significantly differentially expressed genes between this study and previous work should be shown for each developmental stage. Second, given the established role of H3.3 in MSCI, the effect of Atad2 knockout on sex chromosome gene expression should be analyzed. Third, integrated analysis of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data is needed to evaluate how ATAD2 loss affects gene expression. Finally, H3.3 ChIP-seq should be performed to directly assess changes in H3.3 distribution following Atad2 knockout.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) In the revised version, we will include Venn diagrams to illustrate the overlap in significantly differentially expressed genes between this study and previous work. However, we believe that the GSEAs presented here provide stronger evidence, as they indicate the statistical significance of this overlap (p-values). In our case, we observed p-value &lt; 0.01 (**) and p &lt; 0.001 (***).</p>
<p>(2) Sex chromosome gene expression was analyzed and is presented in Fig. 5C.</p>
<p>(3) The effect of ATAD2 loss on gene expression is shown in Fig. 4A, B, and C as histograms, with statistical significance indicated in the middle panels.</p>
<p>(4) Although mapping H3.3 incorporation across the genome in wild-type and Atad2 KO cells would have been informative, the available anti-H3.3 antibody did not work for ChIP-seq, at least in our hands. The authors of Fontaine et al., 2022, who studied H3.3 during spermatogenesis in mice, must have encountered the same problem, since they tagged the endogenous H3.3 gene to perform their ChIP experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 3: The altered distribution of H3.3 is compelling. This raises the possibility that histone marks associated with H3.3 may also be affected, although this has not been investigated. It would therefore be important to examine the distribution of histone modifications typically associated with H3.3. If any alterations are observed, ChIP-seq analyses should be performed to explore them further.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on our understanding of ATAD2’s function—specifically its role in releasing chromatin-bound HIRA—in the absence of ATAD2 the residence time of both HIRA and H3.3 on chromatin increases. This results in the detection of H3.3 not only on sex chromosomes but across the genome. Our data provide clear evidence of this phenomenon. The reviewer is correct in suggesting that the accumulated H3.3 would carry H3.3-associated histone PTMs; however, we are unsure what additional insights could be gained by further demonstrating this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 7: While the authors suggest that pre-PRM2 processing is impaired in Atad2 KO, no direct evidence is provided. It is essential to conduct acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE) followed by western blotting, or a comparable experiment, to substantiate this claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 7 does not suggest that pre-PRM2 processing is affected in Atad2 KO; rather, this figure—particularly Fig. 7B—specifically demonstrates that pre-PRM2 processing is impaired, as shown using an antibody that recognizes the processed portion of pre-PRM2. ELISA was used to provide a more quantitative assessment; however, in the revised manuscript we will also include a western blot image.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) HIRA and ATAD2: Does the upregulation of HIRA fully account for the phenotypes observed in Atad2 KO? If so, would overexpression of HIRA alone be sufficient to phenocopy the Atad2 KO phenotype? Alternatively, would partial reduction of HIRA (e.g., through heterozygous deletion) in the Atad2 KO background be sufficient to rescue the phenotype?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These are interesting experiments that require the creation of appropriate mouse models, which are not currently available.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5)The mechanism by which ATAD2 regulates HIRA turnover on chromatin and the deposition of H3.3 remains unclear from the manuscript and warrants further investigation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer is absolutely correct. In addition to the points addressed in response to Reviewer #1’s general comments (see above), it would indeed have been very interesting to test the segregase activity of ATAD2 (likely driven by its AAA ATPase activity) through in vitro experiments using the Xenopus egg extract system described by Tagami et al., 2004. This system can be applied both in the presence and absence (via immunodepletion) of ATAD2 and would also allow the use of ATAD2 mutants, particularly those with inactive AAA ATPase or bromodomains. However, such experiments go well beyond the scope of this study, which focuses on the role of ATAD2 in chromatin dynamics during spermatogenesis</p>
