<abstract><p>Gut microbiota exert an evolutionarily conserved influence on ageing, from invertebrates to humans. How do microbes that are physically confined to the gut lumen affect the systemic physiological process of ageing? In female <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we show that microbiota increase expression of the peptide hormone <italic>Tachykinin (Tk)</italic>, which corresponds to reduced lifespan. <italic>Tk</italic> is required for microbiota to shorten lifespan, with knockdown rendering flies constitutively long-lived even in the presence of an intact microbiota. This lifespan extension does not come with canonical costs to fecundity or feeding, but impacts on triacylglyceride (TAG) storage suggest adaptive functions in metabolic homeostasis. In flies with defined (gnotobiotic) microbiotas, we show that we can model <italic>Tk</italic>-dependent effects of microbiota on lifespan and TAG by monoassociation with <italic>Acetobacter pomorum</italic>. These effects require <italic>Tk</italic> in the midgut, and the cognate TK receptor <italic>TkR99D</italic> in neurons, implicating a microbiota-gut-neuron relay. This relay also appears to compromise gut barrier function in aged flies, indicating roles in healthspan as well as lifespan. However, the effect of <italic>TkR99D</italic> is independent of its reported role in insulin signalling and adipokinetic hormone signalling which, respectively, are canonical regulators of lifespan and TAG metabolism, suggesting a non-canonical role for <italic>TkR99D</italic> elsewhere in the nervous system. Altogether our results implicate a microbiota-gut-neuron axis in ageing, via a specific bacterium modulating activity of a specific and evolutionarily-conserved hormone.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gut microbiota influence lifespan and ageing across species. This effect appears to be evolutionarily conserved from the invertebrate models <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brummel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cabreiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Houthoofd et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Matthews et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Obata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pryor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sannino et al., 2018</xref>), through to vertebrates including fish and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gordon et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Snyder et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tazume et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Valenzano et al., 2015</xref>). Microbiota are also thought to play a role in human ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Johansen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">OToole and Jeffery, 2015</xref>), supported by mendelian randomisation analysis indicating a putatively causal role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2023</xref>) (but see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gagnon et al., 2023</xref>)). Gut microbiota are physically confined to the gut lumen, yet they influence ageing at an organismal level. By what mechanisms do microbiota modulate these systemic processes?</p>
<p>Evolutionary theories of ageing lead us to expect that mechanisms of ageing should have adaptive functions early in life, i.e. processes under positive selection in early life have deleterious pleiotropic effects in later life, which manifest as ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Williams, 1957</xref>). Microbiota conform to this expectation, with their impacts on ageing appearing to trade off against widespread benefits to host health early in life. For example, microbiota commonly promote host development time, even with the same species of bacteria demonstrated to benefit host development across different phyla of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Schwarzer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Storelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">A. Wong et al., 2014</xref>). This motivates research to characterise how to decouple beneficial effects of microbiota early in life from deleterious effects in late life.</p>
<p>The capacity of microbiota to impact systemic processes, from a physically confined niche in the intestinal lumen, implicates endocrine signalling between organs. A role mediated by endocrine signalling is also consistent with the pleiotropic effects of microbiota, since hormones potently impact multiple traits. The relationship between microbiota and endocrine signalling may be bidirectional, with the microbiota altering how the gut - the biggest endocrine organ in animals - communicates lumen conditions to distal tissues, while distal tissues may direct how the gut manages the microbiota. Signalling in either direction has the potential to modulate ageing, with hormones serving as a key relay.</p>
<p>We chose to investigate these processes in the fruitfly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Flies can be reared axenic (i.e. without exogenous bacteria), and have a simple microbiota dominated by two families of bacteria (<italic>Acetobacteraceae</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic>). These bacteria can be cultured easily, and reintroduced to axenic fly eggs to generate gnotobiotic animals, enabling mapping of host phenotype to bacterial species. Fly genetics also enable tissue- and cell-type-specific genetic manipulations, e.g. expressing RNAi in specific locations, ideal for studying tissue-tissue signalling. We capitalised on these strengths to identify how defined bacteria modulate hormone signalling, and how ageing phenotypes are modulated by tissue-specific lesions in this signalling.</p>

<title>A role for <italic>Tk</italic> in lifespan regulation by microbiota</title>
<p>First, we looked for evidence that microbiota modulate fly endocrine signalling. Hormone activity both to and from the gut could be relevant to impact of microbiota; but since the gut is the site of physical contact with gut microbiota, and also the largest endocrine organ, in which numbers of enteroendocrine cells (EEs) can vary plastically in adults, we reasoned that EE counts could serve as a proxy for microbial impacts of overall endocrine signalling capacity, even though other endocrine tissues could also be affected. When we counted absolute numbers of EEs in whole guts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), we found more cells in guts of conventionally-reared (CR) flies than in axenic flies, suggesting that microbiota enhance capacity for endocrine signalling. Previous studies have shown that microbiota reduce the percentage of EEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Broderick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), which we suggest may have been driven by an even greater microbial promotion of other epithelial cell populations, reducing proportion of EEs despite increased total numbers of EEs.</p>

</fig>
<p>EEs express 14 peptide hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hung et al., 2020</xref>). We asked whether microbiota promote expression of any of these specifically, by reanalysing public transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bost et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We were able to quantify expression of 13 genes, and we analysed the fourteenth (<italic>Burs</italic>) by RT-qPCR (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). Four hormone genes were differentially expressed. Of these four, Tachykinin (<italic>Tk</italic>) - which encodes orthologues of the mammalian neuropeptides Substance P and Neurokinins A/B - appeared a particularly interesting candidate, because published data indicated that <italic>Tk</italic> knockdown flies phenocopy the longer lifespan and metabolic phenotypes observed in axenic flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dobson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rewitz et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sannino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Song et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">A. C.-N. Wong et al., 2014</xref>). Since the differential expression analysis was performed on public data, we validated the impact of microbes on <italic>Tk</italic> expression in our lab stock (<italic>Dahomey</italic>) by RT-qPCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). This correlation between microbial promotion of <italic>Tk</italic> expression and shortening of lifespan, coupled to phenocopying between axenic and <italic>Tk</italic> knockdown flies, led us to predict that <italic>Tk</italic> knockdowns would be constitutively long-lived and their lifespan should no longer respond to microbiota.</p>
<p>We tested our prediction by assessing impact of <italic>Tk</italic> knockdown in flies reared with/without a microbiota. We reared flies under axenic conditions from embryo until death, to avoid potential off-target effects on the fly of antibiotic feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chatzispyrou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Moullan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Ronayne et al., 2023</xref>), after confirming that we could maintain sterile culture conditions throughout the lifespan (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). To establish the genetic role of <italic>Tk</italic>, we first used a ubiquitous knockdown, to avoid in the first instance the possibility that targeting one specific tissue may lead to compensatory expression in another. We drove RNAi expression using an inducible ubiquitous driver (<italic>Daughterless-GeneSwitch</italic> a.k.a. <italic>DaGS)</italic>, which we activated in 3-day-old adult females by feeding a chemical inducer, RU486 (henceforth, RU), thereby avoiding any possible confounding impacts of knockdown during development. In all experiments, we used female flies and a fully-factorial design.</p>
<p>Microbiota shortened lifespan relative to axenic controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). However, <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> blocked this effect, rendering CR flies as long-lived as axenics. Cox Proportional Hazards analysis (CoxPH) revealed a significant <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>:microbiota interaction (p=0.05). To visualise specifically how the experimental conditions differed from one another, we used estimated marginal means (EMMs) to calculate <italic>post hoc</italic> differences between conditions, and to plot <italic>post hoc</italic> metrics of differences in survival (multiplied by −1 such that higher values corresponded to extended lifespan). This analysis revealed a significant shortening of lifespan by microbiota in CR flies relative to axenics, but <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> blocked this effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), i.e. <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> extended lifespan in conventional flies, but not in axenic flies. To confirm the efficacy of <italic>Tk</italic> knockdown in conventional flies with an independent tool, we expressed a distinct RNAi in conventional flies, which also extended lifespan (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>); and an independent recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahrentløv et al., 2025</xref>) also corroborates our findings. CR lifespan was not extended by RU in the absence of the <italic>UAS-Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgene (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>), indicating that the <italic>Tk:</italic>microbiota interaction was attributable to knockdown, not off-target effects of RU feeding; and bacterial load was not altered by <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> induction, suggesting that the lifespan difference is not due to altered density of microbiota (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). Together, these results revealed that gut-microbial modulation of lifespan requires <italic>Tk</italic>.</p>

<title>Evidence for pleiotropic roles of <italic>Tk</italic> between lifespan and metabolism, but not canonical tradeoffs with ageing</title>
<p>Tachykinins are highly pleiotropic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nässel, 2025</xref>), and interventions that extend lifespan are commonly associated with pleiotropic trade-offs early in life. For example, lifespan is expected to anticorrelate reproduction in early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Partridge et al., 2005</xref>), while feeding behaviour, naturally selected to optimise growth and reproduction, is expected to be deleterious for ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Flatt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Good and Tatar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grandison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mair et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore hypothesised that <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> might block beneficial effects of microbiota on reproduction or feeding in early life. We measured steady-state feeding behaviour (proboscis extension) and a point measure of fecundity (egg laying over 24h), after one week of <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> induction in both axenic and CR flies. As expected, microbiota did indeed increase feeding and egg laying in CR flies relative to axenics (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref>), but <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> did not reduce either fecundity or feeding. Thus, longevity in CR <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies appears not to be associated with canonical costs.</p>
<p>We looked for alternative pleiotropic traits. Microbiota have evolutionarily-conserved effects on host metabolism, with increased lipid storage observed in axenic hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dobson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Vijay-Kumar et al., 2010</xref>). Since <italic>Tk</italic> is also implicated in mobilising fly triglyceride (TAG) stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Song et al., 2014</xref>), we anticipated a potential tradeoff with lifespan.

<p>Can the interaction between microbiota and <italic>Tk</italic> be attributed to particular gut bacteria? The fly microbiota, while relatively simple, still contains numerous taxa, which vary among strains and environments, but tend to contain families <italic>Acetobacteraceae and Lactobacillaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brown et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chandler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Staubach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wang and Staubach, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). We characterised the fly microbiota in our lab background by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, and identified amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs). Most ASVs were assigned to the family <italic>Acetobacteraceae</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>), and <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> were also present (among other families). <italic>Acetobacter pomorum</italic> and <italic>Levilactobacillus brevis</italic> are two well-studied species that can be considered representatives of their respective genera, on the basis of genome content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Newell et al., 2014</xref>) and phenotypic impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Newell and Douglas, 2014</xref>).

<p>We generated gnotobiotic flies, monoassociated with either <italic>A. pomorum</italic> (DmCS004) or <italic>L. brevis</italic> (DmCS003), along with axenic controls, and tested whether lifespan impacts were blocked by ubiquitous <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-C</xref>). Without <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, axenic flies were longest-lived, and both bacteria shortened lifespan. flies associated with <italic>A. pomorum</italic> (henceforth <italic>Ap</italic>-flies) were shortest-lived, and flies associated with <italic>L. brevis</italic> (<italic>Lb-</italic>flies) were intermediate. However, <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> induction rendered flies constitutively long-lived, independent of microbiota association and equivalent to axenic controls. Thus, <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> blocked variation in lifespan caused by synthetic variation in the microbiota, and this effect was strongest in <italic>Ap</italic>-flies.</p>
<p>We quantified <italic>Tk</italic> expression by RT-qPCR among axenic flies, <italic>Lb</italic>-flies and <italic>Ap</italic>-flies, and asked whether change in expression upon knockdown (<italic>DaGS, UAS-Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) correlated lifespan outcome (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>). <italic>Tk</italic> expression was lowest in axenics, highest in <italic>Ap</italic>-flies, and intermediate in <italic>Lb</italic>-flies (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7A</xref>), but RU feeding arrested <italic>Tk</italic> expression across all three microbiota conditions - confirming universally efficient knockdown - and this expression level was equivalent to control axenic flies (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7A</xref>). Plotting <italic>Tk</italic> expression against statistical coefficients (EMMs) of the corresponding survival data, revealed a correlation across conditions between <italic>Tk</italic> expression values and lifespan (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7B</xref>). Thus, microbial modulation of lifespan appears to correspond to organismal expression of <italic>Tk</italic>.</p>
<p>We then asked whether specific bacteria and <italic>Tk</italic> interactively modulated TAG levels in youth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). We found reduced TAG in <italic>Ap</italic>-flies relative to axenic flies, and this effect was reversed by <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, consistent with the pleiotropic tradeoff we had observed in CR flies. However no interaction was apparent between <italic>L. brevis</italic> and <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>. Thus, <italic>A. pomorum</italic> was sufficient to modulate TAG in interaction with <italic>Tk</italic>, but <italic>L. brevis</italic> was not. We also note that in both this experiment and the equivalents in CR flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>), feeding RU to axenic flies reduced TAG. Since <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> does not reduce <italic>Tk</italic> expression in axenics (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>), we interpret this as a possible off-target effect of RU, however such an effect cannot account for the lack of difference between axenics without RU and <italic>Ap-</italic>flies/<italic>Lb-</italic>flies with RU.</p>
<p>Altogether, these data demonstrated that <italic>A. pomorum</italic> is sufficient to fully recapitulate the impacts of a complete microbiota on both lifespan and TAG, and interacts equivalently with ubiquitous <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>. By comparison the intermediate effects in <italic>Lb-</italic>flies argues against <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> playing a leading role in the <italic>Tk</italic>-dependent regulation of lifespan and TAG.</p>

<title><italic>A. pomorum</italic> modulates <italic>Tk</italic> expression in midgut but not CNS</title>
<p>Our initial experiments employed ubiquitous <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>. From which specific tissue does <italic>Tk</italic> knockdown mediate effects of the microbiota? Plotting steady-state <italic>Tk</italic> expression from the FlyAtlas2 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Leader et al., 2018</xref>) (i.e. from CR flies), revealed that <italic>Tk</italic> is enriched in neuronal and midgut tissues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We therefore characterised metrics of Tachykinin activity from these two tissues in axenic flies, <italic>Lb-</italic>flies and <italic>Ap</italic>-flies. We examined <italic>Tk</italic> expression by RT-qPCR of RNA from heads and on dissected midguts. <italic>A. pomorum</italic> increased <italic>Tk</italic> expression in midgut, but not in heads; while <italic>L. brevis</italic> did not impact <italic>Tk</italic> expression in either tissue (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We used reporters to confirm intestinal modulation of <italic>Tk</italic> expression. <italic>Acetobacter</italic> are thought to promote Tk signalling epigenetically, by promoting histone lysine acetylation in <italic>Tk+</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jugder et al., 2021</xref>). We confirmed that lysine acetylation was labile in <italic>Tk+</italic> EEs by feeding axenic flies with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin-A, and quantifying staining in <italic>Tk+</italic> cells in both anterior and posterior regions of the midgut (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>). We then examined effects of microbiota, finding increased acetyl-lysine in <italic>Tk+</italic> cells of <italic>Ap-</italic>flies, but not <italic>Lb-</italic>flies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We asked whether this increase corresponded to elevated <italic>Tk</italic> expression, and indeed <italic>Tk</italic> reporter expression (<italic>Tk-T2A-Gal4&gt;UAS-</italic>GFP) was elevated in the anterior midgut, but not posterior midgut (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).

<p>Next we asked whether <italic>Tk</italic> knockdown in the gut blocked the shortened lifespan of <italic>Ap-</italic>flies, using the <italic>Gal4-UAS</italic> system. In the midgut, EEs are marked by <italic>voila-Gal4</italic>, but this construct is also expressed in some neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Scopelliti et al., 2014</xref>), posing a challenge for fully parsing effects of neurons versus midgut EEs. We used a recently-developed intersectional strategy, in which <italic>ChAT-Gal80</italic> represses neuronal <italic>voila-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Medina et al., 2024</xref>), directing Gal4 to the midgut while sparing CNS.

However, expressing <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in all <italic>voila</italic>+ cells (without <italic>ChAT-Gal80</italic>) blocked this effect of <italic>A. pomorum</italic> on lifespan. <italic>ChAT-Gal80</italic> restored a small effect of microbiota, but the magnitude of effect (Z-score) was diminutive, only ∼27-40% of that observed in controls. A second CoxPH analysis of the same data confirmed an overall 4-way interaction of <italic>A. pomorum</italic> and the three transgenes, confirming that the impact of <italic>A. pomorum</italic> was contingent on activation of <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup>,</italic> and the tissues in which it was activated (p=0.0005).

<p>For further validation we conducted a second lifespan experiment, using independent genetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rewitz et al., 2024</xref>) to direct <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> specifically to <italic>Tk</italic>+ EEs, with <italic>Gal4</italic> expressed from the <italic>Tk</italic> locus (<italic>Tk-T2A-Gal4</italic>), recombined with a transgene expressing <italic>Gal80</italic> under control of a fragment of <italic>nSyb</italic> promoter (<italic>R57C10-Gal80</italic>), which is expected to lead to pan-neuronal <italic>Gal80</italic> expression as another means to attenuate neuronal Gal4 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kubrak et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Malita et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rewitz et al., 2024</xref>).

<p>We tested the lifespan impacts of adult-onset TkR manipulation. RNAi constructs were developmentally lethal when crossed to ubiquitous drivers (<italic>DaGS</italic> and <italic>ActGS</italic>), even in the absence of inducer (RU), so instead we established lifespan experiments using the pan-neuronal driver, <italic>Elav-GS</italic>. Lifespan was shorter in <italic>Ap-</italic>flies relative to controls, and RNAi against each TkR interacted with the lifespan effect of <italic>A. pomorum</italic>, but in notably distinct ways. <italic>TkR86C<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> had no effect in <italic>Ap</italic>-flies, but axenics were no longer long-lived (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-C</xref>): this reveals an interaction with <italic>A. pomorum</italic> but does not recapitulate that of <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup>,</italic> suggesting that TkR86C likely does not signal downstream of the <italic>A. pomorum</italic>-<italic>Tk</italic> relay. By contrast, <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> extended lifespan in <italic>Ap-</italic>flies, equivalent to axenics (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-E</xref>). The most parsimonious explanation of these results is an <italic>Acetobacter</italic>-Tk-TkR99D relay, which shortens lifespan.</p>
<p>In fly midgut, TkR99D reportedly plays a role in mobilising lipid stores in enterocytes of the fly midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Song et al., 2014</xref>), prompting us to ask whether it may play an additional role in lifespan from these cells. However, expressing <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> with the enterocyte driver <italic>Mex-GS</italic> did not extend <italic>Ap</italic>-flies lifespan, suggesting that the <italic>A. pomorum-</italic>Tk relay signals gut-nonautonomously (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we asked whether lifespan extension in axenics and upon knockdown of <italic>TkR99D</italic> was accompanied by improved health in older flies (i.e. healthspan). Fly microbiota compromise healthspan by promoting gut barrier dysfunction in aged animals, characterised by permeability which shortly precedes death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Clark et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Regan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zane et al., 2023</xref>). We therefore tested whether <italic>A. pomorum</italic> promoted gut barrier dysfunction, and whether this could be rescued by <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> induction. We aged axenic and <italic>Ap</italic>-flies, with <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> from day 3 of adulthood onwards, before feeding on a blue dye to report gut permeability after 56 days (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). <italic>Ap-</italic>flies indeed exhibited a higher rate of gut permeability than axenics, but <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> rescued the pathology to a level that was not significantly different from axenics. Thus, <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> can ameliorate deleterious impacts of <italic>A. pomorum</italic> on late-life health, suggesting that the putative <italic>A. pomorum</italic>-<italic>Tk-TkR99D</italic> relay limits late-life health.</p>

<p>We tested whether insulin signalling was required for lifespan to respond to <italic>A. pomorum</italic>. The forkhead box-O transcription factor dFOXO, encoded by the <italic>dFoxO</italic> locus, is obligately required for longevity upon reduced insulin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Slack et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">2011</xref>). dFOXO is retained in cytoplasm of Ap-flies, consistent with activated insulin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">S. Shin et al., 2011</xref>). We recombined a dFOXO null mutation (<italic>dFoxO<sup>Δ94</sup></italic>) with transgenes to knock down <italic>Tk</italic> ubiquitously, performed lifespan assays, and used Cox proportional hazards analysis to test for an <italic>A. pomorum*Tk*dFoxO</italic> interaction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B-C</xref>). We observed a significant three-way interaction (CoxPH p=5.384e-05) – indicating that <italic>dFoxO<sup>Δ94</sup></italic> modulated the microbiota-<italic>Tk</italic> interaction – and then used post-hoc tests to dissect the co-dependence of the three experimental variables (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In controls without <italic>Tk</italic> knockdown, <italic>A. pomorum</italic> shortened lifespan relative to axenics in wild-type flies, but <italic>dFoxO<sup>Δ94</sup></italic> flies exhibited a diminished but still-significant shortening of lifespan by <italic>A. pomorum</italic>. Without <italic>dFoxO<sup>Δ94</sup>, Tk</italic> knockdown blocked lifespan response by rendering <italic>Ap</italic>-flies long-lived. In the <italic>dFoxO<sup>Δ94</sup></italic> background<italic>, Tk</italic> knockdown did not extend lifespan, in either <italic>Ap-</italic>flies or axenics. However, unexpectedly, <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> ceased to block the effect of <italic>A. pomorum</italic> in the <italic>dFoxO<sup>Δ94</sup></italic> background. Thus, in summary, (A) <italic>dFoxO</italic> is partially required for lifespan effect of <italic>A. pomorum</italic>, (B) <italic>dFoxO</italic> is required for lifespan extension upon <italic>Tk</italic> knockdown, and (C) <italic>dFoxO</italic> is required for <italic>A. pomorum</italic> and <italic>Tk</italic> knockdown to have an interactive effect on lifespan.

<p>To assess directly the role of tissues reported to express <italic>TkR99D</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Birse et al., 2011</xref>), we turned to the IPCs. We first tested whether ablating these cells by expressing the pro-apoptotic factor <italic>Rpr</italic> would block lifespan response to <italic>A. pomorum</italic>, reasoning that a role for these cells in response to the bacteria would be shown by a lack of response following ablation. Lifespan was again shortened in <italic>Ap-</italic>flies relative to axenic controls. However this effect was blocked by adult-onset <italic>Rpr</italic> expression in IPCs (using the <italic>Dilp2-GS</italic> driver) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D-E</xref>), and we detected an overall microbiota*RU interaction (CoxPH p=0.003). This indicated a role for IPCs in lifespan shortening by <italic>A. pomorum</italic>. To test whether TkR99D activation could account for this effect we expressed <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in IPCs, and assayed expression of the three insulin-like peptides expressed therein (<italic>Ilp2, Ilp3, Ilp5</italic>) by RT-qPCR of heads (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). <italic>Ilp2</italic> exhibited no response to <italic>A. pomorum</italic> or <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>.(linear model, microbiota:RU interaction F<sub>1,24</sub>=0.424, p=0.5) However, for <italic>Ilp3</italic> and <italic>Ilp5</italic>, <italic>A. pomorum</italic> promoted expression, and this effect was blocked by <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> induction (linear models, microbiota:RU interactions <italic>Ilp3</italic> F<sub>1,24</sub>=23.404, p=0.0001, <italic>Ilp5</italic> F<sub>1,24</sub>=29.261, p&lt;0.0001.) Specifically, <italic>Ilp3</italic> and <italic>Ilp5</italic> expression levels were increased in <italic>Ap-</italic>flies, but these effects were absent upon <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> induction (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, we tested whether <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in IPCs blocked lifespan shortening by <italic>A. pomorum</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7G-H</xref>). As expected, without <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup>, Ap</italic>-flies were shorter-lived than axenics. <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> induction in IPCs did not affect axenic lifespan but, surprisingly, the lifespan-shortening effect of <italic>A. pomorum</italic> was exaggerated by <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> induction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>). Consequently, <italic>A. pomorum’s</italic> effect on lifespan seemingly cannot be explained by TkR99D activation in IPCs. We also tested whether <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in IPCs altered effects of <italic>A. pomorum</italic> on TAG levels in young flies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>): no interaction was apparent (though we detected independent effects of microbiota (ANOVA F=14.95, Df=1,37, p=0.0004) and RNAi induction (F=4.32, Df=1,37, p=0.04)), suggesting that interactive effects of <italic>A. pomorum</italic> and Tk peptides are not mediated by <italic>TkR99D</italic> in IPCs.</p>
<p>Altogether, these data outline involvement of insulin signalling in responses to <italic>A. pomorum</italic> and <italic>Tk</italic>, because IPC ablation blocked lifespan shortening by <italic>A. pomorum</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D-E</xref>), and because <italic>dFoxO</italic> was required for the interaction of <italic>A. pomorum</italic> and <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>. However, the failure of <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in IPCs to block <italic>A. pomorum’s</italic> effects on lifespan or TAG suggests that insulin signalling does not act downstream of the putative <italic>A. pomorum</italic>/Tk/TkR signalling relay. These data may suggest priming, with insulin signalling required to potentiate responses to <italic>A. pomorum</italic>/Tk/TkR.</p>

<title>No evidence of role for <italic>TkR99D</italic> in Akh-producing cells in lifespan and metabolic response to <italic>A. pomorum</italic></title>
<p>In insects, adipokinetic hormone (Akh) is released from <italic>corpora cardiaca</italic> (cc) to promote lipid mobilisation in response to heightened energy demand, analogous to glucagon in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gäde and Marco, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Musselman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Toprak et al., 2020</xref>).

<p>First, to test whether Akh peptide levels in CC were <italic>A. pomorum</italic>-dependent, we quantified Akh with antibody staining.

<p>We then tested directly whether TkR99D was required in Akh-producing cells for <italic>A. pomorum</italic> to shorten lifespan. <italic>A. pomorum</italic> shortened lifespan across the all different <italic>Akh</italic> conditions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B-C</xref>).

However, these data indicate that lifespan shortening by <italic>A. pomorum</italic> is independent of TkR99D in CC. We also tested whether RNAi against Akh receptor (<italic>AkhR</italic>) in adipose (fat body) altered response to <italic>A. pomorum</italic>, driving expression with <italic>S106-GS</italic>, but again no interaction was apparent (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10</xref>).

Here we have connected microbial regulation of ageing with tissue-specific regulation of endocrine signalling genes in gut and neurons. Our <italic>Drosophila</italic> results show that (A) <italic>A. pomorum</italic> is sufficient to modulate <italic>Tk</italic> in the midgut, (B) knocking down the peptide in midgut blocks the lifespan response to the bacteria, and (C) neuronal knockdown of the receptor <italic>TkR99D</italic> recapitulates these effects. We are struck by the specificity of this circuit, with knockdown of a single peptide-encoding locus in a specific tissue ablating the microbial impact on lifespan, despite the wide array of host functions that the microbiota affect. This specific requirement can likely be explained by the highly pleiotropic functions of Tachykinins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nässel, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nässel et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Tk</italic> knockdown reprograms organismal physiology to a state in which lifespan can no longer be modulated by microbiota. Given the evolutionary conservation of tachykinins, it will be interesting in future work to ask whether this family of peptides can also modulate ageing in other species.</p>
<p>Our work indicates that the influence of the microbiota-<italic>Tk/TkR99D</italic> relay is partially independent of better-studied lifespan assurance mechanisms, i.e. insulin signalling, and phenotypes associated with ageing. The lifespan benefit of <italic>Tk</italic> knockdown was not accompanied by costs to fecundity or feeding rate in CR flies, but instead knockdown altered metabolic impact of microbiota. Furthermore, knocking down <italic>TkR99D</italic> in major signalling hubs associated with ageing and TAG metabolism (IPCs and Akh+ cells, respectively) did not block lifespan or TAG response to <italic>A. pomorum</italic>, suggesting that yet-uncharacterised neuroendocrine mechanisms are at play. We interpret the partial requirement for <italic>dFoxO</italic>, connecting <italic>A. pomorum</italic> to <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> modulation of lifespan, as suggesting that insulin potentiates downstream responsiveness, without necessarily being involved directly by <italic>TkR99D</italic> in IPCs.</p>
<p>Our work was performed entirely in females. We chose to study the sex that tends to exhibit more robust response to anti-ageing interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Regan and Partridge, 2013</xref>), because of the labour-intensive and technically challenging nature of performing lifespan experiments under lifelong axenic conditions. Having established this the <italic>A. pomorum-Tk-TkR99D</italic> connection, it will be interesting in future work to ask whether males also enjoy a lifespan benefit of diminishing the activity of this circuit.</p>
<p><italic>Tk</italic> is one of a number of signalling circuits implicated downstream of the microbiota, for example JAK-STAT and JNK signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Buchon et al., 2009</xref>), IMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jugder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Watnick and Jugder, 2020</xref>), and the neuropeptide CNMamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). We do not propose that Tachykinins alone are sufficient to explain all physiological effects of the microbiota: rather we expect that the interplay of multiple signalling pathways collectively orchestrate the host organismal response to microbiota. Indeed our transcriptome (re)analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) suggested that a community of bacteria co-regulate expression of the neuropeptides <italic>ITP, AstC</italic> and <italic>NPF</italic> alongside <italic>Tk.</italic> We note that <italic>Tk</italic> and <italic>NPF</italic> are co-expressed in a number of the same EE populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Guo et al., 2019</xref>), and related functions on nutrient-specific appetite, physiology and Akh signalling are reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahrentløv et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Malita et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting closely coupled functions for Tk and NPF which may also be relevant to integrating responses to microbiota. Further work should aim to identify the broader signalling networks that respond to the microbiota, and the extent to which the constituents and structure of those networks mirror what is known in other contexts (e.g. responses to diet or pathogenic infection).</p>
<p>A key element to better understanding how signalling networks at large respond to microbiota will be to better understand what properties of the microbiota the signals convey. Signalling is selected to convey information about environmental, nutritional, and physiological state: which of these parameters do the microbiota impact? Impacts on metabolism could be mediated by direct provision of nutrients (e.g. short-chain fatty acids, B-vitamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sannino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S. C. Shin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">A. C.-N. Wong et al., 2014</xref>)), and/or competition with the host by removal of nutrients from diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huang and Douglas, 2015</xref>). Immunity may be modulated by bacterial titre, to prevent pathological overgrowth of otherwise mutualistic bacteria. Our results indicate that the interplay between bacteria and <italic>Tk</italic> knockdown is bacteria-specific, suggesting in turn that more complex mixes of bacteria that co-occur with the fly may elicit distinct signalling network topologies. Furthermore, the previous finding that fly transcriptional networks are structured by microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dobson et al., 2016</xref>) leads to a question of whether other host networks - such as endocrine signalling - may also be structured by microbiota, in which case signalling in the presence of one bacterium might elicit quite different physiological responses than in the presence of a distinct bacterium.</p>
<p>The two biggest mechanistic questions arising from this work are (A) from where in the nervous system does <italic>TkR99D</italic> inhibition extend lifespan? and (B) by what mechanism does inhibition extend lifespan? We tested two neuroendocrine tissues, the IPCs and the Akh+ cells, finding that <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in either did not block shortened lifespan or TAG phenotypes in <italic>Ap-</italic>flies (though bacteria-independent effects of <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in <italic>Akh+</italic> cells were apparent). These data suggest that we can reject a role for TkR99D in IPCs and <italic>Akh+</italic> cells, and instead that an elusive population of <italic>TkR99D+</italic> neurons is at play downstream of the <italic>Acetobacter-Tk</italic> relay. With respect to future mechanistic understanding, we suggest it will be important to note that pan-neuronal <italic>TkR99D<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> also mitigated gut permeability (smurfing) in aged <italic>Ap</italic>-fies, because the smurf phenotype is underpinned by increased immune system activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Clark et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Clark and Walker, 2017</xref>), and activation of <italic>Tk</italic> cells by <italic>Acetobacter</italic> is dependent on immune (IMD) signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jugder et al., 2021</xref>). Together these observations suggest close links between <italic>Tk</italic> signalling and immunity, outlining a possible role for <italic>Acetobacter/Tk/TkR99D</italic> in “inflammaging”.</p>
<p>The biggest comparative question arising from our work is whether our findings are relevant in other animals, potentially including mammals. Flies have a track record of revealing mechanisms of ageing that are conserved in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bjedov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Clancy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Miller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Selman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wilkinson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). Tachykinins are conserved from invertebrates to mammals, raising the question of whether their functions in ageing are also conserved. The next step would most likely be to assess whether Tachykinin knockdown has anti-ageing effects in rodents, and/or short-lived vertebrates like the African turquoise killifish. Such studies may pave the way for drug repurposing, as some small-molecule inhibitors of human TkRs have already been developed and are licenced in some jurisdictions for specific purposes. Such interest is timely since the therapeutic role of TkRs is receiving renewed attention for potential metabolic therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sass et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study establishes a mechanistic connection between the microbiota and ageing via gut/neuron signalling. Microbial shortening of host lifespan depends on <italic>Tk/TkR</italic> signalling, which can be explained by <italic>Acetobacter</italic> activating intestinal <italic>Tk</italic> and, downstream, neuronal <italic>TkR99D</italic>. The findings hint at effects which may be conserved in other systems, which may ultimately help to explain mechanistically why microbiota exert a conserved influence on animal health and ageing.</p>

Crosses were performed on juice agar in egg laying cages (per litre: 20g agar, 26g sucrose, 52g glucose, 7g yeast, 88.8ml organic clementine or grape juice). To generate axenic flies, eggs were collected and washed 2x in alternating 10% bleach for (3-5 min) and sterile ddH2O for (1 min), with an optional additional 1 min wash in EtOH, before being allowed to pellet by gravity in sterile PBS. 20 µl of egg pellet was aspirated with wide-mouthed pipette tips into T75 flasks containing 50mL SYA. Preservatives were included during fly development only in CR experiments. We made gnotobiotic embryos as as previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sannino and Dobson, 2023</xref>). M9+lactate media comprised 200ml 5x M9 salts, 2ml 1M MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1ml 1M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25ml 20% (v/v) lactate, made up to 1l in ddH<sub>2</sub>O and autoclaved. YPD media comprised 10g yeast extract (VWR 84601.0500), 20g peptone (VWR 84620.0500), 20g dextrose (Fisher Life Sci G/0500/53). <italic>Acetobacter pomorum</italic> (DmCS004) was streaked and grown on M9+lactate plates (1.5% agar), before growing single colonies in liquid M9+lactate at 30°C with shaking (225 rpm) for 2 days.

Cultures were pelleted, washed, resuspended and diluted in sterile PBS to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2. 200 µL of bacterial suspensions were added to T75 flasks containing freshly-prepared axenic eggs.</p>
<p>Newly emerged flies transferred to fresh media using sterile technique in a laminar flow hood, (preservatives as per development) for the first three days of adulthood before gentle anaesthesia on CO<sub>2</sub>. Males were removed and females allocated to SYA containing preservatives in sterile glass <italic>Drosophila</italic> vials, using aseptic technique in a laminair flow hood with a sterile paint brush and sterile petri dish on ice. In experiments using RU486 (Mifepristone, Cayman Chemical, CAY10006317), 2ml l<sup>− 1</sup> of 100mM RU486 stock solution in EtOH was incorporated into media at 200µM final concentration, and fed from day 3 adulthood onwards. 2ml EtOH was incorporated as vehicle control in RU-free controls.</p>
<p>For lifespan assays, mated females were allocated to sterile glassware in groups of 15, and transferred to fresh food every 2–3 days. At each transfer, deaths and censors were scored until all flies were dead. For axenic and gnotobiotic lifespans, fly tipping was performed in a sterile laminar flow hood with aseptic technique.</p>

<title>Feeding and egg laying assays</title>
<p>Feeding rate was measured by quantifying average proboscis extension rate (PER) over 3-4 hours. Vials containing 5 mated females each were arranged on a benchtop in a 25°C room the night before behavioural observations to allow acclimation. Experimenters were blinded to vial ID and experimental condition. The following morning, PER was recorded by iteratively counting the instantaneous number of flies feeding per vial for 3-4 hours. The average of these measurements per each given vial was taken as that vial’s feeding rate. At the end of the experiment, flies were disposed, and vials frozen. The next day eggs were counted from the same frozen vials.</p>

<title>TAG assay</title>
<p>Female flies were collected and divided into groups of 5, 3 days post eclosion. Each group was weighed on a Thermo microbalance to an accuracy of .01 mg. Weighed females were added to a sterile 2mL screw-cap tube containing sterile 1.4mm ceramic beads and 125 µL of TET buffer (10mM Tris, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100). Samples were homogenised for 30s at max speed. After homogenisation, samples were incubated at 72°C for 15 min in a dry bath to inactivate lipases and other enzymes. Then samples were centrifuged at max speed for 5 min at 4°C. From each sample 3 µL of the supernatant was added to a clear, flat bottom 96 well plate. Standard curves were generated using a glycerol stock ranging from 1-0 ug/ul. Triglyceride levels were assayed by the method of Fossati and Prencipe(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fossati and Prencipe, 1982</xref>), with absorbance measured at 540 nm in a Thermo MultiSkan FC plate reader.</p>

<title>RNA extraction</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from whole flies by the addition of 10 female flies per sample to sterile 2 mL screw cap tubes containing 600 µL of TRIzol (Ambion by Life technologies) and homogenised in a Ribolyzer and running at 6.5 (max) for 10 seconds. 200 µL chloroform was added, briefly vortexed, and incubated at RT for 3 min. Samples were centrifuged 12,000rpm for 15m at 4°C, 250µl of isopropanol was added to supernatants, vortexed, and incubated at RT for 10 minutes. Samples were then centrifuged at 12,000rpm for 10m at 4°C. The liquid was removed and discarded, while the pellet containing the RNA was washed with 1mL of 75% ethanol. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10m at 4°C. The liquid was removed without disturbing the pellet, and the tubes were dried at RT with caps opened. Pellets were reconstituted in DEPC water (10µl/fly) and stored at −80°C.</p>

<title>16s amplicon sequencing</title>
<p>DNA was extracted from whole guts, dissected from 3 day-old wild-type stock females (i.e. conventionally-reared and bearing a complete microbiota, 5 per sample, 10 samples total) after 1 minute surface-sterilisation in 70% EtOH. Guts were deposited immediately into TRIzol and homogenised in a ribolyser. 300µl chloroform was added and inverted followed by 3 mins incubation at room temperature, 15 minutes centrifugation at 12000g. Aqueous layer was removed before 500µl back extraction buffer (4M Guanidine thiocyanate, 50 mM sodium citrate, 1M Tris base) was added and mixed by inverting. Samples were spun again at 12000g for 30 minutes and aqueous phase transferred to new tubes with 400 µl isopropanol. Samples were mixed by inversion, centrifuged 15 minutes at 12000g. Pellets were washed in 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 50 µl TE buffer.</p>
<p>Library prep was performed by the University of Glasgow MVLS Shared Research Facility from 12.5ng input DNA per sample, with an initial PCR using Accustart PCRToughMix and 0.5µl 10mM primers against 16s V3/V4 region (FWD TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG, REV GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC), using 25 cycles at an annealing temperature of 60°C, followed by barcoding with Illumina Nextera XT 1 primers, cleanup with 0.9X Spri Select beads (Beckman Coulter), and washing in 80% EtOH. Libraries were quantified by Qubit HS DNA assay and size distributions checked on an Agilent Bioanalyser. Pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq in paired end mode (300bp) using a 600 cycle cartridge kit, 5% PhiX, to an average depth of 170K reads per sample.</p>

<title>RT-qPCR</title>
<p>RNA samples were quantified by spectrophotometry using a Nanodrop 1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific). First strand synthesis of cDNA was performed using the SuperScriptTM Reverse Transcriptase (RT) kit (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s protocol (using 2µg of RNA). The PCR profile was as follows: 95°C for 2 minutes; 94°C denaturation for 30 seconds, 60°C annealing for 30 seconds, 72°C extension for 30 seconds each for 40 cycles, with a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes. The amplicon was migrated through a 1% (w/v) agarose gel. To test for relative gene expression levels, RT-qPCR was performed. Each well contained 2 μl cDNA, 1.5 μl 10 mM forward primer, 1.5 μl 10 mM reverse primer, 3 μl water, 10 μl SYBR green PCR master mix, and 2 ul ROX (Qiagen, UK). The following PCR profile was used: 95°C for 5 minutes; 94°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 30 seconds each for 40 cycles, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes.

<title>Antibody staining and imaging</title>
<p>Whole guts were extracted from 10-day old female flies (axenic, gnotobiotic, and axenic on 1µM TSA), and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30m in a 12 well plate. Guts were then incubated in 1 mL of PBST (1X PBS with 0.1% triton X-100) overnight with slight shaking at 4°C. PBST was carefully aspirated from sample wells, and guts were then washed with 1 mL of Blocking buffer (10% 1X PBS, 1% triton X-100, 2.5% Normal Goat Serum) at 4°C overnight. Blocking buffer was removed, and 0.5 mL of acetyl-lysine antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies 9441) diluted 1/800 in blocking buffer was added to the wells, and incubated overnight at 4°C with slight shaking. Guts were then washed 3X with PBST for 10 minutes, followed by a 1 hr RT PBST wash with slight shaking. 0.5 mL of secondary antibody secondary antibodies diluted 1/200 in PBST was added to the guts, and incubated overnight at 4°C.

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>All enumerated data were plotted and analysed in R 4.4.2. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Team, 2024</xref>). Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted with <monospace>survminer::ggsurvplot_facet</monospace>. Other quantitative data were plotted with ggplot2. Survival data were analysed with CoxPH models (<monospace>survival::coxph</monospace>). Fecundity data were analysed with negative binomial models (<monospace>lme4::glmer.nb</monospace>). All other data were analysed with <monospace>stats::lm</monospace> (after logit transformation for proportion flies feeding). Post-hoc tests were performed with <monospace>emmeans::joint_tests</monospace> and <monospace>emmeans::pairs</monospace>, coefficients were extracted from <monospace>emmeans::emmip</monospace>. Survival indices were generated by applying <monospace>emmeans::emmip</monospace> to coxph models, multiplied by −1, such that higher values corresponded to longer lifespan.</p>
<p>Published transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bost et al., 2018</xref>) were reanalysed by FastQC and quantified with Salmon. The previous publication by Bost et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bost et al., 2018</xref>) presented bulk RNAseq on midguts of flies reared under axenic conditions or with a 5-species gnotobiotic microbiota comprising <italic>Acetobacter</italic> and <italic>Levilactobacillus</italic> species. The original analysis presented excluded expression of ∼70% of genes in the fly genome, and hormones were largely excluded. We reanalysed the raw data using Salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Patro et al., 2017</xref>) to quantify expression, which quantified expression of 10,290 genes, including 14 of the 15 enteroendocrine hormone genes (except <italic>bursicon</italic>). We tested for differential expression using DESeq2, identifying 470 differentially expressed genes (FDR ≤ 0.01, ≥2-fold difference in mean expression). These 470 genes included four peptide hormones: <italic>Tachykinin (Tk), Allostatin C (AstC), Ion Transport Peptide (ITP), and Neuropeptide F (NPF)</italic>. Since <italic>Burs</italic> was not quantified by the Salmon algorithm, we tested independently whether its expression was modulated by microbiota by extracting RNA from midguts of CR and axenic flies.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study demonstrates that in Drosophila melanogaster, tachykinin (Tk) expression is regulated by the microbiota. The authors present <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that axenic flies raised with no microbiota are longer-lived than conventionally reared animals, and that Tk expression and Tk receptors in the nervous system are required for this effect. They further test individual bacterial strains for their role in these effects and connect the effect to loss of lipid stores and suggest that FOXO may be involved in the phenotype, results that are of interest to the fields of environmental perception, host microbiome interactions, and geroscience.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study the authors use a Drosophila model to demonstrate that Tachykinin (Tk) expression is regulated by the microbiota. In Drosophila conventionally reared (CR) flies are typically shorter lived than those raised without a microbiota (axenic). Here, knockdown of Tk expression is found to prevent lifespan shortening by the microbiota and the reduction of lipid stores typically seen in CR flies when compared to axenic counterparts. It does so without reducing food intake or fecundity which are often seen as necessary trade-offs for lifespan extension. Further, the strength of the interaction between Tk and the microbiota is found to be bacteria specific and is stronger in Acetobacter pomorum (Ap) mono-associated flies compared to Levilactobacillus brevis (Lb) mono-association. The impact on lipid storage was also only apparent in Ap-flies.</p>
<p>Building on these findings the authors show that gut specific knockdown is largely sufficient to explain these phenotypes. Knockdown of the Tk receptor, TkR99D, in neurons recapitulates the lifespan phenotype of intestinal Tk knockdown supporting a model whereby Tk from the gut signals to TkR99D expressing neurons to regulate lifespan. In addition, the authors show that FOXO may have a role in lifespan regulation by the Tk-microbiota interaction. However, they rule out a role for insulin producing cells or Akh-producing cells suggesting the microbiota-Tk interaction regulates lifespan through other, yet unidentified, mechanisms.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>Overall, I find the key conclusions of the paper convincing. The authors present an extensive amount of experimental work, and their conclusions are well founded in the data. In particular, the impact of TkRNAi on lifespan and lipid levels, the central finding in this study, has been demonstrated multiple times in different experiments and using different genetic tools. As a result, I don't feel that additional experimental work is necessary to support the current conclusions.</p>
<p>However, I find it hard to assess the robustness of the lifespan data from the other manipulations used (TkR99DRNAi, TkRNAi in dFoxo mutants etc.) because information on the population size and whether these experiments have been replicated is lacking. Can the authors state in the figure legends the numbers of flies used for each lifespan and whether replicates have been done? For all other data it is clear how many replicates have been done, and the methods give enough detail for all experiments to be reproduced.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>Overall, I find the key conclusions of the paper convincing. The authors present an extensive amount of experimental work, and their conclusions are well founded in the data. We have known that the microbiota influence lifespan for some time but the mechanisms by which they do so have remained elusive. This study identifies one such mechanism and as a result opens several avenues for further research. The Tk-microbiota interaction is shown to be important for both lifespan and lipid homeostasis, although it's clear these are independent phenotypes. The fact that the outcome of the Tk-microbiota interaction depends on the bacterial species is of particular interest because it supports the idea that manipulation of the microbiota, or specific aspects of the host-microbiota interaction, may have therapeutic potential.</p>
<p>These findings will be of interest to a broad readership spanning host-microbiota interactions and their influence on host health. They move forward the study of microbial regulation of host longevity and have relevance to our understanding of microbial regulation of host lipid homeostasis. They will also be of significant interest to those studying the mechanisms of action and physiological roles of Tachykinins.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The main finding of this work is that microbiota impacts lifespan though regulating the expression of a gut hormone (Tk) which in turn acts on its receptor expressed on neurons. This conclusion is robust and based on a number of experimental observations, carefully using techniques in fly genetics and physiology: 1) microbiota regulates Tk expression, 2) lifespan reduction by microbiota is absent when Tk is knocked down in gut (specifically in the EEs), 3) Tk knockdown extends lifespan and this is recapitulated by knockdown of a Tk receptor in neurons. These key conclusions are very convincing. Additional data are presented detailing the relationship between Tk and insulin/IGF signalling and Akh in this context. These are two other important endocrine signalling pathways in flies. The presentation and analysis of the data are excellent.</p>
<p>There are only a few experiments or edits that I would suggest as important to confirm or refine the conclusions of this manuscript. These are:</p>
<p>(1) When comparing the effects of microbiota (or single bacterial species) in different genetic backgrounds or experimental conditions, I think it would be good to show that the bacterial levels are not impacted by the other intervention(s). For example, the lifespan results observed in Figure 2A are consistent with Tk acting downstream of the microbes but also with Tk RNAi having an impact on the microbiota itself. I think this simple, additional control could be done for a few key experiments. Similarly, the authors could compare the two bacterial species to see if the differences in their effects come from different ability to colonise the flies.</p>
<p>(2) The effect of Tk RNAi on TAG is opposite in CR and Ax or CR and Ap flies, and the knockdown shows an effect in either case (Figure 2E, Figure 3D). Why is this? Better clarification is required.</p>
<p>(3) With respect to insulin signalling, all the experiments bar one indicate that insulin is mediating the effects of Tk. The one experiment that does not is using dilpGS to knock down TkR99D. Is it possible that this driver is simply not resulting in an efficient KD of the receptor? I would be inclined to check this, but as a minimum I would be a bit more cautious with the interpretation of these data.</p>
<p>(4) Is it possible to perform at least one lifespan repeat with the other Tk RNAi line mentioned? This would further clarify that there are no off-target effects that can account for the phenotypes.</p>
<p>There are a few other experiments that I could suggest as I think they could enrich the current manuscript, but I do not believe they are essential for publication:</p>
<p>(5) The manuscript could be extended with a little more biochemical/cell biology analysis. For example, is it possible to look at Tk protein levels, Tk levels in circulation, or even TkR receptor activation or activation of its downstream signalling pathways? Comparing Ax and CR or Ap and CR one would expect to find differences consistent with the model proposed. This would add depth to the genetic analysis already conducted. Similarly, for insulin signalling - would it be possible to use some readout of the pathway activity and compare between Ax and CR or Ap and CR?</p>
<p>(6) The authors use a pan-acetyl-K antibody but are specifically interested in acetylated histones. Would it be possible to use antibodies for acetylated histones? This would have the added benefit that one can confirm the changes are not in the levels of histones themselves.</p>
<p>(7) I think the presentation of the results could be tightened a bit, with fewer sections and one figure per section.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>The main contribution of this manuscript is the identification of a mechanism that links the microbiota to lifespan. This is very exciting and topical for several reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The microbiota is very important for overall health but it is still unclear how. Studying the interaction between microbiota and health is an emerging, growing field, and one that has attracted a lot of interest, but one that is often lacking in mechanistic insight. Identifying mechanisms provides opportunities for therapies. The main impact of this study comes from using the fruit fly to identify a mechanism.</p>
<p>(2) It is very interesting that the authors focus on an endocrine mechanism, especially with the clear clinical relevance of gut hormones to human health recently demonstrated with new, effective therapies (e.g. Wegovy).</p>
<p>(3) Tk is emerging as an important fly hormone and this study adds a new and interesting dimension by placing TK between microbiota and lifespan.</p>
<p>I think the manuscript will be of great interest to researchers in ageing, human and animal physiology and in gut endocrinology and gut function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Marcu et al. demonstrate a gut-neuron axis that is required for the lifespan-shortening effects mediated by gut bacteria. They show that the presence of commensal bacteria-particularly Acetobacter pomorum-promotes Tk expression in the gut, which then binds to neuronal tachykinin receptors to shorten lifespan. Tk has also recently been reported to extend lifespan via adipokinetic hormone (Akh) signaling (Ahrentløv et al., Nat Metab 7, 2025), but the mechanism here appears distinct. The lifespan shortening by Ap via Tk seems to be partially dependent on foxo and independent of both insulin signaling and Akh-mediated lipid mobilization.</p>
<p>Although the detailed mechanistic link to lifespan is not fully resolved, the experiment and its results clearly show the involvement of the molecules tested. This work adds a valuable dimension to our growing understanding of how gut bacteria influence host longevity. However, there are some points that should be addressed.</p>
<p>(1) Tk+ EEC activity should be assessed directly, rather than relying solely on transcript levels. Approaches such as CaLexA or GCaMP could be used.</p>
<p>(2) In Line243, the manuscript states that the reporter activity was not increased in the posterior midgut. However, based on the presented results in Fig4E, there is seemingly not apparent regional specificity. A more detailed explanation is necessary.</p>
<p>(3) If feasible, assessing foxo activation would add mechanistic depth. This could be done by monitoring foxo nuclear localization or measuring the expression levels of downstream target genes.</p>
<p>(4) Fig1C uses Adh for normalization. Given the high variability of the result, the authors should (1) check whether Adh expression levels changed via bacterial association and/or (2) compare the results using different genes as internal standard.</p>
<p>(5) While the difficulty of maintaining lifelong axenic conditions is understandable, it may still be feasible to assess the induction of Tk (i.e.. Tk transcription or EE activity upregulation) by the microbiome on males.</p>
<p>(6) We also had some concerns regarding the wording of the title.</p>
<p>
Fig6B and C suggests that TkR86C, in addition to TkR99D, may be involved in the A. pomorum-lifespan interaction. Consider revising the title to refer more generally to the &quot;tachykinin receptor&quot; rather than only TkR99D.</p>
<p>
The difference between &quot;aging&quot; and &quot;lifespan&quot; should also be addressed. While the study shows a role for Tk in lifespan, assessment of aging phenotypes (e.g. Climbing assay, ISC proliferation) beyond the smurf assay is required to make conclusions about aging.</p>
<p>(7) The statement in Line 82 that EEs express 14 peptide hormones should be supported with an appropriate reference, if available.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>General assessment: The main strength of this study is the careful and extensive lifespan analyses, which convincingly demonstrate the role of gut microbiota in regulating longevity. The authors clarify an important aspect of how microbial factors contribute to lifespan control. The main limitation is that the study primarily confirms the involvement of previously reported signaling pathways, without identifying novel molecular players or previously unrecognized mechanisms of lifespan regulation.</p>
<p>Advance: The lifespan-shortening effect of Acetobacter pomorum (Ap) has been reported previously, as has the lifespan-shortening effect of Tachykinin (Tk). However, this study is the first to link these two factors mechanistically, which represents a significant and original contribution to the field. The advance is primarily mechanistic, providing new insight into how microbial cues converge on host signaling pathways to influence ageing.</p>
<p>Audience: This work will be of particular interest to a specialized audience of basic researchers in ageing biology. It will also attract interest from microbiome researchers who are investigating host-microbe interactions and their physiological consequences. The findings will be useful as a conceptual framework for future mechanistic studies in this area.</p>

<p><bold>(1) General Statements</bold></p>
<p>The goal of our study was to mechanistically connect microbiota to host longevity. We have done so using a combination of genetic and physiological experiments, which outline a role for a neuroendocrine relay mediated by the intestinal neuropeptide <italic>Tachykinin</italic>, and its receptor <italic>TkR99D</italic> in neurons. We also show a requirement for these genes in metabolic and healthspan effects of microbiota.</p>
<p>The referees' comments suggest they find the data novel and technically sound. We have added data in response to numerous points, which we feel enhance the manuscript further, and we have clarified text as requested. Reviewer #3 identified an error in Figure 4, which we have rectified. We felt that some specific experiments suggested in review would not add significant further depth, as we articulate below.</p>
<p>Altogether our reviewers appear to agree that our manuscript makes a significant contribution to both the microbiome and ageing fields, using a large number of experiments to mechanistically outline the role(s) of various pathways and tissues. We thank the reviewers for their positive contributions to the publication process.</p>

We are also attempting the equivalent experiment in mouse colon reared with/without a defined microbiota. These experiments are ongoing, but we note that the referee feels that the manuscript is a publishable unit whether these stainings succeed or not.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Can the authors state in the figure legends the numbers of flies used for each lifespan and whether replicates have been done?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have incorporated the requested information into legends for lifespan experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Do the interventions shorten lifespan relative to the axenic cohort? Or do they prevent lifespan extension by axenic conditions? Both statements are valid, and the authors need to be consistent in which one they use to avoid confusing the reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We read these statements differently. The only experiment in which a genetic intervention prevented lifespan extension by axenic conditions is neuronal <italic>TkR86C</italic> knockdown (Figure 6B-C). Otherwise, microbiota shortened lifespan relative to axenic conditions, and genetic knockdowns extend blocked this effect (e.g. see lines 131-133). We have ensured that the framing is consistent throughout, with text edited at lines 198-199, 298-299, 311-312, 345-347, 407-408, 424-425, 450, 497-503.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>TkRNAi consistently reduces lipid levels in axenic flies (Figs 2E, 3D), essentially phenocopying the loss of lipid stores seen in control conventionally reared (CR) flies relative to control axenic. This suggests that the previously reported role of Tk in lipid storage - demonstrated through increased lipid levels in TkRNAi flies (Song et al (2014) Cell Rep 9(1): 40) - is dependent on the microbiota. In the absence of the microbiota TkRNAi reduces lipid levels. The lack of acknowledgement of this in the text is confusing</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added text at lines 219-222 to address this point. We agree that this effect is hard to interpret biologically, since expressing RNAi in axenics has no additional effect on <italic>Tk</italic> expression (Figure S7). Consequently we can only interpret this unexpected effect as a possible off-target effect of RU feeding on TAG, specific to axenic flies. However, this possibility does not void our conclusion, because an off-target dimunition of TAG cannot explain why CR flies accumulate TAG following <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> induction. We hope that our added text clarifies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I have struggled to follow the authors logic in ablating the IPCs and feel a clear statement on what they expected the outcome to be would help the reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the requested statement at lines 423-424, explaining that we expected the IPC ablation to render flies constitutively long-lived and non-responsive to <italic>A pomorum</italic>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Can the authors clarify their logic in concluding a role for insulin signalling, and qualify this conclusion with appropriate consideration of alternative hypotheses?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added our logic at lines 449-454. In brief, we conclude involvement for insulin signalling because FoxO mutant lifespan does not respond to <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic><italic>,</italic> and diminishes the lifespan-shortening effect of <italic>A. pomorum</italic>. However, we cannot state that the effects are direct because we do not have data that mechanistically connects Tk/TkR99D signalling directly in insulin-producing cells. The current evidence is most consistent with insulin signalling priming responses to microbiota/Tk/TkR99D, as per the newly-added text.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer sincerely for their keen eye, which has highlighted an error in the previous version of the figure. In revisiting this figure we have noticed, to our dismay, that the figures for GFP quantification were actually re-plots of the figures for (ac)K quantification.

We have revised the figure to remedy our error, and the statistics now match the boxplots and results text.</p>

<p>I'd encourage the authors to provide lifespan plots that enable comparison between all conditions</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have avoided this approach because the number of survival curves that would need to be presented on the same axis (e.g. 16 for Figure 5) is not legible. However we have ensured that axes on faceted plots are equivalent and with grid lines for comparison. Moreover, our approach using statistical coefficients (EMMs) enables direct quantitative comparison of the differences among conditions.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>Is it possible that this driver is simply not resulting in an efficient KD of the receptor? I would be inclined to check this</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This comment relates to Figure 7G. We do see an effect of the knockdown in this experiment, so we believe that the knockdown is effective. However the direction of response is not consistent with our hypothesis so the experiment is not informative about the role of these cells. We therefore feel there is little to be gained by testing efficacy of knockdown, which would also be technically challenging because the cells are a small population in a larger tissue which expresses the same transcripts elsewhere (i.e. necessitating FISH).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Would it be possible to use antibodies for acetylated histones?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The comment relates to Figure 4C-E. The proposed studies would be a significant amount of work because, to our knowledge, the specific histone marks which drive activation in TK+ cells remain unknown. On the other hand, we do not see how this information would enrich the present story, rather such experiments would appear to be the beginning of something new. We therefore agree with Reviewer #1 (in cross-commenting) that this additional work is not justified.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>Tk+ EEC activity should be assessed directly, rather than relying solely on transcript levels. Approaches such as CaLexA or GCaMP could be used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with reviewers 1-2 (in cross-commenting) that this proposal is non-trivial and not justified by the additional insight that would be gained. As described above, we are attempting to immunostain Tk, which if successful will provide a third line of evidence for regulation of Tk+ cells. However we note that we already have the strongest possible evidence for a role of these cells via genetic analysis (Figure 5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While the difficulty of maintaining lifelong axenic conditions is understandable, it may still be feasible to assess the induction of Tk (ie. Tk transcription or EE activity upregulation) by the microbiome on males.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer recognises, maintaining axenic experiments for months on end is not trivial. Given the tendency for males either to simply mirror female responses to lifespan-extending interventions, or to not respond at all, we made the decision in our work to only study females. We have instead emphasised in the manuscript that results are from female flies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>TkR86C, in addition to TkR99D, may be involved in the A. pomorum-lifespan interaction. Consider revising the title to refer more generally to the &quot;tachykinin receptor&quot; rather than only TkR99D.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We disagree with this interpretation: the results do not show that <italic>TkR86C-RNAi</italic> recapitulates the effect of enteric <italic>Tk-RNAi</italic>. A potentially interesting interaction is apparent, but the data do not support a causal role for <italic>TkR86C</italic>. A causal role is supported only for <italic>TkR99D,</italic> knockdown of which recapitulates the longevity of axenic flies and <italic>Tk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies_._ Therefore we feel that our current title is therefore justified by the data, and a more generic version would misrepresent our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The difference between &quot;aging&quot; and &quot;lifespan&quot; should also be addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The smurf phenotype is a well-established metric of healthspan. Moreover, lifespan is the leading aggregate measure of ageing. We therefore feel that the use of “ageing” in the title is appropriate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If feasible, assessing foxo activation would add mechanistic depth. This could be done by monitoring foxo nuclear localization or measuring the expression levels of downstream target genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Foxo nuclear localisation has already been shown in axenic flies (Shin et al, 2011). We have added text and citation at lines 401-402.</p>
