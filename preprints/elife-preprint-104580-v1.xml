<title>Abstract</title><p>The qualities of antibody (Ab) responses provided by B lymphocytes and their plasma cell (PC) descendants are crucial facets of responses to vaccines and microbes. Metabolic processes and products regulate aspects of B cell proliferation and differentiation into germinal center (GC) and PC states as well as Ab diversification. However, there is little information about lymphoid cell-intrinsic functions of enzymes that mediate ether lipid biosynthesis, including a major class of membrane phospholipids. Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) results had indicated that concentrations of a number of these phospholipids were substantially enhanced in GC compared to the background average in spleens. However, it was not clear if biosynthesis in B cells was a basis for this finding, or whether such cell-intrinsic biosynthesis contributes to B cell physiology or Ab responses. Ether lipid biosynthesis can involve the enzyme PexRAP, the product of the <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> gene. Using combinations of IMS and immunization experiments in mouse models with inducible <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> loss-of-function, we now show that B lineage-intrinsic expression of PexRAP promotes the magnitude and affinity maturation of a serological response. Moreover, the data revealed a <italic>Dhrs7b</italic>-dependent increase in ether phospholipids in primary follicles with a more prominent increase in GC. Mechanistically, PexRAP impacted B cell proliferation via enhanced survival associated with controlling levels of ROS and membrane peroxidation. These findings reveal a vital role of this peroxisomal enzyme in B cell homeostasis and the physiology of humoral immunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The qualities and concentrations of antigen (Ag)-specific antibodies (Ab) are key elements of immunity and the pathophysiology of diverse conditions involving inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Ab are secreted by cells in the B lymphocyte lineage, but the exact sources are diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Many derive from a subset termed B1 B cells, which are thought to having characteristics of innate responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), but progeny of follicular and marginal zone B cells (FoB and MZB, respectively) can differentiate into Ab-secreting plasma cells (PC) after activation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In addition to Ab concentrations and affinity for Ag, the efficacy of pathogen clearance can depend on the isotype to which B lymphocytes may transfer the Ag-combining variable region from an IgM heavy chain constant region to a new immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Importantly, the affinities of serum Ab for target Ag can increase over time after an immune exposure, especially after recurrent encounter(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>Many sources and forms of Ab can be protective, though in several autoimmune diseases these molecules and the somatic mutations that diversify an initial BCR repertoire drive pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). A micro-anatomic structure termed the secondary follicle or germinal center (GC) provides one mechanism to increase spectrum of Ab affinities over time and repeated Ag exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Although diversification can, like PC production, occur independent from GC, results with different forms of vaccination support the practical importance of T cell help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) and of this micro-anatomic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Current evidence holds that most Ig class-switching is executed before GC entry of proliferating B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). GC reactions are initiated after B cells in a primary lymphoid follicle encounter Ag, migrate to interact with activated helper T cells after extensive proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). GC formation, size, and function depend on factors that include both the efficiency of population growth for B cells in a phase before they enter and take on characteristics of GC B cells, and on homeostatic and differentiative processes while in the secondary follicle [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>)]. Proliferation and selection end in development as Ab-secreting plasma cells or memory B cells [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>)]. In line with a selection process, substantial rates of B cell death have been measured in GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), so that determinants of survival efficiency affect their outputs. As such, the qualities and quantities of Ab elicited by immunization (or vaccination) depend on B cell proliferation and survival both prior to GC entry as well as during GC reactions.</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence indicates that metabolic reprogramming and intermediary metabolism play pivotal roles in survival, proliferation, differentiation and function in the pre-immune populations that provide immune protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), including B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Among core metabolic processes, several converge on oxidative metabolism fed by glycolytic generation of pyruvate, anaplerotic use of amino acids such as glutamine, and fatty acid oxidation [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>)]. Compared to resting populations such as naive B cells, rates of such metabolism in B cells appear to be increased after activation, including in GC B cells [31-36; reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)] although in one case at a rate that may be less heightened in this specialized subset than after T-independent B cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Such increases support the generation of substrates for anabolic processes in the dividing cell population and perhaps the energy demands thereof.</p>
<p>Mitochondria have been the focus of investigations exploring molecular mechanisms for oxidative metabolism to generate energy and substrates in lymphocytes during immune responses [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>)]. Oxidative phosphorylation in and dynamics of this organelle appear to be important in determining rates of somatic hypermutation that characterize GC B cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), albeit by a molecular mechanism that has not yet been identified. Use of the Krebs TCA cycle to feed an electron transport chain (ETC) and efficient conversion of ADP to ATP as a high-energy phosphate donor is among specialized functions of this highly dynamic subcellular organelle. Along with other sources, mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the ETC at a rate determined by structural and biochemical features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Rates of ROS production, release, and resolution require regulation at multiple levels because these labile species and their reactions with cellular molecules are important for both signaling and cell proliferation but undermine cell function or survival when excessive.</p>
<p>B cells in most GC exhibit inadequacy of oxygen delivery relative to demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Of note, genome-wide screening for genes that help cells adapt to hypoxia revealed a requirement for peroxisomes and an ER enzyme involved in synthesizing plasmalogen ether lipids (EL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Using an unbiased lipidomic analysis that combined imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) and techniques for identifying GC in sections of spleen from immunized mice, we had found that after immunization, local concentrations of a subset of EL were heightened in GC relative to other portions of the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Ether phospholipids (EPL) have a fatty acid linked to the glycerol backbone with an alkyl or a vinyl ether bond at the sn-1 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Synthesis of ether phospholipids depends on the generation of precursors in peroxisomes and final processing in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). However, EL biosynthesis is prominent in the liver, and in theory these species or their precursors might distribute to tissues from a primary site of biosynthesis or from the diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Thus, the finding that secondary follicles had greater densities of some - but not all - ether phospholipids left several key questions unanswered – (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) Does the capacity to synthesize and increase ether lipids in B cell follicles – primary or secondary (i.e., GC) - affect antibody responses? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) Are any of the EL dependent on B lineage-intrinsic metabolism to generate precursors or final products? Moreover, there is debate whether EL or their plasmalogen subset promote cell death or resistance, and whether inactivation of biosynthesis causes defects in establishment or maintenance of hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>).</p>
<p>Peroxisomal Reductase Activating PPARγ (PexRAP, encoded by the <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> gene) catalyzes the reduction of alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) to 1-alkyl-G3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), which then is transferred into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and further metabolized to generate EL. Recent work notes that this enzyme may substantially function in the ER in addition to the peroxisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Widespread inactivation of <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> in mature mice decreased hepatic production of ether lipid species and reduced the population of erythrocytes and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Although questioned based on inborn errors of metabolism affecting other aspects of ether lipid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), this body of work indicated that PexRAP can be essential in some aspects of ether lipid metabolism and may function in hematopoietic cells. Diverse functions of ether lipids in general, and the plasmalogen subset in particular, have been proposed or supported by prior work [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>)]. The ether linkage may provide a sink for oxygen radicals - thereby acting directly to resolve the reactivity and contribute to ROS homeostasis, although there is debate as to the physiological impact of this chemical property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Whether or not this lipid subset influences adaptive immunity or conventional lymphocyte lineages, however, is unclear.</p>
<p>Herein, we tested the hypotheses that (i) the ether lipid profiles in activated B cells depend on their expression of the biosynthetic enzyme PexRAP [alternatively referred to as acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase (ADHAPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>)], and (ii) this enzyme promotes B cell physiology. To do so, we combined conventional lipidomics, Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS), and immunization experiments with genetic models in which loss-of-function for <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> is induced in adult mice. We provide evidence that PexRAP impacts B cell proliferation via enhanced survival associated with controlling levels of ROS and membrane peroxidation. The results also indicate that beyond an impact on B cell homeostasis, GC are reduced in its absence, and the magnitude and affinity maturation of a serological response depend on B cell expression of PexRAP. Taken together, these finding support a function of B cell-intrinsic biosynthesis of ether lipids in B lymphocyte homeostasis, the production of Ab, and in promoting GC reactions.</p>

<title>PexRAP promotes homeostatic maintenance and proliferation of B cells</title>
<p>By use of IMS, we had reported that at least a dozen ether phospholipids - including plasmalogens - were enriched in splenic germinal centers of immunized mice when compared to the rest of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>).</p>
<p>While previous work provided evidence that these lipid molecules were important for the homeostasis of short-lived neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), this effect was questioned based on inborn errors of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Moreover, the impact of these molecules on adaptive immune cells or functions is not known. Accordingly, we sought to test for effects of an intervention that interferes with a key biosynthetic pathway used for endogenous synthesis of these molecules. To do so, we started with analyses using induced loss-of-function for <italic>Dhrs7b<sup>f/f</sup></italic> and the widely expressed <italic>Rosa26-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>) used in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), which reduced hepatic generation of a subset of ether lipids and acts in all hematopoietic cells as well.</p>
<p>We modeled initial experiments on the published work with imaging mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Mice were treated with tamoxifen using conditions less intense than a regimen shown to have no effect on pre-immune splenic populations or B lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>), immunized with SRBC [akin to the analyses in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>)], and analyzed 7 d after immunization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Functional inactivation of <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> in T and B lymphocytes was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-PexRAP Ab (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The frequencies and numbers of CD19<sup>+</sup> B220<sup>+</sup> B cells in <italic>Dhrs7b<sup>f/f</sup></italic>; <italic>Rosa26-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> - only a small minority of which would have been activated by the immunization - were approximately 0.6 the values for controls (<italic>Dhrs7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> <italic>Rosa26-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>, i.e., wild-type locus) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). In contrast to B cell populations, TCRβ<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and TCRβ<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>-</sup> CD8 T cells were intact in tamoxifen-treated and SRBC-immunized <italic>Dhrs7b<sup>f/f</sup></italic>; <italic>Rosa26-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mice (Supplemental Fig. 1A-C). These results suggest that <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> is non-redundantly required for fully functional B cell maintenance but indicate that the enzyme is dispensable for the main populations of conventional T cells. In light of the earlier finding that a subset of ether lipids was more prevalent in secondary follicles, we analyzed GC in these samples. Microscopy and flow cytometry analyses after immunofluorescent staining found that less GC B cells were present after immunization of <italic>Dhrs7b<sup>f/f</sup></italic>; <italic>Rosa26-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mice, i.e., less IgD<sup>-</sup> CD95<sup>+</sup> GL7<sup>+</sup> (GC-phenotype) B cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-I</xref>; Supplemental Fig. 1D). Quantitation of the immune fluorescence micrography with spleens from immunized mice revealed that the numbers of GC per spleen were halved in <italic>Dhrs7b</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice compared with controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>; Supplemental Fig. 1E). The sizes of those GC that did form were substantially reduced as well (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>; Supplemental Fig. 1F). The lower number of B cells found in immunized mice - while a less profound effect than the reduction in GC - tempers the result, and it was possible that the function of helper CD4 T cells was impaired even their though numbers were not affected. While not addressing whether or not B cells are part of the requirement for PexRAP in promoting GC, these results indicate that <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> is necessary for a normal-sized geminal center response.</p>

Western blot analyses showed an almost complete absence of PexRAP protein from B cells purified from tamoxifen-treated <italic>Dhrs7b<sup>f/f</sup></italic>; <italic>huCD20-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>(hereinafter, <italic>Dhrs7b</italic><sup>Δ/Δ<italic>-</italic>B</sup>) mice compared to similarly treated <italic>huCD20-</italic>CreER<sup>T2</sup> controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The enzyme encoded by this gene catalyzes the synthesis of a lipid precursor to many - but not all - plasmalogens and other ether phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), and <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> deficiency impacted neutrophil survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). When we tested if <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> inactivation affected the steady-state B cell population, the frequencies and total numbers of CD19<sup>+</sup> B220<sup>+</sup> B cells in viable lymphocyte gates were about 20% lower in tamoxifen-treated <italic>Dhrs7b</italic><sup>Δ/Δ<italic>-</italic>B</sup> mice compared to tamoxifen-injected, <italic>huCD20</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup>, <italic>Dhrs7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). With loss-of-function after production of mature B cells, i.e., inactivation of <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> at ages over 6 wk, we observed balanced decreases in the numbers of multiple subsets within the B lineage without evidence of selectivity among main sub-classes of B cell (Supplemental Fig 1G-I). Thus, the frequencies of MZB and FOB amidst the smaller population of splenic B cells in tamoxifen-treated <italic>Dhrs7b<sup>f/f</sup></italic>; <italic>huCD20-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mice were similar (Supplemental Fig 1H), and frequencies of B1 B cells in the peritoneal cavity also were unaffected (Supplemental Fig 1I). Prior work documents normal frequencies and numbers of developing and mature B cells under harsher conditions of tamoxifen-induced deletion with CreER<sup>T2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). De novo B cell production rates are too low to yield the ∼20% decrease observed one week after gene disruption, and few splenic B cells are in cell cycle.

<title>B cell expression of PexRAP is required for achieving normally distributed concentrations of ether phospholipids</title>
<p>As noted, lipidomic analyses that used 2-dimensional image mass-spectrometry (2D-IMS) discovered that local concentrations of a subset of ether lipids are enriched in GC compared with the area outside of GC after immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). To measure the extent to which PexRAP expression within mature B cells can affect their lipid content and composition, including their ether- and plasmalogen phospholipids, LC-MS-MS analyses were performed with B cells directly isolated from spleens as well as those cultured after mitogenic activation. These analyses showed substantial reductions in many ether phospholipids - as well as lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPE) generated by phospholipase cleavage of the R2 fatty acid sidechain of an ether phospholipid - in PexRAP-deficient B cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>; Supplemental Fig. 2A, B). While beyond the scope of this work, this evidence suggests that generation of potential signaling molecules via phospholipase(s) such as PLA2 may be reduced. Of note, whereas differences were modest or absent in the naive population, the greatest impact of PexRAP on quantitative amounts of phospholipids was found in the activated B cells, for which tamoxifen treatment and CreERT2 made minimal differences (Supplemental Fig. 2C, D). Several species, skewed towards those with the most detected ions, were at less than 1/5th the level of non-deleted control B cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D</xref>). There is no in vitro surrogate that faithfully represents GC or the GC B cell, but collectively these data provide strong evidence that the capacity to rapidly produce increased levels of many ether lipid molecules after lymphocyte activation depends on a functional <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> gene in B cells. Although additional uptake or biosynthesis pathways may add to the overall pool, as previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) - and especially in resting B cells that are out of cycle - the data indicate that <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> in B cells enhances cell-autonomous biosynthesis. The straightforward inference is that PexRAP catalyzes the generation of ether lipid precursors in amounts crucial for regulating the overall ether phospholipid pools, especially after B cell activation.</p>

<p>Our earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) reported only ion mode features in negative mode and did not analyze the primary follicle (the vast majority of which are resting B cells) relative to the extrafollicular white pulp, red pulp, and GC. To investigate these issues and ultimately the requirement for specific expression of PexRAP, we started with AID-GFP mice to enhance spatial localization. These measurements confirmed that a substantial number of both positive and negatively charged ions whose exact masses identified them as plasmalogens were substantially concentrated in GC as compared to the rest of the B cell follicle (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Supplemental Fig. 3A, B). Accordingly, we tested if the differential enrichment of any ether lipid species in primary or secondary follicles depends on biosynthesis within a specific lymphoid lineage. Mice with conditional mutations were tamoxifen-treated, immunized with SRBC, harvested seven days thereafter, and analyzed by IMS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>).

<p>Collectively, these results indicate that <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> gene expression in activated B cells regulates the spectrum of ether lipids in the micro-anatomic locale of a secondary follicle. Interestingly, immunization also led to modest increases in the levels of some ether and conventional phospholipids in the B cell-rich primary follicle regions (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This finding extends the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), which focused on the relationship between the AID-GFP<sup>hi</sup> region (i.e., GC) and lipid features. Moreover, the absence of PexRAP blunted most of the immunization-induced increases observed in the primary follicles. These findings and those of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> suggest that there are secondary consequences of <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> inactivation (e.g., some di-acyl phospholipids are affected), but provide direct evidence that the enhancement of many ether phospholipid signals in the GC depends on PexRAP in B cells.</p>

<p>As key components of adaptive immunity, progeny of an activated B cell can differentiate into Ab-secreting plasma cells (PC) or into GC B cells - whose physiology diversifies the affinity for and breadth of antigen recognized by the original clone and improves properties of memory [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). PC that develop after a second encounter with antigen yield affinity maturation, and the higher quality and proper quantity of Ag-specific Abs from plasma cells are integral to humoral immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). An increasing body of evidence indicates that metabolic reprogramming and intermediary metabolites modulate immune cell differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>).

<p>Consistent with <italic>in vivo</italic> results finding reduced Ag-specific ASCs in <italic>Dhrs7b</italic><sup>Δ/Δ-B</sup> mice compared with controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), the attenuated population of PexRAP-deficient B lineage cells recovered after transfer into recipient mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) yielded lower frequencies of CD138<sup>+</sup> progeny (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H, I</xref>) along with evidence of reduced activation [i.e., lower frequencies of IgD<sup>-</sup> progeny (Supplemental Fig. 1I). Mitogen-stimulated <italic>Dhrs7b</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> B cells also yielded lower frequencies of CD138<sup>+</sup> cells in vitro, but the division-specific frequencies of CD138<sup>+</sup> cells showed only modest decreases in <italic>Dhrs7b</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> B cells (Supplemental Fig. 4E). Thus, the reduction of CD138<sup>+</sup> cell differentiation appears to be due mostly to its dependence on survival to a sufficient division count.</p>
<p><italic>Dhrs7b</italic> inactivation was initiated prior to immunization in the preceding experiments. Therefore, the impact of PexRAP deficiency on GC and the Ab response in such a setting might be due exclusively to impairment of B cells, e.g., their reduced population expansion, prior to their entry into GC. Alternatively, the effects could also in part involve a requirement for PexRAP-dependent metabolites within GC B cells. To test if <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> functions within GC, we used conditional deletion of <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> driven by the <italic>S1pr2-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> transgene whose expression at high levels marks GC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). Of note, experiments with a fate-marking reporter allele showed that activated B cells that lack the GC B phenotype were not marked by this conditional Cre after immunization with the NP-carrier approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). <italic>Dhrs7b<sup>f/f</sup></italic>; <italic>S1pr2-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>and control <italic>S1pr2-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> (control) mice were immunized with SRBC, and tamoxifen was injected at a time point after the initiation of GC to assure more fully that the inactivation of <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> would be in GC B cells rather than pre-GC blasts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Frequencies of GC B cells were substantially lower in tamoxifen-treated <italic>Dhrs7b<sup>f/f</sup></italic>; <italic>S1pr2-</italic>CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, C), whereas the overall populations of CD138<sup>+</sup> cells, and CD19<sup>+</sup> B220<sup>+</sup> plasmablasts (PBs) among them - almost all of which would have developed prior to the induced loss-of-function - were normal (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, E). These data provide evidence that <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> expression within GC B cells influences them during an Ab response. Collectively, these data indicate that an optimal GC response requires PexRAP function in B cells, and the B cell-intrinsic functions of <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> promote the quantity and affinity maturation of Ab responses, in part via net proliferation of B cells.</p>

<title><italic>Dhrs7b</italic> contributes to modulation of ROS and their impact on B cell population growth</title>
<p>Increased susceptibility to cell death after activation would be a mechanism that could cause the reduced population expansion, GC, and Ab production. Consistent with earlier analyses of LPS-stimulated B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>), we had noted that ROS levels were higher in GC B cells, memory B cells (MBCs) and ASCs than in the naive B2 B cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). ROS can be produced in activated B cells via diverse sources that include mitochondrial electron transport chain function, NADPH oxidase activated by BCR engagement, and fatty acid oxidation in peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). ROS can positively mediate signal transduction, but their steady-state concentrations need to be calibrated because overproduction can have deleterious effect on cells, for instance via lipid peroxidation at excessive rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>). Endogenous antioxidant properties have been imputed to plasmalogens because the vinyl ether bond is susceptible to reaction with reactive oxygen, thereby scavenging ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). When we tested if <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> function is critical for redox control in B cells, mitogen-stimulated <italic>Dhrs7b</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> B cells exhibited ∼3 fold higher signal and about a doubling when stained with fluorescent sensors of cellular and mitochondrial ROS, respectively, compared to WT B cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A-D</xref>). Iron- and copper-dependent lipid peroxidation is considered to be a biological mechanism for ROS-mediated cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>). Lipid peroxidation measured by a fluorescent indicator (C11-Bodipy) in vitro was enhanced in mitogen-activated <italic>Dhrs7b</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> B cells compared with WT controls (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). One independent means of driving increased ROS and lipid peroxidation in B cells (supplemental Fig. S5A) rapidly led to reduced cell viability and B cell numbers (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). Furthermore, in vitro analyses indicated that B cells lacking PexRAP also exhibited increases in the activated executioner caspase, cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) along with early apoptotic cells that are annexin V<sup>+</sup> but exclude 7-aminoactinomycin D (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G, H</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> function supports not only protection against cell death, but also control of cellular and mitochondrial ROS levels and their impact on lipid modification. Of note, while H2O2 did not increase this early apoptotic population (Supplemental Fig. SC), increasing ROS with menadione drove B cell death preceded by annexin V<sup>+</sup> state without an increase in C11-Bodipy signal (Supplemental Fig. S5D-G). We infer that rather than a single mode of death, increased ROS resulting from PexRAP depletion stimulates at least two distinct modes of B cell death.</p>

<p>We exploited the sub-maximal rescue by a lower concentration of NAC (1 mM) to explore if peroxisomal oxidative metabolism might contribute to the toxicity observed when B cells are PexRAP-depleted. Although thioridazine on its own provided no increase in the B cell population growth, its combination with 1 mM NAC treatment improved growth of the <italic>Dhrs7b</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> B cell population compared to either agent on its own (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8J</xref>).

<title><italic>Dhrs7b</italic> in B cells affects their oxidative metabolism and ER mass</title>
<p>Our finding that mitochondrial ROS were increased prompted us to investigate how PexRAP affects physiological functions by measuring respiration in activated B cells. Mitochondrial stress tests with in vitro activated B lymphoblasts measured small but definite decreases in both basal and maximal respiration (oxygen consumption rates, or OCR) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A-C</xref>). The altered performance of mitochondria was associated with reductions in calculated ATP generation and proton leak as well as a small decrease in spare respiratory capacity (SRC) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D-F</xref>, respectively). In contrast, the rates of glucose-stimulated extracellular acidification - cytosolic reactions and a surrogate that can approximate glycolytic activity - were unaffected (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9G</xref>).</p>

<p>Thus, the altered respiration did not reflect a decrease in all cell metabolism. Inasmuch as peroxisomes and mitochondria form contacts and functionally interact with the ER, we measured relative ER mass and found that the signal of the fluorophore ERTracker was consistently reduced in PexRAP-depleted B cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9H, I</xref>). We infer that both mitochondrial function and ER mass in B cells are promoted by their expression of PexRAP.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have shown herein that B lymphocyte expression of an enzyme essential for biosynthesis of a subset of ether phospholipids is crucial for part of the increases in their levels localized to GC. Moreover, the genetic approach used to deplete B cells of PexRAP allowed us to show that the B cell type-restricted gene, <italic>Dhrs7b</italic>, promotes B cell survival, proliferation, and GC size along with affinity maturation and serum concentrations of Ag-specific Ab after immunization. Taken together, this work establishes the predictive value of the discovery approach that identified an unexpected feature of cellular biochemistry in GC and indicates that B cell-autonomous generation of ether lipid species is crucial for B cell survival and the qualities of the Ab elicited by immunization.</p>
<p>Using imaging mass spectrometry for discovery-based hypothesis generation, we had reported that the concentrations of at least a dozen ether phospholipids are increased in splenic GC relative to the remainder of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). The analyses presented here confirm and extend the observations, and provide evidence that after immunization, these concentrations increase even in the primary B cell follicle, albeit to a modest degree when compared to the magnitude of increases in GC, and in B cells activated ex vivo. The cell type-specific gene inactivation after establishment of a pre-immune population establishes that an enzyme crucial for generation of a number of plasmalogens has substantial effects on B lymphocyte physiology and function.</p>
<p>Plasmalogens and other ether lipids and phospholipids have long been shown to be major constituents of lipid bilayers and cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). However, remarkably little is known about whether or not cell-intrinsic synthesis of ether lipids or the balance among their specific molecular species matters for hematopoietic cells or in immunity. Several inborn errors of metabolism in humans are attributable to loss-of-function mutations of genes encoding peroxisomal proteins that impact ether lipid (and hence plasmalogen) synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) but affect other critical processes as well [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>)]. Several of these - such as Zellweger Syndrome and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) - and the mouse models generated to study mechanisms in these human disease, lead to severe neurological defects and early post-partum death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Whether or not lymphocyte development, homeostasis or function were affected in these studies is not clear. Deficient generation of ether lipids is among many abnormalities caused by elimination of fatty acid synthase (FAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Acute inactivation of <italic>Fasn</italic>, the gene encoding this enzyme, in young mature mice caused a decrease in spleen size disproportionate to the reduction in neutrophils, which was the most profound hematological consequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). In addition, circulating lymphocytes were reduced despite normal steady-state representation in the marrow. In-trans cell-extrinsic functions of ether lipids have been noted previously - specifically, as ligands for the invariant natural killer T cell receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>) or for a G-protein coupled receptor on natural killer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). As such, the widespread loss of FAS function and the potential for indirect and pleiotropic effects of this enzyme deficiency left unresolved what cells actually depend on their own synthesis of ether lipids.</p>
<p>PexRAP, the enzyme encoded by the <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> gene, generates intermediates vital for the synthesis of some - but not all - ether lipids in cells such as neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Analyses of neutrophil numbers and survival provided evidence that this enzyme can be crucial for a normal membrane composition. Moreover, PexRAP promoted viability of this very short-lived cell type whose membranes have a high plasmalogen content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). The bloodborne population of lymphocytes was reduced in the <italic>Rosa</italic>26-CreER<sup>T2</sup>, <italic>Dhrs7b</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), but the specific types of lymphoid cell were not reported and the circulating cell number does not necessarily correlate with that in spleen or other organs. Of note, although subject to points articulated in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), the interpretation that the neutrophil phenotype is due to insufficiency of ether lipids or plasmalogens has been questioned based on alternative gene disruption results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Several models of unconditional gene inactivation or mutation that drastically reduced the phospholipid end-products were noted to have normal neutrophils [summarized in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), albeit at older ages (4 - 7 mo) than those used in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). As noted, however, there may be age-related changes in the processes analyzed herein using young (age ∼ 2 mo) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Moreover, cellular and organismal selection for adaptation variants makes the results of acute loss-of-function inherently different from unconditional loss and heterozygote parentage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). The potential for toxicity induced by 4OHT activation of CreER<sup>T2</sup> was among concerns mooted about the earlier study of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). This concern may have been extrapolated from papers that noted impairment in earlier hematopoiesis when <italic>Rosa26</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup> was combined with intensive regimens of tamoxifen administration to infant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). Of note, such studies used individual doses over 4-fold higher that those used herein, and delivered by gavage five times on a daily basis, yet the IgM<sup>+</sup> B cell population sizes in spleen and marrow were normal even in the face of reduced erythropoiesis and thymopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Moreover, the analyses herein compared B lineage-specific deletion to CreER<sup>T2+/-</sup>, <italic>Dhrs7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice identically dosed in parallel with the test subjects. Thus, the work herein indicates that PexRAP is essential for normal physiology and function of mature B lymphocytes, in particular after their activation.</p>
<p>The findings are most consistent with a capacity for PexRAP function to contribute towards B lymphocyte survival and effective proliferation by restraining both executioner caspase activation and lipid peroxidation due to excessive ROS levels. These findings are consistent with those obtained with neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). On the surface such results might appear to present a conundrum relative to work indicating that both fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 and the enzyme that later generates an alkenyl bond at a terminal step in plasmalogen biosynthesis are crucial for the susceptibility of HT-1080 and 786-O tumor cell lines to ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). However, our data are consistent with published evidence that PexRAP is needed for a narrower subset of ether lipids than the broad requirement for FAS or fatty acyl-CoA reductases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>). Moreover, molecular dissection of mechanisms in various non-hematopoietic cell types (including the cancer line 786-O) showed that ether lipid biosynthesis can either promote susceptibility or resistance to ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>). Collectively, our findings suggest that for B cells the inactivation of PexRAP tilts the balance toward death and reduced Ab - perhaps involving lower fractions of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>), or a lower ratio of plasmalogens (alkenyl linkages) relative to alkyl-linked ether lipids.</p>
<p>PexRAP localizes to peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), and prior work has suggested both that peroxisomes are increased in GC B cells and likely contribute to FAO by these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). In line with the possibility that this organelle may affect PexRAP-dependent survival, our data indicated that specific inhibition of peroxisomal FAO could collaborate with sub-optimal ROS scavenging to mitigate the reduced growth of activated B cells. However, recent findings show that PexRAP also is expressed in the ER and is capable of contributing to ether lipid biosynthesis via catalysis in this organelle in addition to or instead of the peroxisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Thus, although ROS generated in peroxisomes likely contribute to the stress experienced by PexRAP-deficient B cells, the phenotypes observed herein may not reflect the need for the peroxisomal fraction of the enzyme.</p>
<p>Our findings with an intermediary in ether lipid biosynthesis add to an increasing body of evidence that metabolism in B lymphocytes affects their differentiation or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Many sources and forms of Ab can be protective, while in several autoimmune diseases these molecules can drive pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The capacity to generate increased affinities and circulating concentrations of Ab is an important factor both in protective immunity and auto-immune disease. Antigen-independent, TLR-driven PC differentiation requires increased oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>), while oxidative metabolism in GC B cells promotes affinity maturation by unknown mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). While not the exclusive determinant of such properties, GC are major sources of higher affinity Ab with a broader spectrum of specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). GC formation, size, and function depend on the efficiency of population growth for B cells in a phase before they enter and take on characteristics of GC B cells, and then homeostatic and differentiative processes while in the secondary follicle. Thus, while the findings with the post-immunization inactivation of <italic>Dhrs7b</italic> using <italic>S1pr2</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup> provide evidence that the expression of PexRAP is important within GC B cells, the decreases of GC and affinity-matured Ab are likely also to involve a pre-GC phase of clonal expansion. In any case, the rapidity of the effects suggests that pharmacological inhibition of PexRAP may be a target in inflammatory disease in which B cells participate, particularly in light of the potential for impacts on pro-inflammatory neutrophils.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry - general and measurements of ROS, lipids peroxidation, and ER</title>
<p>GC B cells were identified as GL7<sup>+</sup> CD95<sup>+</sup> events in the viable B220<sup>+</sup> dump<sup>-</sup> gate (dump channel consisting of one fluorophore for CD11b, CD11c, F4/80, Gr1, TCRβ, and 7AAD), while plasmablasts were defined as B220<sup>+</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> TACI<sup>+</sup> dump<sup>-</sup> cells. For flow analyses of total intracellular ROS and mitochondrial superoxide, B cells (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells) were washed with PBS and stained with 1.25 µM CM-H2DCFDA or 5 µM MitoSOX<sup>TM</sup> Red in PBS (20 min at 37°C), respectively, then washed with 1% BSA containing PBS, and further stained with anti-B220, anti-CD19, anti-CD138, and Ghost-BV510. To measure the lipid peroxidation, cultured B cells (1 × 10<sup>6</sup>) were washed with PBS and stained with 1.25 µM C11-BODIPY<sup>TM</sup> in PBS (20 min at 37°C), and washed with 1% BSA containing PBS followed by surface staining as above. To analyze the level of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), B cells (1 × 10<sup>6</sup>) were stained with 0.5 µM ER-Tracker<sup>TM</sup> Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution with calcium and magnesium (HBSS/Ca/Mg; Gibco) for 30 min at 37°C.</p>
<p>For measurements of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>), cultured B cells (1 x 10<sup>6</sup>) were washed twice with PBS, once with Annexin V binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2), and then incubated (15 min at 20 C in the dark) with Annexin V-rPE, 7AAD, APC-conjugated CD138, APC-Cy7-conjugated B220, e450-CD19.

<title>Immunohistochemistry, MALDI-IMS, and IMS data analysis</title>
<p>Mice were immunized with SRBC and spleens were harvested at 1 week after immunization. Spleens were snap frozen on dry ice, and mounted to a cryostat chuck with a minimal amount of OCT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Frozen spleens were cut at 12 µm thickness using a Leica CM3050S (Leica, IL, USA) at -20 °C, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and blocked with M.O.M<sup>TM</sup> (Vector Lab) followed by incubation with GL7-FITC, anti-IgD-PE, and anti-CD35-biotin Ab followed by streptavidin-conjugated Alex647at 4 °C. After the tile scanning of spleen sections, GC size and numbers were quantified with FIJI Image J software.</p>
<p>For Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS), frozen spleens were cut as above, and mounting onto indium tin oxide (ITO) coated microscope slides (Delta Technologies ETC). Slides were then vacuum desiccated for at least 30 minutes before matrix application. Pre-IMS autofluorescence (AF) images were acquired prior to matrix application on a Zeiss Axio Scan Z1 Slide Scanner using the brightfield channel and the DAPI (ex. 340-380 nm; em. 435-485 nm, blue), EGFP (ex. 450-490 nm; em. 500-550 nm, green), DsRed (ex. 538-562 nm; em. 570-640 nm, red) filter cubes. After taking AF images, a custom in-house developed sublimation device was used to apply the matrices 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone (DHA) and 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (DAN) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to tissue sections for positive and negative ion mode analyses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). For immunized AID-GFP mice, the fluorescence emissions identified GC localization within the section used next for IMS. Alternatively, two serial sections of immunized mice spleens were used, one for 2D-IMS and the contiguous section for immunohistochemistry (IHC). Fluorescence data were registered with the 2D-IMS visualizations of phospholipids to align images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), allowing quantitation of the ion intensities in specific m/z peaks within defined micro-anatomic portions of the spleen (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). MALDI IMS data were acquired with a 10 µm pixel size (laser spot size 8 µm) in full scan mode using a Bruker trapped ion mobility time-of-flight (timsTOF) Flex mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics Billerica, MA, USA). Data were acquired with 250 shots per pixel and a mass range of <italic>m/z</italic> 200-2000. SCiLS (software Bruker Daltonics) was used to process the data, normalize ion intensity, visualize ion images, and merge the images.</p>

<title>LC-MS for lipidomics</title>
<p>To prepare samples, a one-phase method was used to extract lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>). Briefly, 0.5 mL of MeOH/MTBE/CHCl3 mix (1.3:1:1) was added to a frozen pellet of B-cells (1x10<sup>6</sup> cells total), spiked with 10 uL EquiSPLASH-lipidomics internal standard mix (Avanti Research), briefly vortexed and shaken gently for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 10°C. The supernatant was transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube, evaporated under a gentle stream of N2 gas, and resuspended in 100 uL methanol/CHCl3 (9:1) and 2uL were used for LC-HRMS (high-resolution MS) analysis. Each sample was injected two times - one injection in positive ESI mode followed by one in negative mode. Pooled QCs were injected to assess the performance of the LC and MS instruments at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of each sequence. Discovery lipidomics data were acquired using a Vanquish UHPLC (ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography) system interfaced to a Q Exactive HF quadrupole/orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>
<p>Chromatographic separation was performed with a reverse-phase Acquity BEH C18 column (1.7 mm, 2.1x150mm, Waters, Milford, MA) at a flow rate of 250 ul/min. Mobile phases were made up of 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid in (A) H2O/CH3CN (40:60) and in (B) CH3CN/ iPrOH (10:90). Gradient conditions were as follows: 0–1 min, B = 20 %; 1–8 min, B = 20– 100 %; 8–10 min, B = 100 %; 10–10.5 min, B = 100–20 %; 10.5–15 min, B = 20%. The total chromatographic run time was 15 min. Mass spectra were acquired over a precursor ion scan range of m/z 200 to 1,600 at a resolving power of 60,000 using the following HESI-II source parameters: spray voltage 4 kV (3 kV in negative mode); capillary temperature 250°C; S-lens RF level 60 V; N2 sheath gas 40; N2 auxiliary gas 10; auxiliary gas temperature 350°C. MS/MS spectra were acquired for the top-seven most abundant precursor ions with an MS/MS AGC target of 1e5, a maximum MS/MS injection time of 100 ms, and a normalized collision energy of 15, 30, 40. High resolution mass spectrometry data were processed with MS-DIAL version 4.70 in lipidomics mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>). MS1, and MS2 tolerances were set to 0.01 and 0.025 Da respectively. Minimum peak height was set to 30,000 to decrease the number of false positive hits. Peaks were aligned on a quality control (QC) reference file with RT tolerance of 0.1 min and mass tolerance of 0.015 Da. Default lipid library was used (Msp20210527163602_converted.lbm2), solvent type was set to HCOONH4 to match the solvent used for separation, and the identification score cut off was set to 80%. All lipid classes were made available for the search. After lipid identification was completed, MS-DIAL results were exported into Excel and cleaned using minimum RSD for QC samples set to 20% and minimum ratio of QC to Blank set to 10. For species identified in both PexRAP-depleted (<italic>Dhrs7b</italic> Δ/Δ) B cells and controls, mean levels (areas under peak curves) and their variance were analyzed in Excel.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Hoon Cho et al. presents a novel investigation into the role of PexRAP, an intermediary in ether lipid biosynthesis, in B cell function, particularly during the Germinal Center (GC) reaction. The authors profile lipid composition in activated B cells both in vitro and in vivo, revealing the significance of PexRAP. Using a combination of animal models and imaging mass spectrometry, they demonstrate that PexRAP is specifically required in B cells. They further establish that its activity is critical upon antigen encounter, shaping B cell survival during the GC reaction.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, they show that ether lipid synthesis is necessary to modulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and prevent membrane peroxidation.</p>
<p>Highlights of the Manuscript:</p>
<p>The authors perform exhaustive imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) analyses of B cells, including GC B cells, to explore ether lipid metabolism during the humoral response. This approach is particularly noteworthy given the challenge of limited cell availability in GC reactions, which often hampers metabolomic studies. IMS proves to be a valuable tool in overcoming this limitation, allowing detailed exploration of GC metabolism.</p>
<p>The data presented is highly relevant, especially in light of recent studies suggesting a pivotal role for lipid metabolism in GC B cells. While these studies primarily focus on mitochondrial function, this manuscript uniquely investigates peroxisomes, which are linked to mitochondria and contribute to fatty acid oxidation (FAO). By extending the study of lipid metabolism beyond mitochondria to include peroxisomes, the authors add a critical dimension to our understanding of B cell biology.</p>
<p>Additionally, the metabolic plasticity of B cells poses challenges for studying metabolism, as genetic deletions from the beginning of B cell development often result in compensatory adaptations. To address this, the authors employ an acute loss-of-function approach using two conditional, cell-type-specific gene inactivation mouse models: one targeting B cells after the establishment of a pre-immune B cell population (Dhrs7b^f/f, huCD20-CreERT2) and the other during the GC reaction (Dhrs7b^f/f; S1pr2-CreERT2). This strategy is elegant and well-suited to studying the role of metabolism in B cell activation.</p>
<p>Overall, this manuscript is a significant contribution to the field, providing robust evidence for the fundamental role of lipid metabolism during the GC reaction and unveiling a novel function for peroxisomes in B cells. However, several major points need to be addressed:</p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>Figures 1 and 2</p>
<p>The authors conclude, based on the results from these two figures, that PexRAP promotes the homeostatic maintenance and proliferation of B cells. In this section, the authors first use a tamoxifen-inducible full Dhrs7b knockout (KO) and afterwards Dhrs7bΔ/Δ-B model to specifically characterize the role of this molecule in B cells. They characterize the B and T cell compartments using flow cytometry (FACS) and examine the establishment of the GC reaction using FACS and immunofluorescence. They conclude that B cell numbers are reduced, and the GC reaction is defective upon stimulation, showing a reduction in the total percentage of GC cells, particularly in the light zone (LZ).</p>
<p>The analysis of the steady-state B cell compartment should also be improved. This includes a more detailed characterization of MZ and B1 populations, given the role of lipid metabolism and lipid peroxidation in these subtypes.</p>
<p>Suggestions for Improvement:</p>
<p>- B Cell compartment characterization: A deeper characterization of the B cell compartment in non-immunized mice is needed, including analysis of Marginal Zone (MZ) maturation and a more detailed examination of the B1 compartment. This is especially important given the role of specific lipid metabolism in these cell types. The phenotyping of the B cell compartment should also include an analysis of immunoglobulin levels on the membrane, considering the impact of lipids on membrane composition.</p>
<p>- GC Response Analysis Upon Immunization: The GC response characterization should include additional data on the T cell compartment, specifically the presence and function of Tfh cells. In Fig. 1H, the distribution of the LZ appears strikingly different. However, the authors have not addressed this in the text. A more thorough characterization of centroblasts and centrocytes using CXCR4 and CD86 markers is needed.</p>
<p>
The gating strategy used to characterize GC cells (GL7+CD95+ in IgD− cells) is suboptimal. A more robust analysis of GC cells should be performed in total B220+CD138− cells.</p>
<p>- The authors claim that Dhrs7b supports the homeostatic maintenance of quiescent B cells in vivo and promotes effective proliferation. This conclusion is primarily based on experiments where CTV-labeled PexRAP-deficient B cells were adoptively transferred into μMT mice (Fig. 2D-F). However, we recommend reviewing the flow plots of CTV in Fig. 2E, as they appear out of scale. More importantly, the low recovery of PexRAP-deficient B cells post-adoptive transfer weakens the robustness of the results and is insufficient to conclusively support the role of PexRAP in B cell proliferation in vivo.</p>
<p>- In vitro stimulation experiments: These experiments need improvement. The authors have used anti-CD40 and BAFF for B cell stimulation; however, it would be beneficial to also include anti-IgM in the stimulation cocktail. In Fig. 2G, CTV plots do not show clear defects in proliferation, yet the authors quantify the percentage of cells with more than three divisions. These plots should clearly display the gating strategy. Additionally, details about histogram normalization and potential defects in cell numbers are missing. A more in-depth analysis of apoptosis is also required to determine whether the observed defects are due to impaired proliferation or reduced survival.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Cho et al. investigate the role of ether lipid biosynthesis in B cell biology, particularly focusing on GC B cell, by inducible deletion of PexRAP, an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of ether lipids.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the data are well-presented, the paper is well-written and provides valuable mechanistic insights into the importance of PexRAP enzyme in GC B cell proliferation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>More detailed mechanisms of the impaired GC B cell proliferation by PexRAP deficiency remain to be further investigated. In the minor part, there are issues with the interpretation of the data which might cause confusion for the readers.</p>

<p>This study provides useful insights into the ways in which germinal center B cell metabolism, particularly lipid metabolism, affects cellular responses. The authors use sophisticated mouse models to demonstrate that ether lipids are relevant for B cell homeostasis and efficient humoral responses. Although the data were collected from in vitro and in vivo experiments and analyzed using solid and validated methodology, more careful experiments and extensive revision of the manuscript will be required to strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In addition to praise for the <italic>eLife</italic> system and transparency (public posting of the reviews; along with an opportunity to address them), we are grateful for the decision of the Editors to select this submission for in-depth peer review and to the referees for the thoughtful and constructive comments.</p>
<p>In overview, we mostly agree with the specific comments and evaluation of strengths of what the work adds as well as with indications of limitations and caveats that apply to the breadth of conclusions. One can view these as a combination of weaknesses, of instances of reading more into the work than what it says, and of important future directions opened up by the findings we report. Regarding the positives, we appreciate the reviewers' appraisal that our work unveils a novel mechanism in which the peroxisomal enzyme PexRAP mediates B cell intrinsic ether lipid synthesis and promotes a humoral immune response. We are gratified by a recognition that a main contribution of the work is to show that a spatial lipidomic analysis can set the stage for discovery of new molecular processes in biology that are supported by using 2-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry techniques and cell type specific conditional knockout mouse models.</p>
<p>By and large, the technical issues are items we will strive to improve. Ultimately, an over-arching issue in research publications in this epoch are the questions &quot;when is enough enough?&quot; and &quot;what, or how much, advance will be broadly important in moving biological and biomedical research forward?&quot; It appears that one limitation troubling the reviews centers on whether the mechanism of increased ROS and multi-modal death - supported most by the in vitro evidence - applies to germinal center B cells in situ, versus either a mechanism for decreased GC that mostly applies to the pre-GC clonal amplification (or recruitment into GC). Overall, we agree that this leap could benefit from additional evidence - but as resources ended we instead leave that question for the future other than the findings with S1pr2-CreERT2-driven deletion leading to less GC B cells. While we strove to be very careful in framing such a connection as an inference in the posted manuscript, we will revisit the matter via rechecking the wording when revising the text after trying to get some specific evidence.</p>
<p>In the more granular part of this provisional response (below), we will outline our plan prompted by the reviewers but also comment on a few points of disagreement or refinement (longer and more detailed explanation). The plan includes more detailed analysis of B cell compartments, surface level of immunoglobulin, Tfh cell population, a refinement of GC B cell markers, and the ex vivo GC B cell analysis for ROS, proliferation, and cell death. We will also edit the text to provide more detailed information and clarify our interpretation to prevent the confusion of our results.  At a practical level, some evidence likely is technologically impractical, and an unfortunate determinant is the lack of further sponsored funding for further work. The detailed point-by-point response to the reviewer’s comments is below.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Although the manuscript is focused on post-ontogenic B cell regulation in Ab responses, we believe we will be able to polish a revised manuscript through addition of results of analyses suggested by this point in the review: measurement of surface IgM on and phenotyping of various B cell subsets, including MZB and B1 B cells, to extend the data in Supplemental Fig 1H and I. Depending on the level of support, new immunization experiments to score Tfh and analyze a few of their functional molecules as part of a B cell paper may be feasible.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- GC Response Analysis Upon Immunization: The GC response characterization should include additional data on the T cell compartment, specifically the presence and function of Tfh cells. In Fig. 1H, the distribution of the LZ appears strikingly different. However, the authors have not addressed this in the text. A more thorough characterization of centroblasts and centrocytes using CXCR4 and CD86 markers is needed.</p>
<p>The gating strategy used to characterize GC cells (GL7+CD95+ in IgD− cells) is suboptimal. A more robust analysis of GC cells should be performed in total B220+CD138− cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We first want to apologize the mislabeling of LZ and DZ in Fig 1H. The greenish-yellow colored region (GL7<sup>+</sup> CD35<sup>+</sup>) indicate the DZ and the cyan-colored region (GL7<sup>+</sup> CD35<sup>+</sup>) indicates the LZ.</p>
<p>As a technical note, we experienced high background noise with GL7 staining uniquely with PexRAP deficient (<italic><italic>Dhrs7b</italic></italic><sup>f/f</sup>; <italic><italic>Rosa26</italic></italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup>) mice (i.e., not WT control mice). The high background noise of GL7 staining was not observed in B cell specific KO of PexRAP (<italic><italic>Dhrs7b</italic></italic><sup>f/f</sup>; hu<italic><italic>CD20</italic></italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup>). Two formal possibilities to account for this staining issue would be if either the expression of the GL7 epitope were repressed by PexRAP or the proper positioning of GL7<sup>+</sup> cells in germinal center region were defective in PexRAP-deficient mice (e.g., due to an effect on positioning cues from cell types other than B cells). In a revised manuscript, we will fix the labeling error and further discuss the GL7 issue, while taking care not to be thought to conclude that there is a positioning problem or derepression of GL7 (an activation antigen on T cells as well as B cells).</p>
<p>While the gating strategy for an overall population of GC B cells is fairly standard even in the current literature, the question about using CD138 staining to exclude early plasmablasts (i.e., analyze B220<sup>+</sup> CD138<sup>neg</sup> vs B220<sup>+</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup>) is interesting. In addition, some papers like to use GL7<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>neg</sup> for GC B cells instead of GL7<sup>+</sup> Fas (CD95)<sup>+</sup>, and we thank the reviewer for suggesting the analysis of centroblasts and centrocytes. For the revision, we will try to secure resources to revisit the immunizations and analyze them for these other facets of GC B cells (including CXCR4/CD86) and for their GL7<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>neg</sup>. B220<sup>+</sup> CD138<sup>-</sup> and B220<sup>+</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> cell populations.</p>
<p>We agree that comparison of the Rosa26-CreERT2 results to those with B cell-specific loss-of-function raise a tantalizing possibility that Tfh cells also are influenced by PexRAP. Although the manuscript is focused on post-ontogenic B cell regulation in Ab responses, we hope to add a new immunization experiments that scores Tfh and analyzes a few of their functional molecules could be added to this B cell paper, depending on the ability to wheedle enough support / fiscal resources.</p>

<p>- The authors claim that Dhrs7b supports the homeostatic maintenance of quiescent B cells in vivo and promotes effective proliferation.

However, we recommend reviewing the flow plots of CTV in Fig. 2E, as they appear out of scale.

</disp-quote>
<p>In the revision, we will edit the text and try to adjust the digitized cytometry data to allow more dynamic range to the right side of the upper panels in Fig. 2E, and otherwise to improve the presentation of the in vivo CTV result. However, we feel impelled to push back respectfully on some of the concern raised here. First, it seems to gloss over the presentation of multiple facets of evidence. The conclusion about maintenance derives primarily from Fig. 2C, which shows a rapid, statistically significant decrease in B cell numbers (extending the finding of Fig. 1D, a more substantial decrease after a bit longer a period). As noted in the text, the rate of de novo B cell production does not suffice to explain the magnitude of the decrease.</p>
<p>In terms of proliferation, we will improve presentation of the Methods but the bottom line is that the recovery efficiency is not bad (comparing to prior published work) inasmuch as transferred B cells do not uniformly home to spleen. In a setting where BAFF is in ample supply in vivo, we transferred equal numbers of cells that were equally labeled with CTV and counted B cells.  The CTV result might be affected by lower recovered B cell with PexRAP deficiency, generally, the frequencies of CTV<sup>low</sup> divided population are not changed very much. However, it is precisely because of the pitfalls of in vivo analyses that we included complementary data with survival and proliferation in vitro. The proliferation was attenuated in PexRAP-deficient B cells in vitro; this evidence supports the conclusion that proliferation of PexRAP knockout B cells is reduced. It is likely that PexRAP deficient B cells also have defect in viability in vivo as we observed the reduced B cell number in PexRAP-deficient mice. As the reviewer noticed, the presence of a defect in cycling does, in the transfer experiments, limit the ability to interpret a lower yield of B cell population after adoptive transfer into µMT recipient mice as evidence pertaining to death rates. We will edit the text of the revision with these points in mind.</p>

A more in-depth analysis of apoptosis is also required to determine whether the observed defects are due to impaired proliferation or reduced survival.</p>

<p>As suggested by reviewer, testing additional forms of B cell activation can help explore the generality (or lack thereof) of findings. We plan to test anti-IgM stimulation together with anti-CD40 + BAFF as well as anti-IgM + TLR7/8, and add the data to a revised and final manuscript.</p>
<p>With regards to Fig. 2G (and 2H), in the revised manuscript we will refine the presentation (add a demonstration of the gating, and explicate histogram normalization of FlowJo).</p>
<p>It is an interesting issue in bioscience, but in our presentation 'representative data' really are pretty representative, so a senior author is reminded of a comment Tak Mak made about a reduction (of proliferation, if memory serves) to 0.7 x control. [His point in a comment to referees at a symposium related that to a salary reduction by 30% :) A mathematical alternative is to point out that across four rounds of division for WT cells, a reduction to 0.7x efficiency at each cycle means about 1/4 as many progeny.]</p>
<p>We will try to edit the revision (Methods, Legends, Results, Discussion] to address better the points of the last two sentences of the comment, and improve the details that could assist in replication or comparisons (e.g., if someone develops a PexRAP inhibitor as potential therapeutic).</p>
<p>For the present, please note that the cell numbers at the end of the cultures are currently shown in Fig 2, panel I. Analogous culture results are shown in Fig 8, panels I, J, albeit with harvesting at day 5 instead of day 4. So, a difference of ≥ 3x needs to be explained. As noted above, a division efficiency reduced to 0.7x normal might account for such a decrease, but in practice the data of Fig. 2I show that the number of PexRAP-deficient B cells at day 4 is similar to the number plated before activation, and yet there has been a reasonable amount of divisions. So cell numbers in the culture of  mutant B cells are constant because cycling is active but decreased and insufficient to allow increased numbers (&quot;proliferation&quot; in the true sense) as programmed death is increased. In line with this evidence, Fig 8G-H document higher death rates [i.e., frequencies of cleaved caspase3<sup>+</sup> cell and Annexin V<sup>+</sup> cells] of PexRAP-deficient B cells compared to controls. Thus, the in vitro data lead to the conclusion that both decreased division rates and increased death operate after this form of stimulation.</p>
<p>An inference is that this is the case in vivo as well - note that recoveries differed by ~3x (Fig. 2D), and the decrease in divisions (presentation of which will be improved) was meaningful but of lesser magnitude (Fig. 2E, F).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Cho et al. investigate the role of ether lipid biosynthesis in B cell biology, particularly focusing on GC B cell, by inducible deletion of PexRAP, an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of ether lipids.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the data are well-presented, the paper is well-written and provides valuable mechanistic insights into the importance of PexRAP enzyme in GC B cell proliferation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this positive response and agree with the overview and summary of the paper's approaches and strengths.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>More detailed mechanisms of the impaired GC B cell proliferation by PexRAP deficiency remain to be further investigated. In the minor part, there are issues with the interpretation of the data which might cause confusion for the readers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Issues about contributions of cell cycling and divisions on the one hand, and susceptibility to death on the other, were discussed above, amplifying on the current manuscript text. The aggregate data support a model in which both processes are impacted for mature B cells in general, and mechanistically the evidence and work focus on the increased ROS and modes of death. Although the data in Fig. 7 do provide evidence that GC B cells themselves are affected, we agree that resource limitations had militated against developing further evidence about cycling specifically for GC B cells. We will hope to be able to obtain sufficient data from some specific analysis of proliferation in vivo (e.g., Ki67 or BrdU) as well as ROS and death ex vivo when harvesting new samples from mice immunized to analyze GC B cells for CXCR4/CD86, CD38, CD138 as indicated by Reviewer 1.  As suggested by Reviewer 2, we will further discuss the possible mechanism(s) by which proliferation of PexRAP-deficient B cells is impaired. We also will edit the text of a revision where to enhance clarity of data interpretation - at a minimum, to be very clear that caution is warranted in assuming that GC B cells will exhibit the same mechanisms as cultures in vitro-stimulated B cells.</p>
