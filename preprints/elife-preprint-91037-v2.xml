<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Transposable elements (TE) are repetitive sequences representing ∼45% of the human and mouse genomes and are highly expressed by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC). In this study, we investigated the role of TEs on T-cell development in the thymus. We performed multi-omic analyses of TEs in human and mouse thymic cells to elucidate their role in T cell development. We report that TE expression in the human thymus is high and shows extensive age- and cell lineage-related variations. TE expression correlates with multiple transcription factors in all cell types of the human thymus. Two cell types express particularly broad TE repertoires: mTECs and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). In mTECs, transcriptomic data suggest that TEs interact with transcription factors essential for mTEC development and function (e.g., PAX1 and REL), and immunopeptidomic data showed that TEs generate MHC-I-associated peptides implicated in thymocyte education. Notably, AIRE, FEZF2, and CHD4 regulate small yet non-redundant sets of TEs in murine mTECs. Human thymic pDCs homogenously express large numbers of TEs that likely form dsRNA, which can activate innate immune receptors, potentially explaining why thymic pDCs constitutively secrete IFN LJ/β. This study highlights the diversity of interactions between TEs and the adaptive immune system. TEs are genetic parasites, and the two thymic cell types most affected by TEs (mTEcs and pDCs) are essential to establishing central T-cell tolerance. Therefore, we propose that orchestrating TE expression in thymic cells is critical to prevent autoimmunity in vertebrates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Self/non-self discrimination is a fundamental requirement of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In jawed vertebrates, the thymus is the only site where T lymphocytes can be properly educated to distinguish self from non-self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). This is vividly illustrated by Oncostatin M-transgenic mice, where T-cell production occurs exclusively in the lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). These mice harbor normal numbers of T-cell receptors (TCR) αβ T cells but present severe autoimmunity and cannot fight infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Intrathymic generation of a functional T-cell repertoire depends on choreographed interactions between the TCRs of thymocytes and peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on various antigen-presenting cells (APC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Positive selection depends on self-antigens presented by cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTEC) and ensures that TCRs recognize antigens in the context of the host’s MHC molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). The establishment of central tolerance depends on two main classes of APCs located in the thymic medulla: dendritic cells (DC) and medullary TEC (mTEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Two other APC types have a more limited contribution to central tolerance: thymic fibroblasts and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). High avidity interactions between thymic APCs and autoreactive thymocytes lead to thymocyte deletion (negative selection) or generation of regulatory T cells (Treg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>The main drivers of central tolerance, mTECs and DCs, display considerable phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. Indeed, recent single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) studies have identified several subpopulations of mTECs: immature mTEC(I) that stimulate thymocyte migration to the medulla via chemokine secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), mTEC(II) that express high levels of MHC and are essential to tolerance induction, fully differentiated corneocyte-like mTEC(III) that foster a pro-inflammatory microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), and finally mimetic mTECs that express peripheral tissue antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Three different proteins whose loss of function leads to severe autoimmunity, AIRE, FEZF2, and CHD4, have been shown to drive the expression of non-redundant sets of peripheral tissue antigens in mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). DCs, on the other hand, are separated into three main populations. Conventional DC 1 and 2 (cDC1 and cDC2) have an unmatched ability to present both endogenous antigens and exogenous antigens acquired via cross-presentation or cross-dressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Plasmacytoid DC (pDC) are less effective APCs than cDCs, their primary role being to produce interferon alpha (IFNLJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Notably, thymic pDCs originate from intrathymic IRF8<sup>hi</sup> precursors, and, in contrast to extrathymic pDCs, they constitutively secrete high amounts of IFNLJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). This constitutive IFNLJ secretion by thymic pDCs regulates the late stages of thymocyte development by promoting the generation of Tregs and innate CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>).</p>
<p>Transposable elements (TE) are repetitive sequences representing ∼45% of the human and mouse genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Most TEs can be grouped into three categories: the long and short interspersed nuclear elements (LINE and SINE, respectively) and the long terminal repeats (LTR). These broad categories are subdivided into over 800 subfamilies based on sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). TE expression is typically repressed in host cells to prevent deleterious integrations of TE sequences in protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Unexpectedly, TEs were recently found to be expressed at higher levels in human mTECs than in any other MHC-expressing tissues and organs (i.e., excluding the testis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), suggesting a role for TEs in thymopoiesis. Since some TEs are translated and generate MHC I-associated peptides (MAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), they might induce TE-specific central tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Additionally, TEs provide binding sites to transcription factors (TF) and stimulate cytokine secretion via the formation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Hence, TEs could have pleiotropic effects on thymopoiesis. To evaluate the role of TEs in thymopoiesis, we adopted a multipronged strategy beginning with scRNA-seq of human thymi and culminating in MS analyses of the MAP repertoire of mouse mTECs.</p>

<title>LINE, LTR, and SINE expression shows extensive variations during ontogeny of the human thymus</title>
<p>We first profiled TE expression in various thymic cell populations during development. To do so, we quantified the expression of 809 TE subfamilies (classified according to the RepeatMasker annotations) in the scRNA-seq dataset of human thymi created by <italic>Park et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Cells were clustered in 19 populations representing the main constituents of the thymic hematolymphoid and stromal compartments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> and Figure 1 – figure supplement 1). The expression of TE subfamilies was quantified at all developmental stages available, ranging from 7 post-conception weeks (pcw) to 40 years of age (Supplementary file 1 – Table 1). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed three clusters of TE subfamilies based on their pattern of expression during thymic development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>, upper panel): i) maximal expression at early embryonic stages persisting, albeit at lower levels, throughout ontogeny (cluster 1), ii) an expression specific to a given timepoint (cluster 2), or iii) a high expression at early embryonic stages that decreases rapidly at later timepoints (cluster 3). LINE and SINE subfamilies were enriched in cluster 1, whereas LTR subfamilies were significantly enriched in clusters 2 and 3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>, lower panel). Expression of individual LINE and SINE subfamilies was highly shared among different cell types (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). In contrast, the LTR subfamilies’ expression pattern was shared by fewer cell subsets and adopted a quasi-random distribution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). The pattern of expression assigned to TE subfamilies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>, innermost track) was not affected by the proportion of cells of different developmental stages (embryonic or postnatal) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>, outermost track, and Figure 1 – figure supplement 2). This suggests that our observations do not result from a bias in the composition of the dataset. To gain further insights into the expression of TE subfamilies, we studied two biological processes known to regulate TE expression in other contexts: cell proliferation and expression of KRAB zinc-finger proteins (KZFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Cell cycling scores negatively correlated with TE expression in various thymic cell subsets, particularly for LINE and SINE subfamilies shared among cell types (Figure 1 – figure supplement 3 and Supplementary file 1 – Table 2), whereas analysis of KZFP expression identified ZNF10 as a probable repressor of L1 subfamilies in Th17 and NK cells (Figure 1 – figure supplement 4 and Supplementary file 1 – Table 3). Thus, we conclude that the expression of the three main classes of TEs shows major divergences as a function of age and thymic cell types.</p>

<title>TEs form interactions with transcription factors regulating thymic development and function</title>
<p>TEs provide binding sites to TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), and T-cell development is driven by the coordinated timing of multiple changes in transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). We, therefore, investigated interactions between TE subfamilies and TFs during the development of the human thymus. Two criteria defined an interaction: i) a significant and positive correlation between the expression of a TF and a TE subfamily in a given cell population, and ii) the presence of the TF binding motif in the loci of the TE subfamily (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Additionally, we validated the correlations we obtained using a bootstrap procedure to ascertain their reproducibility (see <italic>Material and Methods</italic> for details). This procedure removed weakly correlated TF-TE pairs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). TF-TE interactions were observed in all thymic cell populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, d, Figure 2 – figure supplement 1, and Supplementary file 1 – Table 4). Numerous TF-TE interactions were conserved between hematolymphoid and stromal cell subsets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>). However, the number of interactions and the complexity of the interaction networks were much higher in mTECs than in other cell populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, d, Figure 2 – figure supplement 1, and Figure 2 – figure supplement 2).</p>

<p>Several TFs instrumental in thymus development and thymopoiesis interacted with TE subfamilies (Figure 2 – figure supplement 2, and Supplementary file 1 – Table 4). These TFs include the <italic>NFKB1</italic> and <italic>REL</italic> subunits of the NF-κB complex and <italic>PAX1</italic> in mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) and <italic>JUND</italic> in thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). In DCs, the most notable TF-TE interactions involved interferon regulatory factors (IRF), which regulate the late stages of T-cell maturation, and <italic>TCF4,</italic> which is essential for pDC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). This observation is consistent with evidence that TEs have shaped the evolution of IFN signaling networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Finally, we found significant interactions between <italic>CTCF</italic> and TE subfamilies in mTECs and endothelial cells, suggesting that the binding of <italic>CTCF</italic> to TE sequences affects the tridimensional structure of the chromatin in the thymic stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Interestingly, LINE and SINE subfamilies that occupy more genomic space interacted with higher numbers of transcription factors (Figure 2 – figure supplement 3).</p>
<p>Using data from the ENCODE consortium for hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), we looked at the histone marks at the TE loci identified as TF interactors by our analyses (i.e., correlated with TF expression and containing the TF binding motif). The objective was to determine if they could act as promoters or enhancers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> and Supplementary file 1 – Table 5). We found several TE promoter and enhancer candidates in all eight hematopoietic cell types analyzed, with a striking overrepresentation of LINE and SINE compared to LTR sequences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref> and Supplementary file 1 – Table 6). Finally, we analyzed publicly available ChIP-seq data of ETS1, an important TF for NK cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), to confirm its ability to bind TE sequences. Indeed, 19% of ETS1 peaks overlap with TE sequences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>). Notably, ETS1 peaks overlapped with TE sequences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref>, in red) in the promoter regions of PRF1 and KLRD1, two genes critical for NK cells’ effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Hence, our data suggest that TEs affect thymic development and function by providing binding sites to multiple TFs.</p>

<title>TEs are highly and differentially expressed in human thymic APC subsets</title>
<p>We next sought to determine whether the high expression of TEs reported in mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) was limited to this cell subset or was found in other thymic cell types. Since several thymic stromal cells reach maturity after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), we selected postnatal samples for the following analyses. We computed two distinct Shannon entropy indices: one for the global diversity of TEs expressed by all cells of a given population, and another for the median value of TE diversity expressed by individual cells of a population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Then, we computed a linear model to represent the diversity of TEs expressed by a cell population based on the diversity of TEs expressed by individual cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, blue curve). Two salient findings emerged from this analysis. First, the diversity of TEs expressed in the T-cell lineage decreases during differentiation according to the following hierarchy: DN thymocytes &gt; DP thymocytes &gt; SP thymocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, Figure 3 – figure supplement 1). Second, among the populations of thymic APCs implicated in positive and negative selection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, orange dots), cTECs, mTECs, and DCs expressed broader repertoires of TEs than B cells and fibroblasts. While cTECs and DCs expressed highly diverse TE repertoires at both the population and individual cell levels, the breadth of TE expression in mTECs was found only at the population level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Accordingly, intercellular heterogeneity (i.e., deviation from the linear model) was higher for mTECs than other cell populations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>).</p>

<p>We next focused on thymic APCs expressing the broadest TE repertoires: cTECs, mTECs, and DCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). To this end, we annotated these APC subpopulations based on previously published lists of marker genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref> and Figure 3 – figure supplement 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). We performed differential expression analyses to determine whether some TE subfamilies were overexpressed in specific APC subsets. pDCs and mTEC(II) overexpressed a broader TE repertoire than other APCs: 32.01% of subfamilies were overexpressed in pDCs and 10.88% in mTEC(II) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref> and Supplementary file 1 – Table 7). The nature of the overexpressed TEs differed between pDCs and other thymic APC subsets. Indeed, pDCs overexpressed LTRs, LINEs, and SINEs, including several Alu and L1 subfamilies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref> and Supplementary file 1 – Table 7). In contrast, other thymic APCs predominantly overexpressed LTRs.</p>
<p>TE expression showed wildly divergent levels of intercellular heterogeneity in APC subsets. Indeed, whereas most TE subfamilies were expressed by &lt;25% of cells of the mTEC(II) population, an important proportion of TEs were expressed by &gt;75% of pDCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). To evaluate this question further, we compared TE expression between metacells of thymic APCs; metacells are small clusters of cells with highly similar transcription profiles. This analysis revealed that overexpression of TE subfamilies was shared between pDC metacells but not mTEC(II) metacells, reinforcing the idea that TE expression adopts a mosaic pattern in the mTEC(II) population (Figure 3 – figure supplement 3). We conclude that cTECs, mTECs, and DCs express broad TE repertoires. However, two subpopulations of thymic APCs clearly stand out. pDCs express an extremely diversified repertoire of LTRs, SINEs, and LINEs, showing limited intercellular heterogeneity, whereas the mTEC(II) population shows a highly heterogeneous overexpression of LTR subfamilies.</p>

<title>TE expression in human pDCs is associated with dsRNA structures</title>
<p>The high expression of a broad repertoire of TE sequences in thymic pDCs was unexpected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). LINE and SINE subfamilies, in particular, were highly and homogeneously expressed by thymic pDCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Constitutive IFNLJ secretion is a feature of thymic pDCs not found in extrathymic pDCs. We, therefore, hypothesized that this constitutive IFNLJ secretion by thymic pDCs might be mechanistically linked to their TE expression profile. We first assessed whether thymic and extrathymic pDCs have similar TE expression profiles by reanalyzing scRNA-seq data from human spleens published by <italic>Madissoon et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>) (Figure 4 – figure supplement 1a, b). This revealed that extrathymic pDCs express TE sequences at similar or lower levels than other splenic cells (Figure 4 – figure supplement 1c, d). We then used pseudobulk RNA-seq methods to perform a differential expression analysis of TE subfamilies between thymic and splenic pDCs. This analysis confirmed that TE expression was globally higher in thymic than in extrathymic pDCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Since TE overexpression can lead to the formation of dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), we investigated if such structures were found in thymic pDCs. pDCs were magnetically enriched from primary human thymi following labeling with anti-CD303 antibody (a marker of pDCs). Then, pDC-enriched thymic cells were stained with an antibody against CD123 (another marker of pDCs) and the J2 antibody that stains dsRNA. The intensity of the J2 signal was more than 10-fold higher in CD123<sup>+</sup> relative to CD123<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>, d). We conclude that thymic pDCs contain large amounts of dsRNAs. To evaluate if these dsRNAs arise from TE sequences, we analyzed in thymic APC subsets the proportion of the transcriptome assigned to two groups of genomic sequences known as important sources of dsRNAs: TEs and mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Strikingly, whereas the percentage of reads from mitochondrial genes was typically lower in pDCs than in other thymic APCs, the proportion of the transcriptome originating from TEs was higher in pDCs (∼22%) by several orders of magnitude (Figure 4 – figure supplement 2). Finally, we performed gene set enrichment analyses to ascertain if the high expression of TEs by thymic pDCs was associated with specific gene signatures. These analyses highlighted signatures of antigen presentation, immune response, and interferon signaling in thymic pDCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref> and Supplementary file 1 – Table 8). Notably, thymic pDCs harbored moderate yet significant enrichment of gene signatures of RIG-I and MDA5-mediated IFN LJ/β signaling compared to all other thymic APCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref> and Supplementary file 1 – Table 8). Altogether, these data support a model in which the high and ubiquitous expression of TEs in thymic pDCs would lead to the formation of dsRNAs triggering innate immune sensors, which might explain their constitutive secretion of IFN LJ/β.</p>

<title>AIRE, CHD4, and FEZF2 regulate distinct sets of TE sequences in murine mTECs</title>
<p>The essential role of mTECs in central tolerance hinges on their ability to ectopically express tissue-restricted genes, whose expression is otherwise limited to specific epithelial lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). This promiscuous gene expression is driven by AIRE, CHD4, and FEZF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). We, therefore, investigated the contribution of these three genes to the expression of TE subfamilies in the mTEC(II) population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). First, we validated that mTEC(II) express <italic>AIRE, CHD4,</italic> and <italic>FEZF2</italic> in the human scRNA-seq dataset (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). Next, we analyzed published murine mTEC RNA-seq data to assess the regulation of TE sequences by AIRE, CHD4, and FEZF2. Differential expression analyses between knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice showed that these three factors regulate TE sequences, but the magnitude and directionality of this regulation differed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref> and Supplementary file 1 – Table 9). Indeed, while CHD4 had the biggest impact on TE expression by inducing 433 TE loci and repressing 463, FEZF2’s impact was minimal, with 97 TE loci induced and 60 repressed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). Besides, AIRE mainly acted as a repressor of TE sequences, with 326 loci repressed and 171 induced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). Interestingly, there was minimal overlap between the TE sequences regulated by AIRE, CHD4, and FEZF2, indicating that they have non-redundant roles in TE regulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>). Additionally, AIRE, CHD4, and FEZF2 preferentially targeted LTR and LINE elements, with significant enrichment of specific subfamilies such as MTA_Mm-int and RLTR4_Mm that are induced by Aire and Fezf2, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref> and Figure 5 – figure supplement 1a). While AIRE and CHD4 preferentially targeted evolutionary young TE sequences, the age of the TE sequence did not seem to affect the regulation by FEZF2 (Figure 5 – figure supplement 1b). We also noticed that the distance between regulated TE loci was smaller than the distributions of randomly selected TEs (Figure 5 – figure supplement 1c). This suggests that AIRE, CHD4, and FEZF2 nonrandomly affect the expression of TE sequences located in specific genomic regions. We observed no significant differences in the genomic localization of TE loci targeted by AIRE, CHD4, and FEZF2 relative to the genomic localization of all TE sequences in the murine genome: most TE loci were located in intronic and intergenic regions (Figure 5 – figure supplement 1d). Enrichment for intronic TEs could not be ascribed to induction of global intron retention: the intron retention ratio was similar for TEs regulated or not by AIRE, CHD4, and FEZF2 (Figure 5 – figure supplement 1e). ChIP-seq-based analysis of permissive histone marks showed that TE loci induced by AIRE, CHD4, and FEZF2 were all marked by H3K4me3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>). As a proof of concept, we validated that 31.42% of AIRE peaks overlap with TE sequences by reanalyzing ChIP-seq data, confirming AIRE’s potential to bind TE sequences (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f</xref>). Hence, AIRE, CHD4, and FEZF2 regulate the expression of small yet non-redundant repertoires of TE sequences associated with permissive histone marks.</p>

<title>TEs are translated and presented by MHC class I molecules in murine TECs</title>
<p>Several TEs are translated and generate MAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Hence, the expression of TEs in cTECs and even more in mTECs raises a fundamental question: do these TEs generate MAPs that would shape the T cell repertoire? Mass spectrometry (MS) is the only method that can faithfully identify MAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). Despite its quintessential role in central tolerance, the MAP repertoire of mTECs has never been studied by MS because of the impossibility of obtaining sufficient mTECs for MS analyses: mTECs represent ≤ 1% of thymic cells, and they do not proliferate <italic>in vitro</italic>. To get enough cTECs and mTECs for MS analyses, we used transgenic mice that express cyclin D1 under the control of the keratin 5 promoter (K5D1 mice). These mice develop dramatic thymic hyperplasia, but their thymus is morphologically and functionally normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Primary cTECs and mTECs (2 replicates of 70 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells from 121 and 90 mice, respectively) were isolated from the thymi of K5D1 mice as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). Following cell lysis and MHC I immunoprecipitation, MAPs were analyzed by liquid chromatography MS/MS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>). To identify TE-coded MAPs, we generated a TE proteome by in silico translation of TE transcripts expressed by mTECs or cTECs, and this TE proteome was concatenated with the canonical proteome. MS analyses enabled the identification of a total of 1636 and 1714 MAPs in mTECs and cTECs, respectively. From these, we identified 4 TE-derived MAPs in mTECs and 2 in cTECs, demonstrating that TEs can be translated and presented by MHC I in the thymic cortex and medulla (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref> and Supplementary file 1 – Table 10). These MAPs were coded by the three major groups of TE: LINEs (n=1), LTRs (n=1), and SINEs (n=4). Next, we evaluated whether the low number of TE MAPs identified could result from mass spectrometry detection limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). We measured the level and frequency of TE expression in two subsets of cTECs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>, left) or mTECs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>, right) using scRNA-seq data from <italic>Baran-Gale et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). TE subfamilies generating MAPs in cTECs or mTECs are highlighted in red in their respective plots. Strikingly, TECs highly and ubiquitously expressed the MAP-generating TE subfamilies. These results suggest that the contribution of TEs to the MAP repertoire of cTECs and mTECs might be significantly underestimated by the limits of detection of MS. This is particularly true for mTECs because they express high levels of TEs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>), but their TE profile displays considerable intercellular heterogeneity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref> and Figure 3 – figure supplement 2).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>TEs are germline-integrated parasitic DNA elements that comprise about half of mammalian genomes. Over evolutionary timescales, TE sequences have been co-opted for host regulatory functions. Mechanistically, TEs encode proteins and noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). Regulation of IFN signaling and triggering innate sensors are the best-characterized roles of TEs in the mammalian immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). TEs are immunogenic and can elicit adaptive immune responses implicated in autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>). Pervasive TE expression in various somatic organs means that co-evolution with their host must depend on establishing immune tolerance, a concept supported by the highly diversified TE repertoire expressed in mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). This observation provided the impetus to perform multi-omic studies of TE expression in the thymus. At the whole organ level, we found that TE expression showed extensive age-and cell lineage-related variations and was negatively correlated with cell proliferation and expression of KZFPs. The negative correlation between TE expression and cell cycle scores in the thymus is coherent with recent data showing that transcriptional activity of L1s is increased in senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). A potential rationale for this could be to prevent deleterious transposition events during DNA replication and cell division. On the other hand, the contribution of KZFPs to TE regulation in the thymus is likely underestimated due to their typically low expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>) and scRNA-seq detection limit. Additionally, TEs interact with multiple TFs in all thymic cell subsets. This is particularly true for the LINE and SINE subfamilies that occupy larger genomic spaces. Notably, TEs appear to play particularly important roles in two cell types located in the thymic medulla: mTECs and pDCs.</p>
<p>As mTECs are the APC population crucial to central tolerance induction, their high and diverse TE expression is poised to impact the T cell repertoire’s formation profoundly. The extent and complexity of TF-TE interactions were higher in mTECs than in all other thymic cell subsets. These interactions included <italic>PAX1</italic> and subunits of the NF-κB complex (e.g., <italic>RELB</italic>). PAX1 is essential for the development of TEC progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), and <italic>RELB</italic> is for the development and differentiation of mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). RelB-deficient mice have reduced thymic cellularity, markedly fewer mTECs, lack <italic>Aire</italic> expression, and suffer from autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>). Under the influence of <italic>Aire, Fezf2,</italic> and <italic>Chd4,</italic> mTECs collectively express almost the entire exome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). However, the expression of all genes in each mTEC would cause proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Hence, promiscuous expression of tissue-restricted genes in mTECs adopts a mosaic pattern: individual tissue-restricted genes are expressed in a small fraction of mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>). The present work shows that mTECs also express an extensive repertoire of TEs in a mosaic pattern (i.e., with considerable intercellular heterogeneity). <italic>Aire</italic>, <italic>Fezf2</italic>, and <italic>Chd4</italic> regulate non-redundant sets of TEs and preferentially induce TE sequences associated with permissive histone marks. The immunopeptidome of thymic stromal cells is responsible for thymocyte education and represents one of the most fundamental “known unknowns” in immunology. Inferences on the immunopeptidome of thymic stromal cells are based on transcriptomic data. However, i) TCRs interact with MAPs, not transcripts, and ii) the MAP repertoire cannot be inferred from the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>). Using K5D1 mice presenting prominent thymic hyperplasia, we conducted MS searches of TE MAPs, identifying 4 TE MAPs in mTECs and 2 in cTECs. These results demonstrate that cTECs and mTECs present TE MAPs and suggest they present different TE MAPs. However, the correlation between transcriptomic and immunopeptidomic data suggests that TECs can present many more TE MAPs. Their profiling will require MS analyses of enormous numbers of TECs or the development of more sensitive MS techniques. As TE MAPs have been detected in normal and neoplastic extrathymic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>), the presentation of TEs by mTECs is likely essential to central tolerance. In line with vibrant plaidoyers for a collaborative Human Immunopeptidome Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>), our work suggests that immunopeptidomic studies should not be limited to protein-coding genes (2% of the genome) but also encompass non-coding sequences such as TEs.</p>
<p>The second population of cells exhibiting high TE expression, pDCs, are mainly seen as producers of IFN LJ/β and potentially as APCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Thymic and extrathymic pDCs are ontogenically and functionally different. They develop independently from each other from different precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). IFN LJ/β secretion is inducible in extrathymic pDCs but constitutive in thymic pDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). In line with the location of pDCs in the thymic medulla, their constitutive IFN LJ/β secretion is instrumental in the terminal differentiation of thymocytes and the generation of Tregs and innate CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We report here that high TE expression is also a feature of thymic, but not extrathymic, pDCs. Thus, the present study provides a rationale for the constitutive IFN LJ/β secretion by thymic pDCs: they homogeneously express large numbers of TEs (in particular LINEs and SINEs), leading to the formation of dsRNAs that trigger RIG-I and MDA5 signaling that causes the constitutive secretion of IFN LJ/β. As such, our data suggest that recognition of TE-derived dsRNAs by innate immune receptors promotes a pro-inflammatory environment favorable to the establishment of central tolerance in the thymic medulla.</p>
<p>At first sight, the pleiotropic effects of TEs on thymic function may look surprising. It should be reminded that the integration of genetic parasites such as TEs is a source of genetic conflicts with the host. Notably, the emergence of adaptive immunity gave rise to higher-order conflicts between TEs and their vertebrate hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>). The crucial challenge for the immune system is developing immune tolerance towards TEs to prevent autoimmune diseases that affect up to 10% of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>) without allowing selfish retrotransposition events that hinder genome integrity. The resolution of these conflicts has been proposed to be a determining factor in shaping the function of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>). Our data suggest that the thymus is the central battlefield for conflict resolution between TEs and T cells in vertebrates. Consistent with the implication of TEs in autoimmunity, more than 90% of putative causal variants associated with autoimmune diseases are in allegedly noncoding regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>). In this context, our study illustrates the complexity of interactions between TEs and the vertebrate immune system and should provide impetus to explore them further in health and disease. We see two limitations to our study. First, as with all multi-omic systems immunology studies, our work provides a roadmap for many future mechanistic studies that could not be realized at this stage. Second, our immunopeptidomic analyses of TECs prove that TECs present TE MAPs but certainly underestimate the diversity of TE MAPs presented by cTECs and mTECs.</p>

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>This study aimed to understand better the impacts of TE expression on thymus development and function. Thymic populations are complex and heterogeneous, so we opted for single-cell RNA-seq data to draw a comprehensive profile of TE expression in the thymus. To better understand the impact of AIRE, FEZF2, and CHD4 on TE expression in the mTEC(II) population, RNA-seq data from WT and KO murine mTEC, as well as ChIP-seq for different histone marks in murine mTECs, were reanalyzed to characterize the TE sequences regulated by these three proteins. Unless stated otherwise, studies were done in human cells. For MS analyses, two replicates of 70 million cells from K5D1 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>) were injected for both cTECs and mTECs.

<title>TE expression throughout thymic development</title>
<p>The expression of TE subfamilies was obtained by summing the read counts of loci based on the RepeatMasker annotations. For each TE subfamily in each cell population, expression levels amongst developmental stages were normalized by dividing them with the maximal expression value. Next, the Euclidean distance between each TE subfamily in each cell population (based on their normalized expression across developmental stages) was computed, followed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. The tree was then manually cut into three clusters, and enrichment of LINE, LTR, and SINE elements in these three clusters was determined using Fisher’s exact tests. The cluster assigned to each TE subfamily in each cell population was visualized in a circos plot using the circlize package (version 0.4.14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>) in R, and the percentage of each cell population found in embryonic or postnatal samples. Finally, we computed the frequency that each TE family was assigned to the three clusters, and the maximal value was kept. As a control, a random distribution of the expression of 809 TE subfamilies in 18 cell populations was generated. A cluster (cluster 1, 2, or 3) was randomly attributed for each combination of TE subfamily and cell type, and the maximal occurrence of a given cluster across cell types was then computed for each TE subfamily. Finally, the LINE, LTR, and SINE elements distributions were compared to the random distribution with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.</p>

For each thymic cell population, we calculated the Spearman correlation between proliferation scores and the expression of TE subfamilies. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was applied to correct for multiple comparisons. Correlations were considered positive if the correlation coefficient was ≥0.2 and the adjusted p-value≤0.05, and negative if the coefficient was ≤-0.2 and the adjusted p-value≤0.05. We also computed the median of all correlation coefficients for each cell population. We then assigned the class of each TE subfamily correlated with cell proliferation and compared this distribution to the distribution of classes of all TE subfamilies in the human genome. The percentage of overlap of the sets of TE subfamilies significantly correlated with cell proliferation was determined. A list of 401 human KZFPs was downloaded from <italic>Imbeault et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>).

<title>Interactions between TE subfamilies and transcription factors</title>
<p>We downloaded a list of 1638 transcription factors (TF) manually curated by <italic>Lambert et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>). For each cell population of the thymus, Spearman correlations were computed for each possible pair of TF and TE subfamily, and the Benjamini-Hochberg method was applied to correct the p-values for multiple comparisons. Correlations were considered significant if i) the correlation coefficient was ≥0.2, ii) the adjusted p-value was ≤0.05, and iii) the TF was expressed by ≥10% of the cells of the population. The correlations were validated using a bootstrap procedure (1000 iterations) to ensure their reproducibility. Briefly, we randomly selected n cells out of the n cells of a given population (while allowing cells to be selected multiple times). The empirical p-value was determined by dividing the number of iterations with a correlation coefficient &lt;0.2 by the total number of iterations (1000). In parallel, the curated binding motifs of 945 TFs were downloaded from the JASPAR database. We then used the <italic>Find Individual Motif Occurences</italic> (FIMO) software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref>) to identify the 100 000 genomic positions with the most significant matches for the TF binding motif. These lists of binding motif positions were then intersected with the positions of TE loci with the intersect function of BEDTools (version 2.29.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>), and the percentage of TE loci of each subfamily harboring TF binding motifs was determined. Thus, in a specific cell population of the thymus, a TF was considered as interacting with a TE subfamily if it satisfied two criteria: i) its expression was correlated with the one of the TE family (spearman coefficient ≥0.2, adjusted p-value ≤0.05 and expression of TF in ≥10% of cells), and ii) at least one locus of the TE subfamily contained a binding motif of the TF. For each cell population, networks of interactions between TF and TE subfamilies were generated with the network package (version 1.17.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref>) in R and represented with the ggnetwork package. For the sake of clarity, only the most significant interactions were illustrated for each cell type (i.e., correlation coefficient ≥0.3, TF binding sites in ≥1% of the loci of the TE subfamily, and TF expression in ≥10% of cells of the population). Sharing of TF-TE interactions between cell populations was represented with a chord diagram using the circlize package. For each TE subfamily, the number of interactions with TFs and the number of loci of the TE subfamily in the human genome were determined. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare the number of interactions with TF of LTR, LINE, and SINE elements, whereas Kendall tau correlation was calculated between the number of interactions with TF and the number of loci of TE subfamilies.</p>

<title>Identification of TE promoter and enhancer candidates</title>
<p>From the previously identified list of TF-TE interactions, we isolated the specific loci containing TF binding sites from the subfamilies whose expression was positively correlated with the TF. To determine if these TE loci could act as promoters or enhancers, we used histone ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE consortium for H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3. BED files from the ENCODE consortium were downloaded for eight immune cell populations: B cells, CD4 Single Positive T cells (CD4 SP), CD8 Single Positive T cells (CD8 SP), dendritic cells (DC), monocytes and macrophages (Mono/Macro), NK cells, Th17, and Treg. TE loci colocalizing with peaks in histone ChIP-seq data were identified using the intersect function of BEDTools (version 2.29.2). To be considered enhancer candidates, TE loci had to colocalize with H3K27ac and H3K4me1 but not H3K4me3. To be considered as promoter candidates, TE loci had to colocalize with H3K27ac and H3K4me3, but not H3K4me1, and be located at ≤ 1000 nucleotides from a transcription start site (TSS) annotated in the refTSS database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref>).</p>

The diversity of TE sequences expressed by thymic populations was assessed using Shannon entropy. Using the vegan package (version 2.5-7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref>) in R, two distinct Shannon entropy metrics were computed for each cell population. First, the Shannon entropy was computed based on the expression level (i.e., log(read count)) of TE subfamilies for each cell individually. The median entropy was calculated for each cell population. In parallel, the diversity of TE sequences expressed by an entire population was also assessed. For this purpose, a binary code was generated to represent the expression status of TE subfamilies in each cell (where 1 is expressed and 0 is not expressed). For each population separately, the binary codes of individual cells were summed to obtain the frequency of expression of each TE subfamily in the population, which was used to compute the Shannon entropy of TE sequences expressed by the population. A linear model was generated with the lm function of the stats package in R to summarize the data distribution. The deviation (Δy) from the observed population’s TE diversity and the one expected by the linear model was computed for each cell population.</p>

Thymi from 4-month-old to 12-year-old individuals were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen in the following solution: 95% (PBS-5% Dextran 40 (Sigma-Aldrich)) – 5% DMSO (Fisher Scientific). Protocol for thymic pDCs isolation was based on <italic>Stoeckle et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref>). Briefly, thymic samples were cut in ∼2mm pieces, followed by three rounds of digestion (40 min, 180 RPM at 37LJ) in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 2mg/mL of Collagenase A (Roche) and 0.1mg/mL of DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich). APCs were then enriched using Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich) density centrifugation (3500g, 35min at 4LJ), followed by an FBS cushion density gradient (5mL of RPMI 1640 containing enriched APCs layered on 5mL of heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen, 12483020), 1000RPM for 10min at 4LJ) to remove cell debris. Finally, thymic pDCs were magnetically enriched using the QuadroMACS Separator (Miltenyi). Cells were stained with a CD303 (BDCA-2) MicroBead Kit (Miltenyi), and labeled cells were loaded on LS columns (Miltenyi) for magnetic-activated cell sorting.</p>
<p>Purified thymic pDCs were pipetted on poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:10 in dH<sub>2</sub>O) coated 15μ-Slide 8 well (ibid) and incubated for 2h at 37LJ in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were fixed using 1% [w/v] paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS 1X (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized for 30min at room temperature with 0.1% [v/v] Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS 1X, followed by blocking using 5% [w/v] BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS 1X for 30min at room temperature. Immunostaining was performed in four steps to avoid unspecific binding of the secondary antibodies: i) incubation overnight at 4LJ with the mouse monoclonal IgG2a J2 antibody anti-dsRNA (Jena Bioscience, cat. RNT-SCI-10010500, dilution 1:200), ii) incubation with the donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, cat.

All antibodies and DAPI were diluted in a blocking solution. Image acquisition was made with an LSM 700 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) using a 40x oil objective (Zeiss, Plan-Neofluar N.A. 1.4) and the ZEN software. Using the whiteTopHat function of the EBImage package and the sigmoNormalize function of the MorphoR package in R, the background of the DAPI signal was removed. The nuclei were segmented on the resulting images as circular shapes based on the DAPI signal. The mean intensity of CD123 and J2 staining was determined for each cytoplasm, defined as 19nm rings around nuclei. Based on the distribution of the CD123 signal across cells, a threshold between CD123<sup>-</sup> and CD123<sup>+</sup> cells was set up for each replicate independently.

Stringent criteria (i.e., an expression below 2 transcripts per million (TPM) in all samples) were applied to remove lowly expressed TEs. TE subfamilies with i) a fold change ≥2 and an adjusted p-value ≤0.05 or ii) a fold change ≤-2 and an adjusted p-value ≤0.05 were considered as induced and repressed, respectively. The percentage of overlap between the sets of TE loci induced or repressed by AIRE, FEZF2, and CHD4 was computed. The class and subfamily were assigned to each regulated TE locus, and the distributions of classes and subfamilies across all TE sequences of the murine genome were used as controls. Significant enrichment of classes or subfamilies was determined with Chi-squared tests, and a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was performed to enrich subfamilies in induced or repressed TEs. The distance between TE loci induced or repressed by AIRE, FEZF2, or CHD4 was defined as the minimal distance between the middle position of TE loci on the same chromosome. As a control, distributions of randomly selected TE loci whose expression is independent of AIRE, FEZF2, and CHD4 and equal size to the sets of regulated TEs were generated (for example, if 433 TE loci are induced by CHD4, 433 independent TE loci were randomly selected). Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare random and regulated distributions. Genomic positions of exons, introns 3’ and 5’ untranslated transcribed region (UTR) were downloaded from the UCSC Table Browser. The genomic localization of regulated TEs was determined using the intersect mode of the BEDTools suite version 2.29.2. TE loci not located in exons, introns, 3’UTR, or 5’UTR were considered intergenic. The percentage of regulated TE loci in each type of genomic region was determined and compared to the genomic localization of all TE loci in the murine genome with chi-squared tests. Finally, we estimated the frequency of intron retention events for introns containing TE loci regulated by AIRE, FEZF2, or CHD4 with S-IRFindeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref>). Sequencing reads were aligned to the reference <italic>Mus musculus</italic> genome (mm10) using STAR version 2.7.1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref>) with default parameters. Each intron’s Stable Intron Retention ratio (SIRratio) was computed with the computeSIRratio function of S-IRFindeR. Introns containing TE loci induced by AIRE, FEZF2, or CHD4 were filtered using BEDTools intersect. Random distributions of equivalent sizes of introns containing TE sequences independent of AIRE, FEZF2, and CHD4 were generated as control. A SIRratio of 0.1 was used as a threshold of significant intron retention events.</p>

<p>Thymic stromal cell enrichment was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref>). Briefly, thymi from 16-to 22-week-old K5D1 mice were mechanically disrupted and enzymatically digested with papain (Worthington Biochemical Corporation), DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich), and collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C. Next, the single-cell suspension obtained after enzymatic digestion was maintained at 4°C in FACS buffer (PBS, 0.5% [w/v] BSA, 2mM EDTA) and enriched in thymic epithelial cells using anti-EpCAM (CD326) or anti-CD45 microbeads (mouse, Miltenyi) and LS columns (Miltenyi). Then, the enriched epithelial cell suspension was stained for flow cytometry cell sorting with the following antibodies and dyes: anti-EpCAM-APC-Cy7 clone G8.8 (BioLegend, cat. 118218), anti-CD45-APC clone 30-F11 (BD Biosciences, cat. 559864), anti-UEA1-biotinylated (Vector Laboratories, cat. B-1065), anti-I-A/I-E-Alexa Fluor 700 clone M5/114.15.2 (BioLegend, cat. 107622), anti-Ly51-FITC clone 6C3 (BioLegend, cat. 553160), anti-streptavidin-PE-Cy7 (BD Biosciences, cat. 557598), and 7-AAD (BD Biosciences, cat. 559925). Cell sorting was performed using a BD FACSAria (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using the FACSDiva. TECs were defined as EpCAM<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>−</sup>, while the cTEC and mTEC subsets were defined as UEA1<sup>−</sup>Ly51<sup>+</sup> and UEA1<sup>+</sup>Ly51<sup>-</sup> TEC, respectively.</p>

<title>RNA-Sequencing</title>
<p>Total RNA from 80 000 mTECs or cTECs was isolated using TRIzol and purified with an RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was quantified using Qubit (Thermo Scientific), and RNA quality was assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Transcriptome libraries were generated using a KAPA RNA HyperPrep kit (Roche) using a poly(A) selection (Thermo Scientific). Sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq 500, obtaining ∼200 million paired-end reads per sample.</p>

<title>Preparation of CNBR-activated Sepharose beads for MHC I immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>CNBR-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. 17-0430-01) were incubated with 1 mM HCl at a ratio of 40 mg of beads per 13.5 ml of 1 mM HCl for 30 minutes with tumbling at room temperature. Beads were spun at 215g for 1 minute at 4°C, and supernatants were discarded. 40 mg of beads were resuspended with 4 ml of coupling buffer (0.1M NaHC0<sub>3</sub>/0.5M NaCl pH 8.3), spun at 215g for 1 minute at 4°C, and the supernatants were discarded. Mouse antibodies Pan-H2 (clone M1/42), H2-K<sup>b</sup> (clone Y-3), and H2-D<sup>b</sup> (clone 28-14-8S) were coupled to beads at a ratio of 1 mg of antibody to 40 mg of beads in coupling buffer for 120 minutes with tumbling at room temperature. Beads were spun at 215g for 1 minute at 4°C, and supernatants were discarded. 40 mg of beads were resuspended with 1 ml of blocking buffer (0.2M glycine), incubated for 30 minutes with tumbling at room temperature, and the supernatants were discarded. Beads were washed by centrifugation twice with PBS pH 7.2, resuspended at a concentration of 1 mg of antibody per ml of PBS pH 7.2, and stored at 4°C.</p>

<title>Immuno-isolation of MAPs</title>
<p>Frozen pellets of mTECs (90 mice, 191 million cells total) and cTECs (121 mice, 164 million cells total) were thawed, pooled, and resuspended with PBS pH 7.2 up to 4 ml and then solubilized by adding 4 mL of detergent buffer containing PBS pH 7.2, 1% (w/v) CHAPS (Sigma, cat. C9426-5G) supplemented with Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, cat. P8340-5mL). Solubilized cells were incubated for 60 minutes with tumbling at 4°C and then spun at 16,600g for 20 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred into new tubes containing 1.5 mg of Pan-H2, 0.5 mg of H2-K<sup>b</sup>, and 0.5 mg of H2-D<sup>b</sup> antibodies covalently-cross-linked CNBR-Sepharose beads per sample and incubated with tumbling for 180 minutes at 4°C. Samples were transferred into BioRad Poly prep chromatography columns and eluted by gravity. Beads were first washed with 11.5 mL PBS, then with 11.5 mL of 0.1X PBS, and finally with 11.5 mL of water. MHC I complexes were eluted from the beads by acidic treatment using 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Acidic filtrates containing peptides were separated from MHC I subunits (HLA molecules and β-2 microglobulin) using home-made stage tips packed with two 1 mm diameter octadecyl (C-18) solid phase extraction disks (EMPORE). Stage tips were pre-washed with methanol, then with 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% TFA, and finally with 1% TFA. Samples were loaded onto the stage tips and washed with 1% TFA and 0.1% TFA. Peptides were eluted with 30% ACN in 0.1% TFA, dried using vacuum centrifugation, and then stored at -20 °C until MS analysis.</p>

<title>MS analyses</title>
<p>Peptides were loaded and separated on a home-made reversed-phase column (150-μm i.d. by 200 mm) with a 106-min gradient from 10 to 38% B (A: formic acid 0.1%, B: 80% CAN 0.1% formic acid) and a 600-nl/min flow rate on an Easy nLC-1200 connected to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each full MS spectrum acquired at a resolution of 240,000 was followed by tandem-MS (MS-MS) spectra acquisition on the most abundant multiply charged precursor ions for a maximum of 3s. Tandem-MS experiments were performed using higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) at a collision energy of 34%. The generation of the personalized proteome containing TE sequences, as well as the identification of TE-derived MAPs, was performed as per <italic>Larouche et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) with the following modifications: the mm10 murine reference genome was downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser, the annotations for murine genes and TE sequences were downloaded from the UCSC Table Browser, and the Uniprot mouse database (16 977 entries) was used for the canonical proteome. MAPs were identified using PEAKS X Pro (Bioinformatics Solutions, Waterloo, ON). The level and frequency of expression of TE subfamilies generating MAPs or not were determined in thymic epithelial cells were determined by averaging the expression values across cells of a TEC subset and dividing the number of cells with a positive (i.e.,&gt; 0) expression of the TEs by the total number of cells of the TEC subset, respectively.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Transposable Elements (TEs) are exogenously acquired DNA regions that have played important roles in the evolutional acquisition of various biological functions. TEs may have been important in the evolution of the immune system, but their role in thymocytes has not been fully clarified.</p>
<p>Using the human thymus scRNA dataset, the authors suggest the existence of cell type-specific TE functions in the thymus. In particular, it is interesting to show that there is a unique pattern in the type and expression level of TEs in thymic antigen-presenting cells, such as mTECs and pDCs, and that they are associated with transcription factor activities. Furthermore, the authors suggested that TEs may be non-redundantly regulated in expression by Aire, Fezf2, and Chd4, and that some TE-derived products are translated and present as proteins in thymic antigen-presenting cells. These findings provide important insights into the evolution of the acquired immune system and the process by which the thymus acquires its function as a primary lymphoid tissue.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) By performing single-cell level analysis using scRNA-seq datasets, the authors extracted essential information on heterogeneity within the cell population. It is noteworthy that this revealed the diversity of expression not only of known autoantigens but also of TEs in thymic antigen-presenting cells.</p>
<p>(2) The attempt to use mass spectrometry to confirm the existence of TE-derived peptides is worthwhile, even if the authors did not obtain data on as many transcripts as expected.</p>
<p>(3) The use of public data sets and the clearly stated methods of analysis improved the transparency of the results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors sometimes made overstatements largely due to the lack or shortage of experimental evidence.</p>
<p>For example in Figure 4, the authors concluded that thymic pDCs produced higher copies of TE-derived RNAs to support the constitutive expression of type-I interferons in thymic pDCs, unlike peripheral pDCs. However, the data was showing only the correlation between the distinct TE expression pattern in pDCs and the abundance of dsRNAs. We are compelled to say that the evidence is totally too weak to mention the function of TEs in the production of interferon. Even if pDCs express a distinct type and amount of TE-derived transcripts, it may be a negligible amount compared to the total cellular RNAs. How many TE-derived RNAs potentially form the dsRNAs? Are they over-expressed in pDCs?</p>
<p>
The data interpretation requires more caution to connect the distinct results of transcriptome data to the biological significance.</p>
<p>We contend that our manuscript combines the attributes of a research article (novel concepts) and a resource article (datasets of TEs implicated in various aspects of thymus function). The critical strength of our work is that it opens entirely novel research perspectives. We are unaware of previous studies on the role of TEs in the human thymus. The drawback is that, as with all novel multi-omic systems biology studies, our work provides a roadmap for a multitude of future mechanistic studies that could not be realized at this stage. Indeed, we performed wet lab experiments to validate some but not all conclusions: i) presentation of TE-derived MAPs by TECs and ii) formation of dsRNAs in thymic pDCs. In response to Reviewer #1, we performed supplementary analyses to increase the robustness of our conclusions. Also, we indicated when conclusions relied strictly on correlative evidence and clarified the hypotheses drawn from our observations. Regarding the Reviewer's questions about TE-derived dsRNAs, LINE, LTR, and SINE elements all have the potential to generate dsRNAs, given their highly repetitive nature and bi-directional transcription (1). As ~32% of TE subfamilies are overexpressed in pDCs, we hypothesized that these TE sequences might form dsRNA structures in these cells. To address the Reviewer's concerns regarding the amount of TE-derived RNAs among total cellular RNAs, we also computed the percentage of reads assigned to TEs in the different subsets of thymic APCs (see Reviewer 1 comment #4).</p>
<p>
------</p>
<p>I appreciate the authors' efforts to improve the quality of this valuable paper. The additional data proposed by the authors enhanced the possibility that the non-negligible amount of RNAs in pDCs is derived from TE elements. Their biological roles and significance will be demonstrated in future research.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of generality of specific examples. This manuscript discusses the whole genomic picture of TE expression. In addition, one good way is to focus on the specific example to clearly discuss the biological significance of the acquisition of TEs for the thymic APC functions and the thymic selection.</p>
<p>In Figure 2, the authors focused on ETS-1 and its potential target genes ZNF26 and MTMR3, however, the significance of these genes in NK cell function or development is unclear. The authors should examine and discuss whether the distinct features of TEs can be found among the genomic loci that link to the fundamental function of the thymus, e.g., antigen processing/presentation.</p>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this highly relevant comment. We investigated the genomic loci associated with NK cell biology to determine if ETS1 peaks would overlap with TE sequences in protein-coding genes' promoter region. Figure 2h illustrates two examples of ETS1 significant peaks overlapping TE sequences upstream of PRF1 and KLRD1. PRF1 is a protein implicated in NK cell cytotoxicity, whereas KLRD1 (CD94) dimerizes with NKG2 and regulates NK cell activation via interaction with the nonclassical MHC-I molecule HLA-E (2, 3). Thus, we modified the section of the manuscript addressing these results to include these new analyses: &quot;Finally, we analyzed publicly available ChIP-seq data of ETS1, an important TF for NK cell development (4), to confirm its ability to bind TE sequences. Indeed, 19% of ETS1 peaks overlap with TE sequences (Figure 2g). Notably, ETS1 peaks overlapped with TE sequences (Figure 2h, in red) in the promoter regions of PRF1 and KLRD1, two genes important for NK cells' effector functions (2, 3).&quot;</p>
<p>
------</p>
<p>I am convinced by the authors' explanation that TE elements may contribute to the functions of NK cells.</p>
<p>
However, since I have understood that the main topic of this paper is about the thymus and thymic antigen-presenting cells, the mention of NK cells seems abrupt and unconnected to me. NK cells are a type of innate lymphocyte that arise in the bone marrow, and thymus is dispensable for their development and function. The readers might expect to find something more fundamental regarding the function of the thymus and immunological tolerance.</p>
<p>(3) Since the deep analysis of the dataset yielded many intriguing suggestions, why not add a discussion of the biological reasons and significance? For example, in Figure 1, why is TE expression negatively correlated with proliferation? cTEC-TE is mostly postnatal, while mTEC-TE is more embryonic. What does this mean?</p>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. To our knowledge, the relationship between cell division and transcriptional activity of TEs has not been extensively studied in the literature. However, a recent study has shown that L1 expression is induced in senescent cells. We therefore added the following sentences to our Discussion: &quot;The negative correlation between TE expression and cell cycle scores in the thymus is coherent with recent data showing that transcriptional activity of L1s is increased in senescent cells (5). A potential rationale for this could be to prevent deleterious transposition events during DNA replication and cell division.&quot; We also added several discussion points regarding the regulation of TEs by KZFPs to answer concerns raised by Reviewer 2 (see Reviewer 2 comment #1).</p>
<p>
------</p>
<p>I agree on the possibility suggested by the authors.</p>
<p>(4) To consolidate the experimental evidence about pDCs and TE-derived dsRNAs, one option is to show the amount of TE-derived RNA copies among total RNAs. The immunohistochemistry analysis in Figure 4 requires additional data to demonstrate that overlapped staining was not caused by technical biases (e.g. uneven fixation may cause the non-specifically stained regions/cells). To show this, authors should have confirmed not only the positive stainings but also the negative staining (e.g. CD3, etc.). Another possible staining control was showing that non-pDC (CD303- cell fractions in this case) cells were less stained by the ds-RNA probe.</p>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. We computed the proportion of reads in each cell assigned to two groups of sequences known to generate dsRNAs: TEs and mitochondrial genes (1). These analyses showed that the proportion of reads assigned to TEs is higher in pDCs than other thymic APCs by several orders of magnitude (~20% of all reads). In contrast, reads derived from mitochondrial genes had a lower abundance in pDCs. We included these results in Figure 4 - figure supplement 2 and included the following text in the Results section &quot;To evaluate if these dsRNAs arise from TE sequences, we analyzed in thymic APC subsets the proportion of the transcriptome assigned to two groups of genomic sequences known as important sources of dsRNAs, TEs and mitochondrial genes (1). Strikingly, whereas the percentage of reads from mitochondrial genes was typically lower in pDCs than in other thymic APCs, the proportion of the transcriptome originating from TEs was higher in pDCs (~22%) by several orders of magnitude (Figure 4 - figure supplement 2).&quot; As a negative control for the immunofluorescence experiments, we used CD123- cells. Indeed, flow cytometry analysis of the magnetically enriched CD303+ fraction was around 90% pure, as revealed by double staining with CD123 and CD304 (two additional markers of pDCs): CD123- cells were also CD304-/lo, showing that these cells are non- pDCs. Thus, we decided to compare the dsRNA signal between CD123+ cells (pDCs) and CD123- cells (non-pDCs). The difference between CD123+ and CD123- cells was striking (Figure 4d).</p>
<p>
------</p>
<p>Although the technical concerns about immunostaining were not resolved, it is understandable that it would be difficult to rerun the experiment since the authors used the precious human thymi as the experimental material. Immunostaining co-staining requires careful interpretation so that careful experimental setup is needed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Larouche et al show that TEs are broadly expressed in thymic cells, especially in mTECs and pDCs. Their data suggest a possible involvement of TEs in thymic gene regulation and IFN-alpha secretion. They also show that at least some TE-derived peptides are presented by MHC-I in the thymus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The idea of high/broad TE expression in the thymus as a mechanism for preventing TE-mediated autoimmunity is certainly an attractive one, as is their involvement in IFN-alpha secretion therein. The analyses and experiments presented here are therefore a very useful primer for more in-depth experiments, as the authors point out towards the end of the discussion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are many dangers about analysing RNA-seq data at the subfamily level. Outputs may be greatly confounded by pervasive transcription, DNA contamination, and overlap of TEs with highly expressed genes. Whether TE transcripts are independent units or part of a gene also has important implications for the conclusions drawn. The authors have tried to mitigate against some of these issues, but they have not been completely ruled out.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewers' and editors' comments and suggestions on our manuscript &quot;Transposable elements regulate thymus development and function.&quot; We performed additional analyses to validate our results and rephrased some manuscript sections according to the comments. We believe these changes significantly increase the solidity of our conclusions. Our point-by-point answer to the reviewers' and editors' comments is detailed below. New data and analyses are shown in Figure 1d, Figure 2g and h, Figure 5e and f, Figure 1 – figure supplement 1, Figure 2 – figure supplement 2, Figure 3 – figure supplement 1 and 2, Figure 4 – figure supplement 2, Figure 5 – figure supplement 1, as well as the corresponding text sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors sometimes made overstatements largely due to the lack or shortage of experimental evidence.</p>
<p>For example in figure 4, the authors concluded that thymic pDCs produced higher copies of TE-derived RNAs to support the constitutive expression of type-I interferons in thymic pDCs, unlike peripheral pDCs. However, the data was showing only the correlation between the distinct TE expression pattern in pDCs and the abundance of dsRNAs. We are compelled to say that the evidence is totally too weak to mention the function of TEs in the production of interferon. Even if pDCs express a distinct type and amount of TE-derived transcripts, it may be a negligible amount compared to the total cellular RNAs. How many TE-derived RNAs potentially form the dsRNAs? Are they over-expressed in pDCs?</p>
<p>The data interpretation requires more caution to connect the distinct results of transcriptome data to the biological significance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We contend that our manuscript combines the attributes of a research article (novel concepts) and a resource article (datasets of TEs implicated in various aspects of thymus function). The critical strength of our work is that it opens entirely novel research perspectives. We are unaware of previous studies on the role of TEs in the human thymus. The drawback is that, as with all novel multi-omic systems biology studies, our work provides a roadmap for a multitude of future mechanistic studies that could not be realized at this stage. Indeed, we performed wet lab experiments to validate some but not all conclusions: i) presentation of TE-derived MAPs by TECs and ii) formation of dsRNAs in thymic pDCs. In response to Reviewer #1, we performed supplementary analyses to increase the robustness of our conclusions. Also, we indicated when conclusions relied strictly on correlative evidence and clarified the hypotheses drawn from our observations.</p>
<p>Regarding the Reviewer's questions about TE-derived dsRNAs, LINE, LTR, and SINE elements all have the potential to generate dsRNAs, given their highly repetitive nature and bi-directional transcription (1). As ~32% of TE subfamilies are overexpressed in pDCs, we hypothesized that these TE sequences might form dsRNA structures in these cells. To address the Reviewer's concerns regarding the amount of TE-derived RNAs among total cellular RNAs, we also computed the percentage of reads assigned to TEs in the different subsets of thymic APCs (see Reviewer 1 comment #4).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Lack of generality of specific examples. This manuscript discusses the whole genomic picture of TE expression. In addition, one good way is to focus on the specific example to clearly discuss the biological significance of the acquisition of TEs for the thymic APC functions and the thymic selection.</p>
<p>In figure 2, the authors focused on ETS-1 and its potential target genes ZNF26 and MTMR3, however, the significance of these genes in NK cell function or development is unclear. The authors should examine and discuss whether the distinct features of TEs can be found among the genomic loci that link to the fundamental function of the thymus, e.g., antigen processing/presentation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this highly relevant comment. We investigated the genomic loci associated with NK cell biology to determine if ETS1 peaks would overlap with TE sequences in protein-coding genes' promoter region. Figure 2h illustrates two examples of ETS1 significant peaks overlapping TE sequences upstream of PRF1 and KLRD1. PRF1 is a protein implicated in NK cell cytotoxicity, whereas KLRD1 (CD94) dimerizes with NKG2 and regulates NK cell activation via interaction with the nonclassical MHC-I molecule HLA-E (2, 3). Thus, we modified the section of the manuscript addressing these results to include these new analyses:</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, we analyzed publicly available ChIP-seq data of ETS1, an important TF for NK cell development (4), to confirm its ability to bind TE sequences. Indeed, 19% of ETS1 peaks overlap with TE sequences (Figure 2g). Notably, ETS1 peaks overlapped with TE sequences (Figure 2h, in red) in the promoter regions of PRF1 and KLRD1, two genes important for NK cells' effector functions (2, 3).&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Since the deep analysis of the dataset yielded many intriguing suggestions, why not add a discussion of the biological reasons and significance?
For example, in Figure 1, why is TE expression negatively correlated with proliferation? cTEC-TE is mostly postnatal, while mTEC-TE is more embryonic. What does this mean?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. To our knowledge, the relationship between cell division and transcriptional activity of TEs has not been extensively studied in the literature. However, a recent study has shown that L1 expression is induced in senescent cells. We therefore added the following sentences to our Discussion:</p>
<p>&quot;The negative correlation between TE expression and cell cycle scores in the thymus is coherent with recent data showing that transcriptional activity of L1s is increased in senescent cells (5). A potential rationale for this could be to prevent deleterious transposition events during DNA replication and cell division.&quot;</p>
<p>We also added several discussion points regarding the regulation of TEs by KZFPs to answer concerns raised by Reviewer 2 (see Reviewer 2 comment #1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) To consolidate the experimental evidence about pDCs and TE-derived dsRNAs, one option is to show the amount of TE-derived RNA copies among total RNAs. The immunohistochemistry analysis in figure 4 requires additional data to demonstrate that overlapped staining was not caused by technical biases (e.g. uneven fixation may cause the non-specifically stained regions/cells). To show this, authors should have confirmed not only the positive stainings but also the negative staining (e.g. CD3, etc.). Another possible staining control was showing that non-pDC (CD303- cell fractions in this case) cells were less stained by the ds-RNA probe.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. We computed the proportion of reads in each cell assigned to two groups of sequences known to generate dsRNAs: TEs and mitochondrial genes (1). These analyses showed that the proportion of reads assigned to TEs is higher in pDCs than other thymic APCs by several orders of magnitude (~20% of all reads). In contrast, reads derived from mitochondrial genes had a lower abundance in pDCs. We included these results in Figure 4 – figure supplement 2 and included the following text in the Results section entitled &quot;TE expression in human pDCs is associated with dsRNA structures&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;To evaluate if these dsRNAs arise from TE sequences, we analyzed in thymic APC subsets the proportion of the transcriptome assigned to two groups of genomic sequences known as important sources of dsRNAs, TEs and mitochondrial genes (1). Strikingly, whereas the percentage of reads from mitochondrial genes was typically lower in pDCs than in other thymic APCs, the proportion of the transcriptome originating from TEs was higher in pDCs (~22%) by several orders of magnitude (Figure 4 – figure supplement 2).&quot;</p>
<p>As a negative control for the immunofluorescence experiments, we used CD123- cells. Indeed, flow cytometry analysis of the magnetically enriched CD303+ fraction was around 90% pure, as revealed by double staining with CD123 and CD304 (two additional markers of pDCs): CD123- cells were also CD304-/lo, showing that these cells are non-pDCs. Thus, we decided to compare the dsRNA signal between CD123+ cells (pDCs) and CD123- cells (non-pDCs). The difference between CD123+ and CD123- cells was striking (Figure 4d).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) In the abstract, results and discussion, the following conclusions are drawn that are not supported by the data: a) TEs interact with multiple transcription factors in thymic cells, b) TE expression leads to dsRNA formation, activation of RIG-I/MDA5 and secretion of IFN-alpha, c) TEs are regulated by cell proliferation and expression of KZFPs in the thymus. All these statements derive from correlations. Only one TF has ChIP-seq data associated with it, dsRNA formation and/or IFN-alpha secretion could be independent of TE expression, and whilst KZFPs most likely regulate TEs in the thymus, the data do not demonstrate it. The authors also seem to suggests that AIRE, FEZF2 and CHD4 regulate TEs directly, but binding is not shown. The manuscript needs a thorough revision to be absolutely clear about the correlative nature of the described associations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with Reviewer #2 that some of the conclusions in our initial manuscript were not fully supported by experimental data. In the revised manuscript, we clearly indicated when conclusions relied strictly on correlative evidence and clarified the hypotheses drawn from our observations. Regarding the regulation of TE expression by AIRE, FEZF2, and CHD4, we reanalyzed publicly available ChIP-seq data of AIRE and FEZF2 in murine mTECs. For AIRE, we confirmed that ~30% of AIRE's statistically significant peaks overlap with TE sequences (see Reviewer 2, comment #6 for more details on read alignment and peak calling), confirming its ability to bind to TE sequences directly. We added these results to the main figures (Figure 5f) and modified the &quot;AIRE, CHD4, and FEZF2 regulate distinct sets of TE sequences in murine mTECs&quot; as follows:</p>
<p>“[…]. As a proof of concept, we validated that 31.42% of AIRE peaks overlap with TE sequences by reanalyzing ChIP-seq data, confirming AIRE's potential to bind TE sequences (Figure 5f).&quot;</p>
<p>A reanalysis of FEZF2's ChIP-seq data yielded no significant peaks while using stringent criteria. For this reason, we decided to exclude these data and only use AIRE as a proof of concept.</p>
<p>Regarding KZFPs, we agree with Reviewer #2 that their impact on TE expression is probably significantly underestimated in our data. A potential reason for this is that KZFP expression is typically low; thus, transcriptomic signals from KZFPs could have been missed by the low depth of scRNA-seq. We mentioned this point in the Discussion:</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, the contribution of KZFPs to TE regulation in the thymus is likely underestimated due to their typically low expression (6) and scRNA-seq's limit of detection.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) On the technical side, there are many dangers about analyzing RNA-seq data at the subfamily level and without stringent quality control checks. Outputs may be greatly confounded by pervasive transcription (see PMID 31425522), DNA contamination, and overlap of TEs with highly expressed genes. Whether TE transcripts are independent units or part of a gene also has important implications for the conclusions drawn. I would say that for most purposes of this work, an analysis restricted to independent TE transcripts, with appropriate controls for DNA contamination, would provide great reassurances that the results from subfamily-level analyses are sound. Showing examples from the genome browser throughout would also help.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that contamination could have interfered with TE quantification. We used FastQ Screen (7) to evaluate the contamination of our human scRNA-seq data. As illustrated in the Figure below, most reads aligned with the human genome, and there were no reads uniquely assigned to another species analyzed, confirming the high purity of our dataset.</p>

</fig>
<p>As stated by the Reviewer, pervasive expression is another factor that can lead to overestimation of TE expression. To evaluate if pervasive expression impacted the results of our differential expression analysis of TEs between APC subsets, we visualized read alignment to TE sequences using a genome browser. We selected two samples containing the highest numbers of mTEC(II) and pDCs (T07_TH_EPCAM and FCAImmP7277556, respectively) and used STAR to align reads to the human genome (GRCh38). We then visualized read alignment to randomly selected loci of two subfamilies identified as overexpressed by mTEC(II) or pDCs (HERVE-int and Harlequin-int, respectively). The examples below show that the signal detected is specific to the TE sequences located in introns. Even though this visualization cannot guarantee that pervasive expression did not affect TE quantification in any way, it increases the confidence that the signal detected by our analyses genuinely originates from TE expression.</p>

<p>(3) Related to the above, it would be useful to describe in the main text (and methods) how multi-mapping reads are being handled. It wasn't clear to me how kallisto handles this, and it has implications for the results. In the analysis suggested above, only uniquely mapped reads would have to be used, despite its limitations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that this information regarding assignment of multimapping reads is important. Kallisto uses an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to deal with multimapping reads, a strategy used by several algorithms developed to study TE expression (8). Briefly, the EM algorithm reassigns multimapping reads based on the number of uniquely mapped reads assigned to each sequence. Thus, we added the following details to the methods section:</p>
<p>&quot;Preprocessing of the scRNA-seq data was performed with the kallisto (9), which uses an expectation-maximization algorithm to reassign multimapping reads based on the frequency of unique mappers at each sequence, and bustools workflow.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Whilst I liked the basic idea, I am not convinced that correlating TE and TF expression is a good strategy for identifying TE-TF associations at enhancers. Enhancers express very low levels of short transcripts, which I doubt would be detected in low-depth scRNA-seq data. The transcripts the authors are using to make such associations may therefore have nothing to do with the enhancer roles of TEs. I would limit these analyses to cell types for which there is histone modification data and correlate TF expression with that instead.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that it would have been interesting to correlate the expression of TFs with signals of histone marks at TE sequences. However, we could not perform this analysis because we did not have matched data of histone marks throughout thymic development. Therefore, we adopted an alternative, well-suited strategy.</p>
<p>Our strategy to identify TE enhancer candidates is depicted in Figure 2a: i) correlation between the expression of the TF and the TE subfamily, ii) presence of the TF binding motif in the sequence of the TE enhancer candidate, and iii) colocalization of the TE enhancer candidate with significant peaks of H3K27ac and H3K4me3 in the same cell type from the ENCODE Consortium ChIP-seq data. We limited our analyses to the eight cell types present both in our dataset and the ENCODE Consortium: B cells, CD4 Single Positive T cells (CD4 SP), CD8 Single Positive T cells (CD8 SP), dendritic cells (DC), monocytes and macrophages (Mono/Macro), NK cells, Th17, and Treg.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 2G: binding of ETS1 is unconvincing. Were there statistically meaningful peaks called in these regions? It would be good to also show a metaplot/heatmap of ETS1 profile over all elements of relevant subfamilies. Showing histone marks on the genome browser snapshots would also be useful. Is there any transcriptional evidence that the specific Alus shown act as alternative promoters?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that the examples provided were not particularly convincing. Thus, we reanalyzed the data to determine if statistically significant ETS1 peaks (see the answer to Reviewer 2's comment #6 for details on the methods) located near gene transcription start sites overlapped with TEs. We thereby provided examples of significant ETS1 peaks overlapping TE sequences in the promoter region of two prototypical NK cell protein-coding genes (Figure 2h).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Why was -k 10 used with bowtie2? This will map the same read to multiple locations in the genome, increasing read density at more repetitive (younger) TEs. The authors should use either default settings, being clear about the outcome (random assignment of multimapping reads to one location), or use only uniquely aligned reads.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for their comment and agree that using the -k 10 parameter with bowtie2 was not optimal for TE analysis. To improve the strength of our analyses, we reanalyzed all ChIP-seq data of our manuscript (Figure 2g and h, Figure 5e and f) using the following strategy: alignment with bowtie2 using default parameters except –very-sensitive, multimapping read removal with samtools view -q 10, removal of duplicate reads with samtools markdup -r, peaks calling was performed with macs2 with the -m 5 50 parameter, and peaks overlapping ENCODE's blacklist regions were removed with bedtools intersect.</p>
<p>These new analyses strengthen our evidence that TEs interact with multiple genes that regulate thymic development and function. We updated the results sections concerning ChIP-seq data analyses and the Methods section to include this information:</p>
<p>&quot;ChIP-seq reads were aligned to the reference Homo sapiens genome (GRCh38) using bowtie2 (version 2.3.5) (10) with the --very-sensitive parameter. Multimapping reads were removed using the samtools view function with the -q 10 parameter, and duplicate reads were removed using the samtools markdup function with the -r parameter (11). Peak calling was performed with macs2 with the -m 5 50 parameter (12). Peaks overlapping with the ENCODE blacklist regions (13) were removed with bedtools intersect (14) with default parameters. Overlap of ETS1 peaks with TE sequences was determined using bedtools intersect with default parameters. BigWig files were generated using the bamCoverage function of deeptools2 (15), and genomic tracks were visualized in the USCS Genome Browser (16).&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Figure 1d needs a y axis scale. Could the authors also provide details of how the random distribution of TE expression was generated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the Reviewer that Figure 1d was incomplete and made the appropriate modifications. Regarding the random distribution, we reproduced our dataset containing the expression of 809 TE subfamilies in 18 cell populations. For each combination of TE subfamily and cell type, we randomly assigned an &quot;expression pattern&quot; as identified by the hierarchical clustering of Figure 1b. Then, we computed the maximal occurrence of an expression pattern across cell types for each TE subfamily to generate the distribution curve in Figure 1d. We added the following details to the Methods section to clarify how the random distribution was generated:</p>
<p>&quot;As a control, a random distribution of the expression of 809 TE subfamilies in 18 cell populations was generated. A cluster (cluster 1, 2, or 3) was randomly attributed for each combination of TE subfamily and cell type, and the maximal occurrence of a given cluster across cell types was then computed for each TE subfamily. Finally, the distributions of LINE, LTR, and SINE elements were compared to the random distribution with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The motif analysis requires a minimum of 1 locus from each TE subfamily containing it in order to be reported, but this seems like a really low threshold that will output a lot of noise. What is the rationale here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that this threshold might appear low. Nonetheless, these analyses ultimately aimed to identify TE promoter and enhancer candidates. Hence, we did not want to put an arbitrary threshold at a higher value (e.g., a certain number or percentage of all loci of a given TE subfamily), as this might create a bias based on the total number of loci of a given TE subfamily. Moreover, our rationale was that a TE locus might act as a promoter/enhancer even if it is the only locus of its subfamily containing a TF binding site.</p>
<p>Even though this strategy might have created some noise in the analyses of interactions between TFs and TEs of Figure 2 (panels a-e), we are confident that our bootstrap strategy efficiently removed low-quality identifications based on low correlations values or expression of TF and TE in low percentages of cells. Additionally, the subsequent analyses on TE promoter and enhancer candidates were performed exclusively for the TE loci containing TF binding sites to avoid adding noise to these analyses.</p>

<p>(9) Figure 4e: is this a log2 enrichment? If not, the enrichments for some of the gene sets are not so high.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The enrichment values represented in Figure 4e are not log-transformed. It is essential to highlight that gene set enrichment values were computed for each possible pair of thymic APCs (e.g., pDC vs. cDC1, pDC vs. mTEC(II), etc.), and the values represented in Figure 4e are an average of each comparison pictured at the bottom of the UpSet plot.</p>
<p>However, we agree with Reviewer 2 that the average enrichment value is not extremely high. We thus made the following modifications to the Results section (&quot;TE expression in human pDCs is associated with dsRNA structures&quot;) to better represent it:</p>
<p>&quot;Notably, thymic pDCs harbored moderate yet significant enrichment of gene signatures of RIG-I and MDA5-mediated IFN ɑ/β signaling compared to all other thymic APCs (Figure 4e and Supplementary file 1 – Table 8).&quot;</p>
