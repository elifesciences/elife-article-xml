<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Layer (L)1, beside receiving massive cortico-cortical, commissural and associational projections, is the termination zone of tufted dendrites of pyramidal neurons and the area of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike initiation. However, its synaptic organization in humans is not known. Quantitative 3D-models of excitatory synaptic boutons (SBs) in layer 1 of the human temporal lobe neocortex were generated from neocortical biopsy tissue using transmission electron microscopy, 3D-volume reconstructions and TEM tomography. Particularly, the size of active zones (AZs) and the readily releasable, recycling and resting pool of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were quantified.</p>
<p>The majority of excitatory SBs contained numerous mitochondria comprising ∼7% of the total volume, had a large macular, non-perforated AZ (∼0.20 µm<sup>2</sup>) and were predominantly located on dendritic spines. Excitatory SBs had a total pool of ∼3500 SVs, a relatively large readily releasable (∼4 SVs), recycling (∼470 SVs) and resting (∼2900 SVs) pool. Astrocytic coverage of excitatory SBs suggests both synaptic cross talk or removal of spilled glutamate by astrocytic processes at synaptic complexes.</p>
<p>The structural composition of SBs in L1 may underlie the function of L1 networks that mediate, integrate and synchronize contextual and cross-modal information, enabling flexible and state-dependent processing of feedforward sensory inputs from other layers of the cortical column.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mammalian neocortex is the most complex part of the brain comprising over 75% of the gray matter. One fundamental feature established during development is the formation of distinct layers with different networks of neurons, and its organization into vertically oriented slabs, so-called cortical columns (Marin-Padilla 1978, 1998; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Rockland and DeFelipe 2018</xref>). This organization is established in an ‘inside layers first-outside layers last’ fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Luskin and Shatz 1985a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">b</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cooper et al. 2008</xref>). The exception, beside layer (L)6 is L1 generated first originating from the marginal zone (Marin Padilla 1998; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bystron et al. 2008</xref>). Ongoing cortico- and synaptogenesis finally lead to the formation of the adult cortical network with its unique structural and functional properties (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lübke and Feldmeyer 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Rockland and DeFelipe 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Remarkably, L1 is highly conserved across cortical areas and higher mammalian species, but its importance was long underestimated. However, L1 is now considered as the predominant input layer for top-down information, relayed by a rich, dense network of cortico-cortical, cortico-thalamic, commissural and associational long-range axonal projections. In humans, and thus different to experimental animals, both L1 excitatory Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anstötz et al. 2014</xref>) and a quite heterogeneous population of inhibitory neurons (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jiang et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boldog et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Obermayer et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kwon et al. 2019</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Huang et al. 2024</xref>) provide signals to the terminal tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons of the underlying cortical layers. Thus, L1 is a central locus of neocortical associations controlled by distinct types of inhibition and feedforward excitation (Schumann et al. 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hartung and Letzkus 2021</xref>, reviewed by Schumann et al. 2021).</p>
<p>The temporal lobe neocortex (TLN) is situated on the basolateral aspect of the cerebral hemispheres primarily observed in higher primates, including humans. Notably, in humans, the TLN encompasses approximately 20% of the entire cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kiernan 2012</xref>). It is recognized as a highly specialized associative neocortex, characterized by its homotypic granular six-layered organization (von <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Economo and Koskinas 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Palomero-Gallagher and Zilles 2019</xref>). The human TLN plays a crucial role in various cognitive functions, including auditory, visual, vestibular, linguistic, and olfactory processing.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is intricately connected to diverse sensory and multimodal associational brain regions, such as the limbic system, amygdala, and various subcortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Insausti 2013</xref>). Lastly, the human TLN serves as the epicenter and onset site for temporal lobe epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allone et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Tai et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the most important discoveries in neuroscience, beside the definition of the neuron by Cajal’s neuronal doctrine (1911), was the introduction of the term ‘Synapse’, more than 100 years ago. Since then these structures have been investigated from different viewpoints including structural, functional, molecular and computational studies summarized in meanwhile thousands of original publications, reviews and numerous textbooks. Yet, the quantitative geometry of the most prevalent synapse in the brain, the cortical synapse, has remained largely unexplored structurally, in both experimental animals (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Rollenhagen et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bopp et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hsu et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Prume et al. 2020</xref>) and, even more so, in the context of the human brain (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dominguez-Alvaro et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">2021</xref>; Cano- Astorga et al. 2021, 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Shapson-Coe et al. 2024</xref>). This could be partially attributed to the availability of human brain tissue samples. Nevertheless, detailed and quantitative descriptions of synaptic complexes in L1 of the human brain are to date non-existing.</p>
<p>Here, an investigation into the synaptic organization of L1 in the human TLN was undertaken using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 3D-volume reconstruction, to generate quantitative 3D-models of synaptic boutons (SBs), and TEM tomography. The ultimate objective of this comprehensive project is to elucidate the synaptic organization, layer by layer, of the cortical column in humans.</p>
<p>Such meticulous quantitative structural analyses of SBs and their corresponding target structures are indispensable for comprehending, elucidating, and establishing connections between the structural and functional properties of the diverse signal cascades underlying synaptic transmission, efficacy, strength, and plasticity. Consequently, these efforts contribute significantly to the understanding of the computational properties of brain networks, in particular the synaptic organization of the cortical column.</p>

<title>Neural and synaptic composition of L1 in the human TLN</title>
<p>L1 in the adult mammalian neocortex represents a relatively cell sparse layer, that in humans can be subdivided into two sublaminae, L1a and L1b, as revealed in semithin sections (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and Golgi- preparations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, C, F, G</xref>), as well as at the EM level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H, I</xref>). L1a is more dominated by a dense network of astrocytes of different shape and size, their fine processes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), the occurrence of reactive microglia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H</xref>, I, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>) and terminal tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons throughout the neuropil of L1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H</xref>, I, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Hence, L1a can be described as a sublamina with a predominant proportion of astrocytes, microglia and their processes, although it also harbors numerous other structural elements such as terminal tuft dendrites and synaptic complexes. These complexes consist of a SB juxtaposed with either a dendritic shaft or spine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) directly beneath or interwoven among the fine astrocytic processes within L1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Lipofuscin granules, indicative of aging, were frequently noted in astrocytes, reactive microglia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and L1 neurons, although their abundance, size, and morphology varied considerably. Remarkably, and in contrast to rodents, a persistent subpopulation of excitatory CR-cells was found in humans, identifiable by the horizontal bipolar orientation with intralaminar long-range horizontal axonal collaterals with a transcolumnar projection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Retzius 1893</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">1894</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anstötz et al. 2014</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Martinez-Cerdeno and Noctor 2014</xref>). The majority were located directly underneath the pial surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F, G</xref>) or intermingled with a heterogeneous population of GABAergic interneurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In the human TLN, GABAergic interneurons constitute the predominant class of neurons in L1, exhibiting significant structural and functional heterogeneity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, E</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jiang et al, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Verhoog et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boldog et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Obermayer et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kwon et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Schuman et al. 2019</xref>, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Huang et al. 2024</xref>) which were found throughout both sublaminae and were sometimes organized in clusters of 3-6 neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Beside CR-cells and GABAergic interneurons, also degenerating neurons, identifiable by their shrunken and dark appearance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, I</xref>) were found in both sublaminae although their numbers varied substantially between brain tissue samples.</p>
<p>L1b is primarily dominated by dendritic and synaptic profiles due to a massive increase in synaptic complexes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H</xref>, 2B). Furthermore, L1b is infiltrated by apical dendrites of L2, L3 and L5 pyramidal neurons interspersed with smaller dendritic segments representing apical oblique dendrites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1I</xref>, 2B). The majority of synaptic complexes in L1 were axo-spinous (∼80%, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 B, D, E</xref>), the remainder were axo-dendritic, some of which but not all were regarded as putative GABAergic terminals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Silver et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>L1b can be separated from L2 by the sudden increase of neuronal cell bodies and thick apical dendrites originating at the upper pole of the somata of pyramidal neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref>, 2B). At the L1b and L2 transition more and more apical and apical oblique dendrites of different caliber were observable.</p>

<title>Synaptic organization of L1 in the human TLN</title>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to investigate the synaptic organization of excitatory SBs in L1 in the human TLN, focusing on synaptic parameters that represent possible morphological correlates of synaptic transmission, efficacy, strength and plasticity. The quantitative analysis was separated for both sublaminae to look for possible sublaminar-specific differences. Beside the overall geometry of SBs and the number and size of mitochondria, in particular the size of the PreAZ and PSD constituting the AZ, the morphological equivalent to a functional neurotransmitter release site, and the organization of the three functionally defined pools of SVs, namely the readily releasable (RRP), the recycling (RP) and resting pool, were quantified.</p>
<p>To achieve this, a total of 361 SBs was completely reconstructed out of four patients in six series containing 100-150 ultrathin sections/series. A total of 190 SBs and 184 AZs (L1a) and 171 SBs and 165 AZs (L1b) using neocortical access tissue (see Material and Methods; Source Data 02) were completely 3D- reconstructed and quantified using fine-scale TEM, digital TEM images and subsequent 3D-volume reconstructions.</p>
<p>Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic complexes in L1a und L1b were formed by either presynaptic <italic>en passant</italic> or endterminal boutons with their prospective postsynaptic target structures dendritic shafts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> C, D, 3A-C) or spines of different caliber and type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>, D, E, 3A-C). In both sublaminae, SBs were predominantly found on dendritic spines (∼81%; L1a) and ∼79% (L1b), the remainder were located on dendritic shafts. The majority of SBs on spines were located on mushroom spines (L1a: ∼83%, L1b: ∼73%), a smaller fraction on stubby spines (L1a: ∼11%, L1b: ∼9%) or on thin elongated spines (L1a: 6%, L1b: ∼22%; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), the remainder were not classifiable.</p>
<p>Since our focus was on excitatory SBs, inhibitory terminals were not further analyzed in detail. Inhibitory SBs were distinguished from excitatory SBs by their smaller SVs, which have a more spherical appearance, a smaller sized PreAZ, and the lack of a prominent PSD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Infrequently, GABAergic and glutamatergic terminals were found on the same dendrite (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>) or spine (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Wittner et al. 2001</xref>) but less frequently at ∼2-3%. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kwon et al. 2019</xref>). In turn, not all SBs located on dendritic shafts were GABAergic (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Silver et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The ratio between excitatory vs. inhibitory SBs was between 10-15% although with layer-specific differences. Our findings are in good agreement with recent publications by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Shapson-Coe et al. (2024)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cano-Astorga et al. (2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">2024</xref>) in which the number of inhibitory SBs in different layers of the temporal lobe neocortex was estimated to be10-15%. No significant differences were found in the content of inhibitory SBs between the two sublaminae L1a and L1b.</p>
<p>Some SBs in both sublaminae were seen to establish either two or three synapses on the same spine, spines of other origin, or dendritic shafts. Remarkably, ∼90% of spines in L1a and L1b contained a spine apparatus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), a specialized form of the endoplasmic reticulum, structures that increase spine motility and may also stabilize the synaptic complex during signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Deller et al. 2003</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Knott and Holtmaat 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Synaptic density in L1a and L1b of the human TLN</title>
<p>Synaptic density measurements serve as a valuable tool for quantitatively characterizing the synaptic organization of a specific cortical layer, assessing the connectivity rate, and identifying potential inter- individual differences among patients within the human TLN.</p>
<p>The average density of synaptic complexes in L1 was relatively high with a value of 5.26*10<sup>8</sup> ± 8.44*10<sup>7</sup>, 5.52*10<sup>8</sup> ± 1.25*10<sup>8</sup> synapses/mm<sup>3</sup> in L1a and 5.01*10<sup>8</sup> ± 1.40*10<sup>7</sup> synapses/mm<sup>3</sup> in L1b, ranging from 4.08*10<sup>8</sup> to 6.31*10<sup>8</sup> (L1a) and from 4.87*10<sup>8</sup> to 5.15*10<sup>8</sup> (L1b), respectively (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 1</xref>; Source Data 01). Strikingly, a huge inter-individual variability was found, although with no significant difference between L1a and L1b.</p>
<p>Therefore, L1 exhibited a relatively high density of synaptic complexes, indicating a relatively robust and thus strong connectivity of neurons within L1 of the human TLN.</p>

<p>Mitochondria play a pivotal role in synaptic transmission and plasticity (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dallerac et al. 2018</xref>; see also Discussion). In L1 SBs either no (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>, 3A, E) or several mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>, 3C, D; range 0 to 8) of different shape and size were observed. When present, mitochondria had a volume of 0.04 ± 0.02 µm<sup>3</sup> in L1a and 0.05 ± 0.01 µm<sup>3</sup> in L1b, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02). Mitochondria contributed with ∼7% (L1) to the total bouton volume of SBs, similar to values in L6 (∼6%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>), but with a ∼1.5-fold lower percentage as those in L5 (∼12%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>) and L4 (∼13%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Yakoubi et al. 2019b</xref>).</p>

<title>Structural composition of AZs in L1a and L1b excitatory SBs in the human TLN</title>
<p>The number, size, and shape of the AZ, composed of the PreAZ and PSD, is one key structural determinant in synaptic transmission and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Südhof 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Matz et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Holderith et al. 2012</xref>) as it represents the docking area of SVs (PreAZs) and the receiving area of neurotransmitter quanta at the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Südhof 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority (∼98%) of SBs in L1a and L1b had only a single (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C-E</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A-C, E</xref>) at most two or three AZs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Beside very large, spanning the entire pre- and postsynaptic apposition zone, also smaller AZs covering only a fraction of the pre- and postsynaptic apposition zone were found.</p>
<p>On average, PreAZs were 0.18 ± 0.08 µm<sup>2</sup> in surface area in L1a and 0.22 ± 0.04 µm<sup>2</sup> in L1b with only a slight variability between both sublaminae. The surface area of PSDs was quite similar to that of PreAZs 0.21 ± 0.01 µm<sup>2</sup> and was in L1a and 0.22 ± 0.05 µm<sup>2</sup> in L1b, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02, sheet 01). Thus, the similar size of the PreAZ and PSD showed a nearly perfect overlap at the pre- and postsynaptic apposition zone. L1 AZs did not show a large variability in size as indicated by the low SD, CV, and variance (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Remarkably, AZs exhibited a wide range of shapes in addition to different sizes. Two types of AZs were found: The majority in L1 (∼80%) were of the macular and non-perforated type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), the remainder being either horseshoe-shaped or ring-like and perforated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, our analysis revealed only a weak correlation between the surface area of SBs and that of PreAZs for L1a and L1b SBs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). These findings imply that the size of SBs and PreAZs is regulated independently .</p>
<p>The size of the synaptic cleft (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02, sheet 03) is an important measure at AZs since its size (diameter) critically determines the temporal and spatial neurotransmitter concentration. Measurements of the size of the synaptic cleft were performed on random EM images taken from the series using OpenCAR or online directly at the TEM using ImageSP (Fa. Tröndle, Moorenweis, Germany). Only synaptic clefts cut perpendicular to the PreAZ and PSD were included in the sample. The distance between the outer edge of the PreAZ and PSD was measured at the two lateral edges and separately at the central region of the synaptic cleft; the two values of the lateral edges were averaged for each cleft measurement.</p>
<p>Finally, a mean ± SD was calculated for both the lateral and central region over all synaptic clefts analyzed per patient.</p>
<p>The size of the synaptic cleft did not differ significantly between the two sublaminae and was similar to the results in L4, L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">b</xref>) and L6.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Organization of the pools of SVs in L1a and L1b excitatory SBs of the human TLN</title>
<p>SVs are the other key structure in neurotransmitter storage and release, hence they play a fundamental role in synaptic transmission and in the modulation of short- and long-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Südhof 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">2012</xref>). Three different pools of SVs are functionally defined: the RRP, the RP, and the resting pool. Synaptic efficacy, strength, mode, and probability of release (<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>) are regulated by these pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Schikorski and Stevens 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Silver et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Rizzoli and Betz 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Saviane and Silver 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Schikorski 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Watanabe et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Neher 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Vaden et al. 2019</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Rizzoli and Betz 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Denker and Rizzoli 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chamberland and Toth 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, SVs were distributed throughout the entire terminal in ∼95% of the population of SBs investigated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, 3), the remainder showed a more cluster-like distribution. Two different types of vesicles were found: (1) Small clear SVs with an average diameter of 25.03 ± 5.27 nm ranging up to ∼40 nm (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02, sheet 01). Using TEM tomography, the SV diameter was on average 30.29 ± 4.67 nm ranging up to ∼47 nm (n = 38 SBs with a total of 5.834 SVs; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 03, sheet 05). (2) DCVs (Dense Core Vesicles; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C, E</xref>; Source Data 02, sheet 01) with an average diameter of 57.97 ± 6.45 nm with no significant difference between both sublaminae. DCVs were intermingled with the population of SVs throughout the entire SB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C, E</xref>). DCVs play an important role in endo- and exocytosis by releasing various co-transmitters, such as neuropeptides, ATP, noradrenalin, and dynorphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ghijsen and Leenders 2005</xref>) or in synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Sorra et al. 2006</xref>) and the build-up of PreAZs by releasing Piccolo and Bassoon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">Zhai et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Shapira et al. 2003</xref>). In addition, they are involved in clustering SVs at the PreAZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Mukherjee et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Watanabe et al. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The distribution pattern of SVs made it impossible to morphologically distinguish between the three functionally defined pools of SVs, with the exception of the so-called ‘docked’ ones, that are fused to the PreAZ, and the omega-shaped bodies, that have already opened and released quanta of neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Rizzoli and Betz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Denker and Rizzoli 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Neher 2015</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Rizzoli and Betz 2005</xref>; Chamberland and Toth 2015). However, an attempt was made to define a morphological correlate for the three functionally defined pools.</p>
<p>For this purpose, a perimeter analysis (a modified Sholl-analysis) of each SV in individual SBs was carried out. The perimeter was defined as the minimum distance between each SV membrane and the PreAZ membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sätzler et al. 2002</xref>; for criteria to define SV pools see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Rizzoli and Betz 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Denker and Rizzoli 2010</xref>). The putative RRP was defined as a perimeter (p) p≤10 nm and p≤20 nm to the PreAZ. These criteria for the RRP from which SVs could be easily and rapidly recruited were chosen because both values are less than a SV diameter apart from the PreAZ. The putative RP maintains release during moderate stimulation and was classified at a distance from the PreAZ between p60-p200 nm. All SVs that were further than 200 nm from the PreAZ were regarded to constitute the putative resting pool which acts as a deposit of SVs only used by intense and/or repetitive stimulation.</p>
<p>On average, the total pool of SVs was 2958.62 ± 1940.51 in L1a vs. 3903.32 ± 1852.23 in L1b with an average of 3430.97 ± 1773.77 for L1 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02). Remarkably, the total pool in L1b was significantly larger (p≤0.01) by ∼1.3-fold when compared to L1a. In both sublaminae (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D, E</xref>), there is a huge variability in total pool size , ranging from 758 to 6542 in L1a and 1507 to 15060 in L1b, as indicated by the SD, IQR and variance (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). SVs contributed with ∼5% (0.03 µm<sup>3</sup>) in L1a and ∼4% (0.02 µm<sup>3</sup>) in L1b to the total volume of SBs. However, no significant difference between both sublaminae was observed (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02).</p>
<p>Interestingly, no correlation between the volume of SBs vs. the total pool size was found for L1a (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.2490), but a good correlation for L1b (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.5700). Furthermore, no correlation was found between the PreAZ vs. the total pool size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; Source Data 02).</p>
<p>The average number of SVs in the putative RRP/PreAZ for L1was 3.60 ± 4.24 SVs at p10 nm (L1a: 5.90 ± 5.05 SVs and L1b: 1.29 ± 1.87 SVs) with a significant difference (p ≤ 0.01) by ∼4.5-fold between the two sublaminae (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02). The putative RRP/PreAZ at the p20 nm criterion was on average 19.05 ±17.23 SVs (L1a: 25.04 ± 21.09 SVs and L1b: 13.07 ± 13.87 SVs) and thus nearly 2-fold larger for L1a, although with a huge variability, but even though may point to sublaminae-specific differences in <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, synaptic efficacy, strength and paired-pulse behavior at individual SBs.</p>
<p>No correlation between the putative RRP at both the p10 nm and p20 nm criterion and the surface area of PreAZs was found for both sublaminae. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E</xref>).</p>
<p>The putative RP/PreAZ at the 60-200 nm perimeter criterion was 390.12 ± 286.89 SVs in L1a and 535.88 ± 321.16 in L1b with no significant difference between both sublaminae (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02, sheet 01). It should be noted however, that the variability of the putative RP is relatively large in both sublaminae as indicated by the SD, median, IQR and variance (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Again, no correlation was observed between the SVs in the putative p60-200 nm RP and the surface area of the PreAZs in both L1a (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and L1b (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>; Source Data 02, sheet 01).</p>
<p>The putative resting pool of SVs contained on average 2515.02 ± 1588.99 SVs in L1a and 3277.97 ± 1480.96 SVs in L1b with a significant difference between the two sublaminae (p ≤ 0.01, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02, sheet 01).

<title>TEM tomography of L1 excitatory SBs in the human TLN</title>
<p>It is still controversially discussed whether so-called ‘docked’ SVs or omega-shaped bodies represent the RRP. To compare our results from the perimeter analysis for the p10 nm RRP with that of ‘docked’ SVs, high-resolution TEM tomography was carried out. Only SBs where the AZ could be followed from its beginning to its end in individual tilt-series and where the AZ was cut perpendicular through the PreAZ, PSD and the synaptic cleft were analyzed. In L1a (50 SBs, on dendritic shafts = 25 SBs; on spines = 25 SBs) and L1b (50 SBs, on dendritic shafts = 25 SBs; on spines = 25 SBs) the number of ‘docked’ SVs was analyzed at the PreAZ (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; Source Data 03).</p>

<p>The results for L1a and L1b were two-fold: First, in agreement with already published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>) only in a minority (&lt;1%) of all PreAZs analyzed, regardless of their target structures, a dendritic shaft (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) or spine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, C</xref>), no ‘docked’ SVs were observed, which is in contrast to our perimeter analyses showing several boutons without vesicles within the p10 nm criterion. Second, the majority of PreAZs (∼98%) contained more than 2, the most 8 (L1a) and 6 (L1b) ‘docked’ SVs. This finding strongly supports multivesicular release of ‘docked’ SVs in L1a and L1b SBs in line with findings in L4, L5 and L6 SBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>; see also <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-F</xref>).</p>
<p>On average, 3.71 ± 1.38 ‘docked’ SVs (L1a) and 3.42 ± 1.34 ‘docked SVs’ (L1b) were found at individual PreAZs with similar values for both sublaminae. Furthermore, no significant difference was found for ‘docked’ SVs between shaft vs. spine synapses in L1. The number of ‘docked’ SVs at L1a PreAZs was ∼2-fold smaller but nearly 3-fold larger in L1b when compared to the results of our quantitative perimeter analysis for the putative RRP using the p10 nm criterion. In contrast to the p10 nm criterion with high inter- and intra-individual variabilities (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>), the number of ‘docked’ SVs showed a relatively low variability as indicated by the SD, CV, variance, and skewness. They were different (p ≤ 0.001) from the values estimated with the p10 nm perimeter analysis.</p>
<p>There seems to be a tendency that larger PreAZs contained more ‘docked’ SVs providing a larger ‘docking’ area allowing the recruitment of more SVs.</p>
<p>In summary, a notable disparity difference was observed between values obtained for L1 using the p10 nm criterion of the perimeter- and the TEM tomography analysis. Additionally, the putative RRP in L1 (this study) and L6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>) was ∼2-4-times smaller when compared to values in L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Yakoubi et al. 2019b</xref>) and L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>) pointing towards a layer-specific regulation of the putative RRP. Moreover, the results suggest that not only ‘docked’ SVs but also those very close to the PreAZ should be considered to belong to the putative RRP.</p>

<title>Astrocytic coverage of L1 SBs in the human TLN</title>
<p>Astrocytes, by directly interacting with synaptic complexes thus forming the ‘tripartite’ synapse play a pivotal role in the induction, maintenance and termination of synaptic transmission by controlling the spatial and temporal concentration of neurotransmitter quanta in the synaptic cleft (reviewed by Dellerac et al. 2018). Astrocytic profiles were identified by their irregular stellate shape, relatively clear cytoplasm, numerous glycogen granules and bundles of intermediate filaments (for criteria see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Peters et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Ventura and Harris 1999</xref>; see also <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>). Astrocytes and their fine processes formed a relatively dense network in L4 and L5, but a comparably loose one within the neuropil in L1, as determined by measuring the volume content of astrocytic processes. Astrocytic processes in L1 contributed ∼20% to the total human TLN volume which is similar to findings in L6 of the human TLN. The highest degree (∼70%) of astrocytic processes was measured in L4 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>; Source Data 04, sheet 01, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>A second, more detailed measurement (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; source data 04, sheet 02), in which the percentage of AZs covered by astrocytes was analyzed, demonstrated 1) that in L1, the majority of spine and shaft synapses were not (∼70%) or only partially (∼20%) covered by fine astrocytic processes; 2) only in a small proportion (∼10%) of both spine and shaft synapses fine astrocytic processes forming a ‘tripartite’ synapse physically isolating the synaptic complexes from the surrounding neuropil were observed; 3) the results in L1 (L1a: n = 3 patients, n = 128 spine synapses, n = 48 shaft synapses; L1b: n = 3 patients, n = 126 spine synapses, n = 44 shaft synapses) are in contrast to those in L4 (n = 5 patients; n = 93 spine synapses, n = 41 shaft synapses). In L4, a much higher number of ‘tripartite’ synaptic complexes (spines: ∼50%; shafts: ∼20%) was found. In this layer, ∼25% of the AZs on dendritic spines and ∼60% on dendritic shafts were partially covered, with large inter-individual differences. Approximately 20% of both the spine and shaft synapses were not covered; 4) no significant differences between spine and shaft synapses were found in either L1 or L4.</p>
<p>In summary, it is most likely that the partial coverage or complete absence of fine astrocytic processes at the majority of synaptic complexes in L1 of the human TLN may contribute to different ‘behaviors’ of synaptic complexes in synaptic transmission and in the modulation of short-term plasticity, for example in the removal of ‘spilled’ horizontally diffusing neurotransmitter quanta favoring synaptic crosstalk (for more detail see Discussion).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated the synaptic organization of L1 in the human TLN. In addition to similarities, the quantitative 3D models of the analyzed excitatory SBs showed significant layer-specific differences in structural and synaptic parameters, in particular in the size of AZs and the total pool of SVs, the putative RRP, RP, and resting pool compared to other previously studied layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">b</xref>; Schmuhl- Giesen et al. 2022). The low degree of astrocytic coverage of L1 SBs suggests that glutamate spillover, and as a consequence synaptic cross talk, may occur at most synaptic complexes in L1.</p>

<title>Synaptic density measurements</title>
<p>Synaptic density measurements are a useful tool to describe the synaptic organization of a particular area, nuclei and even layers in different brain regions, but also the degree of connectivity underlying the computational properties of a given brain area or in a given brain network. Meanwhile numerous studies in various animal species and brain regions have performed such an analysis but data for a density of synaptic complexes in humans are still rare (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Marco and DeFelipe 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Tang et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">DeFelipe et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alonso-Nanclares et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blazquez-Llorca et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Finnema et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cano-Astorga et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Strikingly, a huge layer-specific difference in the mean density of synaptic contacts was found in the human TLN (see also <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). In L1, the overall density was 5.26*10<sup>8</sup> ± 8.44*10<sup>7</sup> synaptic complexes/mm<sup>3</sup> although a great variability was observed as indicated by the SD consistent with findings in the other layers of the human TLN L4 (2.37*10<sup>6</sup> ± 2.19*10<sup>6</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Yakoubi et al. 2019b</xref>); L5 (3.89 *10<sup>8</sup> ± 9.12*10<sup>8</sup>; Yakoubi R., PhD Thesis 2023) and L6 (4.98*10<sup>7</sup> ± 1.85*10<sup>7</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>) and existing data published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alonso-Nanclares et al. 2008</xref>: 9.13 ± 0.63*10<sup>8</sup> and Tang et al. 2001: 164*10<sup>12</sup>. The density values for L1 and L5 are in the same order of magnitude but differ substantially from L4 and L6 by one or two orders of magnitude. The huge differences in synaptic density may be explained by gender and age-specific differences and the use of different methods in estimating synaptic densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">DeFelipe et al. 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, the highest synaptic density was observed in L1, indicating a relatively high level of connectivity and synaptic interaction. This may suggests that L1 facilitates rapid information processing due to its robust synaptic activity.</p>

<p>The surface area of AZs in L1 SBs of the human TLN was on average ∼0.20 μm<sup>2</sup>. This is in good agreement with data obtained for AZs in L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cano-Astorga et al. 2021</xref>), L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Yakoubi et al. 2019b</xref>), L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>), L6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>) and in L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cano-Astorga et al. 2023</xref>) of the human temporal and cingulate neocortex.

<p>The substantial variability in the size of AZs at individual SBs, observed both in the human TLN and in experimental animals, likely contributes to differences in synaptic efficacy, strength, <italic>Pr</italic>, quantal size, as well as the size of the RRP and RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Südhof 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Matz et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Freche et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Holderith et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Neher 2015</xref>; Chamerland and Toth 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Rollenhagen et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Vaden et al. 2019</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Rizzoli and Betz 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Denker and Rizzoli 2010</xref>).

<p>It has be postulated that perforated AZs contribute to synaptic efficacy (Geinismann et al. 1992; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nava et al. 2014</xref>) by an increased number of SVs at perforated synapses and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buchs and Muller 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Desmond and Weinberg; 1998</xref>) and by increasing the number of AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors at perforated synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ganeshina et al. 2004</xref>). However, since the number of perforated AZs in all layers of the human TLN is relatively low compared to those of the macular-non-perforated type, it is highly speculative which impact they might have here on synaptic efficacy and the modulation of synaptic plasticity.</p>

<title>Size of the three pools of SVs</title>
<p>Besides the size of the PreAZ, the pool of rapidly releasable SVs also critically determines <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> and thus synaptic efficacy, strength and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Rosenmund and Stevens 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Schikorski and Stevens 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Rizzoli and Betz 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Schikorski 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Watanabe et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Vaden et al. 2019</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Rizzoli and Betz 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Neher 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chamberland and Toth 2016</xref>). It is still rather unclear whether functionally heterogeneous SV pools are structurally identifiable and thus support diverse forms of synaptic transmission und would also play a pivotal role in long- and short-term plasticity. Synaptic transmission can be modulated in various ways depending on the availability of SVs and on their recycling rates. Hence, the size of both the RRP and RP critically determines synaptic efficacy, strength and plasticity. These parameters are controlled at the PreAZ but vary substantially across various CNS synapses (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Rizzoli and Betz 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Neher 2015</xref>). The contribution of the RRP size to synaptic dynamics and the mechanisms by which such control is achieved at individual SBs remains largely unknown.</p>
<p>L1-SBs had a total pool size of ∼3500 SVs/AZ, larger than in other layers of the human TLN: ∼2-fold in L4 (∼1800 SVs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Yakoubi et al. 2019b</xref>), ∼2.6-fold in L5 (∼1350 SVs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>) and ∼3-fold in L6 (∼1150 SVs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>). Remarkably, the total pool sizes in L4 and L5 of the human TLN were significantly larger than those in L4 (∼550 SVs/AZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Rollenhagen et al. 2015</xref>) and L5 (∼750 SVs/AZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Rollenhagen et al. 2018</xref>) of the rat somatosensory cortex.</p>
<p>The largest total pool size in L1 may point to a pivotal role in the rapid replenishment after depletion by high-frequency stimulation and the transfer of SVs into the RRP and RP from the total pool in L1 SBs.</p>
<p>The putative RRP at L1 PreAZs was on average ∼4 SVs/AZ for the p10 nm RRP and similar to that in L5 (∼5 SVs/AZ), but significantly smaller by ∼5.3-fold to that of L4 (∼20 SVs/AZ) and by ∼3.5-fold when compared to L6 in the human TLN. Also, huge differences were observed in the putative p20 nm RRP which at L1 PreAZs was ∼20 SVs, ∼40 SVs in L4, ∼15 SVs in L5 and ∼30 SVs in L6, respectively. It has to be noted that a layer-specific difference in both the putative p10 nm and p20 nm RRP exists although a huge variability was observed as indicated by the SD, IQR, and variance. Hence, at L1 PreAZs the overall RRP, taken the p10 nm and p20 nm criterion (both together are less than a vesicle diameter) was constituted by ∼25 SVs rapidly available SVs that may partially contribute to the efficacy, strength and reliability of synaptic transmission, but also in the modulation of short-term synaptic plasticity in L1.</p>
<p>The size of the putative RP/PreAZ was ∼470 SVs in human L1 SBs and thus ∼3-fold larger to that in L6 SBs, ∼1.3- fold larger than in L4, and ∼2.4-fold larger than in L5 SBs of the human TLN. In the rodent neocortex the RP/PreAZ comprised ∼130 (L4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Rollenhagen et al. 2015</xref>) and ∼200 SVs (L5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Rollenhagen et al. 2018</xref>). The comparably largest size of the RP in L1 when compared with values for the other cortical layers in the human TLN and to that found for L4 and L5 in rodents may also point to a rapid availability of SVs from the putative RP after the replenishment of the putative RRP during high-frequency stimulation. If the refilling rates were activity dependent, the large size of the RP at L1 PreAZs could explain some forms of short-term synaptic plasticity, e.g. a substantial increase in synaptic strength during frequency facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation at these SBs.</p>
<p>Finally, the putative resting pool of SVs at L1 PreAZs in the human TLN is also relatively large (∼3000 SVs) and again the largest when compared with other layers in the human TLN (L4 and L5: ∼1250 SVs; L6: ∼900 SVs). The size of the resting pool may guarantee to rapidly replenish the RRP and RP after repetitive high-frequency stimulation via active transfer of SVs with the help of mitochondria associated with the pool of SVs (this study, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Zhou and Fuster 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Verstreken et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Smith et al. 2016</xref>). The notable disparities in AZ and SV pool sizes among individual SBs may contribute to rapid alterations in the computational properties of single neurons or networks. Consequently, these variations in AZ and SV pool sizes at L1 SBs may critically influence the behavior of SBs during so-called Up-and-Down states as described for other SBs of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Zhou and Fuster 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Sakata and Harris 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Testa-Silva et al. 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>Importance of presynaptic mitochondria in synaptic transmission</title>
<p>Mitochondria in the cortical layers of the human TLN were organized in clusters associated with the pool of SVs (this study, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>). In L1, mitochondria only contribute by about 7.2% (L1a) and 6.7% (L1b) to the total SB volume with similar values between L1 and L6, but their percentage was ∼2-fold lower than values in L4 and L5 suggesting a layer-specific distribution of mitochondria in the human TLN.</p>
<p>Mitochondria play a pivotal role in the recruitment and mobilization of SVs from the RP and resting pool and in the priming and docking process of SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Verstreken et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Perkins et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Smith et al. 2016</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dallerac et al. 2018</xref>).

<title>Astrocytic coverage of L1 SBS in the human TLN</title>
<p>It is widely recognized that astrocytes play a crucial role in the formation of the ‘tripartite’ synapse, which is a common characteristic of cortical synapses. Astrocytes serve both as a physical barrier to glutamate diffusion and to mediate neurotransmitter uptake via transporters, thereby regulating the spatial and temporal concentration of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Oliet et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Min and Nevian 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Pannasch et al. 2014</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dallerac et al. 2018</xref>). In addition, they modulate synaptic transmission by activating pre- and postsynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Haydon and Carmignoto 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Le Meur et al. 2012</xref>). Moreover, it was found that the control of timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) at neocortical synapses is critically influenced by astrocytes by increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during the induction of t-LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Min and Nevian 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Remarkably, significant layer-specific differences exist in the astrocytic coverage of synaptic complexes in the human TLN. Whereas in L4 and L5 ∼60-80% of the total volumetric fraction was occupied by astrocytic processes and most of AZs in L4 were tightly ensheathed by fine astrocytic processes, in L1 and L6 the volumetric fraction of astrocytic processes was only ∼20% with a loose and incomplete coverage of AZs in L1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). As a consequence, the lack or only incomplete astrocytic coverage of synaptic complexes in L1 can only partially act as a physical barrier to neurotransmitter diffusion. In addition, beside a vertical also its horizontal diffusion of glutamate at the synaptic cleft is possible. Hence, two possible scenarios for the role of astrocytes are present at L1 synaptic complexes. First, as shown for only a small part (10%) of synaptic complexes in L1 the ‘tripartite’ synapse is realized at both sides of the synaptic cleft (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). This would allow the selective uptake of horizontally diffusing glutamate via glutamate transporters located in the fine astrocytic processes. This prevents ‘glutamate spillover’, and thus allow a vertically directed neurotransmitter diffusion and docking to postsynaptic receptors at the PSD.</p>
<p>The remaining larger part of synaptic complexes in L1 either lack a coverage by fine astrocytic processes at AZs or are only partially ensheathed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Here ‘glutamate spillover’ of horizontally diffusing neurotransmitter quanta is most likely and thus synaptic crosstalk between neighboring synaptic complexes at AZs in neighboring spines on terminal tuft dendrites because spine density in L1 is high. This may cause a switch from asynchronous to synchronous release from neighboring synaptic complexes upon repetitive low- and high-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">von Gersdorff and Borst 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, two distinct structural scenarios were identified regarding the role of astrocytes in L1, However, it is still rather unknown which of the two scenarios contribute more efficiently to synaptic transmission and plasticity in L1.</p>

<title>The role of L1 in the information processing of the cortical column</title>
<p>The computational properties of the neocortex depend upon its ability to integrate the information provided by the sensory organs (bottom-up information) with internally generated signals such as expectations or attentional signals (top-down information). This integration occurs at apical tuft dendrites of L2/3 and L5 pyramidal neurons in L1. Importantly, L1 is the predominant input layer for top-down information, relayed by a rich, dense network of cortico-cortical, commissural and associational long-range axonal projections. In experimental animals, L1 consists exclusively of a heterogeneous population of GABAergic interneurons providing feedforward and feedback inhibition (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jiang et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boldog et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Obermayer et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kwon et al. 2019</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Huang et al. 2024</xref>) providing signals to the terminal tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons (reviewed by Schumann et al. 2021). In humans, there is a persistent subpopulation of CR cells that provides excitation due to their long-range transcolumnar axonal projection to the terminal tuft dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anstötz et al. 2014</xref>), but may also control the population of GABAergic interneurons, which is as to date unknown.</p>
<p>Thus, L1 in the human neocortex is a central locus of neocortical associations controlled by excitation and distinct types of inhibition (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hartung and Letzkus 2021</xref>; Schumann et al. 2021). In summary, the population of GABAergic interneurons in L1 provides inhibition and disinhibition to pyramidal terminal tuft dendrites by either shunting or promoting the generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Na<sup>+</sup>-spikes by temporal and spatial coincidence detection. Thus, the circuitry of L1, including the persistent subpopulation of excitatory CR- cells; is an important and fundamental ‘integrator’ of the neocortex sampling bottom-up information within or even across cortical columns, but also act as a ‘filter’ or ‘discriminator’ but also as an ‘amplifier’ in the information processing of the neocortex.</p>
<p>Hence, L1 of the neocortex can be regarded as a complex and intricate layer of the brain serving different functions, for example to gate inputs, convey expectations and context as well as mediate states of consciousness, attention, cross-modal interactions, sensory perception, and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bastos et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Heeger 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">Zagha 2020</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gilbert and Li 2013</xref>). There is evidence that L1 processing, particularly Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the distal apical dendrite, is important for sensory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Xu et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies have revealed that L1 plays a crucial role in top-down attentional processes, aiding in directing attention, based on our goals and intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hartung and Letzkus 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Schuman et al. 2021</xref>). Additionally, L1 is implicated in the formation and consolidation of long-term memories with disruptions in L1 function associated with memory deficits. Furthermore, L1 contributes to brain plasticity, which involves the brain’s ability to change and adapt in response to experience, including the process by which synapses alter in strength and number (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hartung and Letzkus 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Schuman et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, L1 of the neocortex is a complex and fascinating layer of the brain that is involved in a wide range of cognitive processes and brain plasticity. Since this is relayed by a network of SBs in L1, their composition and connections play a pivotal role, in columnar information processing.</p>

All subsequent experimental procedures were approved by the Research Committee of the Research Centre Jülich GmbH.</p>

<title>Fixation and tissue processing for TEM</title>
<p>Tissue samples from the human TLN were after their removal prepared and embedded for conventional TEM and EM tomography analysis. All neocortical access tissues were obtained from patients suffering from drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (1 male and 3 female, 24-65 years in age for L1, and additionally 2 male, and 3 female, 25-63 in age for L4; see also <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The pre-surgical work-up comprised high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging together with long-term video-electro-encephalography (EEG)-monitoring and electrophysiology using multiple electrode recordings. In all cases, the circumscribed epileptic focus was in the hippocampus proper, but not in the neocortical access regions of the TL.</p>
<p>During epilepsy surgery, blocks of both non-affected, non-epileptic and epileptic neocortical access tissue samples (see <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 2</xref>) were resected and part of the tissue samples were further histologically examined by neuropathologists. The non-affected non-epileptic neocortical access tissue samples were always taken far from the epileptic focus and may thus be regarded as non-epileptic as also demonstrated by functional studies using the same experimental approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Mohan et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Molnár et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Seeman et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Obermayer et al. 2018</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mansvelder et al. 2019</xref>). These studies have clearly demonstrated that neocortical access tissue samples taken from epilepsy surgery do not differ in electrophysiological properties and synaptic physiology when compared with acute slice preparations in experimental animals.</p>
<p>So-called ‘post mortem’ tissue was not used in this study since the ultrastructural quality (preservation) of such material is not suitable enough for fine-scale high-resolution EM, due to severe distortions of relevant structural features, e.g. fragmentation and lysis of membranes of SBs, PreAZs, PSDs and SVs that are required for the generation of quantitative 3D-models of SBs and their target structures (Lübke, personal observation). However, under certain conditions also ‘post mortem’ tissue samples can be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dominguez-Alvaro et al. 2019</xref>, 2921; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cano-Astorga et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">2023</xref>).</p>

<p>For the study of L1 in the human TLN, blocks of neocortical access tissue were sampled from the temporo-lateral or temporo-basal regions of the inferior temporal gyrus and the gyrus medialis. Immediately after their removal during epilepsy surgery, biopsy samples of the TLN were immersion-fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde diluted in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4) for 24-72 hrs at 4°C. The fixative was replaced by fresh fixative after 2 hrs and changed twice during the subsequent fixation period. Prior to vibratome sectioning, brain tissue samples were thoroughly rinsed in ice-cold PB and afterwards embedded in 5% Agar-Agar (Sigma, Munich, Germany) diluted in PB.</p>
<p>Neocortical tissue blocks were cut in the coronal plane through the TLN with a Vibratome VT 1000S (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) into 150-200 µm thick sections, collected in ice-cold PB, and washed again several times in PB. Afterwards they were transferred to 0.5-1% PB-sucrose buffered Osmium tetroxide (OsO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mOsm, pH 7.4; Sigma, Munich, Germany) for 60-90 min. After visual inspection to check for the quality of post-fixation, sections were thoroughly washed several times in PB and left overnight at 4°C in PB. The next day they were dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol starting at 20%, 30%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% to absolute ethanol (15 min for each step and absolute ethanol, 30 min twice), followed by a brief incubation in propylene oxide (2 min twice; Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany). Sections were then transferred into a mixture of propylene oxide and Durcupan<sup>TM</sup> resin (2:1, 1:1 for 1h each; Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany) and stored overnight in pure resin. The next day, sections were flat embedded on coated glass slides in fresh Durcupan<sup>TM</sup>, coverslipped with Acla<sup>TM</sup> foils and polymerized at 60°C for 2 days.</p>

<title>Semi- and ultrathin sectioning</title>
<p>After light microscopic (LM) inspection, a tissue block containing the region of interest (ROI) was glued on a pre-polymerized block and trimmed down. Semithin sections were cut with a Leica UltracutS ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria), with a Histo-Diamond knife (Fa. Diatome, Nidau, Switzerland). Afterwards they were briefly stained with methylene-blue (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) to identify the cortical layers, particularly L1 and underlying L2, examined and documented using a motorized Olympus BX61 microscope equipped with the Olympus CellSense analysis hard- and software (Olympus GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). All images were stored in a database until further use.</p>
<p>After further trimming of the block to its final size, serial ultrathin sections (50 ± 5 nm thickness; silver to silver gray interference contrast) were cut with a Leica UltracutS ultramicrotome through the determined ROI of L1a and L1b, respectively. Ultrathin sections in serial sequence were collected on pioloform-coated slot copper grids (Plano, Wetzlar, Germany). Prior to EM examination, sections were stained with 5% aqueous uranyl acetate or Uranyless (Science Services, Munich, Germany) for 15–20 min and lead citrate for 3–5 min according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Reynolds (1963)</xref> to enhance the contrast of biological membranes at the EM level.

<title>3D-volume reconstructions and quantitative analysis of SBs</title>
<p>EM panorama images composing each series were imported, stacked, and aligned in the reconstruction software OpenCAR (Contour Alignment Reconstruction; for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sätzler et al. 2002</xref>). The main goal of this study was to quantify several structural and synaptic parameters representing structural correlates of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Excitatory SBs were characterized by large round SVs and prominent PreAZs and PSDs in contrast to putative GABAergic terminals that have smaller, more oval-shaped SVs, and a thin or no PSDs.</p>
<p>The following structural parameters were analyzed in randomly selected excitatory SBs: (1) surface area and volume of SBs; (2) volume of mitochondria; (3) surface area of PreAZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Dufour et al. 2016</xref>) and PSDs; two apposed membrane specializations separated by the synaptic cleft; (4) number and diameter of clear SVs and dense-core vesicles (DCVs); and (5) distance of individual SVs from the PreAZ for the structural definition of the RRP, RP, and resting pool. 3D-volume reconstructions were generated by drawing contour lines on the structures of interest in each panorama image within a series of images until a given structure was completed. Presynaptic SBs, their mitochondria as well as their postsynaptic target structures were outlined on the outer edge of their membranes, using closed contour lines throughout the entire stack within a series. A SB was considered completely captured, when it was possible to follow the axon in both directions through the entire series (<italic>en passant</italic> SBs) or the enlargement of the axon leading to an endterminal SB. The beginning of a synaptic terminal was defined by the typical widening of the axon and the abrupt occurrence of a pool of SVs.</p>
<p>The PreAZs and PSDs were regarded as complete when their perimeters were entirely reconstructed in a series of ultrathin sections. The surface areas of the PreAZ and PSD were computed separately by first generating a 3D surface model of the SB. The PreAZ was then measured by extracting this area from the reconstructed presynaptic bouton membrane that was covered by this membrane specialization. Hence, the length (L) of the PreAZ (L PreAZ) and the surface area (SA) of the PreAZ (SA PreAZ) is already known. The size of the PSD opposing the PreAZ was estimated under the following assumptions: (1) both membrane specializations, PreAZ and PSD run parallel to each other at the pre- and postsynaptic apposition zone; (2) for both membrane specializations a contour line was drawn determining their actual length (L PreAZ and L PSD). Hence, the surface area of the PSD (SA PSD) is estimated by the following equation:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="599047v5_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which is the perimeter ratio between the outlines of the PSD to that of the synaptic contact.</p>
<p>The synaptic cleft width was measured because of its importance for the transient temporal and spatial increase of the glutamate concentration, reversible binding of glutamate to appropriate glutamate receptors and eventual up-take and diffusion of glutamate out of the synaptic cleft. To a large extent, these processes are governed by the geometry of this structure and the shape and size of the PreAZs and PSDs.</p>
<p>All SVs were marked throughout each SB, their diameters were individually measured and their distances to the PreAZ were automatically detected using an algorithm implemented in OpenCAR (minimal distance between each SV membrane to the contour line of the PreAZ) throughout the SB in every single image of the series. Large DCVs were only counted in the image where they appeared largest. To avoid double counts, only clear ring-like structures were counted as SVs. However, SVs might be missed in densely packed regions, because ring-like traces may partly overlap. This effect may counteract any double counts. Based on the small extent and the partially counteracting nature of this effect, the numbers of small clear vesicles reported in this study remained uncorrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In this work, aldehyde fixation was used that is thought to induce tissue shrinkage thereby biasing structural quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eyre et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Korogod et al. 2015</xref>). A direct comparison of structural parameters obtained from either aldehyde or cryo-fixed and substituted tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Korogod et al. 2015</xref>), showed differences in cortical thickness (∼16% larger in cryo-fixed material), in the volume of extracellular space (∼6-fold larger in cryo-fixed material), a slight increase in glial volume and overall density of synaptic contacts (∼14% in cryo-fixed material), but no significant differences in neuronal structures such as axons, dendrites and SV diameter.</p>
<p>In the structural and synaptic parameters as estimated here, no significant difference was found for SB size and other synaptic subelements such as mitochondria, active zones (AZs) and SVs when compared with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Zhao et al. 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">b</xref>). Therefore, no corrections for shrinkage were applied and we are thus convinced that the synaptic parameters reported here are accurate and can be directly used for detailed computational models. In addition, large-scale preservation for ultrastructural analysis will therefore continue to rely on chemical fixation approaches, due to the limited preservation of the ultrastructure in cryo-fixed material as stated in Korogod and co-workers (2015).</p>

Care was taken to distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic contacts, as well as the postsynaptic target structures (dendritic shafts or spines). Finally, the density of synaptic contacts (<italic>Nv</italic>) per 1 mm<sup>3</sup> was calculated using the formula below:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="599047v5_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>Qd</italic> is the number of synaptic contacts per dissector and Vd is the volume of the dissector given by: Number of dissectors x frame area x section thickness.</p>

<title>TEM tomography of L1 SBs in the human TLN</title>
<p>EM tomography was performed on 200-300 nm thick sections cut from blocks prepared for serial ultrathin sectioning as described above (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; Source Data 03). Sections were mounted on pioloform-coated line copper grids and were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate following a slightly modified staining protocol as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Reynolds (1963)</xref>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, sections were examined with a JEOL JEM 1400Plus, operating at 120 kV and equipped with a 4096×4096 pixels CMOS camera (TemCam-F416, TVIPS, Gauting, Germany). Tilt-series were acquired automatically over an angular range of −60° to +60° at 1°-degree increments using Serial EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mastronarde 2005</xref>). Stack alignment and reconstruction by filtered backprojection were carried out using the software package iMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kremer et al. 1996</xref>). Final reconstructions were ultimately filtered using a median filter with a window size of 3 pixels. Tilt-series were stored as .tif files and were further processed using the freely available software Imod 4.9.12 and ImageJ (ImageJ, RRID:SCR-0033070). In each tilt-series so- called ‘docked’ SVs identified by their fusion with the PreAZ or as omega-shaped body that already released a quantum of neurotransmitter were counted separately for L1a and L1b and for their target structures, dendritic shafts or spines in randomly selected SBs.</p>
<p>To determine possible differences to the values obtained by the 3D-reconstructions, in the same tilt-series binned at 24 nm (section thickness) the diameter of SVs was measured randomly by using OpenCAR as described above. To avoid double counts and underestimations of the diameter, the ring-shaped structure of an SV was compared on each tilted-slice and only marked if it appears largest. In 18 tilt-series each consisting of 9-14 tilt-slices, randomly selected SBs were investigated (L1a: 8 tilt series; 16 SBs with a total of 2094 SVs; L1b: 10 tilt series; 22 SBs with a total of 3740 SVs).</p>

<title>Quantitative analysis of the astrocytic coverage</title>
<p>Although methodologically associated with the possibility of a certain degree of error, astrocytic processes around synaptic complexes were mainly identified by their relatively clear cytoplasm compared to synaptic boutons or dendritic profiles; in addition by their irregular, stellate shape, by the presence of glycogen granules and bundles of intermediate filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Peters et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Ventura and Harris 1999</xref>). With greater accuracy, astrocytic processes can be identified with immunolabeling, but this leads to poorer tissue preservation and resolution of cellular structures such as AZs. Among studies in rats (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Rollenhagen et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">2018</xref>) in a previous study on the human TLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>) immunohistochemistry against glutamine synthetase, a key enzyme in astrocytes, was carried out. Since similar results were obtained without immunohistochemistry when identifying astrocytic processes around AZs, immunohistochemistry was omitted in the series of follow-up studies on the human TLN.</p>
<p>To quantify the volume contribution of astrocytic processes in the human neocortex, the interactive software ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Schneider et al. 2012</xref>) was used. The first, the middle, and the last images of an individual EM series were used for a further quantitative volumetric analysis (Source Data 04, sheet 01). In each section of the same series used for the 3D-volume reconstructions, a grid (grid size 1 × 1 μm<sup>2</sup>) was placed over the EM image, and in each square, the abundance of fine astrocytic processes was documented throughout these images and averaged. Using the Cavalieri method [Unbiased Stereology: Three-Dimensional Measurement in Microscopy (Advanced Methods) Paperback-January 7, 2005, by Vyvyan Howard Matthew Reed], the (absolute) volume contribution of astrocytic processes was determined according to the Cavalieri estimator:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="599047v5_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where a(p) is the size of one square (0.8 × 0.8 μm2), P is the number of squares counted, and t is the thickness of the slice.</p>
<p>In addition, in consecutive sections spanning the complete AZ , the astrocytic coverage was evaluated under the following criteria: fine astrocytic processes were observed on 1) both sides of the AZ reaching as far as the synaptic cleft, 2) only one side of the AZ was covered by fine astrocytic processes and 3) AZs without astrocytic processes (Source Data 04, sheet 02). Values obtained for L1 (L1a: n = 3 patients; L1b: 3 patients) either for SBs terminating on dendritic spines (L1a: n = 128; L1b: n=126) or shafts (L1a: n= 48; L1b: n = 44) were compared to L4 (n = 5 patients; dendritic spines n=93; dendritic shafts n=41). Layer 4 was chosen because the volumetric analysis showed the highest portion of astrocytic processes in this layer compared to all other cortical layers. All values are given as percentages.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The mean value ± standard deviation (SD), the median with the interquartile range (IQR), the coefficient of variation (CV), skewness, variance, and the coefficient of correlation (R<sup>2</sup>) were given for each structural parameter analyzed. The p-value was considered significant only if p &lt; 0.05. Box- and Violin plots (Plotly 4.0.0 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chart-studio.plotly.com">https://chart-studio.plotly.com</ext-link>) were generated to investigate inter-individual differences for each patient and structural parameter (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Source Data 02).</p>
<p>To test for significant differences, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H-test with a subsequent Mann- Whitney u-test analysis was performed, using PAST 4.02 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hammer et al. 2001</xref>). Correlation graphs between several structural parameters were then generated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>-values were interpreted as follows: 0, no linear correlation; 0-0.5, weak linear correlation; 0.5-0.8, good linear correlation; and 0.8-1.0, strong linear correlation. Furthermore, a freely available Fisher’s <italic>r</italic>-to-<italic>z</italic>-transformation calculator (Fisher’s z) was used to test for differences in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> between L1a and L1b (p-value &lt; 0.05). For statistical comparison with other layers of the human TLN, L1a and L1b were grouped together as L1.</p>
<p>Parts of the data acquisition were carried out in the context of a PhD Thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Sadeghi Dastjerdi A. 2024</xref>).Values obtained in the present study for L1 were compared partially to those obtained for L2, L3 (Girwert Ch., PhD Thesis in preparation), L4, L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">b</xref>; Yakoubi R., PhD Thesis 2023) and L6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The Authors investigated the anatomical features of the excitatory synaptic boutons in layer 1 of the human temporal neocortex. They examined the size of the synapse, the macular or the perforated appearance and the size of the synaptic active zone, the number and volume of the mitochondria, the number of the synaptic and the dense core vesicles, also differentiating between the readily releasable, the recycling and the resting pool of synaptic vesicles. The coverage of the synapse by astrocytic processes was also assessed, and all the above parameters were compared to other layers of the human temporal neocortex. The Authors conclude that the subcellular morphology of the layer 1 synapses is suitable for the functions of the neocortical layer, i.e. the synaptic integration within the cortical column. The low glial coverage of the synapses might allow the glutamate spillover from the synapses enhancing synaptic crosstalk within this cortical layer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this paper are the abundant and very precious data about the fine structure of the human neocortical layer 1. Quantitative electron microscopy data (especially that derived from the human brain) are very valuable, since this is a highly time- and energy consuming work. The techniques used to obtain the data, as well as the analyses and the statistics performed by the Authors are all solid, strengthen this manuscript, and support the conclusions drawn in the discussion.</p>

<p>The study of Rollenhagen et al examines the ultrastructural features of Layer 1 of human temporal cortex. The tissue was derived from drug-resistant epileptic patients undergoing surgery, and was selected as further from the epilepsy focus, and as such considered to be non-epileptic. The analyses has included 4 patients with different age, sex, medication and onset of epilepsy. The manuscript is a follow-on study with 3 previous publications from the same authors on different layers of the temporal cortex:</p>
<p>Layer 4 - Yakoubi et al 2019 eLife</p>
<p>Layer 5 - Yakoubi et al 2019 Cerebral Cortex,</p>
<p>Layer 6 - Schmuhl-Giesen et al 2022 Cerebral Cortex</p>
<p>They find, the L1 synaptic boutons mainly have single active zone a very large pool of synaptic vesicles and are mostly devoid of astrocytic coverage.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The MS is well written easy to read. Result section gives a detailed set of figures showing many morphological parameters of synaptic boutons and surrounding glial elements. The authors provide comparative data of all the layers examined by them so far in the Discussion. Given that anatomical data in human brain are still very limited, the current MS has substantial relevance. The work appears to be generally well done, the EM and EM tomography images are of very good quality. The analyses is clear and precise.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors made all the corrections required and answered all of my concerns, included additional data sets, and clarified statements where needed.</p>

<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>The third version of this paper has been substantially improved. The English is significantly better, there are only few paragraphs and sentences which are hard to understand (see my comments and suggestions below). Almost all of my suggestions were incorporated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the comments and incorporated the suggestions within the latest version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Remaining minor concerns:</p>
<p>About epileptic and non-epileptic (non-affected) tissue. I am aware that temporal lobe neocortical tissue derived from epileptic patients is regarded as non-affected by many groups, and they are quite similar to the cortex of non-epileptic (tumour) patients in their electrophysiological properties and synaptic physiology. But please, note, that one paper you cited did not use samples from epileptic patients, but only tissue from non-epileptic tumor patients (Molnár et al. PLOS 2008).</p>
<p>When you look deeper, and make thorough comparison of tissues derived from epileptic and non-epileptic patients, there are differences in the fine structure, as well as in several electrophysiological features. See for example Tóth et al., J Physiol, 2018, where higher density of excitatory synapses were found in L2 of neocortical samples derived from epileptic patients compared to non-epileptic (tumor) patients. Furthermore, the appearance of population bursts is similar, but their occurrence is more frequent and their amplitude is higher in tissue from epileptic compared to non-epileptic patients. So, I still cannot agree, that temporal neocortex of epileptic patients with the seizure focus in the hippocampus would be non-affected. Therefore I suggested to use the term biopsy tissue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are thankful for this comment on using non-epileptic tissue also by others. We are also aware that Molnár et al. 2008 worked with tumor tissue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is still not emphasized in the first paragraph of the Discussion, that only excitatory axon terminals were investigated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now mentioned in the first paragraph of the discussion that only excitatory synaptic boutons were investigated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The text in the Results and the Discussion are somewhat inconsistent.</p>
<p>The last two paragraphs of the Results section ends with several sentences which should be part of the discussion, such as line 328: This finding strongly supports multivesicular release... or line 344: --- pointing towards a layer-specific regulation of the putative RRP. Moreover, the results suggest that... and line 370: ... it is most likely... Please, correct this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We disagree with the reviewer on these points because these sentences summarizes the findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The first paragraph of the Discussion summarizes the work of the quantitative EM work and gives one conclusion about the astrocytic coverage. This last sentence is inconsistent with the other parts of the paragraph. I would either write that &quot;astrocytic coverage was also investigated&quot; (or something similar), or move this sentence to the paragraph which discusses the astrocytic coverage.</p>
<p>Results line 180-183. &quot;Special connections&quot; between astrocytic processes and synaptic boutons are mentioned, but not shown. Either show these (but then prove with staining!), or leave out this paragraph.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We deleted this paragraph as suggested.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Minor suggestions:</p>
<p>Synaptic density, lines 189-193. If you say &quot;comparatively&quot; high, then compare to something (cite your own work for the other layers, and tell the approximative values for the other layers). Same in line 194 comparably high to what? Other option: say &quot;relatively high&quot;.</p>

<p>We corrected the sentences as suggested by the reviewer.</p>

<p>Line 354 Dot missing at the end of the sentence (after Figure 6A, B)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Corrected as suggested by the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 354-358: Please rephrase this sentence (too complicated, not understandable). I do not understand why results of the L4, L5, L6 are described here. What does it mean &quot;Astrocytes and their fine processes formed a relatively dense, but a comparably loose network within the neuropil in L1&quot;? Dense or loose?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the experiment measuring the volume fraction of astrocytic processes (Figure 6C), all six cortical layers were analyzed, thus we compared the values obtained for L1 with the results for L4, L5 and L6. For more clarity, we rephrased the sentence: “Astrocytes and their fine processes formed a relatively dense network in L4 and L5, but a comparably loose one within the neuropil in L1…” We also rephrased other sentences in this paragraph (as also suggested below).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 359-369: Please rephrase this paragraph. The sentences are too complicated, have too many parentheses, and are not understandable. I suggest to write first how many synapses were examined in L1 and L4, then how many of them were on spine and on dendrites (either n or %). Then give the values how many (n or %) of them were &quot;tripartite synapses&quot;, out of spine synapses and of dendritic synapses in both layers. How many of them were partially covered in both layers. Please, write the data in a systematic way. The best would be to give the values in a table as well. This way it will be more understandable (now, it is chaotic, hard to follow).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We rephrased the paragraph and added a new table (3).</p>
