<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The pelvic organs (bladder, rectum and sex organs) have been represented for a century as receiving autonomic innervation from two pathways — lumbar sympathetic and sacral parasympathetic — by way of a shared relay, the pelvic ganglion, conceived as an assemblage of sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we find that the mouse pelvic ganglion is made of four classes of neurons, distinct from both sympathetic and parasympathetic ones, albeit with a kinship to the former, but not the latter, through a complex genetic signature. We also show that spinal lumbar preganglionic neurons synapse in the pelvic ganglion onto equal numbers of noradrenergic and cholinergic cells, both of which therefore serve as sympathetic relays. Thus, the pelvic viscera receive no innervation from parasympathetic or typical sympathetic neurons, but instead from a divergent tail end of the sympathetic chains, in charge of its idiosyncratic functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The pelvic ganglion is a collection of autonomic neurons, close to the walls of the bladder, organized as a loose ganglionated plexus (as in humans) or a bona fide ganglion (as in mouse). It receives input from preganglionic neurons of the throracolumbar intermediate lateral motor column, a sympathetic pathway that travels through the hypogastric nerve. A second input is from the so-called “sacral parasympathetic nucleus” that projects through the pelvic nerve. The assignment of these two inputs to different divisions of the autonomic nervous system by John Langley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), largely based on physiological observation on external genitals which were never consensual (reviewed in (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic>), has led, in turn, to propose that the pelvic ganglion, targeted by both pathways, is of a mixed sympathetic/parasympathetic nature (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></italic>). Of note, this unique case of anatomic promiscuity between the two types of neurons poses a challenge for the schematic representation of the autonomic nervous system, so that the pelvic ganglion is most often omitted from such representations (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic>). A duality of the pelvic ganglion was also suggested by the coexistence of noradrenergic and cholinergic neurons, which elsewhere in the autonomic nervous system form, respectively, the vast majority of sympathetic ganglionic cells and the totality of parasympathetic ones. Here we directly explore the composition of the mouse pelvic ganglion in cell types, using single-cell transcriptomics, and compare it to sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We isolated cells from several autonomic ganglia of postnatal day 5 mice: the stellate ganglion and the lumbar chain (both belonging to the paravertebral sympathetic chain), the coeliac+mesenteric ganglia (part of the prevertebral sympathetic chain), the sphenopalatine ganglion (parasympathetic) and the pelvic ganglion, and processed them for single-cell RNA sequencing (cf Material and Methods). Neuronal cells segregated in three large ensembles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>): one that contained all sympathetic neurons, one that contained all parasympathetic neurons, and the third that contained most pelvic neurons — except one subset that segregated close to the sympathetic cluster. Thus, no pelvic neuron segregates with parasympathetic neurons, but the great majority of them do not segregate with sympathetic neurons either.</p>

<caption><title>The pelvic ganglion does not contain parasympathetic neurons and is made of sympathetic-like neurons.</title><p>(A) UMAP of cells isolated from 3 sympathetic ganglia (lumbar, stellate and celiac), a parasympathetic ganglion (sphenopalatine) and the pelvic ganglion dissected from postnatal day 5 mice. The pelvic ganglion is sharply divided into 4 clusters (P1-4), none of which co-segregates with sympathetic or parasympathetic neurons. (B) Heatmap of the highest scoring 100 genes in an all-versus-all comparison of their dichotomized expression pattern among the 4 ganglia and 4 pelvic clusters (see Material and Methods), excluding genes specific to the pelvic ganglion (shown in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>), and keeping only the top-scoring comparison for genes that appear twice. For overall legibility of the figure, the three largest cell groups (lumbar, stellate and sphenopalatine) are subsampled and genes are ordered by expression pattern (designated on the left), rather than score. “cholinergic” and “noradrenergic” genes are those that are coregulated with ChAT or Th, regardless of known function. “Other” refers to various groupings that split sympathetic ganglia and are thus not informative as to a sympathetic or parasympathetic identity. Transcription factors are indicated in bold face. White arrowhead: pelvic P3 cluster; S, sympathetic; ParaS, parasympathetic. (C) Pie chart of the top 100 genes, counted by expression pattern in the all-versus-all comparison. Genes specific for the P4 cluster dominate (see heatmap in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>), followed by those which are “parasympathetic-not-pelvic” and “sympathetic-and-pelvic” (seen in 1B). The three genes marked in white are the only ones that are compatible with the current dogma of a mixed sympathetic/parasympathetic pelvic ganglion, by being expressed in the sphenopalatine ganglion and a subset of pelvic clusters (other than the full complement of cholinergic ones).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The separation, on the UMAP, of most pelvic from all other ganglionic cells contrasts with the suite of 5 developmental transcription factors that we previously reported as differentially expressed between the sympathetic and pelvic ganglia on one hand, and parasympathetic ganglia on the other (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></italic>). To explore this conundrum, we searched for more genes that would help place the pelvic ganglion relative to the sympatho-parasympathetic dichotomy: additional genes that would put the pelvic ganglion in the sympathetic category (as per our previous findings), genes that would put it in a class by itself (as the UMAP suggests), or genes that would split pelvic neurons into parasympathetic-like and sympathetic-like clusters (as the current dogma implies).</p>
<p>In an unbiased approach, we sought genes expressed in a higher proportion of cells in any set of ganglia compared to its complementary set (see Material and Methods). To give justice to the classical notion that the pelvic ganglion is heterogeneous, i.e. mixed sympatho/parasympathetic, we treated the clusters of pelvic ganglionic cells, 4 in our conservative estimate (P1-4) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>) as 4 ganglia, alongside the 4 other ganglia (sphenopalatine, stellate, coeliac and lumbar) — i.e. we made (2<sup>8</sup>-2) = 254 comparisons and analyzed the 100 “top” genes, i.e. with the highest discrimination score, irrespective of the comparison scored (Table S1, S2, S3).</p>
<p>The vast majority of the top 100 genes fell into 7 of the 254 possible dichotomized expression patterns, visualized on a heatmap (patterns I-VI, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,C</xref>; pattern VII, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>) where cells are grouped by ganglion, and genes by expression pattern (i.e. disregarding their score). These 7 patterns can be consolidated into 3, among which only the first is informative about a sympathetic or parasympathetic identity of pelvic neurons:
<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>Patterns I-IV comprise 39 genes with an opposite status in sympathetic and parasympathetic cells, among which 20 (I+III) are sympathetic-specific and 19 (II+IV) parasympathetic-specific (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,C</xref>). Those which are also expressed in pelvic clusters (I and IV) argue for their sympathetic (conversely parasympathetic) identity, and against the opposite identity; those which are not expressed in pelvic clusters (II and III), argue solely against such an identity. Overall, 32 genes (I+II) argue against a parasympathetic identity of all pelvic clusters, among which 16 genes (I) argue for their sympathetic identity; 7 genes (III+IV) argue against a sympathetic identity of all clusters, among which 3 genes (IV) argue for a parasympathetic identity of P1 or P4 (which are otherwise not parasympathetic by the criterion of 31 and 32 genes, respectively). We verified expression of 7 sympathetic and 7 parasympathetic markers by in situ hybridization on the pelvic ganglion at E16.5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patterns V+VI comprise 12 genes that correlate with neurotransmitter phenotype (cholinergic or noradrenergic) by being expressed in the sphenopalatine ganglion and P1, P2 and P4 (5 genes (V), including ChAT) or, conversely, in all sympathetic ganglia and P3 (7 genes (VI), including Th) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,C</xref>). These genes point to noradrenergic and cholinergic “synexpression groups”(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>) broader than the defining biosynthetic enzymes and transporters. Neurotransmitter phenotype has been suggested to largely coincide with origin of input, lumbar or sacral (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>) which currently defines, respectively, sympathetic versus parasympathetic identity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>). However, we find that the lumbar sympathetic pathway targets both cholinergic and noradrenergic pelvic ganglionic cells (in a proportion than reflects their relative abundance), by anterograde tracing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, noradrenergic and cholinergic genes are excluded from a debate on the sympathetic or parasympathetic identity of pelvic neurons.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pattern VII involves 42 genes that place all, or some pelvic clusters in a class by themselves (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>), thus neither sympathetic nor parasympathetic (as does the whole transcriptome, as evidenced by the UMAP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>)) by being expressed, or not expressed, exclusively in them. The cholinergic cluster P4 was particularly rich in genes with such idiosyncratic expression states (20 genes). <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> provides the 5 top genes of each pelvic cluster.</p></list-item>

</fig>
<p>In the aggregate, the pelvic ganglion is best described as a divergent sympathetic ganglion, devoid of parasympathetic neurons. The fact that few of the top 100 genes (4 genes, III) marked sympathetic neurons to the exclusion of pelvic ones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), while many (40 genes, VII) did the opposite (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>), argues that the pelvic identity is an evolutionary elaboration of a more generic, presumably more ancient, sympathetic one.</p>
<p>A third of the top 100 genes (32 genes) are transcription factors: 6 define a parasympathetic/non{sympathetic+pelvic} identity (Hmx2, Hmx3, Dlx5, Dlx6, Ebf3, Satb2); 12 define a {pelvic+sympathetic}/non-parasympathetic identity (Isl1, Gata2, Gata3, Hand1, Hmx1, Tbx20 plus 6 Hox genes); 3 correlate with the noradrenergic phenotype (Tfap2b, Insm2 and Zfpm2); 8 (including 6 Hox genes) are specific to the pelvic ganglion or some of its clusters (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>) and 3 Hox genes are specific to the pelvic+lumbar ganglia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Nothing is known of the function of the 6 parasympathetic transcription factors, but most of the non-Hox {sympathetic+pelvic} ones are implicated in sympathetic differentiation: Islet1 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></italic>), Hand1(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></italic>), Gata2(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>), Gata3 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>) and Hmx1(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Expression of a shared core of 12 transcription factors by pelvic and sympathetic ganglia, yet of divergent transcriptomes overall, logically calls for an additional layer of transcriptional control to modify the output of the 12 sympathetic transcription factors. Obvious candidates are the 6 Hox genes restricted to the pelvic ganglion (Hoxd9, Hoxa10, Hoxa5, Hoxd10, Hoxc11 and Hoxb3) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>) and 6 more beyond the 100 top genes, mostly Hoxb paralogues (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Given that the parasympathetic and sympathetic ganglia are deployed according to a rostro-caudal pattern (parasympathetic ganglia in register with cranial nerves, sympathetic ganglia with thoraco-lumbar nerves, and the pelvic ganglion with lumbar and sacral nerves (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), the entire taxonomy of autonomic ganglia could be a developmental readout of Hox genes (whose multiplicity makes this conjecture hard to test). A role for Hox genes in determining types of autonomic neurons would be reminiscent of their specification of other neuronal subtypes in Drosophila(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>), C. elegans (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>) and Mus (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The notion that the pelvic ganglion is a caudal elaboration of the sympathetic ganglionic chains echoes the situation of its preganglionic neurons, in the lumbar and sacral spinal cord. We showed that lumbar and sacral preganglionics are indistinguishable by several criteria, including the expression state of 6 transcription factors (Phox2a, Phox2b, Tbx3, Tbx2, Tbx20, FoxP1) and their dependency on the bHLH gene Olig2, in addition to their well-known location (the intermediate lateral column) and ventral exit point of their axon (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></italic>). Recent surveys of spinal preganglionic neurons by single-cell transcriptomics (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>) discovered many subtypes, most of them evenly distributed from thoracic to sacral levels, and a few enriched at, or specific to the sacral level, confirming that the sacral preganglionic neurons are sympathetic, yet represent a caudal modification of the thoracolumbar intermediate lateral column.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the genetic signatures of neither pre- nor post-ganglionic neurons of the sacral autonomic outflow support its century-old assignment to the parasympathetic division of the visceral nervous system. Importantly, we have argued (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic>) that the supposed parasympathetic identity was unnecessary at best to understand the physiology of the pelvis, at worst incongruent with it, at least concerning sex organs and the bladder. The antagonism between an anti-erectile lumbar and a pro-erectile sacral autonomic pathways on the blood vessels of the external genitals — the key argument that Langley advanced for making the sacral pathway parasympathetic, even before he coined the term (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>)— was repeatedly challenged by the evidence of a lumbo-sacral pro-erectile synergy (reviewed in (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic>)). And experimental support for a lumbo-sacral antagonism on the bladder is scant, despite common perception from textbooks and reviews (reviewed in (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic>)). It is thus remarkable that the cell type-based anatomy that we uncover in no way contradicts the physiology. There is no need to suppose that some sympathetic-like neurons in the pelvic region display a type of physiology common with that of parasympathetic ones in the head or thorax, which would deserve a common name. The classical parasympathetic label is thus best dropped and replaced by the genetic (i.e. embryological and evolutionary) notion of a sympathetic one, modified to suit the unique demands of pelvic physiology. The division of the autonomic nervous system that encompasses the pelvic ganglion and both its lumbar and sacral afferents (which could be termed “pelvo-sympathetic” and includes whatever antagonistic pathways operate in the region —e.g. on genital blood vessels) is now ripe for finer grain analysis, anatomical and physiological, at the level of neuron types, defined by their gene expression patterns.</p>

<title>Obtainment of ganglionic cells</title>
<p>Sphenopalatine, stellate, coeliac, lumbar and pelvic ganglia were dissected from Phox2bCre;Rosa<sup>tdT</sup> P5 pups and placed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) oxygenated with carbogen (4°C). Fat tissue was carefully removed and nerves emanating from the ganglia were cut. Ganglia were transferred into a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube containing 1ml PBS-Glucose (1mg/ml Glucose), 20 μl Papain solution (Worthington LS003126; 25.4 Units/mg) and 20 μl DNAse (2mg/ml in PBS) and incubated at 37°C for 15min. The ganglia were collected by centrifugation (300g, 1min), the supernatant replaced by 1ml PBS-Glucose supplemented with 50 μl Collagenase/Dispase (Worthington CLS-1 345U/mg; Dispase II Roche 1.2U/mg; 80mg Collagenase and 92mg Dispase II dissolved in 1ml PBS-Glucose) and 20 μl DNAse solution and the ganglia incubated at 37°C for 8min. After collecting the ganglia by centrifugation for 3min at 300g they were dissociated in 1ml PBS-Glucose supplemented with 0.04% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and DNAse (20μl) by trituration, using a fire-polished, siliconized Pasteur pipette. The cell suspension was then filtered through a 40μm cell strainer. To eliminate cell debris, the cell suspension was centrifuged through a density step gradient by overlaying the cell suspension onto 1ml OptiPrep solution (80 μl OptiPrep (Sigma), 900μl PBS supplemented with 0.04%BSA, 20μl DNAse) for 15 min, 100g at 5°C. After removal of the supernatant from the soft cell pellet, the cells were suspended in 100μl PBS-Glucose/0.04%BSA and collected again in 500μl Eppendorf tube for 15 min, 100g at 5°C. The supernatant was carefully removed (under control by fluorescence microscope). After addition of 40 μl PBS-Glucose/0.04%BSA the cell density was adjusted to 1000 cells/ml and transferred to the 10xGenomics platform.</p>

<title>Library construction and Sequencing</title>
<p>Single cell RNA-Seq was performed in two separate experimental rounds, one for the stellate, sphenopalatine and pelvic ganglia (pelvic_1) performed at the École normale supérieure GenomiqueENS core facility (Paris, France), and one for the celiac, lumbar and pelvic ganglia (pelvic_2) performed at the ICGex NGS platform of the Institut Curie (Paris, France). Cellular suspensions (10000 cells for the first round, 5300 cells for the second) were loaded on a 10X Chromium instrument (10X Genomics) to generate single-cell GEMs (5000 for the first round, 3000 for the second). Single-cell RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit (v2 for the first round, v3 for the second) (10X Genomics) according to manufacturer’s protocol based on the 10X GEMCode proprietary technology. Briefly, the initial step consisted in performing an emulsion where individual cells were isolated into droplets together with gel beads coated with unique primers bearing 10X cell barcodes, UMI (unique molecular identifiers) and poly(dT) sequences. Reverse transcription reactions were applied to generate barcoded full-length cDNA followed by disruption of the emulsions using the recovery agent and the cDNA was cleaned up with DynaBeads MyOne Silane Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Bulk cDNA was amplified using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 with 96-Well Gold Sample Block Module (Applied Biosystems) (98°C for 3min; 12 cycles: 98°C for 15s, 63°C for 20s, and 72°C for 1min; 72°C for 1min; held at 4°C). The amplified cDNA product was cleaned up with the SPRI select Reagent Kit (Beckman Coulter). Indexed sequencing libraries were constructed using the reagents from the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit v3, in several steps: (1) fragmentation, end repair and A-tailing; (2) size selection with SPRI select; (3) adaptor ligation; (4) post ligation cleanup with SPRI select; (5) sample index PCR and cleanup with SPRI select beads (with 12 to 14 PCR cycles depending on the samples). Individual library quantification and quality assessment were performed using Qubit fluorometric assay (Invitrogen) with dsDNA HS (High Sensitivity) Assay Kit and Bioanalyzer Agilent 2100 using a High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Genomics). Indexed libraries were then equimolarly pooled and quantified by qPCR using the KAPA library quantification kit (Roche). Sequencing was performed on a NextSeq 500 device (Illumina) for the first round and a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) for the second, targeting around 400M clusters per sample and using paired-end (26/57bp for the first round, 28×91bp for the second).</p>

<title>Bioinformatic analysis</title>
<p>For each of the 6 samples (pelvic_1, stellate, sphenopalatine, pelvic_2, coeliac and lumbar) we performed demultiplexing, barcode processing, and gene counting using the Cell Ranger software (v. 6.0.1). The ‘filtered_feature_bc_matrix’ files (uploaded at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE232789">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE232789</ext-link>) were used as our starting points for defining cells. For each dataset, only droplets that expressed more than 1500 genes, less than 11000 genes and a percentage of mitochondrial genes below 15% were retained. This resulted in the selection of 4404 pelvic_1 cells, 7225 stellate cells, 4630 sphenopalatine cells, 1643 pelvic_2 cells, 1428 coeliac and 2120 lumbar cells.</p>
<p>We used Seurat version 3 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></italic>) to read, manipulate, assemble, and normalize (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>) the datasets. Specifically, we concatenated cells from all 6 datasets and normalized the data using the sctransform (SCT) method for which we fitted a Gamma-Poisson Generalized Linear Model (&quot;glmGamPoi&quot; option). Using the Seurat framework, we then performed a PCA on the normalized dataset.</p>
<p>Next, we integrated all 6 datasets using Batchelor (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></italic>) (a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors), and we visualized all cells, including neurons, in 2 dimensions using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection method (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>) on the first 50 components from the PCA.</p>
<p>We selected neurons based on their mean expression of a set of neuronal marker genes (Stmn2, Stmn3, Gap43 and Tubb3). Specifically, cells were classified as neurons if their mean marker SCT-normalized gene expression exceeded a threshold of 3, that best separated the bimodal distribution of the higher and lower values of the mean expression of neuronal markers. Likewise, we excluded glial-containing doublets using the following markers: Plp1, Ttyh1, Fabp7, Cryab and Mal. The number of neurons thus selected was 862 for Pelvic_1, 2689 for the stellate, 1857 for the sphenopalatine, 361 for Pelvic_2, 236 for celiac and 925 for the lumbar chain.</p>
<p>We then clustered pelvic neurons based on the first two components from the UMAP generated from the 50 batch-corrected components, using the graph-based clustering method Louvain (Blondel et al 2008) implemented in the Seurat framework, with a resolution of 0.3. This procedure defined 24 clusters and split the pelvic ganglion into four clusters 1, 7, 15 and 19 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>), that we renamed P1, P2, P3, P4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The efficiency of batch correction is attested by the equal contribution from both batches of pelvic ganglia to all four defined pelvic clusters (P1-4) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>), and the comparable expression level of the top 100 genes across both pelvic batches in the violin plots (Table S2).</p>
<p>To search in an unbiased manner for gene expression similarities between pelvic neurons and either sympathetic or parasympathetic ones, we systematically compared the expression of every gene of the dataset across all possible splits among ganglia, i.e. between every subset of ganglia (“subset_1”), and its complementary subset (“subset_2”). Because we treated each of the 4 pelvic clusters as a ganglion, there were 2^8=256 such splits (2 of them, defined by “all_8_groups vs none” and “none vs all_8_groups”, being meaningless). For every split and every gene, we devised a score that would best reflect how higher the proportion is of cells expressing the gene (i.e. one read of the gene or more) in subset_1 than in subset_2. We used a metric based on the product of the proportions of cells expressing the gene in each ganglion of subset_1 or subset_2 (rather than throughout subset_1 or subset_2), to give an equal weight to each ganglion (irrespective of its size), and to penalize splits that contain outliers (i.e. ganglia that contain much fewer cells positive for that gene than other ganglia in subset_1, or ganglia that contain much more cells positive for that gene than other ganglia in subset_2).</p>
<p>Specifically, for a given split and a given gene, the score (here defined by the variable score, in the R programming language) is defined as:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="548500v2_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> are the ganglion subsets subset_1 and subset_2 as described above.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>n<sub>S1</sub> and n<sub>S2</sub> are the number of ganglion clusters that belong to subset_1 and subset_2.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="548500v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> are the proportion of cells from ganglion or pelvic cluster i and j (i belonging to subset_1 and j to subset_2) which express the given gene.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>eps<sub>pos</sub>=0.9 and eps<sub>nega</sub>=0.02 are parameters controlling a tradeoff between favoring genes expressed in subset_1 and penalizing genes expressed in subset_2.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Note that when eps<sub>pos</sub>=0.9 (the parameter value used here) the quantity <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="548500v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> can be negative, in which case the expression becomes equal to -Inf and the gene gets the lowest possible score for that given split. This means that with these settings all dichotomies involving a ganglion or pelvic cluster in which less than 10% of cells express the gene (p=0.1) will get the minimal possible score.</p></list-item>

<title>Tracer injections</title>
<p>Surgeries were conducted under aseptic conditions using a small animal digital stereotaxic instrument (David Kopf Instruments). Male, C57bl mice (2-4 months old) were anesthetized with isoflurane (3.5% at 1 l/min for induction and 2–3% at 0.3 l/min for maintenance). Carprofen (0.5 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously for analgesia before surgery. A feed-back-controlled heating pad was used to maintain the animal temperature at 36 °C. Anesthetized animals were shaved along the spine and placed in a stereotaxic frame. The skin overlying the spine was sterilized with alternating scrubs of Vetadine and 80% (W/V) ethanol and a 100 µl injection of lidocaine (2%) was made subcutaneously along the spine before an incision was made from the iliac crest to the T9 vertebral spinous process. The T10 and T11 spinous processes were identified by counting rostrally from the L6 spinous process (identified relative to the iliac crest). Two small rostro-caudal incisions were made on each side of the vertebral column through the superficial-most layer of muscle. Parallel clamps were then placed within these incisions until firm contact was made with the transverse process of the T11 vertebra. The T11 vertebra was then raised upwards via the clamps until no respiratory movement was observed. The muscles connecting the T10 spinous process to transverse processes of caudal vertebra were dissected to expose the T10/T11 intervertebral space. A lateral incision was made across the dura to expose the underlying L1 spinal segment and 150nL injections of 4% lysine fixable, tetramethylrhodamine or Alexa-488 conjugated dextran, 3000MW (Thermofisher) were made bilaterally, into the intermediolateral nucleus (IML) and intermedio-medial nucleus (IMM) (0.600mm lateral, 0.600mm deep and 0.150mm lateral and 0.700mm deep) using a narrow-tapered glass pipette and a Nanoject III injector (Drummond Scientific). Injections were made at 5nL per second and left in place for 5 minutes following injection to prevent dextran leakage from the injection site. The pipette was then retracted, and the intervertebral space bathed with sterile physiological saline. A small piece of sterile gel foam hemostat (Pfizer) was then placed within the intervertebral space and the incision overlying the spine was sutured closed.</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>7-14 days after injection the mice were intracardially perfused with cold PBS until exsanguinated and subsequently fixed by perfusion with cold 4% PFA until the carcass became stiff. The bladder, prostate and pelvic ganglia were immediately dissected as an intact bloc and post fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 degrees. The intact spinal column was also dissected out and the dorsal surface of the spinal cord exposed before post fixation overnight in 4% PFA at 4 degrees. The fixed tissues were then rinsed in PBS 3x 30 minutes the following day. The “bladder block” was then cryopreserved in 15% sucrose (W/V) in PBS until non buoyant. The dorsal aspect of the injection site was imaged in situ using and fluorescence stereoscope. The spinal cord was then dissected out and cryopreserved as described above.</p>
<p>The bladder block was sectioned on a cryostat in a sagittal orientation to capture serial sections of the entire pelvic ganglion. Sections were cut at a thickness of 30µm and collected as a 1 in 4 series on Superfrost Plus glass slides. The spinal cord was sectioned coronally at a thickness of 60µm as a 1 in 2 series. On slide immunohistochemistry was performed against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) for the bladder block sections, primary incubation: 4-6 hours at room temperature, secondary incubation: 2 hours at room temperature, with 3×5 minute washes in PBS after each incubation.

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study compares gene expression patterns among different autonomic ganglia and will be of interest to developmental neuroscientists and neurophysiologists. The study expands the database of genes expressed by subpopulations of autonomic neurons in ganglia, a key step in decoding their developmental origins and physiological functions. The alternative view that the pelvic ganglionic neurons are actually modified sympathetic neurons is <bold>incompletely</bold> demonstrated given the large number of molecular and functional differences known to be present between cranial and sacral neurons.</p>

<p>In recent years, these investigators have been engaged in a debate regarding the classification of the sacral parasympathetic system as &quot;sympathetic&quot; rather than &quot;parasympathetic,&quot; based on shared developmental ontogeny of spinal preganglionic neurons. In this current study, these investigators conducted single-cell RNAseq analyses of four groups of autonomic neurons: paravertebral sympathetic neurons (stellate and lumbar train ganglia), prevertebral sympathetic neurons (coeliac-mesenteric ganglia), rostral parasympathetic ganglia (sphenopalatine ganglia), and the caudal pelvic ganglia (containing traditionally recognized sacral &quot;parasympathetic cholinergic neurons,&quot; which the investigators sought to challenge in terms of nomenclature). The authors argued that the pelvic ganglionic neurons shared the expression of more genes with sympathetic ganglia, as opposed to parasympathetic ganglia. Additionally, the pelvic neurons did not express a set of genes observed in the rostral parasympathetic sphenopalatine ganglia. Based on these findings, they claimed that the sacral autonomic system should be considered sympathetic rather than parasympathetic. However, these arguments face significant challenges.</p>
<p>Firstly, among the P1-4 clusters of pelvic neurons, the P3 cluster predominantly represents noradrenergic sympathetic neurons, known to be present in pelvic ganglia. These neurons share gene expression patterns typically found in sympathetic neurons and lack the key cholinergic features identified in the P1, P2, and P4 clusters. Consistently, the P3 cluster of neurons is located close to sympathetic neuron clusters on the map, echoing the conventional understanding that the pelvic ganglia are mixed, containing both sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons.</p>
<p>Secondly, as mentioned above, the P1, P2, and P4 clusters are cholinergic neurons, expressing ChAT (and VIP). The authors claimed that these neurons shared a large set of genes expressed in sympathetic neurons (class I genes shown in Figure 1B). A closer look at the expression showed that some genes are expressed at higher levels in sympathetic neurons and in P2 cluster neurons, but much weaker in P1, P2, and P4 neurons, such as Islet1 and GATA2, and the opposite is true for SST. Another set of genes is expressed weakly across clusters, like HoxC6, HoxD4, GM30648, SHISA9, and TBX20. Since the pelvic ganglia are in a caudal body part, it is not surprising to have genes expressed in pelvic ganglia, but not in rostral sphenopalatine ganglia, and vice versa (to have genes expressed in sphenopalatine ganglia, but not in pelvic ganglia), according to well recognized rostro-caudal body patterning, such as nested expression of hox genes.</p>
<p>Thirdly, noradrenergic sympathetic neurons and cholinergic neurons, by virtue of expressing different neurotransmitters, could have distinct roles. It is true that some cholinergic neurons reside in the sympathetic train ganglia as well, such as those innervating the sweat gland and some vascular systems; in this sense, the pelvic ganglia share some features with sympathetic ganglia, except that the pelvic ganglia contain a much higher percentage of cholinergic neurons compared with sympathetic ganglia. It is much simpler and easier to divide the autonomic nervous system into sympathetic neurons that release noradrenaline versus parasympathetic neurons that release acetylcholine, and these two systems often act in antagonistic manners, though in some cases, these two systems can work synergistically. It also does not matter whether or not pelvic cholinergic neurons could receive inputs from thoracic-lumbar preganglionic neurons (PGNs), not just sacral PGNs; such occurrence only represents a minor revision of the anatomy. In fact, it makes much more sense to call those cholinergic neurons located in the sympathetic chain ganglia parasympathetic. Thus, from the functionality point of view, it is not justified to claim that &quot;pelvic organs receive no parasympathetic innervation&quot;.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Recent advances in single-cell profiling of gene expression (RNA) permit the analysis of specialized cell types, an approach that has great value in the nervous system which is characterized by prodigious neuronal diversity. The novel data in this study focus primarily on genetic profiling to compare autonomic neurons from ganglia associated with the cranial parasympathetic outflow (sphenopalatine (also known as pteropalatine), the thoraco-lumbar sympathetic outflow (stellate, coeliac) and the sacral parasympathetic outflow (pelvic). Using statistical methods to reduce the dimensionality of the data and map gene expression, the authors provide interesting evidence that cranial parasympathetic and sacral sympathetic ganglia differ from each other and from sympathetic ganglia (Figures 1, S1 - S4). The authors interpret the mapping analysis as evidence that the cranial and sacral outflows differ so calling them both parasympathetic is unjustified. Based on anatomical localization of markers (Figure 2 ) (mainly transcription factors) the authors show a similarity between the sympathetic and pelvic ganglion. In Figure 3 they present evidence that some pelvic ganglionic neurons are dually innervated by sympathetic preganglionic neurons and sacral preganglionic neurons. These observations are interpreted to mean that the pelvic ganglion is not parasympathetic, but rather a modified sympathetic ganglion - hence the title of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The extensive use of single-cell profiling in this work is both interesting and exciting. Although still in its early stages, it holds promise for a deepened understanding of autonomic development and function. As noted in the introduction, this study extends previous work by Professor Brunet and his associates.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
This work further documents differences between the cranial and sacral parasympathetic outflows that have been known since the time of Langley - 100 years ago. The approach taken by Brunet et al. has focused on late neonatal and early postnatal development, a time when autonomic function is still maturing. In addition, the sphenopalatine and other cranial ganglia develop from placodes and the neural crest, while sympathetic and sacral ganglia develop from the neural crest alone. How then do genetic programs specifying brainstem and spinal development differ and how can this account for kinship that Brunet documents between spinal and sacral ganglia? One feature that seems to set the pelvic ganglion apart is the mixture of 'sympathetic' and 'parasympthetic' ganglion cells and the convergence of preganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic synapses on individual ganglion cells (Figure 3). This unusual organization has been reported before using microelectrode recordings (see Crowcroft and Szurszewski, J Physiol (1971) and Janig and McLachlan, Physiol Rev (1987)). Anatomical evidence of convergence in the pelvic ganglion has been reported by Keast, Neuroscience (1995). It should also be noted that the anatomy of the pelvic ganglion in male rodents is unique. Unlike other species where the ganglion forms a distributed plexus of mini-ganglia, in male rodents the ganglion coalesces into one structure that is easier to find and study. Interestingly the image in Figure 3A appears to show a clustering of Chat-positive and Th-positive neurons. Does this result from the developmental fusion of mini ganglia having distinct sympathetic and parasympathetic origins? In addition, Brunet et al dismiss the cholinergic and noradrenergic phenotypes as a basis for defining parasympathetic and parasympathetic neurons. However, see the bottom of Figure S4 and further counterarguments in Horn (Clin Auton Res (2018)). What then about neuropeptides, whose expression pattern is incompatible with the revised nomenclature proposed by Brunet et al.? Figure 1B indicates that VIP is expressed by sacral and cranial ganglion cells, but not thoracolumbar ganglion cells. The authors do not mention neuropeptide Y (NPY). The immunocytochemistry literature indicates that NPY is expressed by a large subpopulation of sympathetic neurons but never by sacral or cranial parasympathetic neurons.</p>

<p>The data we produce are not criticized as such and thus, do not require revision; the criticisms concern our interpretation of them. General themes of the reviews are that i) genetic signatures do not matter for defining neuronal types (here sympathetic versus parasympathetic); ii) that a cholinergic postganglionic autonomic neuron must be parasympathetic; and iii) that some physiology of the pelvic region would deserve the label “parasympathetic”. We answered the latter argument in (Espinosa-Medina et al., 2018) to which we refer the interested reader; and we fully disagree with the first two. Of note, part of the last sentence of the eLife assessment is misleading and does not reflect the referees’ comments. Our paper analyses genetic differences between the cranial and sacral outflow and uses them to argue that they cannot be both parasympathetic. The eLife assessment acknowledges the “genetic differences” but concludes that, somehow, they don’t detract from a common parasympathetic identity. We take issue with this paradox, of course, but it is coherent with the referee’s comments. On the other hand, the eLife assessment alone pushes the paradox one step further by stating that “functional differences” between the cranial and sacral outflows can’t either prevent them from being both parasympathetic. We would also object to this, but the only “functional differences” used by the referees to dismiss our diagnostic of a sympathetic-like character (rather than parasympathetic) for the sacral outflow are between noradrenergic and cholinergic, and between sympathetic and parasympathetic (and we also disagree with those, see above, and below) —not between cranial and sacral.</p>
<p>We will thus use the opportunity offered by eLife to keep the paper as it is (with a few minor stylistic changes). We respond below to the referees’ detailed remarks and hope that the publication, as per eLife new model, of the paper, the referees’ comments and our response will help move the field forward.</p>

<p>“Consistently, the P3 cluster of neurons is located close to sympathetic neuron clusters on the map, echoing the conventional understanding that the pelvic ganglia are mixed, containing both sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons”.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The greater closeness of P3 than of P1/2/4 to the sympathetic cluster can be used to judge P1/2/4 less sympathetic than P3 (and more… something else), but not more parasympathetic. There is no echo of the “conventional understanding” here.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“A closer look at the expression showed that some genes are expressed at higher levels in sympathetic neurons and in P2 cluster neurons ” [We assume that the referee means “in sympathetic neurons and in P3 cluster neurons”] but much weaker in P1, P2, and P4 neurons such as Islet1 and GATA2, and the opposite is true for SST. Another set of genes is expressed weakly across clusters, like HoxC6, HoxD4, GM30648, SHISA9, and TBX20.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These statements are inaccurate; On the one hand, the classification is not based on impression by visual inspection of the heatmap, but by calculations, using thresholds. Admittedly, the thresholds have an arbitrary aspect, but the referee can verify (by eye inspection of heatmap) that genes which we calculate as being  at “higher levels in sympathetic neurons and in P3 cluster neurons, but much weaker in P1, P2, and P4 neurons” or vice versa, i.e. noradrenergic or cholinergic neurons (genes from groups V and VI, respectively), have a much bigger difference than those cited by the referee, indeed are quasi-absent from the weaker clusters or ganglia. In addition, even by subjective eye inspection:</p>
<p>Islet is equally expressed in P4 and sympathetics.</p>
<p>SST is equally expressed in P1 and sympathetics.</p>
<p>Tbx20 is equally expressed in P2  and sympathetics.</p>
<p>HoxC6, HoxD4, GM30648, SHISA9 are equally expressed in all clusters and all sympathetic ganglia.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We do not simply show “genes expressed in pelvic ganglia, but not in rostral sphenopalatine ganglia, and vice versa”, i.e. a genetic distance between pelvic and sphenopalatine, but many genes expressed in all pelvic cells and sympathetic ones, i.e. a genetic proximity between pelvic and sympathetic. This situation can be deemed “unsurprising”, but it can only be used to question the parasympathetic nature of pelvic cells (as we do), or considered irrelevant (as the referee does, because genes would not define cell types, see our response to an equivalent stance by Referee#2). Concerning Hox genes, we do take them into account, and speculate in the discussion that their nested expression is key to the structure of the autonomic nervous system, including its division into sympathetic and parasympathetic outflows.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>This “minor revision of the anatomy” would make spinal preganglionic neurons which are universally considered sympathetic (in the thoraco-lumbar chord), synapse onto large numbers of parasympathetic neurons (in the paravertebral chains for sweat glands and periosteum, and in the pelvic ganglion), robbing these terms of any meaning.</p>
<p>Thus, from the functionality point of view, it is not justified to claim that &quot;pelvic organs receive no parasympathetic innervation&quot;.</p>
<p>There never was any general or rigorous functional definition of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems — it is striking, almost ironic, that Langley, creator of the term parasympathetic and the ultimate physiologist, provides an exclusively anatomic definition in his Autonomic Nervous System, Part I. Hence, our definition cannot clash with any “functionality point of view”. In fact, as we briefly say in the discussion and explore in (Espinosa-Medina et al., 2018), it is the “sacral parasympathetic” paradigm which is unjustified from a functionality point of view, for implying a functional antagonism across the lumbo-sacral gap, which has been disproven repeatedly. It remains to be determined which neurons are antagonistic to which on the blood vessels of the external genitals; antagonism within one division of the autonomic nervous system would not be without precedent (e.g. there exist both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator sympathetic neurons, and both, inhibitor and activator enteric motoneurons). The way to this question is finally open to research, and as referee#2 says “it is early days”.</p>

<p><bold>Public review by Referee #2</bold></p>
<p>This work further documents differences between the cranial and sacral parasympathetic outflows that have been known since the time of Langley - 100 years ago.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We assume that the referee means that it is the “cranial and sacral parasympathetic outflows” which “have been known since the time of Langley”, not their differences (that we would “further document”): the differences were explicitly negated by Langley. As a matter of fact, the sacral and cranial outflows were first likened to each other by Gaskell, 140 years ago (Gaskell, 1886). This anatomic parallel (which is deeply flawed (Espinosa-Medina et al., 2018)) was inherited wholesale by Langley, who added one physiological argument (Langley and Anderson, 1895) (which has been contested many times (Espinosa-Medina et al., 2018) and references within).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, the sphenopalatine and other cranial ganglia develop from placodes and the neural crest, while sympathetic and sacral ganglia develop from the neural crest alone.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Contrary to what the referee says, the sphenopalatine has no placodal contribution. There is no placodal contribution to any autonomic ganglion, sympathetic or parasympathetic (except an isolated claim concerning the ciliary ganglion (Lee et al., 2003)). All autonomic ganglia derive from the neural crest as determined a long time ago in chicken. For the sphenopalatine in mouse, see our own work (Espinosa-Medina et al., 2014).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>One feature that seems to set the pelvic ganglion apart is […] the convergence of preganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic synapses on individual ganglion cells (Figure 3).

</disp-quote>
<p>Contrary to what the referee says, we do not provide in Figure 3 any evidence for anatomic convergence, i.e. for individual pelvic ganglion cells receiving dual lumbar and sacral inputs. We simply show that cholinergic neurons figure prominently among targets of the lumbar pathway. This said, the convergence of both pathways on the same pelvic neurons, described in the references cited by the referee, is another major problem in the theory of the “sacral parasympathetic” (as we discussed previously (Espinosa-Medina et al., 2018)).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The clustering of Chat-positive and Th-positive cells could arise from a number of developmental mechanisms, that we have no idea of at the moment. This has no bearing on sympathetic and parasympathetic.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, Brunet et al dismiss the cholinergic and noradrenergic phenotypes as a basis for defining parasympathetic and parasympathetic neurons. However, see the bottom of Figure S4 and further counterarguments in Horn (Clin Auton Res (2018)).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The bottom of Figure S4 simply indicates which cells are cholinergic and adrenergic. We have already expounded many times that noradrenergic and cholinergic do not coincide with sympathetic and parasympathetic. Henry Dale (Nobel Prize 1936) demonstrated this. Langley himself devoted several pages of his final treatise to this exception to his “Theory on the relation of drugs to nerve system” (Langley, 1921) (p43) (which was actually a bigger problem for him than it is for us, for reason which are too long to recount here; it is as if the theoretical difficulties experienced by Langley had been internalized to this day in the form of a dismissal of the cholinergic sympathetic neurons as a slightly scandalous but altogether forgettable oddity). (Horn, 2018), reviews the evidence that the thoracic cholinergic sympathetic phenotype is brought about by a secondary switch upon interaction with the target and argues that this would be a fundamental difference with the sacral “parasympathetic”. But in fact the secondary switch is preceded by co-expression of ChAT and VAChT with Th in most sympathetic neurons (reviewed in (Ernsberger and Rohrer, 2018)); and we have no idea of the dynamic in the pelvic ganglion. It may also be mentioned in this context that target-dependent specification of neuronal identity has also been demonstrated of other types of sympathetic neurons ((Furlan et al., 2016)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What then about neuropeptides, whose expression pattern is incompatible with the revised nomenclature proposed by Brunet et al.?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There was never any neuropeptide-inspired criterion for a nomenclature of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 1B indicates that VIP is expressed by sacral and cranial ganglion cells, but not thoracolumbar ganglion cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Contrary to what the referee says, there are VIP-positive cells in our sympathetic data set and even strongly positive ones, except they are scattered and few (red bars on the UMAP). They correspond to cholinergic sympathetics, likely sudomotor, which are known to contain VIP (e.g.(Anderson et al., 2006)(Stanke et al., 2006)). In other words, VIP is probably part of what we call the cholinergic synexpression group (but was not placed in it by our calculations, probably because of a low expression level even in sympathetic noradrenergic cells).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors do not mention neuropeptide Y (NPY). The immunocytochemistry literature indicates that NPY is expressed by a large subpopulation of sympathetic neurons but never by sacral or cranial parasympathetic neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Contrary to what the referee says, Keast (Keast, 1995) finds 3.7% of  pelvic neurons double stained for NPY and VIP in male rats, and says (Keast, 2006) that in females “co-expression of NPY and VIP is common” ( thus in cholinergic neurons that the referee calls “parasympathetic”). Single cell transcriptomics is probably more sensitive than immunochemistry, and in our dichotomized data set (table S1), NPY is expressed in all pelvic clusters and all sympathetic ganglia. In other words, it is one more argument for their kinship. It does not appear in the heatmap because it ranks below the 100 top genes.</p>
