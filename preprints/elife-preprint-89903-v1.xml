<title>Abstract</title><p>Precise developmental timing control is essential for organism formation and function, but its mechanisms are unclear. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the microRNA <italic>lin-4</italic> plays a critical role in developmental timing. While <italic>lin-4</italic>’s downregulation of LIN-14 is well-established, the mechanisms behind <italic>lin-4</italic> upregulation remain unknown. We demonstrate that the membrane-associated transcription factor MYRF-1 is necessary for <italic>lin-4</italic> upregulation in late L1 stage. MYRF-1 is initially localized on the cell membrane, and its increased cleavage and nuclear accumulation coincide with <italic>lin-4</italic> expression timing. We show that MYRF-1 regulates <italic>lin-4</italic> expression cell-autonomously and that hyperactive MYRF-1 can prematurely drive <italic>lin-4</italic> expression in early L1 and embryos. The tandem <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter DNA recruits MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup> to form visible loci in the nucleus, suggesting that MYRF-1 directly acts on the <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter. Our findings identify a crucial link in understanding developmental timing regulation and establish MYRF-1 as a key regulator of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is during the embryonic stage that the basic form and pattern of organisms are mostly established. However, the majority of growth in animals occurs during post-embryonic stages[<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Some extreme examples are seen in insects undergoing metamorphosis and vertebrate amphibians[<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In many cases, there is often a considerable increase in body size, but profound transitions take place, such as neural circuitry remodeling throughout juvenile years and sexual maturation[3-6]. Undoubtedly, the genetic program determines how different species grow to different characteristic sizes and forms, yet such mechanisms remain largely unknown. One key question is how developmental timing is controlled.</p>
<p>When hatching out of their egg shells, the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits a miniature yet grossly similar form to adults, and demonstrates a set of behavioral abilities including sensory response, locomotion, and learning[<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They go through four larval stages before becoming fertile adults, and the transition between two consecutive larval stages is marked by a molting event. Changes in the temporal pattern of development are best exemplified by stage-specific cell division and differentiation of blast cells, as well as stage-specific epidermal cuticle formation fate. Such stage-specific patterns can be skipped or reiterated in so-called heterochronic mutants, and <italic>lin-4</italic> and <italic>lin-14</italic> are the two that have been studied in details[<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <italic>lin-4</italic> mutants exhibit complex cell lineage defects, including reiterated larval stage 1-specific cell division in some progenitors, while <italic>lin-14</italic> mutants exhibit precocious patterning where stage-specific events are skipped. The studies of these mutants led to the discovery of the first microRNA regulatory pathway as follows: The ubiquitously expressed nuclear factor LIN-14 promotes L1 patterns and suppresses progression to L2. The microRNA <italic>lin-4</italic> is upregulated during late L1, and suppresses LIN-14 post-transcriptionally, consequently initiating progression to L2 pattern[<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. <italic>lin-4</italic> - LIN-14 pair not only controls the division pattern of blast cells but also controls the maturation and plasticity of the neural circuit during L1-L2 transition[<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; <italic>lin-4</italic> is also involved in other diverse biological processes[<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The vertebrate ortholog of <italic>lin-4</italic>, known as <italic>miR-125</italic>, has been found to promote neuronal differentiation and maturation[<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
<p>What remains a mystery is the factors that trigger the expression of the <italic>lin-4</italic> microRNA during mid-late L1. It is known that the coding sequence of <italic>lin-4</italic> is embedded within an intron of a host gene, and its transcription uses its own promoter and bound Pol II complexes[<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Once produced, <italic>lin-4</italic> can self-enhance its own transcription by directly interacting with cis-elements in the promoter region[<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is also known that during embryonic stages, the transcription of <italic>lin-4</italic> is suppressed by FLYWCH transcriptional factors, but this suppression only extends until late embryogenesis[<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. What is not known is the regulation that turns on the <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription in late L1.</p>
<p>The onset of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression in late L1 is likely linked to the nutritional state. <italic>C. elegans</italic> needs to feed to initiate the post-embryonic developmental programs of the L1 stage. When newly hatched animals encounter an environment without food, they enter into a diapause state in which development is suspended, and they become more resistant to environmental stress. In the case of epidermal blast cell division, the cycling inhibitors are promoted by more activated FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 due to starvation, which suppresses the blast’s division[<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. During L1 diapause, <italic>lin-4</italic> expression is suppressed, but this suppression is largely independent of <italic>daf-16</italic>[<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], suggesting that <italic>lin-4</italic> expression onset during mid-late L1 under nutrient-rich environment is not a result of simple attenuation of <italic>daf-16</italic> activity. It is worth noting that external food signals are insufficient to drive <italic>lin-4</italic> expression as <italic>lin-4</italic> doesn’t promptly turn on when animals encounter food. Therefore, <italic>lin-4</italic> expression must reflect the combination of the decision of the internal nutritional state and developmental progression.</p>
<p>Another unique developmental event that occurs at late L1 is the synaptic rewiring of DD motor neurons[<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The process enables a structural and functional switch between dendritic and axonal domains of DDs without an obvious transition in gross neuronal morphology. We previously identified the membrane-bound transcription factor MYRF-1 as an essential positive regulator of synaptic rewiring in DDs[<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. MYRF-1 is broadly expressed, and <italic>myrf-1</italic> loss of function results in animals being arrested at the end of L1 or during L2. Intriguingly, the MYRF-1 protein is localized on the cell membrane during early and mid-L1 but increasingly undergoes self-cleavage towards late L1 in response to unidentified signaling mechanisms[<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The enzymatic reaction of cleavage is expected to occur after trimerization of full-length MYRF-1, which releases N-MYRF-1 in trimeric form[<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but the regulatory mechanisms underlying the process are unclear. Although MYRF-1’s essential role in regulating the development of animals (including humans) is well-established[<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>-<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the functional targets of MYRF-1 remain elusive. In the course of studying the genetic interaction between <italic>myrf-1</italic> and <italic>lin-14</italic>, we discovered that MYRF-1 is required for <italic>lin-4</italic> expression. We present data demonstrating that MYRF-1 is a direct, cell-autonomous driver of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression.</p>

<title>MYRF-1 is required for <italic>lin-4</italic> upregulation</title>
<p>The accumulation of <italic>lin-4</italic> microRNA occurs during mid to late L1, primarily due to an upregulation of transcription in <italic>lin-4</italic> primary RNA, as supported by multiple studies [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>](<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, C</xref>). We confirmed their findings by observing a P<italic>lin-4</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> (<italic>maIs134</italic>) reporter generated by Ambros group[<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], consisting of 2.4 kb of DNA sequences upstream of the mature <italic>lin-4</italic> fused to GFP. After its on-set, <italic>lin-4</italic> expression appears to constitutive and ubiquitous throughout the larval stages (see discussion). MYRF-1 is also expressed broadly in larvae, but unlike <italic>lin-4</italic>, MYRF-1 transcription is active in both embryos and early L1, with an increase in transcription observed towards late L1[<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, the activity of MYRF-1 as a transcription factor is determined by the presence of N-MYRF-1 in the nucleus[<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Initially, full-length MYRF-1 localizes to the cell membrane during early L1, and only during mid to late L1 is the processing of MYRF-1 cleavage increased, resulting in an elevated amount of N-MYRF-1 being released and shuttled into the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B). Therefore, the nuclear accumulation of N-MYRF-1 coincides with the upregulation of <italic>lin-4</italic> both temporally and spatially.</p>

<p>The mutation <italic>ju1121</italic>(<italic>G274R</italic>) in the MYRF-1 protein not only abolishes its DNA binding capability but also negatively interferes with its close paralogue MYRF-2, resulting in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> displaying phenotypic resemblance to double mutants of <italic>myrf-1</italic> and <italic>myrf-2</italic>[<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Animals with the <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> mutation exhibit developmental arrest at L2 and eventually perish during L2-L3 molting. We find that <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription reporter fails to be upregulated in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> at any viable stages that can be analyzed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, B). Similarly, another two loss of function mutants of <italic>myrf-1</italic>(<italic>syb1468</italic>) and <italic>myrf-1</italic>(<italic>syb1491</italic>) also shows a lack of <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription reporter signals (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A, B</xref>). Therefore, according to the 2.4 kb promoter reporter analysis, it is evident that the upregulation of <italic>lin-4</italic> is dependent on the presence of MYRF.</p>

</fig>
<p>To confirm the crucial role of MYRF in the upregulation of <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription during late L1 stage, we investigated how myrf influences <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription by employing a reporter system with a nuclearly localized mScarlet protein, endogenously inserted at the <italic>lin-4</italic> locus (<italic>umn84</italic>), wherein the reporter open reading frame replaced the primary RNA sequence of <italic>lin-4</italic>. Our observations revealed that mScarlet signals were not detected in embryos and early L1 larvae ((<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). However, these signals were significantly upregulated during late L1 stage and exhibited even stronger intensity in early L2 stage. Notably, in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> mutants, the mScarlet signals were largely absent throughout the body during late L1 stage (14h), except for an interesting presence in 8-9 nuclei in the posterior bulb of the pharynx, with intensity comparable to that observed in the wild-type counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, D, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>). The overall absence of <italic>lin-4</italic> upregulation persisted in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> mutants during early L2 stage (21h), except for the aforementioned subset of pharyngeal nuclei where the mScarlet signals increased, although the ascent was much weaker compared to the wild-type controls.</p>
<p>We carried out qPCR analysis using probes specifically targeting <italic>lin-4</italic> microRNA to examine endogenous <italic>lin-4</italic> expression in wild type and <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> mutants, and observed a significant reduction in the levels of mature <italic>lin-4</italic> microRNA in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). This decrease of mature <italic>lin-4</italic> microRNA has been further confirmed through microRNA sequencing analysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). These findings, combined with the analysis of endogenous <italic>lin-4</italic> reporter, provide compelling evidence supporting the critical role of MYRF in the upregulation of <italic>lin-4</italic> during the late L1 stage.</p>
<p>To investigate if MYRF-1 is continuously required for <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription after its initial upregulation, we used the auxin-inducible degradation (AID) system[<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We combined the ubiquitously expressed F-box protein TIR1 with degron-tagged MYRF-1 to acutely deplete MYRF-1 protein. The degradation was induced by treating animals at L2, L3, and L4 stages with an NAA solution, an auxin analog. Our results showed a significant reduction in the <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription reporter signals in animals of all tested stages within 10 hours’ post-treatment (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). This demonstrates that MYRF-1 is necessary for <italic>lin-4</italic> expression throughout the larval stages.</p>

<title>Sustained high level of LIN-14 protein in <italic>myrf-1</italic> mutants</title>
<p>The LIN-14 protein is typically present in embryos and early L1 but is downregulated as development progresses. Loss of the microRNA <italic>lin-4</italic> leads to sustained high levels of LIN-14 protein throughout larval development[<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To investigate how <italic>myrf-1</italic> mutations may affect LIN-14, we examined the signals of endogenously tagged LIN-14::GFP in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> mutants[<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The LIN-14::GFP signal remains bright and shows no signs of decreasing at late L1 and beyond in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B), consistent with the low levels of <italic>lin-4</italic> microRNA observed in the mutants.</p>

<title>MYRF-1 regulates <italic>lin-4</italic> expression cell-autonomously</title>
<p>Although MYRF is essential for larval development, there is limited understanding of how MYRF specifically affects tissues and cells during development. Identifying <italic>lin-4</italic> as a potential transcriptional target of MYRF-1, we aimed to investigate how MYRF-1 may regulate <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription. The primary question is whether MYRF-1 promotes <italic>lin-4</italic> expression in target cells or whether MYRF-1 acts to modify unidentified systemic signals that subsequently lead to upregulation of <italic>lin-4</italic> in terminal cells.</p>
<p>We conducted tissue-specific rescue experiments by expressing MYRF-1 under the <italic>myo-3</italic> promoter, which is specific to body wall muscles, in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> mutants. We observed a significant induction of <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription in body wall muscles but not in other tissues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We also used the epidermis-specific promoter of <italic>dpy-7</italic>, a collagen, for another MYRF-1 rescue experiment, which resulted in the appearance of <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription reporter signals only in the epidermis. Interestingly, the reporter GFP signals were not detected in the seam cells, a group of specialized epidermal cells embedded in the large syncytium epidermal hpy7 cell. Seam cells are derived from the epidermal lineage and also express the <italic>dpy-7</italic> gene; however, this experiment used a short promoter of <italic>dpy-7</italic>, which is not activated in seam cells, thus excluding the induction of <italic>lin-4</italic> in these cells. These results demonstrate that MYRF regulates <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription autonomously within specific cells.</p>

<p>One possible explanation for the deficiency of <italic>lin-4</italic> upregulation in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> mutants is that it may be due to overall developmental arrest in L2. To investigate this possibility, we generated a conditional allele of <italic>myrf-1</italic><sup>LoxP</sup>(<italic>ybq98</italic>) using CRISPR-Cas9 editing. We then obtained an epidermis-specific Cre-expressing transgene and combined it with the <italic>myrf-1</italic><sup>LoxP</sup> allele in animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, C). Our analysis showed that the <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription reporter signals in the epidermis are lost in animals with the combined Cre transgene and <italic>myrf-1</italic><sup>loxP</sup> allele, while the signals were still present in all surrounding tissues. These results provide further evidence that MYRF-1 promotes <italic>lin-4</italic> upregulation cell autonomously and suggest that MYRF-1 acts directly in terminal tissues to regulate cell development.</p>

<title>Hyperactive form of MYRF-1 drives premature expression of <italic>lin-4</italic></title>
<p>The next question was whether MYRF-1 is sufficient to drive the upregulation of <italic>lin-4</italic>. Because of the intricate nature of regulated MYRF-1 cleavage, overexpressing full-length MYRF-1 by transgene does not enhance its transcriptional activity effectively, as excess MYRF-1 is unable to traffic to the cell membrane or undergo adequate cleavage[<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Overexpressing N-MYRF-1 alone is also insufficient as it unlikely forms trimers efficiently. In another study, we have identified elements of the cleavage mechanism, which we will report in another manuscript. Using this information, we created a truncated form of MYRF-1 (deleting 601-650) that is expected to bypass the need for cell-membrane trafficking and circumvent the developmental signals that control cleavage. We expected that overexpressing this modified MYRF-1 would produce abundant N-MYRF-1 in trimeric form and enhance its endogenous function.</p>
<p>In this experiment, we used the endogenously mScarlet-tagged line to report the transcription activity of <italic>lin-4 (umn84)</italic>. As mentioned earlier, mScarlet expression is not detected in embryos and early L1 larvae (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We find that overexpressing the hyperactive MYRF-1(Δ601-650) driven by the ubiquitous promoter <italic>rpl-28</italic> is detrimental to larval development, as all F1 progenies with the transgene arrest at early larval stages. Strikingly, expressing this hyperactive MYRF-1 variant causes upregulation of <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription reporter in both embryos and early L1 larvae, indicating that MYRF-1 alone is sufficient to activate <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Given that <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription is suppressed by FLYWCH during embryogenesis and by distinct yet unidentified mechanisms during early L1, MYRF-1 may play a predominant role in promoting <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription.</p>

<p>In our previous study, we characterized a mutant of <italic>myrf-1<sup>1-700</sup>(syb1313)</italic> that exhibited precocious synaptic remodeling and M-cell division during mid-late L1, albeit in a discordant manner[<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our analysis of MYRF-1<sup>1-700</sup> localization led us to infer that MYRF-1(syb1313) functions as a constitutively active protein in specific cell types, but weakly and inconsistently. In the current study, we investigated the expression of the <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription reporter in <italic>myrf-1(syb1313)</italic> and observed a clear upregulation of the reporter in the mutants, especially in neurons, at 6 hours, while it was undetectable in wild-type animals at this stage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, D). It is worth noting that at the time (15h) when <italic>lin-4</italic> is typically upregulated in wild-type animals, the reporter GFP expression is significantly absent in the pharynx and epidermis of <italic>myrf-1(syb1313)</italic> mutants. However, there is sustained, higher-than-wild type expression of the reporter GFP in neurons of these mutants. Considering the precocious phenotype observed in DD neurons in <italic>myrf-1(syb1313)</italic>, these data support that hyperactive MYRF-1 promotes the premature transcription of <italic>lin-4</italic>.</p>
<p>We conducted further analysis to investigate the impact of <italic>myrf-1<sup>1-700</sup>(syb1313)</italic> on the endogenously tagged mScarlet <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription reporter. In the mutants, we observed premature upregulation of mScarlet signals in a subset of nuclei, likely neurons based on their position and nucleus size, at 6 hours (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, F). As mutant animals progressed towards late L1 (14h), the signal intensity significantly increased and remained consistently higher compared to the wild type controls. From this stage on, while the mScarlet signals in many wild type individuals were still in the process of upregulation, the signal intensity in <italic>myrf-1<sup>1-700</sup>(syb1313)</italic> mutants did not exhibit a comparable sustained increase. This observation aligns with our assessment of <italic>myrf-1<sup>1-700</sup>(syb1313)</italic> mutants, indicating an inconsistent precocity and developmental progression deficiency. Nonetheless, these results strongly support the notion that hyperactive MYRF can precociously activate endogenous <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in <italic>myrf-1<sup>1-700</sup>(syb1313)</italic> mutants, the mScarlet signals exhibit strong upregulation in a few nuclei located in the posterior bulb of the pharynx at 14 hours, in comparison to the wild type (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, F). These cells appear to belong to the same subset, as determined by their position and pattern, where the mScarlet signals have not experienced a significant decrease as observed in many other neighboring cells when MYRF function is lost (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, D). This result indicates that hyperactive MYRF indeed enhances <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription in this specific subset of pharyngeal cells. However, it is noticeable that at 6 hours, the mScarlet signals in these nuclei of <italic>myrf-1<sup>1-700</sup>(syb1313)</italic> mutants are not as bright as nearby neurons, suggesting that MYRF-1<sup>1-700</sup> does not activate <italic>lin-4</italic> expression effectively in these pharyngeal nuclei at early L1.</p>
<p>The strong induction of mScarlet signals in these pharyngeal nuclei at late L1 and onwards in <italic>myrf-1<sup>1-700</sup>(syb1313)</italic> mutants contrasts with the lack of <italic>maIs134</italic> signals in the pharynx of the mutants. One possible explanation for this contrasting expression pattern is the presence of additional pharynx-enhancing elements located outside the 2.4 kb promoter region of <italic>lin-4</italic> used in the <italic>maIs134</italic> transgene. Alternatively, it should be considered that the threshold for transcription factor activation required to drive the expression of the endogenous reporter (mScarlet) versus the multicopy DNA array reporter (<italic>maIs134</italic>) is likely different. Therefore, resolving this discrepancy would require further investigation.</p>

<title>MYRF-1 interacts with <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter directly</title>
<p>We next investigated whether MYRF-1 physically binds to <italic>lin-4</italic> regulatory sequences to regulate <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription. Gel mobility shift assays are commonly used to test the direct interaction between protein and DNA fragments. A series of MYRF-1 variants were expressed in HEK cells by transfection, and cell lysis was tested for their binding with 498 bp DNA of the <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter. None of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> MYRF-1 variants including full-length and N-MYRF-1<sup>1-482</sup> display significant binding with 498 bp <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter. This negative result is difficult to interpret considering when <italic>C. elegans</italic> MYRF-1 is expressed HEK cell lines, they do not assemble into trimer nor be cleaved (while mammalian MYRF does) for unknown reasons[<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which may render them incompetent to bind target DNA.</p>
<p>While analyzing <italic>Plin-4-GFP(maIs134)</italic>, we observed that the multicopy transgene of <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter DNA caused unexpected developmental abnormalities in animals. Previously, we used combined alleles, <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> along with a rescuing multicopy transgene <italic>myrf-1</italic><sup>LoxP</sup>(<italic>ybqIs112</italic>) for the conditional ablation of <italic>myrf-1</italic>[<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In our current study, we introduced the <italic>Pdpy-7-Cre</italic> transgene into the combined-conditional <italic>myrf-1</italic> alleles (<italic>ju1121</italic>-<italic>ybqIs112</italic>) to examine <italic>maIs134</italic> expression in the epidermis where <italic>myrf-1</italic> is to be ablated. We observed a certain percentage of dauers emerging on plates even when the food <italic>E.

</fig>
<p>Because wild type <italic>C. elegans</italic> would never become dauer before the food runs out, this type of dauer formation is only associated with certain types of mutants, termed as the constitutive dauer formation (Daf-C). With intrigue, we initially thought that the dauer is due to the loss of <italic>myrf-1</italic> in the epidermis; however, the <italic>maIs134</italic> transgene animals themselves produce a low percentage of Daf-C, although the combinatorial effect of the conditional <italic>myrf-1</italic> alleles (<italic>ju1121</italic>-<italic>ybqIs112</italic>) and epidermal-Cre remains to be characterized. We also noticed that animals carrying <italic>maIs134</italic> invariably develop slower than wild-type animals, even though they show no obvious defect in becoming adults and in fertility (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-F</xref>). The developmental delay starts from L2 and onwards based on their appearance and body length measurement. The L2 animals of <italic>maIs134</italic> are typically darker, longer, fatter than normal L2 animals and resemble pre-dauer (L2d) animals in gross morphology (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). We interpret the Daf-C phenotype in <italic>maIs134</italic> with the reasoning that the transgene containing tandem array of <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter DNA sequestered a significant amount of the MYRF-1 protein, causing MYRF-1 to drop to such a low level that impedes normal development. A salient phenotype of <italic>myrf-1</italic> mutants is developmental arrest after all. If the hypothesis was true, expressing more MYRF-1 in <italic>maIs134</italic> animals might suppress the Daf-C phenotype. In the rescuing transgene <italic>myrf-1</italic><sup>LoxP</sup>(<italic>ybqIs112</italic>) MYRF-1 protein is expected to increase slightly more than its endogenous level. This notion is indeed consistent with the observation that <italic>ybqIs112</italic> transgene completely suppressed the slow-growth phenotype in <italic>maIs134</italic>, as well as the Daf-C (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-D</xref>), suggesting that the transgene of <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter DNA negatively interferes with the normal function of MYRF-1 in development.</p>
<p>These observations prompted us to investigate further whether the transgene array of <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter DNA effectively binds a significant amount of MYRF-1 protein. To test this, we injected the <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter (498 bp or 2.4 kb) reporter plasmid into <italic>myrf-1</italic><sup>GFP</sup>(<italic>ybq14</italic>), and remarkably, we detected some puncta of intensified GFP signals in a subset of nuclei in animals carrying transgene (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G-I</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>). This suggests that the MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup> protein is condensed in discrete nuclear locations, a phenomenon that we never observed in wild type <italic>myrf-1</italic><sup>GFP</sup>(<italic>ybq14</italic>) animals. To determine the specificity of their interaction, we designed a plasmid of <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter DNA without the sequence encoding RFP or GFP, and a second plasmid containing 7x TetO sequence to be bound by TetR. We generated a line of ubiquitously expressed TetR DNA binding domain fused with RFP (TetR::RFP) as a single copy transgene (<italic>ybqSi233</italic>) to ensure consistent expression of TetR::RFP at a moderate level (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, H). The formation of the TetO tandem DNA array indeed led to the formation of TetR::RFP puncta, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method. The presence of RFP puncta can then mark the location of DNA arrays in the nucleus. The formation of the TetO DNA array alone was insufficient to sequester MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup>, while only the addition of the <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter DNA into the tandem array caused the emergence of the MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup> puncta, indicating the specificity of the <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter-MYRF-1 interaction. Therefore, the collection of serendipitous observations and the nuclear loci co-labelling <italic>in vivo</italic> supports the direct regulator role of MYRF-1 in driving <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription.</p>

<title>MYRF-1 regulates a selective subset of microRNAs during L1-L2 transition</title>
<p>We wanted to investigate the extent to which MYRF-1’s transcriptional activity might affect the landscape of microRNA expression in genome, as microRNAs often have stronger effects when present in combination with homologous microRNAs or in synergy with other microRNA families[<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We performed microRNA-targeted sequencing analysis on <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> mutants of late L1 (16 hours) compared to controls. The sequencing analysis showed that a small subset of microRNA species was differentially expressed between <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> and control animals (P&lt;0.05) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). We performed a phylogenetic analysis to analyze the relationships between these microRNA species (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Remarkably, 6 out of the 7 up-regulated microRNAs are clustered on one phylogenetic branch, which is separate from the other two. Among the differentially expressed, <italic>lin-4</italic> was the most decreased gene, consistent with our present analysis on <italic>lin-4</italic>. We then selected several candidates of relative abundance and examined their expression using transcriptional reporters. We generated single copy insertion transgenes carrying 2 kb upstream sequences of the candidate microRNA and eventually obtained lines for <italic>mir-48</italic>, <italic>mir-73</italic>, and <italic>mir-230</italic> showing consistent GFP signals (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, D). The <italic>mir-48</italic> reporter (<italic>ybqSi206</italic>) was decreased, while <italic>mir-73</italic> (<italic>ybqSi208</italic>) and <italic>mir-230</italic> (<italic>ybqSi209</italic>) were increased in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic> at early L2, thus confirming the microRNA sequencing results. Notably, all three microRNAs were increased from L1 to L2 by transcriptional reporter; among the three, <italic>mir-48</italic> reporter is hardly detected in L1 and shows the most dramatic upregulation when animals transition to L2. The loss of <italic>myrf-1</italic> significantly decreased <italic>mir-48</italic>’s upregulation, but did not completely block it as it did with <italic>lin-4</italic>. <italic>mir-48</italic> belongs to the <italic>let-7</italic> microRNA family, and two other family members, <italic>mir-84</italic> and <italic>mir-241</italic>, were also downregulated in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121)</italic>, while <italic>let-7</italic>, the founding member, itself was upregulated in the mutants. Among the microRNAs upregulated in the <italic>myrf-1</italic> mutants, <italic>mir-42</italic> belongs to the <italic>mir-35</italic> family, which is essential for embryogenesis, and <italic>mir-71</italic> has been extensively studied for its upregulation in adults and regulatory role in aging. At this stage, it is unclear how these candidate microRNAs may be involved in regulating post-embryonic development, but our results suggest an intricate genetic circuit in which MYRF-1’s activity may either enhance or dampen the expression of select microRNA species.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study reveals that the nuclear accumulation of released N-terminal MYRF-1 increases from mid L1 to late L1, coinciding with the upregulation of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression. We demonstrated that MYRF-1 is essential for the upregulation of <italic>lin-4</italic> in terminal tissues in L1 and also required for <italic>lin-4</italic> expression throughout the larval stages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Our data support the direct, predominant role of MYRF-1 in driving <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription.</p>
<p>While <italic>lin-4</italic> expression appears to be constitutive after late L1 by stable GFP reporter, the analysis with higher temporal resolution showed that it exhibits oscillation in each larval stage[<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The periodic activation of <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription is likely driven by poorly understood oscillation gene regulatory circuits, some of which include <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of human circadian clock genes[<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>-<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Recent work has begun to reveal the regulation mechanisms underlying oscillating <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription[<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. BLMP-1/PRDM1 functions as a nutrient-stimulated priming factor to decompact the <italic>lin-4</italic> locus and boost the amplitude of <italic>lin-4</italic> oscillation[<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is worth noting that the expression of BLMP-1 itself does not oscillate. However, two other oscillating nuclear hormone receptors, NHR-85/Rev-Erb and NHR-23/ROR, promote <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription, ensuring its precise oscillation timing[<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These two receptors are the closest nematode orthologs of human circadian transcription factors Rev-Erb and ROR, respectively. The expression of NHR-85 is downregulated post-transcriptionally by LIN-42/PERIOD, another ortholog of the human circadian factor[<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. LIN-42/PERIOD peaks in each cycle, but lags behind NHR-85 and NHR-23. Although the interactions between BLMP-1, NHR-85, and NHR-23 constitute an attractive model for explaining the oscillation of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression, it remains unclear to what extent the upregulation of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression, particularly during late L1, relies on these factors. For instance, there is a lack of description regarding the impact of BLMP-1, NHR-85, and NHR-23 mutants on endogenous <italic>lin-4</italic> expression. Exploring how MYRF-1 interacts with the three components of <italic>lin-4</italic> oscillation control—BLMP-1, the NHR-85 and NHR-23 pair, and LIN-42—would be an interesting direction for further study.</p>
<p>Similar to the orthologs of circadian genes, <italic>myrf-1</italic> mRNA exhibits oscillation in each larval stage as part of an oscillation scheme consisting of over 3000 genes oscillating at specific phases in each cycle[<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These gene expression patterns, including <italic>lin-4</italic>, are halted during acute food removal/starvation, indicating that cycle progression is regulated by nutritional state[<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Our report includes the partial dauer-constitutive phenotype caused by the interaction between the <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter DNA and MYRF-1. Although we do not fully understand the phenomenon, it clearly points to a link between MYRF-1 activity and nutrient state. Investigating how MYRF-1 responds to nutrient signals, what transcriptional outcome it produces, and its position in the regulatory circuit of oscillation will be important topics for future investigation.</p>

<title>Taqman real time PCR analysis for miRNA lin-4</title>
<p>Samples for Taqman Real-Time PCR Assays were prepared from wild type N2 and BLW252 [myrf-1(ju1121)/mIn1] strains at three stages: Early L1 (0h), Late L1 (16h), and Early L2 (21h). The worms were screened for size and fluorescence marker of the desired transgene using Biosorter. myrf-1(ju1121) mutants lack the pharyngeal GFP, which serves as a transgene marker of balancer mIn1, as a criterion in sorting process. More than 2,000 worms were collected for each sample after the Biosorter process.</p>
<p>RNA extraction was carried out using RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions with some modifications. Briefly, 1 ml of RNAiso Plus was added to each sample, which was homogenized using a pre-cooled grinder. The homogenization buffer was then transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and allowed to stand at room temperature (15 – 30°C) for 5 – 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 200 µl of chloroform was added and shaken for 30 s until the mixture turned milky. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000g at 4°C for 15 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube. To the supernatant, 0.5 ml of isoamylol was added and left to stand for 10 min at room temperature, then centrifuged at 12,000g at 4°C for 60 min. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet was washed with 75% ethanol at 12,000g, 4°C for 60 min, and then dissolved in 20 µl of DEPC-treated water. The concentration of miRNA was determined using Nanodrop, and its quality was assessed through electrophoresis. Each experiment was performed using at least three replicates. The TAKARA RNA reverse transcription kit (6110A) was used to perform RNA reverse transcription following the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of the resulting product was measured using Nanodrop, and its quality was evaluated through electrophoresis. The Taqman real-time PCR was conducted according to the Taqman small RNA assay protocol. Initially, the concentration of each sample was diluted to below 10 ng/µl, followed by reverse transcription PCR using the Taqman microRNA RT kit (4366596). Subsequently, the Taqman real-time PCR mixture was prepared using Taqman small RNA assay (20X) with lin-4a (21nt) (ID: 000258) and sn2323 (ID: 001760) as the internal control. Each sample was tested using at least three technical replicates and three biological replicates. The Taqman real-time PCR was carried out using Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermofisher), and all the procedures were followed as per the instructions. To determine the relative changes of each sample in each assay, the lin-4 Ct of technical replicates was averaged and then subtracted by the average sn2323 Ct to obtain the △CT value for each sample. Within each biological replicate and assay, the difference between the △CT of each sample and the △CT of wild type at Early L1 was calculated to obtain △△CT. The 2 to the power of △△CT was then calculated to obtain the fold change in each sample compared to the wild type at Early L1.

<p>In this work, the authors set out to ask whether the MYRF family of transcription factors, represented by myrf-1 and myrf-2 in C. elegans, have a role in the temporally controlled expression of the miRNA lin-4. The precisely timed onset of lin-4 expression in the late L1 stage is known to be a critical step in the developmental timing (&quot;heterochronic&quot;) pathway, allowing worms to move from the L1 to the L2 stage of development. Despite the importance of this step of the pathway, the mechanisms that control the onset of lin-4 expression are not well understood.</p>
<p>Overall, the paper provides convincing evidence that MYRF factors have a role in the regulation of lin-4 expression. However, some of the details of this role remain speculative, and some of the authors' conclusions are not fully supported by the studies shown. These limitations arise from three concerns. First, the authors rely heavily on a transcriptional reporter (maIs134) that is known not to contain all of the regulatory elements relevant for lin-4 expression. Second, the authors use mutant alleles with unusual properties that have not been completely characterized, making a definitive interpretation of the results difficult. Third, some conclusions are drawn from circumstantial or indirect evidence that does not use field-standard methods.</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate that the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of MYRF-1 coincides with the activation of lin-4 expression, making MYRF-1 a good candidate for mediating this activation. However, the evidence that MYRF-1 is required for the activation of lin-4 is somewhat incomplete. The authors provide convincing evidence that lin-4 activation fails in animals carrying the unusual mutation myrf-1(ju1121), which the authors describe as disrupting both myrf-1 and myrf-2 activity. The concern here is that it is difficult to rule out that ju1121 is not also disrupting the activity of other factors, and it does not disentangle the roles of myrf-1 and myrf-2. Partially alleviating this issue, they also find that expression from the maIs134 reporter is disrupted in putative myrf-1 null alleles, but making inferences from maIs134 about the regulation of endogenous lin-4 is problematic. Helpfully, an endogenous Crispr-generated lin-4 reporter allele is used in some studies, but only using the ju1121 allele. Together, these findings provide solid evidence that MYRF factors probably do have a role in lin-4 activation, but the exact roles of myrf-1 and myrf-2 remain unclear because of limitations of the unusual ju1121 allele and the use of the maIs134 reporter. The creative use of a conditional myrf-1 alleles (floxed and using the AID system) partially overcomes these concerns, providing strong evidence that myrf-1 acts cell-autonomously to regulate lin-4, though again, these key experiments are only carried out with the maIs134 transgene.</p>
<p>A second important question asked by the authors is whether MYRF activity is sufficient to activate lin-4 expression. The authors provide evidence that supports this idea, but this support is somewhat incomplete, because the authors rely partially on the maIs104 array and, more importantly, on mutant alleles of MYRF-1 that they propose are constitutively active but are not completely characterized here.</p>
<p>The authors also approach the question of whether MYRF-1 regulates lin-4 via direct interaction with its promoter. The evidence presented here is consistent with this idea, but it relies on indirect evidence involving genetic interactions between myrf-1 and the presence of multiple copies of the lin-4 promoter, as well as the detection of nuclear foci of MYRF-1::GFP in the presence of multiple copies of the lin-4 promoter. This is not the field-standard approach for testing this kind of hypothesis, and the positive control presented (using the TetR/TetO interaction) is unconvincing. Thus, the evidence here is consistent with the authors' hypothesis, but the studies shown are incomplete and do not represent a rigorous test of this possibility.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors ask whether MYRF factors have a role in the regulation of other miRNAs. The evidence provided (RNAseq experiments, validated by several reporter transgenes) solidly supports this idea, with the provision that it is not completely clear that ju1121 is disrupting only the activity of myrf-1 and myrf-2.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors attempt to examine how the temporal expression of the lin-4 microRNA is transcriptionally regulated. However, the experimental support for some claims is incomplete. The authors repeatedly use the ju1121(G247R) mutation of myrf-1, but more information is required to evaluate their claim that this mutation &quot;abolishes its DNA binding capability but also negatively interferes with its close paralogue MYRF-2&quot;. Additionally, in the lin-4 scarlet endogenous transcriptional reporter, the lin-4 sequence is removed. Since lin-4 has been reported to autoregulate, it seems possible that the removal of lin-4 coding sequence could influence reporter expression. Further, concrete evidence for direct lin-4 regulation by MYRF-1 is lacking, as the approaches used are indirect and not standard in the field. Overall, while the aims of the work are mostly achieved, data regarding the direct regulation of lin-4 by MYRF-1 and placing the work into the context of previous related reports is lacking. Because of its very specific focus, this paper reports useful findings on how a single transcription factor family might control the expression of a microRNA.</p>

<p>We express our gratitude to the editors for acknowledging the significance of our findings and
facilitating the review process. We would also like to thank the reviewers for dedicating their
time to thoroughly read the manuscript and provide valuable insights.</p>
<p>During the revision process, we will address the raised issues and concerns, confident that our
revisions will enhance the clarity and strength of the paper.</p>
<p>In response to the reviewers' feedback, we acknowledge that some of the relevant information
was previously presented in our published papers (Meng, Dev Cell. 2017; Xia, Elife. 2021).
However, we recognize that in the current version of the manuscript, we may not have
expounded on these details as clearly as needed. We will rectify this shortcoming in the revised
version to provide a more comprehensive account of our research.</p>
<p>We also explain our perspective on why the discovery of MYRF controlling lin-4 upregulation is
crucial in addressing unanswered key questions in developmental biology.</p>
<p>The Loss of Function Characteristics of myrf-1(ju1121 G274R)</p>
<p>We would like to present the evidence supporting the characteristics of myrf-1(ju1121) as a
loss-of-function mutation affecting both myrf-1 and myrf-2. In our initial paper (Meng, Dev Cell.
2017), the nature of this mutation was a significant focus of our research.</p>
<p>Our investigation involved analyzing multiple alleles (tm, ok, gk alleles from CGC, and indel
alleles made in-house) of myrf-1 and myrf-2, as well as their double mutants. Here is a summary
of our current understanding based on these analyses:</p>
<p>1. myrf-1 single loss-of-function (l.f.) mutants exhibit penetrant arrest at the end of L1 or
early L2 stages. However, they only display very mild deficiency in DD synpatic
remodeling at 21 hours, primarily caused by a delay.</p>
<p>2. myrf-2 single l.f. mutants behave similarly to the wild type, exhibiting no significant
developmental abnormalities, including synpatic remodeling.</p>
<p>3. myrf-1 and myrf-2 double l.f. mutants exhibit penetrant arrest during L2, occurring
approximately half a stage later than in myrf-1 single mutants.</p>
<p>4. Remarkably, myrf-1 and myrf-2 double l.f. mutants exhibit severe blockage in synaptic
remodeling, indicating that both genes act collaboratively to drive this essential process
(Meng, Figure 5).</p>
<p>5. The myrf-1(ju1121 G274R) mutation exhibits severe synaptic remodeling blockage and
arrest during L2, closely resembling myrf-1 myrf-2 double mutants (Meng, Figure 1 and
2).</p>
<p>Therefore, despite myrf-1's more significant role in development based on the arrest
phenotype, synaptic remodeling requires the combined function of myrf-1 and myrf-2. This
redundancy is further supported by the analysis of the new set of specific myrf-1 mutants (Xia,
Figure 6).</p>
<p>Both myrf-1 and myrf-2 are broadly expressed (Meng, Figure 3 and S5), and they undergo
developmentally regulated cell-membrane to nucleus translocation (Xia, Figure 4 and
Supplement 1). Overexpressing N-MYRF-1 and full-length MYRF-2 in DD neurons leads to
precocious synaptic remodeling (Meng, Figure 4 and 5). Interestingly, overexpressing full-length
myrf-1 does not have the same effect, indicating potential regulatory differences between these
two factors.</p>
<p>The myrf-1(ju1121 G274R) mutation is located in the N-terminal region of the Ig-fold type DNA-binding domain, specifically within the loop between a and b Ig-fold strands. This site is
conserved across all metazoan MYRFs (Meng, Figure 1D and 6A). The mutant myrf-1(G274R)
loses its DNA binding ability, as demonstrated by a gel mobility shift assay using the counterpart
residue mutation in mammalian MYRF (Meng, Figure 6B).</p>
<p>MYRF-1(ju1121 G274R) mutant interfering with normal MYRF’s function has been supported by
molecular genetics experiments (Meng, Figure 6C-E) and biochemical analysis. In essence, the
MYRF-1(G274R) mutant does not impact MYRF trimerization or MYRF-1-MYRF-2 interaction, but
blocks DNA binding. Substantial evidence has confirmed the physical binding of MYRF-1 and
MYRF-2 both in vitro and in vivo (Meng, Figure 5G and S6; Xia, Figure 1A). Importantly, MYRF-
1(ju1121 G274R) is still able to bind to MYRF-2, as supported by coIP analysis (Meng, Figure S7),
indicating that the G274R mutation does not disrupt the MYRF-1-MYRF-2 interaction. This
observation is consistent with the characteristics of the MYRF structure (PMID: 28160598;
PMID: 34345217). The critical interface of the MYRF trimer is located in the alpha-helix
upstream of the ICE domain, the beta sheets of the ICE, and the beta-helix of the bridge region
between ICE and DBD. Therefore, since MYRF-1(ju1121 G274R) is not situated in this critical
interface of the MYRF trimer, it is unlikely that the mutation affects MYRF trimerization.</p>
<p>With all available evidence, we propose a reasonable model where myrf-1(ju1121) has two
effects: rendering myrf-1 defective in DNA binding and negatively interfering with MYRF-2 by
forming a non-functional trimer consisting of monomer MYRF-1(ju1121) and wild-type MYRF-2.</p>
<p>Regarding the potential neomorphic function of myrf-1(ju1121), the myrf-1(ju1121)/+
individuals appear superficially wild type and show no defects in synaptic remodeling.
Furthermore, we have generated a myrf-1 minigene array that results in a complete rescue of
the developmental phenotype in myrf-1(ju1121) (Meng, Figure 3A-D). Notably, the transgene is
expected to be low copy numbered, as it was generated by injecting at a very low concentration of 0.1 ng/μl. The complete rescue of the phenotype strongly suggests that any potential
aberrant effects caused by myrf-1(ju1121) mutants are minimal.</p>
<p>In summary, myrf-1(ju1121) behaves similarly to myrf-1 myrf-2 double mutants, and we utilized
this allele for the convenience of analysis.</p>
<p>Due to the essential role of MYRF-controlled processes in larval development and the lack of
detectable phenotypic effects in myrf-2 single loss-of-function mutants, it is evident that myrf-2
plays a minor role in these developmental events. Considering that development regulation
rarely follows a simple linear or accumulative fashion, deciphering the relative contributions of
each myrf-1 and myrf-2 in specific developmental events may not be straightforward.
Consequently, our primary focus remains on investigating the functions of myrf-1.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we concur that providing a clear description of the impact of myrf-1 and myrf-2
single mutants on lin-4 expression is crucial. We are actively conducting ongoing analyses, and
the new findings will be incorporated in the revised version of our manuscript.</p>
<p>Characterizing myrf-1(syb1313, 1-700) as a Hyperactive Allele of myrf-1</p>
<p>The cleavage and release of N-MYRF are developmentally regulated and occur in late L1. We
have substantial evidence supporting the interaction between the non-cytoplasmic region of
MYRF and another transmembrane protein, PAN-1, which is crucial for delivering MYRF onto the
cell membrane (Xia, Figure 1, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 13). The myrf-1(syb1313, 1-700) mutant lacks the
non-cytoplasmic region of MYRF, which is the interaction site for PAN-1. Initial analyses revealed
that in the mutants, MYRF-1(syb1313) remains in the cytoplasmic, ER-like structure, resulting in
larval arrest during L2 (Xia, Figure 8).</p>
<p>However, a more careful analysis unveiled that a small amount of N-MYRF is processed and
enters the nucleus, but this process is not dependent on the normal developmental timing and
may take place during early-mid L1. Consequently, this leads to precocious yet discordant DD
synaptic remodeling and M-cell lineage division (Xia, Figure 6 and 9). Considering the precocious
development, the low quantity of nuclear N-MYRF, and the overall larval arrest phenotype
observed in the mutants, we conclude that myrf-1(syb1313) represents an inconsistent, weak
hyperactive form of MYRF-1. Moreover, the hyperactive function may be context-dependent, for
instance, presence of myrf-1(syb1313) may be sufficient for certain needs in neurons but
insufficient for epidermis. Our ongoing research to identify the downstream targets of MYRF
also supports this notion.</p>
<p>Given that the myrf-1(syb1313) mutant has been thoroughly characterized and published, it is
the most suitable option for use in our current investigations on lin-4 expression.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we employed the MYRF-1(delete 601-650) deletion mutant construct, which is a
significantly more effective hyperactive MYRF-1 mutant when overexpressed. This reagent stems from our ongoing study, which is dedicated to identifying the self-inhibitory mechanisms
of MYRF cleavage. The extensive volume of data that led to this discovery makes it impractical
to include in the current manuscript. However, we are eager to share the substantial effects of
MYRF-1(delete 601-650) mutants in activating lin-4 expression, which strengthens the role of
MYRF in regulating lin-4. We will take care to revise this section to provide clearer references.</p>
<p>The lin-4p::nls::mScarlet(umn84) knock-in reporter is loss-of-function for lin-4; however, lin-4
mature microRNA does not affect lin-4 expression.</p>
<p>Indeed, the lin-4 knock-in reporter umn84 removes lin-4 coding sequence. As a result, the
homozygous reporter strain is also lin-4 null mutants. Since both lin-4 and myrf-1 are located on
Chr II and are less than 4 m.u. apart, the constructed strain is myrf-1 lin-4(umn84) / mIn1
(balanced by mIn1). Consequently, the myrf-1 homozygous animal is also lin-4 reporter
homozygous.</p>
<p>Regarding the endogenous function of the &quot;auto-regulating element,&quot; we are aware of the
follow-up paper by Frank Slack's group, in which they concluded that the previously reported
sequence is dispensable for lin-4 expression, and the loss of lin-4 does not affect the expression
of its primary transcript (PMID: 29324872). To avoid confusion, we will remove or revise the
introductory sentences as necessary to accurately reflect this information.</p>
<p>Additionally, besides analyzing the expression of the knock-in reporter of lin-4 (umn84), we also
conducted a thorough analysis of mature microRNA expression using targeted qPCR and
genomic analysis via microRNA sequencing. Both sets of results indicate severely defective
upregulation of lin-4 mature microRNA in myrf-1(ju1121).</p>
<p>No evidence indicates that the 2.4 kb reporter of Plin-4-gfp (maIs134) is an inappropriate
reporter for lin-4 transcription.</p>
<p>maIs134 is originated from the Ambros lab, and to date, there is no single evidence
demonstrating that maIs134 cannot be regarded as a reliable transcription reporter for lin-4
expression. The Stec et al. (Curr Biol 2021. PMID: 33357451) paper suggests that the PCE or CEA
site (at ~ -2.8 kb) outside the 2.4 kb region confers enhancing effects for lin-4 transcription,
but no other published paper has studied lin-4 transcription and cited this finding.</p>
<p>While the Stec et al. paper provides elaborate mechanistic descriptions, the basic
characterization of the importance of CE-A and blmp-1 to lin-4 expression is lacking. Deletion of
CE-A in the lin-4 promoter reporter using an Ex array transgene resulted in highly variable
reporter expression (Stec, Figure 4D). Notably, two high expression data points indicated that a
transgene reporter without CE-A can be highly expressed, suggesting that CE-A is unnecessary
for lin-4 transcription. Only when both CE-A and CE-D (within 2.4 kb) were deleted, the reporter expression was significantly decreased. Moreover, deletion of CE-C (proximal region) alone
caused severe loss of reporter activity, supporting that proximal CE-C is the essential element,
while CE-A is not.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the effect of CE-A on lin-4 expression has not been analyzed using
stable transgenes or genetic deletions in the endogenous lin-4 region. Furthermore, there is no
data on how blmp-1 mutants affect the expression of the wild-type lin-4 promoter reporter, CEA
deletion reporter, or lin-4 mature microRNA, despite the paper’s main claim that blmp-1
boosts lin-4 expression. While CE-A can confer an enhancing effect in epidermal expression
when fused to the gst-5 promoter, there is no data showing that CE-A is sufficient to drive lin-4
transcription by itself.</p>
<p>In summary, there is currently insufficient evidence to establish whether CE-A is necessary or
sufficient for regulating lin-4 expression. In fact, the data presented in Stec et al. (Curr Biol 2021)
suggest that CE-A is unnecessary for lin-4 expression. As such, I do not see any reason to
consider the 2.4 kb reporter in maIs134 as inappropriate for analyzing lin-4 transcription.
Furthermore, our presented data using the knock-in reporter of lin-4 (umn84) demonstrated
that its regulation by myrf is essentially consistent with the observations drawn from the

<p>The Significance of the Finding: MYRF Regulating lin-4 Upregulation</p>
<p>We are grateful that the editors find our results valuable for those interested in lin-4 expression.
However, we acknowledge that the editors may not share the same enthusiasm as we do,
seeing this as a landmark discovery in understanding postembryonic development, a
fundamental question in the field of developmental biology.</p>
<p>Importance of Understanding lin-4 Upregulation in Development</p>
<p>The foundation of developmental biology has been built on the principles derived from studying
embryonic development in model organisms like Drosophila, exemplified by the Nobel laureates
Lewis, Nusslein-Volhard, and Wieschaus. These principles explain what occurs during embryonic
development, including patern formation, morphogenesis, and differentiation. However, these
existing principles do not fully explain the phenomena of postembryonic development,
including growth. For instance, during C. elegans development in L1, it remains unclear what
controls the initiation of P cell division. If we may exclude dividing cells from the discussion,
numerous stage-specific changes occur in non-dividing cells, including neurons. The extensive,
systematic expression studies of transcription factors in C. elegans have failed to provide
evidence that such developmental progression is driven by sequential activation of
transcriptional cascades, as commonly observed during embryonic differentiation. A different
approach to ask a similar question is to inquire how developmental timing is controlled, e.g.,
&quot;why does it take a boy 12 years to reach adolescence?&quot; This perspective highlights the need to identify potential unidentified checkpoints that control postembryonic stages (An example of

<p>The upregulation of lin-4 represents a system’s checkpoint during postembryonic development.
Deciphering the mechanism controlling lin-4 expression is instrumental in understanding the
principles of postembryonic development, even extending to adult development, including life
span control.</p>
<p>Importance of the Finding: MYRF's Control of lin-4 Upregulation</p>
<p>To date, no other essential, positive regulator of lin-4 transcription has been identified, although
several negative regulators have been reported. A landmark paper by Victor Ambros identified
FLYWCH as a repressor of lin-4 expression during embryogenesis (PMID: 18794349). FLYWCH
mutants fail to progress to normal hatched larvae, implying that FLYWCH is crucial. The paper
indeed suggested that FLYWCH has additional functions beyond suppressing lin-4, although
these functions have not been thoroughly characterized. The significance of the FLYWCH finding
lies in the elaborate control during the transition from embryo to larval development, where lin-
4 is actively suppressed. This control may ensure the robustness of subsequent lin-4 activation.
The process during the embryo-to-larvae transition, as well as the counterpart process in
mammalian development perinatally, remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Another negative regulator of lin-4 is lin-42, as reported in three papers in 2014 (PMID:
25319259; PMID: 24699545; PMID: 25032706). Lin-42 negatively regulates lin-4 expression,
despite the main focus of the papers being lin-42's repression of let-7. However, the precise
mechanisms by which this repression is achieved are not fully understood.</p>
<p>Amy Pasquinelli's lab conducted a genome-wide screen to identify factors responsible for
driving lin-4 upregulation but did not identify a critical factor that promotes lin-4 transcription
(PMID: 20937268).</p>
<p>In the recent paper by Stec et al. (Curr Biol 2021. PMID: 33357451), they reported blmp-1's role
in enhancing lin-4 expression. However, the significance of blmp-1 in regulating lin-4 remains
vaguely described, despite a large amount of data describing elaborate epigenetic controls. The
paper did not provide data on how endogenous lin-4 expression is affected in blmp-1 mutants,
nor did it demonstrate how full-length reporter expression is affected in blmp-1 mutants. The
only relevant data appears to be on the CE-A-gst-5 promoter reporter in blmp-1 mutants. As a
result, it remains unclear how blmp-1 affects lin-4 transcription.</p>
<p>In summary, no single factor has been identified, the loss of which leads to significant
deficiencies in lin-4 upregulation. MYRF is the first and a critical factor identified in this context.
This finding represents a significant advancement in our understanding of lin-4 regulation and
its crucial role in development.</p>
