<title>Abstract</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive weakness of almost all skeletal muscles, whereas extraocular muscles (EOMs) are comparatively spared. While hindlimb and diaphragm muscles of end-stage SOD1G93A (G93A) mice (a familial ALS mouse model) exhibit severe denervation and depletion of <italic>Pax7<sup>+</sup></italic> satellite cells (SCs), we found that the pool of SCs and the integrity of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are maintained in EOMs. In cell sorting profiles, SCs derived from hindlimb and diaphragm muscles of G93A mice exhibit denervation-related activation, whereas SCs from EOMs of G93A mice display spontaneous (non-denervation-related) activation, similar to SCs from wild-type mice. Specifically, cultured EOM SCs contain more abundant transcripts of axon guidance molecules, including <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, along with more sustainable renewability than the diaphragm and hindlimb counterparts under differentiation pressure. In neuromuscular co-culture assays, AAV-delivery of <italic>Cxcl12</italic> to G93A-hindlimb SC-derived myotubes enhances motor neuron axon extension and innervation, recapitulating the innervation capacity of EOM SC-derived myotubes. G93A mice fed with sodium butyrate (NaBu) supplementation exhibited less NMJ loss in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles. Additionally, SCs derived from G93A hindlimb and diaphragm muscles displayed elevated expression of <italic>Cxcl12</italic> and improved renewability following NaBu treatment <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, the NaBu-induced transcriptomic changes resembling the patterns of EOM SCs may underlie the beneficial effects observed in G93A mice. More broadly, the distinct transcriptomic profile of EOM SCs may offer novel therapeutic targets to slow progressive neuromuscular functional decay in ALS and provide possible “response biomarkers” in pre-clinical and clinical studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disorder characterized by progressive motor neuron (MN) loss and skeletal muscle wasting, resulting in respiratory failure and death 3–5 years following diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. While not entirely spared, the extraocular muscles (EOMs) of ALS patients and mutant mouse models exhibit comparatively preserved structure and function and retained neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The reason for this differential involvement remains unclear, especially considering that eye movements are preferentially involved in other neuromuscular disorders like myasthenia gravis, some muscular dystrophies, and mitochondrial myopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>While ALS is classically considered predominantly a “dying-forward” process of motor neurons (MN), accumulated evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] support that early muscle dysfunction is an important contributor to ALS pathophysiology. The degree to which “dying-forward” from the central nerve system or “dying-back” process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] starting distally at NMJs contributing to ALS progression remains unsettled and may vary in different patient subsets. Regardless of the direction of communication and relative contribution of different cell types to ALS progression (e.g. glia, neurons, myofibers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], it is widely accepted that NMJ disassembly and the resulting skeletal muscle denervation is a critical pathogenic event in both patients and animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>EOMs differ from limb and trunk muscles in many respects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In contrast to other skeletal muscles, the individual motor neurons (MNs) controlling EOMs innervate fewer EOM myofibers, and individual myofibers often have multiple NMJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The multiple innervation phenotype refers to the co-existence of innervated “en plaque” and “en grappe” NMJs in a single EOM myofiber. The “en plaque” type of NMJs are located in the middle portion of myofibers and resemble NMJs seen in other types of muscles. Each EOM myofiber has one “un plaque” NMJ. “en grappe” NMJs are a series of smaller, grape-shaped NMJs that are located in the distal portion of some EOM myofibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. MNs innervating EOMs express higher level of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins calbindin-D28k and parvalbumin, thus may be more resistant to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced excitotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. The expression profile of EOM myofibers is also different from that of limb muscle in over 300 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Previous studies have investigated the muscle-derived neuroprotective factors, including BDNF, GDNF, NT3 and NT4 and found that none of these classical neurotrophic factors was expressed (RNA or proteins) significantly higher in EOM myofibers compared to hindlimb myofibers in both mutant G93A and wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Thus, it is important to look for clues in other cell types that influence the microenvironment around NMJs, such as satellite cells (SCs).</p>
<p>An association between SC function, NMJ integrity, and resultant denervation has been demonstrated in animal models of aging and muscular dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Using transgenic mice expressing GFP in the progeny of activated SCs, Liu and colleagues demonstrated that inducible depletion of adult skeletal muscle SCs impaired the regeneration of NMJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, they found that the loss of SCs exacerbated age-related NMJ degeneration. Preservation of SCs attenuated aging-related NMJ loss and improved muscle performance in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. SCs from EOMs exhibit superior expansion and renewability (the capability to maintain dividing and undifferentiated stem cells after rounds of regeneration) than their limb counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], inspiring us to compare the phenotypes of SCs derived from EOMs and limb muscles and to conduct transcriptomic profiling of SCs to look for candidate genes that could preserve NMJ integrity in ALS.</p>
<p>In the current study, we found that the integrity of NMJs and the amount of Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs are maintained in EOMs in end-stage G93A mice, in contrast to the severe denervation and depletion of Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that the EOM SCs exhibit abundant transcripts of axon guidance molecules, such as <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, along with sustainable renewability compared with SCs from diaphragm and hindlimb muscles. Furthermore, EOM SC-derived myotubes enhance axon extension and innervation in co-culture experiments with spinal motor neurons compared to hindlimb SC-derived myotubes. Overexpressing <italic>Cxcl12</italic> using adeno-associated viral vector (AAV8) in G93A hindlimb SC-derived myotubes recapitulated features of the EOM SC-derived myotubes.</p>
<p>Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers in the colon, has been shown to extend the survival of ALS G93A mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. We found that G93A mice fed with 2% sodium butyrate (NaBu) in drinking water decreased NMJ denervation and SC depletion in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles. Adding NaBu to the culture medium improved the renewability of SCs derived from the G93A hindlimb and diaphragm muscles, as well as increasing the expression of <italic>Cxcl12,</italic> resembling EOM SC transcriptomic pattern. Since muscle tissue can be biopsied during life, characterizing the distinct EOM SC transcriptomic pattern could provide potential predictive/cohort selective, and response/pharmacodynamic biomarkers in therapeutic trials in both ALS patients and animal models, in addition to identifying therapeutic targets.</p>

<title>NMJ integrity and peri-NMJ SC abundance are preserved in EOMs, and NaBu-supplemented feeding reduces NMJ denervation and SC depletion in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles in G93A mice</title>
<p>We investigated the NMJ integrity and peri-NMJ SC abundance by whole-mount imaging of extensor digitorum longus (EDL), soleus, diaphragm, and EOMs derived from WT littermates and G93A mice with or without NaBu-supplemented feeding. For EOMs, only the “en plaque” type of NMJs were included in this comparison, because they resemble NMJs in other types of muscles in morphology and spatial distribution. The “en grappe” type of NMJs were not included. Z-stack scans of glycerol-cleared whole muscles were obtained using a high working distance lens in a confocal microscope. The z-stacks were compacted into 2D images by maximal intensity projection. Acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at NMJs were labeled with Alexa Fluor conjugated α-Bungarotoxin (BTX). Axons and axon terminals of motor neurons were labeled with antibodies to neurofilament (NF) and synaptophysin (SYP) respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref><bold>-figure supplement 1A</bold>). In order to quantify the extent of denervation in a categorical manner, NMJs were arbitrarily defined as “well innervated” if SYP staining was present in &gt;60% of the BTX positive area, “partially innervated” if between 60% and 30%, and “poorly innervated” if SYP staining corresponded to less than 30% of the BTX positive area. Poorly innervated NMJs also generally lacked nearby NF<sup>+</sup> axons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref><bold>-figure supplement 1A</bold>).</p>

<p>At least 343 (average 758 ± 345 per group) NMJs from muscles (EDL, soleus, diaphragm and EOMs, respectively) dissected from WT or G93A mice with or without NaBu-feeding were examined (<bold>Figure 1-table supplement 1</bold>) in order to calculate the relative proportions of well-, partially-and poorly- innervated NMJs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). EDL, soleus and diaphragm muscles, but not EOMs, from end stage G93A mice (4-month-old) exhibited significant decrease in well-innervated NMJs, accompanied by an increase in poorly-innervate NMJs. The increase of “poorly-innervated NMJ” is slightly less dramatic in diaphragm compared to the hindlimb muscles, meanwhile the increase of “partially-innervated NMJ” ratio is the most significant in the diaphragm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>), indicating that denervation process is most severe in hindlimb muscles, slightly milder in diaphragm and barely detectable in EOMs. Consistent with previous observation by our lab and others that NaBu treatment slows ALS progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], the hindlimb and diaphragm muscles from NaBu-fed mice (1 month, 2% in water, starting feeding at the age of 3-month-old) all exhibited significantly reduced denervation compared to littermates who were not fed NaBu (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>, n = 10 per group, gender matched).</p>
<p>qRT-PCR for <italic>Scn5a</italic>, the gene encoding sodium channel Nav1.5, was performed with RNA extracted from whole muscles and used as another marker of denervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref><bold>-figure supplement 1B</bold>). The original values of <italic>Scn5a</italic> expression levels are provided in <bold>Figure 1-table supplement 2</bold>. Consistent with the immunostaining quantification in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>, the elevation of <italic>Scn5a</italic> expression is most notable when comparing G93A hindlimb muscles to wildtype counterparts (&gt;250 folds for EDL, &gt;70 folds for soleus), milder for diaphragm (&gt; 15 folds) and not significant for EOMs. Additionally, NaBu feeding significantly reduced the <italic>Scn5a</italic> transcripts in hindlimb muscles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref><bold>-figure supplement 1B</bold>).</p>
<p>Whole mount imaging of muscles stained with the satellite cell (SC) markers Pax7, BTX, SYP, and DAPI, was used to quantify SCs in the vicinity of NMJs. The Pax7 signal in each z-stack image was filtered using DAPI as a mask to identify Pax7<sup>+</sup> cell nuclei. Afterwards the z-stacks were compacted into 2D images by maximal intensity projection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). The number of nuclear Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells were counted within the circles of 75 µm diameter drawn around the NMJs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>, see also <bold>Figure 2-table supplement 1)</bold>. Similar to the NMJ denervation status, depletion of peri-NMJ SCs was most significant in hindlimb muscles of end-stage G93A mice and slightly milder in diaphragm, while no significant depletion was observed in EOMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>). G93A mice fed with NaBu had less depletion of SCs in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles.</p>

<title>The proliferation and differentiation properties are conserved in SCs derived from G93A EOMs</title>
<p>We conducted FACS based isolation of SCs from hindlimb (combining tibialis anterior, EDL, quadriceps and gastrocnemius), diaphragm, and EOMs using a modified version of a published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Soleus was excluded because it has higher content of slow-twitch myofibers (37-55%), which is more similar to diaphragm than the other fast-twitch fiber-dominant hindlimb muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Vcam1 was used as a marker for quiescent SC. CD31 (endothelial cell marker), CD45 (hematopoietic cell marker) and Sca-1 (mesenchymal stem cell marker) positive cells were discarded. Thus, in the FACS profile the target SC population (Vcam1<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup>Sca-1<sup>-</sup>) was in gate P5-4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). Single antibody staining controls are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref><bold>-figure supplement 1</bold>.

<p>SCs isolated from WT hindlimb and diaphragm muscles exhibited relatively homogenous levels of Vcam1, which facilitated separation from other cells and debris (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>, gate P5-4), and also indicates they are mostly quiescent under resting conditions. In contrast, SCs derived from the G93A hindlimb and diaphragm displayed heterogeneous levels of Vcam1, potentially due to ongoing activation/differentiation triggered by disease progression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). Importantly, EOM SCs from both WT and G93A mice were heterogeneous in Vcam1 levels, implying they are spontaneously activated even in the absence of pathological stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). While significant decreases of P5-4 population were observed in the G93A hindlimb and diaphragm derived SCs compared to WT, no significant difference was detected between G93A and WT EOM derived SCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>FACS-isolated SCs were next cultured in growth medium for 4 days, fixed, and stained for MyoD to confirm their myogenic lineage. Close to 100% of the cells were MyoD positive (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). We examined the ratio of actively proliferating cells (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) among the SCs (labeled with Pax7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].

These observations are consistent with previous reports of superior proliferative potential of EOM SCs compared to limb and diaphragm muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].

<p>We also compared myotube formation and cell proliferation of cultured SCs under differentiation conditions. After 4 days in growth medium, we switched to differentiation medium and cultured the cells for 2 more days. The cells were then stained for sarcomere myosin heavy chain (MHC), Pax7 and Ki67. The EOM-derived SCs exhibited a higher number of Pax7 positive cells (Pax7<sup>+</sup>/Ki67<sup>+</sup> and Pax7<sup>+</sup>/Ki67<sup>-</sup>) compared to SCs derived from hindlimb and diaphragm muscles – from both WT and G93A mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). In contrast, the fusion indices, which calculate the ratio of nucleus within the MHC positive myotubes, were the lowest for EOM SCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). This does not necessarily mean the EOM SCs have deficiencies in differentiation after they are committed, but more likely a reflection of their superior preservation of actively proliferating population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. In support of this view, previous TA engraftment experiments showed that more myofibers were generated by EOM SCs than their limb counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>

<p>We designed two NaBu treatment plans for G93A diaphragm and hindlimb SCs as follows: one with 0.5 mM NaBu applied in the growth medium for 1 day before switching to differentiation medium (1 day in growth medium), the other with NaBu continuously applied for 3 days (1 day in growth medium + 2 days in differentiation medium). As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>, the G93A hindlimb and diaphragm SCs in culture showed significant increase in the ratio of Pax7 positive cells under the 1-day NaBu treatment, associated with a decrease in fusion index.

These data indicate that NaBu treatment results in EOM-like preservation of renewability of the G93A SCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). Aside from the drop of fusion indices after 3-day treatment with NaBu, there was notable decrease of MHC levels, indicating long-term exposure to NaBu did inhibit the differentiation process (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>), which is in line with the published result observed in C2C12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>].</p>

<p>Similarities of the transcriptomic profiles of RNA-Seq samples were examined using the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>). We found that both WT and G93A EOM SCs cultured in differentiation medium were more similar to hindlimb and diaphragm SCs in growth medium than their counterparts in differentiation medium, highlighting the superior renewability of EOM SCs in differentiation medium and is consistent with the immunostaining results showed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>.</p>
<p>To understand RNA-Seq data in the perspective of SC homeostasis, which refers to the transition between quiescence (dormant, slow self-renewal), activation (rapid amplification with symmetric and asymmetric cell division) and differentiation states during tissue regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], we compiled the lists of quiescence, activation and differentiation signature genes respectively. For quiescence signature genes, a list of 507 genes highly upregulated in quiescent SCs compared to activated SCs have been generated previously by Fukada et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. We adopted this list together with other 18 genes denoted by other investigators, including <italic>Notch1</italic>, <italic>Notch2</italic>, <italic>Hes1</italic>, <italic>Hey1</italic>, <italic>Rbpj</italic>, <italic>Dtx4</italic>, <italic>Jag1</italic>, <italic>Sox8</italic>, <italic>Sdc3</italic>, <italic>Itga7</italic>, <italic>Itgb1</italic>, <italic>Met</italic>, <italic>Vcam1</italic>, <italic>Ncam1</italic>, <italic>Cdh2</italic>, <italic>Cdh15</italic>, <italic>Cxcr4</italic>, <italic>Cav1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. The activation signature gene list was generated from our RNA-seq data using those expressed significantly higher in SCs (both from WT and G93A) in growth medium (1187 genes in total, |log2FC| ≥ 0.4 and FDR ≤ 0.001). Accordingly, the differentiation signature gene list was generated from those expressed significantly higher in SCs cultured in differentiation medium (1349 genes in total).</p>
<p>To verify that our signature gene lists recapitulate the SC properties at activation and differentiation state reported in previous studies, we did functional annotation analysis (KEGG pathway, Gene ontology_biological process, Gene ontology_cellular component). As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref><bold>-figure supplement 1,</bold> the top functional annotations enriched in our activation signature genes are all related to cell cycle and DNA replication, while the top functional annotations for our differentiation signature genes are associated with muscle contraction, muscle-specific subcellular structures and metabolic changes.</p>
<p>To explore whether the homeostatic states of EOM SCs are different from that of SCs from other muscle origins, we looked for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared-in-common among the following four groups: WT EOM SC-vs-WT diaphragm SC; WT EOM SC-vs-WT HL SC; G93A EOM SC-vs-G93A diaphragm SC; G93A EOM SC-vs-G93A HL SC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>, left two panels). Within the 1119 shared DEGs identified in SCs cultured in growth medium, slightly more activation signature genes and quiescence signature genes were expressed higher in EOM SCs compared to diaphragm and HL derived SCs. Meanwhile more differentiation signature genes were expressed lower in EOM SCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref>, leftmost panel and <bold>Figure 6-table supplement 1</bold>). These trends became much more prominent in the 3318 shared DEGs identified in SCs cultured in differentiation medium, implying that EOM SCs are notably superior at preserving renewability in a differentiation environment than their diaphragm and hindlimb counterparts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref>, middle panel). Consistently, subgroups of quiescence signature genes belonging to commonly used stem cell markers (<italic>Pax7, Cd34, Cxcr4, Vcam1, Sdc3, Sdc4, Cdh15, Met, Cav1</italic>), Notch signaling pathway (<italic>Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Jag1, Heyl, Dtx4, Msc</italic>) and pluripotency signaling pathway (<italic>Klf4, Igf1, Bmp2, Bmp4, Fzd4, Fgfr4, Pik3r1, Lifr</italic>) were all expressed higher in EOM SCs in differentiation medium than SCs derived from diaphragm and hindlimb muscles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref>, middle panel and <bold>Figure 6-table supplement 2</bold>).</p>
<p>In parallel, we examined whether the 3-day NaBu treatment could alter the homeostasis of G93A diaphragm and hindlimb SCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>, rightmost panel). There were 3018 DEGs shared between the following two comparing groups: G93A diaphragm SC_D_NaBu3-vs-G93A diaphragm SC_D and G93A HL SC_D_NaBu3-vs-G93A HL SC_D. Similar to the trends observed in EOM SCs in differentiation medium, the majority of activation and quiescence signature genes found in these DEGs were upregulated in the NaBu treated group, while the differentiation signature genes were downregulated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref>, rightmost panel). The elevated quiescence signature genes of the NaBu treated group include commonly used stem cell markers (<italic>Pax7, Cd34, Vcam1, Sdc4, Cdh2, Met, Cav1, Itga7</italic>), Notch signaling pathway members (<italic>Notch3</italic>, <italic>Rbpj</italic>) and pluripotency signaling pathway components (<italic>Fzd4</italic>, <italic>Bmp4</italic>). However, other three pluripotency related genes (<italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Wnt4</italic> and <italic>Bmp2</italic>) were found downregulated (<bold>Figure 6-table supplement 3</bold>), indicating that NaBu treatment also has a mixed impact on the stemness of the SCs.</p>
<p>To compile EOM SCs signature gene list, we identified 621 genes expressed higher in EOM SCs than diaphragm and hindlimb SCs cultured in growth medium from the 1119 DEGs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>, leftmost panel). Next, we pulled out 2424 genes that are expressed higher in EOM SCs than diaphragm and hindlimb SCs cultured in differentiation medium from the 3318 DEGs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>, middle panel). These two lists have 478 genes shared-in-common. Particularly, many of these genes are related to axon guidance, cell migration and neuron projection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref>). <bold>Figure 7A-figure supplement 1, Figure 7-table supplement 1 and 2</bold> further demonstrate this phenotype when the functional annotation analysis was done separately for the growth or differentiation culture conditions. The functional annotation analysis for the 3018 genes altered by the 3-day NaBu treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>, rightmost panel) also spotted axon guidance, cell migration and neuron projection on the top of the annotation lists (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 7B</bold></xref> and <bold>Figure7-table supplement 3</bold>). Importantly, the chemokine <italic>Cxcl12</italic> shows up in all three lists. Cxcl12 is known to promote axonal extension and NMJ regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. These data suggest that enhanced attraction of motor neuron axons by peri-NMJ SCs might be a shared mechanism underlying the NMJ preservation in EOMs and NaBu treatment observed in G93A mice.</p>

<title>AAV mediated overexpression of Cxcl12 in myotubes promotes motor neuron axon extension</title>
<p>Since recombinant <italic>Cxcl12</italic> is known to promote axon extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], we tested whether overexpressing <italic>Cxcl12</italic> in myotubes via adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction could achieve the same effect. For these experiments, we co-cultured motor neurons and SC-derived myotubes on compartmentalized microfluidic chambers (XonaChip). Because AAV vectors do not transduce satellite cells efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], we first seeded the satellite cells into one compartment of the XonaChips, then induced them to differentiate for two days before AAV transduction.

The cocultures were maintained for 9 more days.

<p>By measuring the lengths of the longest RSMN neurites (presumably axons) crossing the 450 μm microgrooves, we noticed that hindlimb-SC derived myotubes from G93A mice, but not from WT littermates, appeared repulsive to distal axons. The axons stayed close to the edge of the microgrooves and even grew backward towards the neuronal compartment, which we termed “edge effect” (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 8B</bold></xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 8</bold></xref><bold>-figure supplement 2A</bold>, arrows). This was rarely seen in the WT hindlimb SC-derived myotubes. In contrast, RSMN axon extension was dramatically enhanced in the co-culture system either with G93A hindlimb SC-derived myotubes overexpressing <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, or G93A EOM SC-derived myotubes overexpressing GFP (as control) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 8B</bold></xref><bold>, C</bold>). Those neurites located close to the microgrooves were often seen to closely grow along nearby myotubes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 8</bold></xref><bold>-figure supplement 2B</bold>). G93A hindlimb SC-derived myotubes overexpressing <italic>Cxcl12</italic> occasionally were even seen to overcome the “edge effect” and redirect the axons towards their proximities (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 8</bold></xref><bold>-figure supplement 2B</bold>, arrow) - a persuasive indication of chemoattractive effects of those myotubes. Meanwhile, RSMN innervation of AChR clusters (BTX positive patches) were not seen in co-cultures with G93A hindlimb SC-derived myotubes overexpressing GFP, while they were consistently observed in the other three types of AAV-transduced myotubes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 8C</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The overall innervation incidence was too low for statistical analysis due to the sparsity of axons in the myotube compartments, thus we conducted co-culture experiments where RSMNs were added to SC-derived myotubes in a uni-compartmental co-culture setting. As shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 9A-C</bold></xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 9</bold></xref><bold>-figure supplement 1A-C</bold>, when co-cultured in a single compartment, <italic>Cxcl12</italic> overexpressing G93A hindlimb SC-derived myotubes exhibited increased innervation compared to GFP overexpressing controls. Furthermore, individual <italic>Cxcl12</italic> overexpressing EOM SC derived myotubes were frequently innervated by multiple (3 or more) times (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 9A-C</bold></xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 9</bold></xref><bold>-figure supplement 1D</bold>), recapitulating the “multi-innervation” property of EOMs <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The extra “anchor points” seemed to encourage better spatial alignment of the RSMN axon network to the myotubes globally in the co-cultures. This spatial alignment of RSMN axons and myotubes was not observed in co-cultures of RSMNs and hindlimb SC-derived myotubes (<italic>without Cxcl12 overexpression</italic>), which also did not exhibit multi-innervation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 9A-C</bold></xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 9</bold></xref><bold>-figure supplement 1A-C</bold>). Under higher magnification, we often observed that axons sending branches to adjacent BTX positive patches on EOM SC-derived myotubes (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 9B</bold></xref>, arrows). Of note, there was higher expression of several Netrin and Semaphorin family members reported to promote axon-branching in EOM SCs compared to other muscle-derived SCs cultured in differentiation medium (<bold>Figure 7-table supplement 2</bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. This milieu, comprised of abundant axon guidance molecules, in combination with the robust self-renewability of satellite cells, may contribute to the relative EOM NMJ resistance in ALS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have demonstrated an association between the degeneration of NMJs and depletion of peri-NMJ SCs in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles <italic>in vivo</italic> in end-stage G93A mice. In contrast, EOM NMJs exhibited no signs of denervation or SCs depletion. The FACS profile of SCs isolated from EOM suggests spontaneous activation even without pathological stimulation, which is supported by previous <italic>in vivo</italic> BrdU labeling and staining results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Furthermore, immunostaining, qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq analyses all imply that EOM SCs <italic>in vitro</italic> possess superior renewability better than hindlimb and diaphragm SCs, under differentiation-inducing culture conditions. Comparative functional annotation analyses of the transcriptomes highlight higher expression of axon guidance molecules in EOM SCs. Neuromuscular coculture experiments demonstrate that EOM SC-derived myotubes are more attractive to potential axons derived from rat spinal motor neurons than their hindlimb counterparts – which in fact appeared to repel the branching axons. Thus, the unique homeostasis regulation and axon attraction properties of EOM SCs may contribute to the resistance to denervation of EOM under ALS (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 9D</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Earlier report of SC quantification from muscle biopsy samples using electron microscopy detected no significant difference between ALS patients and non-ALS controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Other studies using primary cultured SCs from muscle biopsy samples implied compromised differentiation program in ALS SCs compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. As to proliferation, one study reported enhanced proliferation in ALS SCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>], while the other cued for deficits in proliferation in ALS SCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. The various findings may reflect variations in the disease stage of patients during sampling. For animal studies, Manzano <italic>et al</italic> measured the amount of Pax<sup>7+</sup> SCs in dissociated EDL and soleus myofibers from G93A mice and WT controls and observed large variations across muscle-type and disease stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. In another study carried out by the same group, primarily cultured EDL and soleus SCs from G93A mice generally showed lower proliferation potential than the WT counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>].</p>
<p>In our whole-mount muscle imaging data and FACS profiles of isolated SCs, SC depletion, at least for the most quiescent population, is observed in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles from end-stage G93A mice. Additionally, the heterogeneity of Vcam1 levels observed in hindlimb and diaphragm SCs derived from end stage G93A mice compared to those from WT controls indicates occurrence of denervation-related pathological activation. Although this activation may transiently elevate the number of SCs, the continuous dominance of asymmetric over symmetric cell division, as well as the differentiation pressure to regenerate myofibers could gradually exhaust the quiescent stem cell pool, leading to the depletion phenotype seen in the end stage G93A mice. In contrast, the superior preservation of renewability of EOM SCs seen in differentiation medium is an effective measure against this catastrophe. However, the spontaneous activation and superior renewability of EOM SCs may not always be an advantage. As mentioned in the introduction section, EOMs are preferentially involved in some other neuromuscular disorders. In the case of mitochondrial myopathies, mitochondrial DNA defects accumulate over time, resulting in compromised oxidative phosphorylation represented by cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficient myofibers in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The proportion of COX-deficient myofibers is higher in EOMs than other muscles, which may be related to accelerated spreading of mitochondrial DNA defects in myofibers by the distinct properties of EOM SCs.</p>
<p>In this study, overexpressing <italic>Cxcl12</italic> in G93A hindlimb SC-derived myotubes promotes motor neuron axon extension under the co-cultured condition. <italic>Cxcl12</italic> has been known as a critical axon guidance cue for motor neurons during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. In adult animals, peri-synaptic Schwann cells have recently been reported to transiently produce <italic>Cxcl12</italic> after acute motor axon terminal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Intraperitoneal injection of antibodies neutralizing secreted Cxcl12 protein slows down the regeneration process. In contrast, the exposure of primary motor neurons to recombinant Cxcl12 protein stimulates neurite outgrowth and directional axonal extension in compartmentalized culture setup, which could be reversed by the treatment of the Cxcr4 specific inhibitor AMD3100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Since myoblasts also express <italic>Cxcr4</italic> and will migrate along the Cxcl12 protein gradient during muscle regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>], the abundant peri-NMJ SCs in EOM expressing <italic>Cxcl12</italic> may achieve synergistic effect with peri-synaptic Schwann cells, improving the long-term integrity of NMJs.</p>
<p>Epigenetic regulation of SC transcriptome by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such as butyrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>], could modulate the myogenesis process both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. Butyrate is a gut-bacteria fermentation product that also acts as an energy source to improve mitochondrial respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. Previous studies by our lab and others showed NaBu-supplemented feeding prolongs the life span of G93A mice and reverses CypD-related mitoflash phenotypes in myofibers derived from G93A mice, which implies a potential decrease of oxidative stress. Additionally, NaBu treatment also improved mitochondrial respiratory function of NSC34 motor neuron cell line overexpressing hSOD1G93A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>]. Yet it was not known whether the beneficiary effects of NaBu are linked to any phenotypic changes of SCs, and whether NaBu treatment induced epigenetic modulations similar to that of EOM SCs. The study here revealed its beneficiary role on the preservation of NMJ integrity and peri-NMJ SCs affected in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles by ALS progression. NaBu treatment of G93A hindlimb and diaphragm SCs in culture induced transcriptomic changes mimicking some features seen in EOM SCs, including the upregulation of activation and quiescence signature genes and the downregulation of differentiation signature genes, indicating NaBu improved the renewability of G93A hindlimb and diaphragm SCs. Additionally, some axon guidance molecules, particularly <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, were also induced by NaBu application (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 9D</bold></xref>). Thus, NaBu-induced EOM SC-like transcriptomic pattern could be a crucial contributor to its therapeutic effect against ALS progression.</p>
<p>Overall, our studies have defined several mechanisms which (1) may explain why EOMs are relatively spared in ALS, and (2) provides a rationale for targeting these differences as a therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, analysis of these signatures in patient muscle biopsies could be used to select subsets of ALS patients who may be most likely to benefit from therapies targeting this signaling network, and to provide possible “response biomarkers” in pre-clinical and clinical studies. As a cocktail of sodium phenylbutyrate (a derivative of NaBu) and Taurursodiol (an antioxidant) under the Commercial name of Relyvrio has been recently approved in US and Canada as a new ALS therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>], our study could help gain more insights into the molecular mechanisms related to this type of ALS therapy.</p>

<p>All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol on the usage of mice was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas at Arlington (A19.001, approval date: 09/20/2018). WT mice used in this study were of B6SJL background. The ALS transgenic mouse model (hSOD1G93A) with genetic background of B6SJL was originally generated by Drs. Deng and Siddique’s group at Northwestern University and deposited to the Jackson Lab as B6SJL-Tg (SOD1*G93A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>].

<title>Primary culture of satellite cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting</title>
<p>The hindlimb muscles including tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), gastrocnemius, and quadriceps were dissected from 1-2 mice. For diaphragm, both the crural and costal domains were dissected from 1-2 mice. For EOMs, the four rectus muscles in the eye sockets were dissected from 5-6 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]. The collected muscles were placed in 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> Ringer’s solution. Excessive connective tissue, tendons, fat, blood clots and vessels were removed as much as possible. After cleanup, the muscles were transferred into the digestion media (DMEM containing 5% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep and 10 mM HEPES) and minced into small blocks using scissors. Collagenase II (Worthington LS004176), dispase II (Sigma D46931G), hyaluronidase (Worthington LS002592) and Dnase I (Worthington LS002139) were added at the final concentration of 0.26%, 0.24%, 0.16% and 0.04%, respectively. The digestion system was placed in an orbital shaker running at 70 rpm at 37 °C for 45 min. The digested muscles were triturated 10 times with a 20-gauge needle attached to a 5 ml syringe. Afterwards the triturated mixture was pipetted onto a pre-wetted 100 μm strainer and centrifuge at 100 g for 2.5 min to precipitate the bulky myofiber debris. The supernatant was transferred onto a pre-wetted 40 um strainer and cells were collected by centrifuged at 1200 g for 6.5 min. The cells were resuspended in sorting media (PBS containing 0.3% BSA, 10 mM HEPES and 1 mM EGTA) and stained with antibodies or dyes at 4 °C for 45 min with shaking. The antibodies used include PE anti-mVcam1 (Biolegend 50604858, 600 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells), APC anti-mCD31 (Biolegend 50162682, 400 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells), APC anti-mCD45 (Biolegend 50162782, 400 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells) APC anti-mSca-1 (Biolegend 50163216, 200 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells). This antibody combination followed a previous published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Vcam1 is a SC marker, CD31 is a endothelial cell marker, CD45 is a hematopoietic cell marker and Sca-1 is a mesenchymal stem cell marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. For sorting, our target population is VCAM<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup>Sca-1<sup>-</sup>. When needed, the cells were stained with methyl green (2 µg/ml) to check mortality rate. As a positive control, half of the cells were transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and methanol (precooled at −20°C) was added dropwise with gentle mixing and left on ice for 5 min, the dead cells were wash twice before being mixed with the rest half of cells for methyl green staining. The sorting process was conducted using BD FACS Melody Cell Sorter using a 100 µm nozzle. The excitation laser and emission filter setup for methyl green is the same as APC. The flow rate was tuned between 1-7 to adjust the event rate to 2000-4000/sec. Gating conditions of FSC-A/SSC-A, SSC-H/SSC-W, FSC-H/FSC-W, Vcam1/CD31_CD45_Sca-1 and Vcam1/Methyl green plots were shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1 and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 2. The sorted cells were collected in growth media (DMEM containing 20%FBS, 1% Pen/Strep, 1% chick embryonic extract and 10 mM HEPES). Afterwards the cells were seeded into laminin (Corning 354232) -coated plates or glass-bottom dishes containing growth media (without HEPES). Culture media was changed on the third day and the fourth day. To induce differentiation, cells were washed three times with PBS and cultured in differentiation media (DMEM containing 2% horse serum) for 2 more days.</p>

<title>Neuro-muscular coculture assay</title>
<p>For neuromuscular coculture in compartmentalized chambers (XonaCHIPS XC450), XoanCHIPS were coated with poly-L-ornithine (0.5 mg/ml) for 1 hr at 37 °C followed by laminin (0.1 mg/ml) for 1 hr at 37 °C. Primarily cultured satellite cells were seeded at 1×10^5 into the myotube compartment in growth medium for attachment overnight and then switched to differentiation medium and cultured for 2 more days. Afterwards AAV8-CMV-eGFP (Vector Biolabs, 1×10^11 GC/ml) or AAV8-CMV-Cxcl12-IRES-eGFP (Vector Biolabs, 1.5×10^11 GC/ml, the <italic>Cxcl12</italic> gene is of mouse origin) transduction was conducted for one day. The usage of higher titer for the second virus is for matching GFP signal intensity, as IRES-dependent expression is significantly lower than those directly driven by CMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>]. The chambers were washed with Neurobasal Plus Medium twice before seeding rat spinal motor neurons into the neuronal compartment (1×10^5). The coculture was kept in Neurobasal Plus Medium for 9 more days and half medium change was conducted every 2 days.</p>
<p>For neuromuscular coculture in the same glass-bottom chamber, 8-well chambered cover glasses (Cellvis C8-1.5H-N) were coated with poly-L-ornithine and laminin as described above. Primarily cultured satellite cells were seeded at 1×10^5/chamber in growth medium for attachment overnight and then switched to differentiation medium and cultured for 2 more days. AAV transduction was conducted for one day as described above. The infected myotubes were washed with Neurobasal Plus Medium (Thermo Fisher A3582901, with B-27 and GlutaMax supplement) before the addition of rat spinal motor neurons (4×10^3/chamber, iXCells 10RA-033) to the same chamber.

<title>Immunofluorescence (IF) and imaging of whole mount muscle samples</title>
<p>EDL, soleus and EOM (the four rectus muscles) were dissected out and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 hr. Afterwards the samples were washed with PBS containing 1% glycine once and two more times with PBS. Further fixation and permeabilization was done with methanol at −20°C for 10 min. For diaphragm, the costal muscles and their surrounding rib cages were dissected and immersed in methanol directly for fixation (PFA fixation was skipped because it made the diaphragm harder to flatten and introduced more non-specific noises in staining). The samples were rehydrated and washed with PBS. The epimysium and tendons were removed as much as possible. EDL and soleus were further split into smaller bundles along the longitudinal axis. Then the samples were immersed in blocking buffer (PBS containing 2% BSA, 2% horse serum, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.05% sodium azide) overnight at 4 °C. Next day the samples were incubated with primary antibodies for 1-2 days. After washing with PBS for three times, the samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor labelled secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher 1:1000) and Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated α- Bungarotoxin (Thermo Fisher B13422, 1:1000) for 1-2 days. The samples were then washed with PBS, counterstained with DAPI and mounted in antifade mounting media (20 mM Tris, 0.5% N-propyl gallate, 80% glycerol) for imaging.

<title>RNA extraction and qRT-PCR</title>
<p>For cultured SCs, cell culture medium was removed before RNA extraction and Trizol reagent was added to the well before scratching cells off using pipette tips. The homogenate was transferred into tubes containing 5 PRIME Phase Lock Gel (Quantabio 2302830), and 1/10 volume of 1-bromo-3-chloroporpane (Alfa Aesar A11395) was added. The samples were shaken vigorously for 12 s and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000× <italic>g</italic>. Afterwards, the upper phase was transferred to another Eppendorf tube and isopropanol (1/2 volume of the initial homogenate) was added for precipitation overnight at −20 °C. Next day, after 15 min centrifugation at 16000 <italic>g</italic> the precipitate was washed briefly with 75% ethanol. After another 5 min centrifugation, the ethanol was removed. The precipitate was briefly dried and resuspended in RNase free water. For whole muscle samples, the freshly dissected muscles were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, kept at −80 °C freezer overnight and then soaked in RNALater ICE (Thermo Fisher AM7030) for 2-3 days at −20 °C. Before RNA extraction, leftover tendons and neurites were removed and muscles were transferred to 1 ml Trizol. Homogenization was conducted in FastPrep-24 Classic bead beating grinder (MP Biomedicals 116004500). The tissue homogenate was transfer to centrifuge tubes containing phase lock gel (QuantaBio 2302830) and 1/10 volume of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane was added. The tubes were hand shaken for 12 seconds, left at bench top for 2 minutes and then centrifuged at 16000 g at 4 °C for 15 minutes. The upper phase was transferred to a new centrifuge tube and mixed with equal volume of ethanol. The following steps of RNA purification was conducted with Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus kit (Zymo Research R2070). RNA concentration was measured with Quantus Fluorometer (Promega E6150). RNA quality was assessed by RNA ScreenTape analysis at Genomics Core Facility at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. Only RNAs with RIN ≥ 9 and 28s/18s ≥ 1 were used for qRT-PCR or RNA-Seq. Reverse transcription was done using Promega GoScript Reverse Transcription system. The qPCR reactions used Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) and were carried out by the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher).

<p>Non-stranded mRNA sequencing was carried out by BGI Americas Corporation. The average number of clean reads per sample was 45.16 million (ranging from 44.11 to 48.51 million). The average percentage of clean reads was 93.32% (ranging from 92.42% to 93.97%). The average percentage of aligned reads (to Genome Reference Consortium Mouse Build 38 patch release 6) was 96.01% (ranging from 95.40% to 96.67%) and the average percentage of uniquely aligned reads was 86.46% (ranging from 85.12% to 87.63%). To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different samples (using Poisson distribution method to compare uniquely mapped reads of the gene), only genes with |log2FC| ≥ 0.4 and FDR ≤ 0.001 were considered. To identify DEGs between different groups (containing more than one sample, using DESeq2 method), only genes with |log2FC| ≥ 0.4 and Qvalue ≤ 0.05 were considered. PCA analysis, hierarchical clustering, functional annotation analysis (KEGG pathway, GO_C, GO_P) were performed in Dr. TOM platform of BGI.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The study explores the mechanisms that preserve satellite cell function in extraocular muscles (EOMs) in a mouse model of familial Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that carries the G93A mutation in the Sod1 gene. ALS is a fatal neuromuscular disorder driven by motor neuron degeneration, leading to progressive wasting of most skeletal muscles but not EOM. The study first established that integrity of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is preserved in EOM but not in limb and diaphragm muscles of G93A mice, and sodium butyrate (NaBu) treatment partially improves NMJ integrity in limb and diaphragm muscles of G93A mice. They also found a loss of synaptic satellite cells and renewability of cultured myoblasts in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles of G93A mice, but not in EOM, and NaBu treatment restores myoblast renewability. Using RNA-seq analysis, they identify that exon guidance molecules, particularly Cxcl12, are highly expressed in EOM myoblasts, along with more sustainable renewability. Using a neuromuscular co-culture model, they convincingly show that AAV-mediated Cxcl12 expression in G93A myotubes enhances motor axon extension and innervation. Strikingly, NaBu-mediated preservation of NMJ in limb muscles of G93A mice is associated with elevated expression of Cxcl12 in satellite cells and improved renewability of myoblasts. These results together offer molecular insights into genes critical for maintaining satellite cell function and revealing a mechanism through which NaBu ameliorates ALS.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Combination of in vivo and cell culture models.</p>
<p>
Nice imaging of NMJ and associated satellite cells.</p>
<p>
Using motoneuron-myotube coculture to establish the mechanism.</p>
<p>
Tested and illustrated a mechanism through which a clinically used drug ameliorates ALS.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Data presentation could be improved (see details in the Recommendation for Authors).</p>
<p>
It would have been nice to have included G93A motoneurons in the coculture study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The work is potentially interesting as it outlines the role of satellite cells in supporting the functional decline of skeletal muscle due to the denervation process. In this context the authors analyze the functional and molecular characteristics of satellite cells in different muscle types differently affected by the degenerative process in the ALS model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The work illustrates a relevant aspect of the differences in stem cell potential in different skeletal muscles in a mouse model of the disease through a considerable amount of data and experimental models.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
However, there are some criticisms of the structuring of the results:</p>
<p>It is not clear how many animals were used in each experimental group (Figs 1 and 2, Fig. 2-9). In particular, it is unclear whether the dots in the histograms represent biological or technical replicates. Furthermore, the gender used in experimental groups is never specified. This last point appears to be important considering the gender differences observed in the SOD1G93A mouse model.</p>
<p>The first paragraph of the results lacks a functional analysis of the motor decline of the animals after the administration of sodium butyrate. The authors, in fact, administered NaBu around 90 days of age while in previous work the drug had been administered at a pre-symptomatic age. It would therefore be useful, to make the message more effective, to characterize the locomotor functions of the treated animals in parallel with the histological evidence of the integrity of the NMJ.</p>
<p>Figure 5 should be completed with the administration of NaBu also to the satellite cells isolated from the WT mouse, the same for figure 9 where AAV-CMV-Cxcl12 transduction of WT myotubes is missing.</p>
<p>In the experiment illustrated in Figure 8, treatment of cell cultures with NaBu would improve the outcome as well as the interference of Cxcl12 expression in myotubes derived from G93A EOM SC (Fig.9) would strengthen the specificity of this protein in axon guidance in this NMJ typical of a spared muscle in ALS.</p>
<p>In the &quot;materials and methods&quot; section the paragraph relating to the methods used for statistical analysis is missing.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In their paper, Li et al. investigate the transcriptome of satellite cells obtained from different muscle types including hindlimb, diaphragm, and extraocular muscles (EOM) from wild-type and G93A transgenic mice (end-stage ALS) in order to identify potential factors involved in the maintenance of the neuromuscular junction. The underlying hypothesis is that since EOMs are largely spared from this debilitating disease, they may secrete NMJ-protective factors. The results of their transcriptome analysis identified several axon guidance molecules including the chemokine Cxcl12, which are particularly enriched in EOM-derived satellite cells. Transduction of hindlimb-derived satellite cells with AAV encoding Cxcl12 reverted hindlimb-derived myotubes from the G93A mice into myotubes sharing phenotypic characteristics similar to those of EOM-derived satellite cells. Additionally, the authors were able to demonstrate that EOM-derived satellite cell myotube cultures are capable of enhancing axon extensions and innervation in co-culture experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The strength of the paper is that the authors successfully isolated and purified different populations of satellite cells, compared their transcriptomes, identified specific factors released by EOM-derived satellite cells, overexpressed one of these factors (the chemokine Cxcl12) by AAV-mediated transduction of hindlimb-derived satellite cells. The transduced cells were then able to support axon guidance and NMJ integrity. They also show that administration of Na butyrate to mice decreased NMJ denervation and satellite cell depletion of hind limbs. Furthermore, the addition of Na Butyrate to hindlimb-derived satellite cell myotube cultures increased Cxcl12 expression. These are impressive results providing important insights for the development of therapeutic targets to slow the loss of neuromuscular function characterizing ALS.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Several important aspects have not been addressed by the authors, these include the following points which weaken the conclusions and interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>a) Na Butyrate was shown to extend the survival of G93A mice by Zhang et al. Na butyrate has a variety of biological effects, for example, anti-inflammatory effects inhibit mitochondrial oxidative stress, positively influence mitochondrial function, is a class I / II HDAC inhibitor, etc. What is the mechanism underlying its beneficial effects both in the context of mouse muscle function in the ALS G93A mice and in the in vitro myotube assay? Cytokine quantification as well as histone acetylation/methylation can be assessed experimentally and this is an important point that has not been appropriately investigated.</p>
<p>b) In the context of satellite cell characterization, on lines 151-152 the authors state that soleus muscles were excluded from further studies since they have a higher content of slow twitch fibers and are more similar to the diaphragm. This justification is not valid in the context of ALS as well as many other muscle disorders. Indeed, soleus and diaphragm muscles contain a high proportion of slow twitch fibers (up to 80% and 50% respectively) but soleus muscles are more spared than diaphragm muscles. What makes soleus muscles (and EOMs) more resistant to ALS NMJ injury? Satellite cells from soleus muscles need to be characterized in detail as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, EOMs are complex muscles, containing many types of fibers and expressing different myosin heavy chain isoforms and muscle proteins. The fact that in mice both the globular layer and orbital layers of EOMs express slow myosin heavy chain isoform as well as myosin heavy chain 2X, 2A, and 2B (Zhou et al., 2010 IOVIS 51:6355-6363) also indicates that the sparing is not directly linked to the fast or slow twitch nature of the muscle fiber. This needs to be considered.</p>
<p>c) In the context of myotube formation from cultured satellite cells on lines 178-179 the authors stained the myotubes for myosin heavy chain. Because of the diversity of myosin heavy chain isoforms and different muscle origins of the satellite cells investigated, the isoform of myosin heavy chain expressed by the myotubes needs to be tested and described. It is not sufficient to state anti-MYH.</p>
<p>d) The original RNAseq results have not been deposited and while it is true that the authors have analyzed the results and described them in Figures 6 and 7 and relative supplements, the original data needs to be shown both as an xls list as a Volcano plots (q value versus log2 fold change). This will facilitate the independent interpretation of the results by the readers as some transcripts may not be listed. As presented it is rather difficult to identify which transcripts aside from Cxcl12 are commonly upregulated. Can the data be presented in a more visual way?</p>
<p>e) There is no section describing the statistical analysis methods used. In many figures, more than 2 groups are compared so the authors need to use an ANOVA followed by a post hoc test.</p>
<p>The authors have achieved their aim in showing that satellite cells derived from EOMs have a distinct transcriptome and that this may be the basis of their sparing in ALS. Furthermore, this work may help develop future therapeutic interventions for patients with ALS.</p>
