<title>Abstract</title><p>Activation of the subventricular zone (SVZ) after cerebral ischemia is one of the early responses in the brain to counteract the loss of neurons and reduce tissue damage. Impaired brain regions communicate with the SVZ through many chemotactic messages that result in neural stem cells (NSC) migration and differentiation. However, the activation of gliogenesis and the role of newborn astrocytes in the post-ischemic scenario is still under debate. We have previously shown that adenosine release after brain ischemia prompts the SVZ to generate new astrocytes. Here, we use transient brain ischemia in mice to define the cellular origin of these astrocytes in the SVZ neurogenic niche and investigate their role in the pathological process. By combining immunofluorescence, BrdU-tracing and genetic cellular labelling, we tracked the migration of newborn astrocytes, positive for the proteoglycan marker Thbs4, from the dorsal and medial SVZ to the perilesional barrier surrounding the ischemic core, termed “glial scar”. We found that these Thbs4-positive astrocytes modulate the dense extracellular matrix at the lesion border by synthesis but also degradation of hyaluronan. We also show that while the accumulation of this polymer at the lesion is sufficient to recruit newborn astrocytes, its degradation at the SVZ correlates with gliogenesis. These results point to newborn astrocytes as a plausible pharmacological target to modulate the glial scar after brain ischemia and facilitate tissue regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cell regeneration in the adult mammalian brain occurs mainly in two neurogenic niches: the subventricular zone (SVZ) in the lateral ventricle and the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bond et al., 2015</xref>). Adult brain stem cells are multipotent and derive from the embryonic radial glia, thus sharing the principal cell markers and features with resident astrocytes. In the adult mouse brain, neuroblasts from SVZ migrate through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulb (OB), where neurogenesis occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Luskin, 1993</xref>). Neuronal hyperactivity (e.g., during epilepsy), as well as pathological (e.g., stroke) or natural (e.g., aging) processes, can impair the physiological machinery of the neurogenic niches altering their neurogenic and gliogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chaker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kralic et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sundholm-Peters et al., 2005</xref>). It is known, for instance, that SVZ cells are activated <italic>in vivo</italic> after focal ischemia following a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ceanga et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>We have previously demonstrated in oxygen and glucose-deprived (OGD) organotypic brain slices that the ischemic region and the SVZ establish a biochemical interplay based on a gradient of toxic and protective factors released early after the insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cavaliere et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, others have demonstrated that brain stroke models in mice can activate astrogliogenesis to the detriment of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Laug et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Young et al., 2012</xref>). Benner and colleagues identified an SVZ-derived astrocyte population characterized by high levels of the membrane-bound proteoglycan thrombospondin 4 (Thbs4), a cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecule that has been deemed neuroprotective against ischemic damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Laug et al., 2019</xref>). Ablation of Thbs4 in KO mice also produced abnormal ischemic scar formation and increased microvascular haemorrhage, suggesting a role of SVZ astrogliogenesis in brain damage and glial scar formation induced by ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benner et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The perilesional barrier known as the <italic>glial scar</italic> assembles early after brain ischemia, isolating the damaged area and constraining both the spread of pathogens and potentially toxic damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) into the surrounding area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bush et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Faulkner et al., 2004</xref>). Consisting of packed reactive astrocytes and a dense extracellular matrix comprised mostly of hyaluronic acid (HA), the glial scar represents a physical barrier for the SVZ-generated newborn neurons which migrate into the ischemic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arvidsson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yamashita et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the modulation of glial scar formation after brain ischemia may represent a strategy to reduce tissue damage and reestablish brain functionality. In ischemic stroke, the brain extracellular matrix (ECM) suffers a thorough restructuration due to injury and must undergo successful remodelling to encourage brain repair. ECM elements involved in the ischemic cascade induce activation of astrocytes and microglia, modulating ECM structure by releasing glycoproteins to the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adams and Gallo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fawcett, 2015</xref>). This crosstalk culminates in the formation of the glial scar, which is created locally by reactive astrocytes and astrocytes-secreted ECM molecules such as HA and chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bush et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lau et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We have previously demonstrated that high extracellular adenosine levels, a hallmark of ischemic insults, induced astrogliogenesis from the SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benito-Muñoz et al., 2016</xref>). Following our previous results, here we characterized the SVZ response to brain ischemia and investigated the role of newly generated astrocytes in the modulation of the glial scar after MCAO. We show that ischemic conditions increase the number of newly generated astrocytes in the SVZ and their migration to the ischemic area. We also propose the role of these astrocytes in modulating the extracellular matrix at the glial scar and suggest this astrocyte population as a possible target for brain repair after brain ischemia</p>

<title>Thbs4 is expressed in the neurogenic niche of the SVZ</title>
<p>As suggested by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Girard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pous et al., 2020</xref>), Thbs4 is highly expressed in astrocytes of the SVZ and RMS and might have a role in ischemia-induced neurogenesis. To confirm these observations, we labelled the mouse SVZ by immunofluorescence for Thbs4. Thbs4 was mainly expressed in the SVZ, RMS and OB but also in the cerebellum and ventral tegmental area (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In the SVZ, the staining was associated with cells with different morphologies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), ranging from cells with small primary apical processes in contact with the ventricle, to rounded NSC-like cells in the dorsolateral SVZ horn. After quantification by direct count of Thbs4-positive cells, Thbs4-positive astrocytes represented 21,4% of the total SVZ cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), with more than 60%of them displaying a radial glia-like type-B morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bond et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Doetsch et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). To confirm Thbs4 expression, we labelled the SVZ cells with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the Thbs4 promoter (pThbs4-eGFP) by postnatal (P1) electroporation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Twenty-four hours after electroporation, almost 20% of total cells in the dorsal SVZ expressed GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), with a greater extent in the rostral SVZ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), confirming that Thbs4-positive cells were mainly localized in the neurogenic niche of the SVZ.</p>

<title>Thbs4 expression in the SVZ increases after brain ischemia</title>
<p>To investigate if brain ischemia could activate astrogliogenesis in the SVZ, we analyzed cell proliferation and Thbs4 expression in the SVZ after MCAO. Sixty minutes of MCAO (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>) caused neuronal damage in the cortex and striatum, as observed by cresyl violet staining (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>) and NeuN immunofluorescence (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). The survival rate at 28 days post-lesion was around 50% (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>). Moreover, motor deficits and animal weight of ischemic mice were followed every day after MCAO for 30 days. Motor deficits ameliorated overtime, while body weight dropped sharply the first 3 days after MCAO and was partially restored at 30 dpi (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1E-F</xref>).</p>
<p>To study cell proliferation in the SVZ, we administrated 50 mg/kg BrdU i.p. every two hours (3 doses in total) the day before MCAO (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). We observed an increase of total SVZ BrdU-positive cells 24h after MCAO (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B-C</xref>). Ki67 immunofluorescence of SVZ wholemount preparations (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>) also revealed more than tenfold increase of proliferative cells 24h after MCAO (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref>). In addition, we observed a significant increase in cleaved Caspase3-positive cells 24h post-lesion (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2F-G</xref>). These results suggest a fast and specific proliferative response in the ischemia-induced SVZ.</p>
<p>We next analyzed Thbs4 staining in combination with Nestin, an NSC marker, and Doublecortin (DCX), a marker of neuroblasts, before and after MCAO. SVZ was analyzed in sham and ischemic mice 7-, 15- and 30-days post-ischemia (dpi). The immunofluorescence analysis of the SVZ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) showed a transient decrease of Nestin and DCX-positive cells but an increase of Thbs4-positive astrocytes up to 15 dpi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>) with respect to the Sham animals. The increase of Thbs4 astrocytes was also confirmed by Western blot analysis using SVZ homogenates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-F</xref>), evidencing a 2-fold increased expression of Thbs4 in the ischemic SVZ. Similarly to immunofluorescence, Western blot also showed decreased Nestin protein levels at 15 dpi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). These results suggest that Thbs4 expression in the SVZ is increased after ischemia.</p>

<title>Ischemia induces Thbs4-positive newborn astrocytes from SVZ slow proliferative cells</title>
<p>To characterize the different cell populations of the SVZ activated after focal ischemia, we labelled the whole pool of proliferating cells with 1% of BrdU in drinking water for 14 days before MCAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Codega et al., 2014</xref>). One month after MCAO, BrdU in the SVZ mainly stained slow proliferative cells like type B cells, whereas in rapid transit-amplifying cells (type C), BrdU was diluted away. Therefore, we chose to label type C cells by intraperitoneal administration (50 mg/kg) of 5-Iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (IdU) 24h before euthanasia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). To identify the cell origin of newborn astrocytes, we analyzed the SVZ 30 dpi by immunofluorescence co-labelling Thbs4 and GFAP together with BrdU or IdU. We found a 2-fold increase of the total amount of proliferative cells (BrdU-positive) after MCAO respect to sham group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), whereas we did not observe a significant change in the number of IdU-positive cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The number of slow proliferative NSC (Thbs4/GFAP/BrdU) increased linearly after MCAO (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, E</xref>) especially in the dorsal region of the SVZ (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>), whereas the number of activated NSC (Thbs4/GFAP/IdU) did not change significantly either in the whole SVZ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>) or in any subregion analyzed (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). These results suggest that, after ischemia, Thbs4-positive astrocytes derive from the slow proliferative type B cells.</p>

<title>Ischemia-induced newborn astrocytes migrate from the dorsal SVZ to ischemic regions</title>
<p>To confirm that Thbs4-positive astrocytes derived from type B cells of dorsal SVZ, we labelled NSCs of dorsal SVZ by electroporating the pCAGGSx-CRE plasmid in P1 Ai14 Rosa26-CAG-tdTomato transgenic mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Plasmid electroporation induced the expression of tdTomato (tdTOM) by Cre recombination, enabling the spatial tracking and cell fate assessment of electroporated NCS from the dorsal SVZ. 3-4 months after electroporation, we performed the MCAO and tdTOM fluorescence was analyzed at 7, 30 and 60 dpi. To confirm the efficient labelling of NSCs by the electroporation protocol, we followed the tdTOM fluorescence in the OB (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>, see methods). Only those animals with tdTOM-positive cells in the OB were taken into account for later analysis. After quantification of tdTOM-positive NSCs 7, 30 and 60 dpi, we observed a significant decrease in tdTOM-positive cells in ischemic animals in all SVZ regions analyzed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-C</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4B</xref>), suggesting that they either left the area, or died. On the contrary, there was a general increase of tdTOM-positive cells outside the SVZ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-E</xref>), especially in the intermediate and caudal axis of the whole brain respect to sham animals (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D-G</xref>), suggesting that electroporated cells had migrated away from the SVZ.</p>

<p>To identify the proportion of NSCs that differentiated to Thbs4-positive astrocytes following ischemia, we analyzed the co-expression of Thbs4 with tdTOM after MCAO. Despite the general decrease of tdTOM-positive cells in the SVZ, the fraction of Thbs4/tdTOM cells increased at 30 dpi after MCAO (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F-G</xref>), reaching a maximum increase at 60 dpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>), in particular in rostral and intermediate SVZ (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C</xref>). Finally, we analyzed the Thbs4-positive astrocytes recruitment to the ischemic regions. More than half of the total tdTOM-positive cells in the infarcted area expressed the Thbs4 marker at 60 dpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I-J</xref>). These results suggest that ischemia-induced astrogliogenesis in the SVZ occurs in type B cells from the dorsal region, and that these newborn Thbs4-positive astrocytes migrate to the ischemic areas.</p>

<title>Thbs4-positive astrocytes accumulate at the glial scar after brain ischemia</title>
<p>Nestin, besides its role in the neurogenic niches, is also rapidly and locally expressed by reactive astrocytes and participates in the glial scar formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Frisén et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, we used Nestin immunofluorescence as a reliable tool to identify the lesion border where the glial scar occurs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Nestin staining of the scar was also compared with more classical methodologies like TTC staining (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), where viable tissue is stained red and dead tissue is left unstained. The white-pale pink area was then measured as infarct tissue by TTC staining (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Unlike the TTC staining, which can only be performed hours after the lesion (the infiltration of peripheral immune cells avoids the exposure of the stained area), the visualization of the glial scar with Nestin immunofluorescence allowed us to analyze the lesion at later time-points. We observed a rapid formation of the glial scar already at 7 dpi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Analyzing the expression of the two astrocytic markers, Thbs4 and GFAP, as a percentage of the glial scar region-of-interest (ROI), we observed different dynamics and localization. GFAP expression increased rapidly after 7 days within the glial scar ROI, whereas Thbs4 was upregulated at 15 dpi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). This delay suggested that the glial scar harbors two different astrocytic sub-populations: GFAP-only or GFAP/Thbs4. To analyze the spatial location of GFAP and Thbs4 markers within the Nestin border, we measured the fluorescence intensity profile of damaged area at 30 dpi. GFAP was found in both the scar and core areas, whereas Thbs4 fluorescence was found mostly at the borders of the glial scar (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-G</xref>). Analysis and dynamics of Thbs4-positive astrocyte migration was further performed in the corpus callosum (CC), striatum (Str), cortex (Ctx) and olfactory bulb (OB) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). We observed a linear increase of Thbs4-positive astrocytes from 7 to 60 dpi, both in the Ctx and Str (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). Migration occurred mainly through the corpus callosum; among the total GFAP-positive astrocytes, 36.5% were also positive for Thbs4, suggesting that more than one third of the astrocytes in the glial scar derived from the SVZ (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>). Likewise, the number of DCX-positive cells dramatically decreased 15 dpi in all OB layer (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D-F</xref>) together with a significant decrease of BrdU-positive cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5G</xref>) DCX/BrdU-positive neuroblasts in the RMS (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5H</xref>), suggesting that ischemia induced a change in the neuroblasts ectopic migratory pathway, depriving the OB layers of the SVZ newborn neurons.</p>

<title>Thbs4-positive astrocytes modulate extracellular matrix homeostasis at the glial scar</title>
<p>To study the role of Thbs4-positive astrocytes in the glial scar, we analyzed the HA, the main compound of the brain extracellular matrix (ECM), using the hyaluronic binding protein (HABP) as a marker. Upon ischemic damage, local astrocytes (GFAP+/Thbs4-) react and change their morphology to a fibrotic state, producing high-molecular weight HA (HMW-HA) to form the glial scar and isolate the damaged area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Preston and Sherman, 2011</xref>). We then analyzed HA deposition in the corpus callosum and the infarcted areas after MCAO. HABP immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) and image analysis evidenced HA accumulation in the infarcted areas. Skeleton analysis revealed progressively longer HA cable-like structures at the glial scar during infarct evolution (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Fractal dimension analysis, which informs on the interconnectivity of the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Soria et al., 2020</xref>), confirmed HA accumulation and progressively increased matrix complexity in infarcted areas but not in corpus callosum (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), suggesting that white matter glia react differently to the damage.</p>

<p>The presence of the Thbs4-positive astrocytes in the ischemic scar proximal to HA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-E</xref>) prompted us to investigate if this population contributed to ECM production and, hence, to the scar formation. Since HA is produced exclusively at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sherman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zimmermann and Dours-Zimmermann, 2008</xref>), we analyzed HA labelling within 1 µm of the Thbs4-positive cell membrane in high-resolution confocal images (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Image analysis showed a dramatic increase in HABP area at Thbs4-positive astrocyte-cell membranes after MCAO (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>), suggesting a role of Thbs4-positive astrocytes in HA formation at the glial scar.</p>
<p>To study the potential role of Thbs4-positive astrocytes in HA removal, we quantified intracellular HABP spots in Thbs4-positive astrocytes at the glial scar. Although HMW-HA cleavage is an extracellular process, HA fragments can be internalized for degradation by lysosomal hyaluronidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Preston and Sherman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zimmermann and Dours-Zimmermann, 2008</xref>). Intracellular HABP spots were analyzed in the Thbs4-positive astrocytes and in local astrocytes GFAP-positive/Thbs4-negative) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>). Thirty days after MCAO, Thbs4-positive astrocytes showed more intracellular HABP than local astrocytes in the infarcted cortex (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>). However, the number of HA spots internalized was higher in local astrocytes compared with Thbs4 astrocytes (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C</xref>), suggesting that Thbs4-positive cells internalize HA in fewer vesicles. To confirm that astrocytes were degrading HA, we performed an immunofluorescence analysis of CD44 (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6D</xref>). CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor whose main function is HA degradation and ECM remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dzwonek and Wilczynski, 2015</xref>). We showed that Thbs4-positive astrocytes highly expressed CD44 receptor and their colocalization was around 80% of the total Thbs4-positive astrocytes in the corpus callosum 30 dpi (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6E</xref>). These results suggest that Thbs4-positive astrocytes participate in both the formation and degradation of the extracellular matrix at the glial scar.</p>
<p>To confirm these results in a more versatile preparation, we performed rat <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures from SVZ neural stem cells. Oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) protocol was conducted as an ischemia model and cells were fixed 7 days after OGD (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>). HA was analysed by HABP immunofluorescence (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B</xref>) inside and outside the Thbs4-positive cells (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7C</xref>). Thbs4-positive cells display increased intracellular HA after OGD (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7D</xref>), whereas HA decreased in the extracellular space (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7E</xref>). However, this phenomenon was reversed after adding hyaluronidases in the extracellular space (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7F-G</xref>), suggesting Thbs4-positive cells from SVZ homogenates can internalize or synthesize HA depending on the external stimuli. HA was also measured in Iba1-positive cell cultures where we observed a reduced internalization compare to Thbs4-positive cells (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7H</xref>). Finally, metalloproteinases activity was also increased in Thbs4 cultures after OGD (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7I</xref>). All these results together suggest Thbs4-positive cells can internalize HA after ischemic conditions but also synthetize it when ECM is degraded.</p>

<title>Hyaluronan accumulation is sufficient but not exclusive for the recruitment of Thbs4-positive astrocytes</title>
<p>Since Thbs4-positive astrocytes migrate to the glial scar but not to the ischemic core, we hypothesize that HA, the main component of the ischemic scar, may be the trigger signal for Thbs4-positive astrocyte recruitment. To test this hypothesis, we simulated the ECM accumulation occurring at the scar by overexpressing the Hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) from the naked mole rat (<italic>Heterocephalus glaber</italic>), which produces HA of very high molecular weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tian et al., 2013</xref>).

Interestingly, when we produced the lesion by MCAO and the viral overexpression of HAS2 in the contralateral hemisphere, we observed that Thbs4-positive astrocytes preferentially migrated to the ischemic glial scar (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The effects of brain insult on adult neurogenesis have been extensively discussed, both in animal models and humans. However, whether these can activate the generation of newborn astrocytes from the neurogenic niches is still under debate. Neural stem cells in the adult brain represent a reminiscence of the embryonic radial glia. While some researchers propose that exhaustion of neurogenesis in the adult brain is the consequence of astrogliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Encinas et al., 2011</xref>), others define astrogliogenesis as a part of a neurorestorative program from the neurogenic niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bonzano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sohn et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, direct and clear evidence of the generation of newborn astrocytes from the SVZ or the SGZ has not been presented so far, nor has the role that newborn astrocytes may have in ageing and pathophysiological conditions. Here, we confirm that a strong and acute damage-associated stimulus in the brain, such as an ischemic infarct, prompts astrogliogenesis in the SVZ. We also demonstrate that these astrocytes, which are positive for Thbs4, migrate to the glial scar and modulate it, being capable of synthesis and degradation of hyaluronan, a main component of the ECM at the scar.</p>
<p>Our results are in agreement with previous observations, where cortical injury initiated by photothrombotic/ischemia can initiate a massive Thbs4-positive astrocyte production from the SVZ that is modulated by Notch activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benner et al., 2013</xref>). In this work, the authors suggested a clear involvement of the Thbs4-positive astrocytes in ischemic scar modulation. In fact, the homozygotic ablation of the Thbs4 gene resulted in abnormal glial scar formation and increased microvascular haemorrhage after brain ischemia. Our results also showed that the adult neurogenic niche at the SVZ responds early after the ischemic stroke, degrading local hyaluronan plausibly to modify niche stiffness and allow NSCs proliferation and differentiation. NSC labelling by <italic>in vivo</italic> postnatal electroporation allowed us to provide proof of the origin and migration of newborn Thbs4-positive astrocytes from the SVZ to the ischemic scar in response to the pathological process. It is interesting to note that Thbs4 is present in the newborn astrocytes that arrive at the scar, whereas local reactive astrocytes at the damaged area express GFAP only. It is plausible that the SVZ-derived newborn astrocytes express Thbs4 to be able to migrate to the ischemic area since Thbs4 deletion has been shown to be detrimental to the migration of SVZ-derived cells along the RMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Girard et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>It is interesting to notice that despite the local, “GFAP-only”, reactive astrocytes at the scar are capable of forming the required ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cregg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wanner et al., 2013</xref>), we show that Thbs4-positive (Thbs4/GFAP) astrocytes are recruited from the SVZ to participate in scar formation likewise. It should be noted that contrary to the local reactive astrocytes, which are hastily generated and are located both at the center and border of the lesion, the newborn astrocytes recruited from the SVZ arrive later to the injury. We demonstrate that these Thbs4-positive astrocytes migrate all the way from the SVZ to the lesion and stop at the lesion border (defined precisely by Nestin staining), establishing residence at the scar but not beyond. The molecular signals that trigger gliogenesis at the SVZ and recruit newborn astrocytes to the lesion are still unclear. We have previously shown that adenosine, a byproduct of ATP hydrolysis, is a strong candidate, given that stimulates astrogliogenesis through A1 receptors after OGD <italic>in vitro</italic> and ischemia <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benito-Muñoz et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we have shown that viral-mediated overproduction of the principal component of the glial scar, HA, is sufficient to activate the generation and migration of the Thbs4-positive astrocytes from the SVZ. However, our data also show that the ischemic infarct, with all its proinflammatory (cytokines, chemokines) and proteolytic (MMPs, ROS) signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jayaraj et al., 2019</xref>), constitute a stronger attractor than the ECM <italic>per se</italic>.</p>
<p>Based on our observations of both HA production and internalization by these cells <italic>in vivo</italic> in the ischemic region and <italic>in vitro</italic> after OGD, we propose a role of Thbs4-positive astrocytes in the modulation, and perhaps maintenance, of the ECM at the scar. It is possible that ECM degradation at the scar is also performed by professional macrophages such as microglia, which are known to be recruited to the scar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fawcett and Asher, 1999</xref>) and have been shown to degrade ECM by phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Soria et al., 2020</xref>). Understanding which cells in the scar environment participate in its modulation, and specifically in its degradation, bears highly therapeutic value for regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Silver and Miller, 2004</xref>). Here, we shed light on the unknown role of SVZ-derived astrocytes activated by the brain ischemic insult and propose them as critical players for tissue regeneration after brain ischemia.</p>

<title>Transient MCAO</title>
<p>Brain ischemia was induced in 3-4-month old C57BL/6 mice (approximately 25 g) by occluding 60 minutes of the lenticulo-striate arteries with a 10 mm length of silicone-coated 6-0 monofilament nylon suture (602223PK10, Doccol Corporation) using a modification of the protocol described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gelderblom et al., 2009</xref>). Arteries occlusion generated a specific lesion in the cortex and striatum that was evaluated at different times after the MCAO (7, 15, 30 or 60 days after occlusion). Ischemic damage was evaluated in the ipsi-lateral hemisphere by Cresyl violet staining, nestin immunofluoresce or hyaluronan staining. Sham animals, in which arteries were visualized but not disturbed, were used as an experimental control. Both experimental groups, sham and ischemic, were anesthetized with a mix of isofluorane and oxygen (induction of anesthesia with 4% isofluorane and maintenance for surgery at 1.5% isofluorane) and maintained under analgesia with buprenorphine 24 hours after ischemia (0.03 mg/Kg body weight i.p. every 12h). Animal wellness was evaluated daily, controlling the body weight and the motor deficit of the animal by means of neurological score and pole test. Motor deficit was assessed in each animal 1h after MCAO and later every 24h. Animals without neurological deficits were excluded from the study.</p>

<title>5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) protocol</title>
<p>The total pool of proliferating cells was labelled with three injections of 50 mg/kg 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) the day before MCAO protocol. Animals were sacrificed the day after MCAO to analyse acute SVZ proliferation. Chronic BrdU protocol was performed for quiescent NSC identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Codega et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, 1% of BrdU was administered in the drinking water during 14 days. At day 15, BrdU was removed and animals were subjected to MCAO protocol. Mice were sacrificed and perfused at 3, 7, 15 and 30 days after MCAO, although only animals with a temporal window of 30 days between MCAO and perfusion were used for statistical analysis. Activated cells were labelled by i.p. injection of 50 mg/Kg 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (IdU) 24 hours before euthanasia.</p>

<title>Electroporation</title>
<p>Ai14-Rosa26-CAG-tdTomato<sup>flx/flx</sup> transgenic mice and pCAGGS-CRE plasmid were kindly provided for Prof. Harold Cremer and Marie-Catherine Tiveron from Institut de Biologie du Développement de Marseille (IBDM). Postnatal electroporation was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Platel et al., 2019</xref>). Mice pups from P0-P2 were anesthetized by hypothermia. pCAGGS-CRE plasmid was used at a final concentration of 2.5 µg/ul and 2µl was injected in the lateral ventricle by expiratory pressure using a glass micropipette. Following injection, pup brains were placed between electrodes targeted the dorsal SVZ and subjected to five 95V electrical pulses (50 ms, 950 ms intervals). BTX ECM399 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) electroporator was used with 7 mm tweezer electrodes. Electroporated pups were reanimated at 37°C before returning to the mother.</p>

<title>AAV vector production</title>
<p>AAV2/9-CAG-HAS2-3xFlag vector was produced by polyethylenimine (PEI) mediated triple transfection of low passage HEK-293 T/17 cells (ATCC; cat number CRL-11268). The respective AAV expression plasmid expression plasmid pNMRHAS2_N1(provided by Dr Vera Gorbunova) was cotransfected with the adeno helper pAd Delta F6 plasmid (Penn Vector Core, cat # PL-F-PVADF6) and AAV Rep Cap pAAV2/9 plasmid (Penn Vector Core, cat # PL-TPV008). AAV vector was purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bourdenx et al., 2015</xref>). Cells are harvested 72 h post-transfection, resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.5) and lysed by 3 freeze-thaw cycles (37°C/-80°C). The cell lysate is treated with 150 units/ml Benzonase (Sigma, St Louis, MO) for 1 h at 37°C, and the crude lysate is clarified by centrifugation. Vectors are purified by iodixanol step gradient centrifugation and concentrated and buffer-exchanged into Lactated Ringer’s solution (Baxter, Deerfield, IL) using vivaspin20 100 kDa cut-off concentrator (Sartorius Stedim, Goettingen, Germany). Titrations were performed at the transcriptome core facility (Neurocentre Magendie, INSERM U862, Bordeaux, France). The genome-containing particle (gcp) titer was determined at a concentration of 1.10<sup>13</sup> gcp/ml by quantitative real-time PCR using the Light Cycler 480 SYBR green master mix (Roche, cat # 04887352001) with primers specific for the AAV2 ITRs (fwd 50-GGAACCCCTAGTGATG GAGTT-3’; rev 50-CGGCCTCAGTGAGCGA-30) on a Light Cycler 480 instrument. The purity assessment of vector stocks was estimated by loading 10 μl of vector stock on 10 % SDS acrylamide gels; total proteins were visualized using the Krypton Infrared Protein Stain according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies).</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> AAV-HAS2 injections</title>
<p>Mice were anaesthetized with isofluorane and fixed to a stereotaxic frame connected with a gas mask. We injected 1µl of adeno-associated virus (AAV2/9) CAG-HAS2-3xFlag (1×10^13 gc/µl) in the contralateral striatum (AP: +1.0; ML: −1.8; DV: −3.2) to simulate scar tissue hyaluronan. After two weeks, the ischemic group was subjected to the MCAO model in the ipsilateral hemisphere and perfused 30 days later. Only slices with representative lesions in both hemispheres were used for image and statistical analysis.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Mice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg). Brain tissues were fixed by intracardial perfusion using 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed brains were sliced at 40 μm of thickness using the Leica VT 1200S vibratome (Leica Microsystems) and subjected to immunofluorescence. For standard immunofluorescence protocol, tissue slices were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton and non-specific epitopes blocked with 1% Bovine Serum Albumin and 10% Donkey serum in PBS. Primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 1) were incubated at different concentrations (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for specification) overnight at 4°C and then washed three times with 0.1% Triton in PBS. Secondary conjugated antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with 0.1% Triton in PBS, cells were stained for 10 min with DAPI and further washed with PBS. Finally, coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount (SouthernBiotech) and analyzed by fluorescence using the confocal microscope Leica TCS SP8. For hyaluronic acid labelling, endogenous biotins were pre-blocked using Streptavidin/Biotin blocking solution (Vector Labs, #SP-2002) following the manufactureŕs instructions and further blocked with PBS 1X 0.1% Saponine 1% BSA for one hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies and biotinylated Hyaluronic Acid Binding Protein (HABP, #385911 Millipore) were incubated for 72 hours at 4°C or 24 hours at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, 1X 0.1% Saponine, secondary antibody and DAPI diluted in the same blocking buffer were incubated for one hour at room temperature. Slices were mounted with Mowiol (Millipore #475904) in superfrost slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and #1.5 coverslips.</p>

<title>Imaging and image analysis</title>
<p>Confocal images were acquired in a Leica TCS SP8, 1.4 NA and 63X oil magnification. Widefield imaging was performed in a Zeiss AxioVision fluorescence microscope and a 3DHISTECH panoramic MIDI II digital slide scanner. Settings were adjusted for each individual experiment and kept for all conditions. Image processing was performed using ImageJ, CaseViewer and Hyugens (SVI, The Netherlands) software. For Thbs4, Nestin and DCX immunofluorescence, wholemount SVZ preparations and AAV-HAS2 analysis, tile-scan was done using the navigator plug-in in the LasX software. For Nestin immunofluorescence, images were de-convoluted using the Hyugens software. For HABP analysis (both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis), an ImageJ macro was created in order to measure several parameters (HABP area and spots, inside and outside cell) with slight changes depending on the sample (monolayer or tissue).</p>

<title>Western blot</title>
<p>The SVZ was freshly dissected on ice and minced using a micro grinder. Total protein was extracted after tissue lysis with RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific #89900) and Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 100X (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were lysed in ice for 10 minutes and sonicated using an Ultrasonic Processor (Hielscher Ultrasound Technology). Sonicated tissues were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min and 4°C to remove insoluble fragments. Protein concentration was measured by chemioluminescence using RC DC™ Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Forty micrograms of protein samples were denatured in reducing loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol (M3148, Sigma) and 0.0002% bromophenol blue at 95°C for 5 minutes and separated in pre-casted 12% or 7.5% Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel using the Criterion cell system (Biorad). Electrophoresis was conducted at 80 V in a Tris-Glycine buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS in dH2O, pH 8.3). After complete separation, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Biorad) using Trans-Blot® TurboTM Transfer System (Bio-Rad). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in blocking solution (Tris-Buffer Solution (TBS), 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% BSA) for one hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated in blocking buffer for one hour at room temperature. Immunodetection was performed by electrochemical luminescence in a Chemidoc MP (Biorad) and the intensity of the bands was quantified using ImageLab (Bio-Rad) software corrected by Gaussian curves.</p>

<title>qRT-PCR</title>
<p>Fresh SVZ tissue from ipsilateral hemisphere was isolated as previously described from sham, 15 and 30 days after MCAO animals to analyse the expression of several genes (Supplementary Table 2). RNA was extracted from the tissue after mechanical trituration following the manufactureŕs protocol (NZYTECH Total RNA Isolation kit protocol (NZYTECH, MB13402). RNA concentration was measured by spectrophotometry using the Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo-Scientific, USA). Real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from 10 ng of RNA was performed using the One-step NZYTECH RT-qPCR Green kit according to manufactureŕs protocol (NZYTECH, MB34302). RT-PCR was normalized using the housekeeping genes hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase 1 (HPRT1, Qiagen QuantiTect Primer Assay, Barcelona, Spain). Specificity of each amplification was confirmed by melting curve analysis. PCR reactions were performed in a CFX96 Detection System (BioRad, Madrid, Spain). Semi-quantification was performed using the 2-ΔΔCt algorithm. Unsupervised hierarchical distance matrix and distance matrix map was developed using Orange3 software (Python v3.0).</p>

<p>The authors analyze the role of newborn astrocytes in the modulation of glial scar formation in a middle carotid artery occlusion (MCAO) hypoxia lesion model. The findings are <bold>valuable</bold> because they have implications for understanding the molecular and cellular processes contributing to brain repair in response to ischemia. The results are currently <bold>incomplete</bold>, in the absence of data showing: (i) cell-target specificity of molecular markers for newborn astrocytes; (ii) consistent phenomena across different rodent species.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show that SVZ-derived astrocytes respond to a middle carotid artery occlusion (MCAO) hypoxia lesion by secreting and modulating hyaluronan at the edge of the lesion (penumbra) and that hyaluronan is a chemoattractant to SVZ astrocytes. They use lineage tracing of SVZ cells to determine their origin. They also find that SVZ-derived astrocytes express Thbs-4 but astrocytes at the MCAO-induced scar do not. Also, they demonstrate that decreased HA in the SVZ is correlated with gliogenesis. While much of the paper is descriptive/correlative they do overexpress Hyaluronan synthase 2 via viral vectors and show this is sufficient to recruit astrocytes to the injury. Interestingly, astrocytes preferred to migrate to the MCAO than to the region of overexpressed HAS2.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The field has largely ignored the gliogenic response of the SVZ, especially with regard to astrocytic function. These cells and especially newborn cells may provide support for regeneration. Emigrated cells from the SVZ have been shown to be neuroprotective via creating pro-survival environments, but their expression and deposition of beneficial extracellular matrix molecules are poorly understood. Therefore, this study is timely and important. The paper is very well written and the flow of results is logical.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main problem is that they do not show that Hyaluronan is necessary for SVZ astrogenesis and or migration to MCAO lesions. Such loss of function studies have been carried out by studies they cite (e.g. Girard et al., 2014 and Benner et al., 2013). Similar approaches seem to be necessary in this work.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) How good of a marker for newborn astrocytes is Thbs4? Did you co-label with B cell markers like EGFr? Is the Thbs4 gene expressed in B cells? Do scRNAseq papers show it is expressed in B cells? Are they B1 or B2 cells?</p>
<p>(2) It is curious that there was no increase in Type C cells after MCAO - do the authors propose a direct NSC-astrocyte differentiation?</p>
<p>(3) The paper would be strengthened with orthogonal views of z projections to show co-localization.</p>
<p>(4) It is not clear why the dorsal SVZ is analysed and focused on in Figure 4. This region emanates from the developmental pallium (cerebral cortex anlagen). It generates some excitatory neurons early postnatally and is thought to have differential signalling such as Wnt (Raineteau group).</p>
<p>(5) Several of the images show the lesion and penumbra as being quite close to the SVZ. Did any of the lesions contact the SVZ? If so, I would strongly recommend excluding them from the analysis as such contact is known to hyperactivate the SVZ.</p>
<p>(6) The authors switch to a rat in vitro analysis towards the end of the study. This needs to be better justified. How similar are the molecules involved between mouse and rat?</p>
<p>(7) Similar comment for overexpression of naked mole rat HA.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, Ardaya et al have addressed the impact of ischemia-induced gliogenesis from the adult SVZ and their effect on the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the glial scar. They use Thbs4, a marker previously identified to be expressed in astrocytes of the SVZ, to understand its role in ischemia-induced gliogenesis. First, the authors show that Thbs4 is expressed in the SVZ and that its expression levels increase upon ischemia. Next, they claim that ischemia induces the generation of newborn astrocyte from SVZ neural stem cells (NSCs), which migrate toward the ischemic regions to accumulate at the glial scar. Thbs4-expressing astrocytes are recruited to the lesion by Hyaluronan where they modulate ECM homeostasis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings of these studies are in principle interesting and the experiments are in principle good.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript suffers from an evident lack of clarity and precision in regard to their findings and their interpretation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to study the activation of gliogenesis and the role of newborn astrocytes in a post-ischemic scenario. Combining immunofluorescence, BrdU-tracing, and genetic cellular labelling, they tracked the migration of newborn astrocytes (expressing Thbs4) and found that Thbs4-positive astrocytes modulate the extracellular matrix at the lesion border by synthesis but also degradation of hyaluronan. Their results point to a relevant function of SVZ newborn astrocytes in the modulation of the glial scar after brain ischemia. This work's major strength is the fact that it is tackling the function of SVZ newborn astrocytes, whose role is undisclosed so far.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The article is innovative, of good quality, and clearly written, with properly described Materials and Methods, data analysis, and presentation. In general, the methods are designed properly to answer the main question of the authors, being a major strength. Interpretation of the data is also in general well done, with results supporting the main conclusions of this article.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, there are some points of this article that still need clarification to further improve this work.</p>
<p>- As a first general comment, is it possible that the increase in Thbs4-positive astrocytes can also happen locally close to the glia scar, through the proliferation of local astrocytes or even from local astrocytes at the SVZ? As it was shown in published articles most of the newborn astrocytes in the adult brain actually derive from proliferating astrocytes, and a smaller percentage is derived from NSCs. How can the authors rule out a contribution of local astrocytes to the increase of Thbs4-positive astrocytes? The authors also observed that only about one-third of the astrocytes in the glial scar derived from the SVZ.</p>
<p>- It is known that the local, GFAP-reactive astrocytes at the scar can form the required ECM. The authors propose a role of Thbs4-positive astrocytes in the modulation, and perhaps maintenance, of the ECM at the scar, thus participating in scar formation likewise. So, this means that the function of newborn astrocytes is only to help the local astrocytes in the scar formation and thus contribute to tissue regeneration. Why do we need specifically the Thbs4-positive astrocytes migrating from the SVZ to help the local astrocytes? Can you discuss this further?</p>
<p>- The authors observed that the number of BrdU- and DCX-positive cells decreased 15 dpi in all OB layers (Fig. S5). They further suggest that ischemia-induced a change in the neuroblasts ectopic migratory pathway, depriving the OB layers of the SVZ newborn neurons. Are the authors suggesting that these BrdU/DCX-positive cells now migrate also to the ischemic scar, or do they die? In fact, they see an increase in caspase-3 positive cells in the SVZ after ischemia, but they do not analyse which type of cells are dying. Alternatively, is there a change in the fate of the cells, and astrogliogenesis is increased at the expense of neurogenesis? The authors should understand which cells are Cleaved-caspase-3 positive at the SVZ and clarify if there is a change in cell fate. Also please clarify what happens to the BrdU/DCX-positive cells that are born at the SVZ but do not migrate properly to the OB layers.</p>
<p>- The authors showed decreased Nestin protein levels at 15 dpi by western blot and immunostaining shows a decrease already at 7div (Figure 2). These results mean that there is at least a transient depletion of NSCs due to the promotion of astrogliogenesis. However, the authors show that at 30dpi there is an increase of slow proliferating NSCs (Figure 3). Does this mean, that there is a reestablishment of the SVZ cytogenic process? How does it happen, more specifically, how NSCs number is promoted at 30dpi? Please explain how are the NSCs modulated throughout time after ischemia induction and its impact on the cytogenic process.</p>
<p>- The authors performed a classification of Thbs4-positive cells in the SVZ according to their morphology. This should be confirmed with markers expressed by each of the cell subtypes.</p>
<p>- In Figure S6, the authors quantified HABP spots inside Thbs4-positive astrocytes. Please show a higher magnification picture to show how this quantification was done.</p>
