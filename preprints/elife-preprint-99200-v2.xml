<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The International Tuberculosis Host Genetics Consortium (ITHGC) demonstrated the power of large-scale GWAS analysis across diverse ancestries in identifying tuberculosis (TB) susceptibility loci. Despite identifying a significant genetic correlate in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-II region, this association did not replicate in the African ancestry-specific analysis, due to small sample size and the inclusion of admixed samples. Our study aimed to build upon the findings from the ITHGC and identify TB susceptibility loci in an admixed South African cohort using the local ancestry allelic adjusted association (LAAA) model. We identified a near-genome-wide significant association (<italic>rs3117230</italic>, <italic>p</italic>-value = 5.292 x10<sup>-6</sup>, OR = 0.437, SE = 0.182) in the <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic> gene originating from KhoeSan ancestry. These findings extend the work of the ITHGC, underscore the need for innovative strategies in studying complex admixed populations, and confirm the role of the HLA-II region in TB susceptibility in admixed South African samples.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M.tb</italic>) (World Health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Organization, 2023</xref>). <italic>M.tb</italic> infection has a wide range of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic, non-transmissible, or so-called “latent”, infections to active TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zaidi et al., 2023</xref>). Approximately 1/4 of the global population is infected with <italic>M.tb</italic>, but only 5-15% of infected individuals will develop active TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Menzies et al., 2021</xref>). Several factors increase the risk of progressing to active TB, including co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, asthma and other airway and lung diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Glaziou et al., 2018</xref>). Socio-economic factors including smoking, malnutrition, alcohol abuse, intravenous drug use, prolonged residence in a high burdened community, overcrowding, informal housing and poor sanitation also influence <italic>M.tb</italic> transmission and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cudahy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Escombe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Laghari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Matose et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Smith et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, individual variability in infection and disease progression has been attributed to variation in the host genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schurz et al., 2024</xref>; Caitlin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Uren et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Verhein et al., 2018</xref>). Numerous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) investigating TB susceptibility have been conducted across different population groups. However, findings from these studies often do not replicate across population groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Möller &amp; Kinnear, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Möller et al., 2018</xref>; Caitlin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Uren et al., 2017</xref>). This lack of replication could be caused by small sample sizes, variation in phenotype definitions among studies, variation in linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns across different population groups and the presence of population-specific effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Möller &amp; Kinnear, 2020</xref>). Additionally, complex LD patterns within population groups, produced by admixture, impede the detection of statistically significant loci when using traditional GWAS methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Swart et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The International Tuberculosis Host Genetics Consortium (ITHGC) performed a meta-analysis of TB GWAS results including 14 153 TB cases and 19 536 controls of African, Asian and European ancestries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schurz et al., 2024</xref>). The multi-ancestry meta-analysis identified one genome-wide significant variant (<italic>rs28383206</italic>) in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-II region (<italic>p</italic> = 5.2 x 10<sup>-9</sup>, OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.84-0.95). The association peak at the <italic>HLA-II</italic> locus encompassed several genes encoding crucial antigen presentation proteins (including <italic>HLA-DR</italic> and <italic>HLA-DQ</italic>). While ancestry-specific association analyses in the European and Asian cohorts also produced suggestive peaks in the HLA-II region, the African ancestry-specific association test did not yield any associations or suggestive peaks. The authors described possible reasons for the lack of associations, including the smaller sample size compared to the other ancestry-specific meta-analyses, increased genetic diversity within African individuals and population stratification produced by two admixed cohorts from the South African Coloured (SAC) population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schurz et al., 2024</xref>). The SAC population (as termed in the South African census (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lehohla, 2012</xref>)) form part of a multi-way (up to five-way) admixed population with ancestral contributions from Bantu-speaking African (∼30%), KhoeSan (∼30%), European (∼20%), and East (∼10%) and Southeast Asian (∼10%) populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chimusa et al., 2013</xref>). The diverse genetic background of admixed individuals can lead to population stratification, potentially introducing confounding variables. However, the power to detect statistically significant loci in admixed populations can be improved by leveraging admixture-induced local ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Swart et al., 2021</xref>; Swart, van Eeden, et al., 2022). Since previous computational algorithms were not able to include local ancestry as a covariate for GWASs, the local ancestry allelic adjusted association model (LAAA) was developed to overcome this limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Duan et al., 2018</xref>). The LAAA model identifies ancestry-specific alleles associated with the phenotype by including the minor alleles and the corresponding ancestry of the minor alleles (obtained by local ancestry inference) as covariates. The LAAA model has been successfully applied in a cohort of multi-way admixed SAC individuals to identify novel variants associated with TB susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Swart et al., 2021</xref>; Swart, van Eeden, et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Our study builds upon the findings from the ITHGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schurz et al., 2024</xref>) and aim to resolve the challenges faced in African ancestry-specific association analysis. Here, we explore host genetic correlates of TB in a complex admixed SAC population using the LAAA model.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>This study included the two SAC admixed datasets from the ITHGC analysis [RSA(A) and RSA(M)] as well as four additional TB case-control datasets obtained from admixed South African population groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Like the SAC population, the Xhosa population are admixed with rain-forest forager and KhoeSan ancestral contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choudhury et al., 2021</xref>). All datasets were collected over the past 30 years under different research projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Daya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kroon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schurz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Smith et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ugarte-Gil et al., 2020</xref>) and individuals that were included in the analyses consented to the use of their data in future research regarding TB host genetics. Across all datasets, TB cases were bacteriologically confirmed (culture positive) or diagnosed by GeneXpert. Controls were healthy individuals with no previous or current history of TB disease or treatment. However, given the high prevalence of TB in South Africa [852 cases (95% CI 679-1026) per 100 00 individuals 15 years and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cudahy et al., 2020</xref>)], most controls have likely been exposed to <italic>M.tb</italic> at some point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gallant et al., 2010</xref>). For all datasets, cases and controls were obtained from the same community and thus share similar socio-economic status and health care access.</p>

<p>A list of sites genotyped on the Infinium<sup>TM</sup> H3Africa array (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chipinfo.h3abionet.org/browse">https://chipinfo.h3abionet.org/browse</ext-link>) were extracted from the whole-genome sequenced [RSA(Xhosa)] dataset and treated as genotype data in subsequent analyses. Quality control (QC) of raw genotype data was performed using PLINK v1.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Purcell et al., 2007</xref>). In all datasets, individuals were screened for sex concordance and discordant sex information was corrected based on X chromosome homozygosity estimates (F<sub>estimate</sub> &lt; 0.2 for females and F<sub>estimate</sub> &gt; 0.8 for males). In the event that sex information could not be corrected based on homozygosity estimates, individuals with missing or discordant sex information were removed. Individuals with genotype call rates less than 90% and SNPs with more than 5% missingness were removed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Swart et al., 2021</xref>). Monomorphic sites were removed. Individuals were screened for deviations in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) for each SNP and sites deviating from the HWE threshold of 10<sup>-5</sup> were removed. Sex chromosomes were excluded from the analysis. The genome coordinates across all datasets were checked for consistency and, if necessary, converted to GRCh37 using the UCSC liftOver tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kuhn et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Genotype datasets were pre-phased using SHAPEIT v2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Delaneau et al., 2013</xref>) and imputed using the Positional Burrows-Wheeler Transformation (PBWT) algorithm through the Sanger Imputation Server (SIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Durbin, 2014</xref>). The African Genome Resource (AGR) panel (n=4 956), accessed via the SIS, was used as the reference panel for imputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gurdasani et al., 2015</xref>) since it has been shown that the AGR is the best reference panel for imputation of missing genotypes for samples from the SAC population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schurz et al., 2019</xref>). Imputed data were filtered to remove sites with imputation quality INFO scores less than 0.95. Individual datasets were screened for relatedness using KING software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Manichaikul et al., 2010</xref>) and individuals up to second degree relatedness were removed. A total of 7 544 769 markers overlapped across all six datasets. This list of intersecting markers was extracted from each dataset using PLINK --extract flag. The datasets were then merged using the PLINK v1.9. After merging, all individuals missing more than 10% genotypes were removed, markers with more than 5% missing data were excluded and a HWE filter was applied to controls (threshold &lt;10<sup>- 5</sup>). The merged dataset was screened for relatedness using KING and individuals up to second degree relatedness were subsequently removed. The final merged dataset after QC and data filtering (including the removal of related individuals) consisted of 1 544 individuals (952 TB cases and 592 healthy controls). A total of 7 510 057 variants passed QC and filtering parameters.</p>

<title>Global ancestry inference</title>
<p>ADMIXTURE was used to determine the correct number of contributing ancestral proportions in our multi-way admixed population cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alexander &amp; Lange, 2011</xref>). ADMIXTURE estimates the number of contributing ancestral populations (denoted by K) and population allele frequencies through cross-validation (CV). All 1 544 individuals were grouped into running groups of equal size together with 191 reference populations (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Running groups were created to ensure approximately equal numbers of reference populations and admixed populations. Xhosa and SAC samples were divided into separate running groups.</p>

<p>Redundant SNPs were removed by PLINK through LD pruning by removing each SNP with LD r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.1 within a 50-SNP sliding window (advanced by 10 SNPs at a time). Ancestral proportions were inferred in an unsupervised manner for K = 3-6 (1 iteration). The best value of K for the data was selected by choosing the K value with the lowest CV error across all running groups. Ten iterations of K = 3 and K = 5 was run for the Xhosa and SAC individuals respectively. Since it has been shown that RFMix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maples et al., 2013</xref>) outperforms ADMIXTURE in determining global ancestry proportions (C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Uren et al., 2020</xref>), RFMix was also used to refine inferred global ancestry proportions. Global ancestral proportions were visualised using PONG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Behr et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Local ancestry inference</title>
<p>The merged dataset and the reference file (containing reference populations from <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were phased separately using SHAPEIT2. The local ancestry for each position in the genome was inferred using RFMix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maples et al., 2013</xref>). Default parameters were used, but the number of generations since admixture was set to 15 for the SAC individuals and 20 for the Xhosa individuals (as determined by previous studies) (Caitlin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Uren et al., 2016</xref>). RFMix was run with three expectation maximisation iterations and the --reanalyse-reference flag.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Batch effect screening and correction</title>
<p>Merging separate datasets generated at different timepoints and/or facilities, as we have done here, will undoubtedly introduce batch effects. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a common method used to visualise batch effects, where the first two principal components (PCs) are plotted with each sample coloured by batch, and a separation of colours is indicative of a batch effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nyamundanda et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is difficult to differentiate between separation caused by population structure and separation caused by batch effect using PCA alone. An alternative method to detect batch effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2022</xref>) involves coding case/control status by batch followed by running an association analysis testing each batch against all other batches. If any single dataset has more positive signals compared to the other datasets, then batch effects may be responsible for producing spurious results. Batch effects can be resolved by removing those SNPs which pass the genome-wide significance threshold from the merged dataset. We have adapted this batch effect correction method for application in a highly admixed cohort with complex population structure (Croock et al., 2024). Our modified method was used to remove 36 627 SNPs affected by batch effects from our merged dataset.</p>

<title>Local ancestry allelic adjusted association analysis</title>
<p>The LAAA association model was used to investigate if there are allelic, ancestry-specific or ancestry-specific allelic associations with TB susceptibility in our merged dataset. Global ancestral components inferred by RFMix, age and sex were included as covariates in the association tests. Variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt; 1% were removed to improve the stability of the association tests. Dosage files, which code the number of alleles of a specific ancestry at each locus across the genome, were compiled. Separate regression models for each ancestral contribution were fitted to investigate which ancestral contribution is associated with TB susceptibility. Details regarding the models have been described elsewhere (Swart, van Eeden, et al., 2022); but in summary, four regression models were tested to detect the source of the association signals observed:</p>
<sec id="s2e1">
<label>(1)</label><title>Null model or global ancestry (GA) model</title>
<p>The null model only includes global ancestry, sex and age covariates. This test investigates whether an additive allelic dose exerts an effect on the phenotype (without including local ancestry of the allele).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e2">
<label>(2)</label><title>Local ancestry (LA) model</title>
<p>This model is used in admixture mapping to identify ancestry-specific variants associated with a specific phenotype. The LA model evaluates the number of alleles of a specific ancestry at a locus and includes the corresponding marginal effect as a covariate in association analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e3">
<label>(3)</label><title>Ancestry plus allelic (APA) model</title>
<p>The APA model simultaneously performs model (1) and (2). This model tests whether an additive allelic dose exerts an effect of the phenotype whilst adjusting for local ancestry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e4">
<label>(4)</label><title>Local ancestry adjusted allelic (LAAA) model</title>
<p>The LAAA model is an extension of the APA model, which models the combination of the minor allele and ancestry of the minor allele at a specific locus and the effect this interaction has on the phenotype.</p>
<p>The R package <italic>STEAM</italic> (Significance Threshold Estimation for Admixture Mapping) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Grinde et al., 2019</xref>) was used to determine the genome-wide significance threshold given the global ancestral proportions of each individual and the number of generations since admixture (g = 15). <italic>STEAM</italic> permuted these factors 10 000 times to derive a threshold for significance. Results were visualised in RStudio. A genome-wide significance threshold of <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 2.5 x 10<sup>-6</sup> was deemed significant by <italic>STEAM</italic>.</p>

<title>Global and local ancestry inference</title>
<p>After close inspection of global ancestry proportions generated using ADMIXTURE, the K number of contributing ancestries (the lowest k-value determined through cross-validation) was K = 3 for the Xhosa individuals and K = 5 for the SAC individuals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This is consistent with previous global ancestry deconvolution results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chimusa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choudhury et al., 2021</xref>). It is evident that our cohort is a complex, highly admixed group with ancestral contributions from the indigenous KhoeSan (∼22 - 30%), Bantu-speaking African (∼30 - 72%), European (∼5 - 24%), Southeast Asian (∼11%) and East Asian (∼5%) population groups.</p>

<p>Local ancestry was estimated for all individuals. Admixture between geographically distinct populations creates complex ancestral and admixture-induced LD blocks, which can be visualised using local ancestry karyograms. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows karyograms for three individuals from the merged dataset. It is evident that, despite individuals being from the same population group, each possesses unique patterns of local ancestry arising from differing numbers and lengths of ancestral segments.</p>

<title>Local ancestry-allelic adjusted analysis</title>
<p>A total of 784 557 autosomal markers (with MAF &gt; 1%) and 1 544 unrelated individuals (952 TB cases and 592 healthy controls) were included in logistic regression models to assess whether any loci and/or ancestries were significantly associated with TB status (whilst adjusting for sex, age, and global ancestry proportions). LAAA models were successfully applied for all five contributing ancestries (KhoeSan, Bantu-speaking African, European, East Asian and Southeast Asian). Only one variant (<italic>rs74828248</italic>) was significantly associated with TB status (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 2.5 x 10<sup>-6</sup>) whilst utilising the LAAA model and whilst adjusting for Bantu-speaking African ancestry on chromosome 20 (<italic>p</italic>-value = 2.272 x 10<sup>-6</sup>, OR = 0.316, SE = 0.244) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). No genomic inflation was detected in the QQ-plot for this region (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). However, this variant is located in an intergenic region and the link to TB susceptibility is unclear (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Although no other variants passed the genome-wide significance threshold, multiple lead SNPs were identified. Notably, an appreciable peak was identified in the HLA-II region of chromosome 6 when using the LAAA model and adjusting for KhoeSan ancestry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The QQ-plot suggested minimal genomic inflation, which was verified by calculating the genomic inflation factor (λ = 1.05289) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). The lead variants identified using the LAAA model whilst adjusting for KhoeSan ancestry in this region on chromosome 6 are summarised in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The association peak encompasses the <italic>HLA-DPA1/B1</italic> (major histocompatibility complex, class II, DP alpha 1/beta 1) genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). It is noteworthy that without the LAAA model, this association peak would not have been observed for this cohort. This highlights the importance of utilising the LAAA model in future association studies when investigating disease susceptibility loci in admixed individuals, such as the SAC population.</p>

However, <italic>rs28383206</italic> is absent from our in-house whole-genome sequencing (WGS) datasets, which include Bantu-speaking African and KhoeSan individuals. This absence suggests that <italic>rs28383206</italic> might not have been imputed in our datasets using the AGR reference panel, potentially due to its low alternate allele frequency in southern African populations. Our merged dataset contained two variants located within 800 base pairs of <italic>rs28383206</italic>: <italic>rs482205</italic> (6:32576009) and <italic>rs482162</italic> (6:32576019).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The LAAA analysis of host genetic susceptibility to TB, involving 942 TB cases and 592 controls, identified one suggestive association peak adjusting for KhoeSan local ancestry. The association peak identified in this study encompasses the <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic> gene, a highly polymorphic locus, with over 2 000 documented allelic variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Robinson et al., 2020</xref>). This association is noteworthy given that <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic> alleles have been associated with TB resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dawkins et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ravikumar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Selvaraj et al., 2008</xref>). The direction of effect the lead variants in our study (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) similarly suggest a protective effect against developing active TB. However, variants in <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic> were not identified in the ITHGC meta-analysis.</p>
<p>Population stratification arising from the highly heterogeneous admixed cohorts might have masked this association signal in the African ancestry-specific association analysis. The association peak in the HLA-II region was only captured using the LAAA model whilst adjusting for KhoeSan local ancestry. This underscores the importance of incorporating global and local ancestry in association studies investigating complex multi-way admixed individuals, asthe genetic heterogeneity present in admixed individuals (produced as a result of admixture-induced and ancestral LD patterns) may cause association signals to be missed when using traditional association models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Duan et al., 2018</xref>; Swart, van Eeden, et al., 2022).</p>
<p>We did not replicate the significant association signal in <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> identified by the ITHGC. However, the ITHGC also did not replicate this association in their own African ancestry-specific analysis. The significant association, <italic>rs28383206</italic>, identified by the ITHGC appears to be tagging the <italic>HLA-DQA1</italic>*02:1 allele, which is associated with TB in Icelandic and Asian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sveinbjornsson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that this association signal is specific to non-African populations, but additional research is required to verify this hypothesis. Both our study and the ITHGC independently pinpointed variants associated with TB susceptibility in different genes within the HLA-II locus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The HLA-II region spans ∼0.8Mb on chromosome 6p21.32 and encompasses the <italic>HLA-DP, - DR</italic> and <italic>-DQ</italic> alpha and beta chain genes. The HLA-II complex is the human form of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) proteins on the surface of antigen presenting cells, such as monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages. The innate immune response against <italic>M.tb</italic> involves phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages. In the phagosome, mycobacterial antigens are processed for presentation on MHC-II on the surface of the antigen presenting cell. Previous studies have suggested that <italic>M.tb</italic> interferes with the MHC-II pathway to enhance intracellular persistence and delay activation of the adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Oliveira-Cortez et al., 2016</xref>). For example, <italic>M.tb</italic> can inhibit phagosome maturation and acidification, thereby limiting antigen processing and presentation on MHC-II molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chang et al., 2005</xref>). Given that MHC-II plays an essential role in the adaptive immune response to TB and numerous studies have identified HLA-II variants associated with TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chihab et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">de Sá et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Harishankar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schurz et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Selvaraj et al., 2008</xref>), additional research is required to elucidate the effects of HLA-II variation on TB risk status.</p>

</fig>
<p>This analysis has a few limitations. First, unlike the ITHGC manuscript, we did not validate our SNP peak in the HLA-II region through fine mapping. Although we initially considered performing HLA imputation and fine-mapping using the HIBAG R package, as described in the ITHGC article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hibag.s3.amazonaws.com/hlares_index.html#estimates">https://hibag.s3.amazonaws.com/hlares_index.html#estimates</ext-link>), the African HIBAG model was trained on genotype data from African American and HapMap YRI populations, which have minimal to no KhoeSan ancestry. Since our association peak likely originates from KhoeSan ancestral haplotype blocks, using an imputation reference panel that includes individuals with KhoeSan ancestry is essential to this analysis. We acknowledge that HLA typing could validate the importance of our lead SNPs in the HLA-II region and support the LAAA model, but this was not feasible due to the absence of a suitable reference panel that includes KhoeSan ancestry. Second, our analysis has a notable case-control imbalance (cases/controls = 1.610). While many studies discuss methods for addressing case-control imbalances with more controls than cases (which can inflate type 1 error rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Öztornaci et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>), few address the implications of a large case-to-control ratio like ours (952 cases to 592 controls). To assess the impact of this imbalance, we used the Michigan genetic association study (GAS) power calculator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Skol et al., 2006</xref>). Under an additive disease model with an estimated prevalence of 0.15, a disease allele frequency of 0.3, a genotype relative risk of 1.5, and a default significance level of 7 × 10⁻⁶, we achieved an expected power of approximately 75%. With a balanced sample size of 950 cases and 950 controls, power would exceed 90%, but it would drop significantly with a smaller balanced cohort of 590 cases and 590 controls. Given these results, we proceeded with our analysis to maximize statistical power despite the case-control imbalance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, application of the LAAA to a highly admixed SAC cohort revealed a suggestive association signal in the HLA-II region associated with protection against TB. Our study builds on the results of the ITHGC by demonstrating an alternative method to identify association signals in cohorts with complex genetic ancestry. This analysis shows the value of including individual global and local ancestry in genetic association analyses. Furthermore, we confirm HLA-II loci associations with TB susceptibility in an admixed South African population and hope that this publication will encourage greater appreciation for the role of the adaptive immune system in TB susceptibility and resistance.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study confirms the association between the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-II region and tuberculosis (TB) susceptibility in genetically admixed South African populations, specifically identifying a near-genome-wide significant association in the HLA-DPB1 gene, which originates from KhoeSan ancestry. The evidence supporting the association between the HLA-II region and TB susceptibility is <bold>solid</bold>, and the work will be of interest to those studying the genetic basis of tuberculosis susceptibility/infection resistance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to confirm the association between the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-II region and tuberculosis (TB) susceptibility within admixed African populations. Building upon previous findings from the International Tuberculosis Host Genetics Consortium (ITHGC), this study sought to address the limitations of small sample size and the inclusion of admixed samples by employing the Local Ancestry Allelic Adjusted (LAAA) model, as well as identify TB susceptibility loci in an admixed South African cohort.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strengths of this study include the use of multiple TB case-control datasets from diverse South African populations and ADMIXTURE for global ancestry inference.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness of this study include insufficient significant novel discoveries and reliance on cross-validation. The use of existing models did not add value to this study.</p>
<p>Appraisal:</p>
<p>
The authors achieved their aims. However, the results still needed to be further validated in the future.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>
The innovative use of the LAAA model and the comprehensive dataset in this study may make contributions to the field of genetic epidemiology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript is about using different analytical approaches to allow ancestry adjustments to GWAS analyses amongst admixed populations. This work is a follow-on from the recently published ITHGC multi-population GWAS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.84394">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.84394</ext-link>), with the focus on the admixed South African populations. Ancestry adjustment models detected a peak of SNPs in the class II HLA DPB1, distinct from the class II HLA DQA1 loci signficant in the ITHGC analysis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Excellent demonstration of GWAS analytical pipelines in highly admixed populations. Particularly the utility of ancestry adjustment to improve study power to detect novel associations. Further confirmation of the importance of the HLA class II locus in genetic susceptibility to TB.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Limited novelty compared to the group's previous existing publications and the body of work linking HLA class II alleles with TB susceptibility in South Africa or other African populations. This work includes only ~100 new cases and controls from what has already been published. High resolution HLA typing has detected significant signals in both the DQA1 and DPB1 regions identified by the larger ITHGC and in this GWAS analysis respectively (Chihab L et al. HLA. 2023 Feb; 101(2): 124-137).</p>
<p>
Despite the availability of strong methods for imputing HLA from GWAS data (Karnes J et Plos One 2017), the authors did not confirm with HLA typing the importance of their SNP peak in the class II region. This would have supported the importance of this ancestry adjustment versus prior ITHGC analysis.</p>
<p>
The populations consider active TB and healthy controls (from high-burden presumed exposed communities) and do not provide QFT or other data to identify latent TB infection.</p>
<p>Important methodological points for clarification and for readers to be aware of when reading this paper:</p>
<p>(1) One of the reasons cited for the lack of African ancestry-specific associations or suggestive peaks in the ITHGC study was the small African sample size. The current association test includes a larger African cohort and yields a near-genome-wide significant threshold in the HLA-DPB1 gene originating from the KhoeSan ancestry. Investigation is needed as to whether the increase in power is due to increased African samples and not necessarily the use of the LAAA model as stated on lines 295 and 296?</p>
<p>Authors response - The Manhattan plot in Figure 3 includes the results for all four models: the traditional GWAS model (GAO), the admixture mapping model (LAO), the ancestry plus allelic (APA) model and the LAAA model. In this figure, it is evident that only the LAAA model identified the association peak on chromosome 6, which lends support the argument that the increase in power is due to the use of the LAAA model and not solely due to the increase in sample size.</p>
<p>
Reviewer comment - This data supports the authors conclusions that increase power is related to the LAAA model application rather than simply increase sample size.</p>
<p>(2) In line 256, the number of SNPs included in the LAAA analysis was 784,557 autosomal markers; the number of SNPs after quality control of the imputed dataset was 7,510,051 SNPs (line 142). It is not clear how or why ~90% of the SNPs were removed. This needs clarification.</p>
<p>Authors response:</p>
<p>
In our manuscript (line 194), we mention that &quot;...variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt; 1% were removed to improve the stability of the association tests.&quot; A large proportion of imputed variants fell below this MAF threshold and were subsequently excluded from this analysis.</p>
<p>Reviewers additional comment: The authors should specify the number of SNPs in the dataset before imputation and indicate what proportion of the 784,557 remaining SNPs were imputed. Providing this information might help the reader better understand the rationale behind the imputation process.</p>
<p>(3) The authors have used the significance threshold estimated by the STEAM p-value &lt; 2.5x10-6 in the LAAA analysis. Grinde et al. (2019 implemented their significance threshold estimation approach tailored to admixture mapping (local ancestry (LA) model), where there is a reduction in testing burden. The authors should justify why this threshold would apply to the LAAA model (a joint genotype and ancestry approach).</p>
<p>Authors response: We describe in the methods (line 189 onwards) that the LAAA model is an extension of the APA model. Since the APA model itself simultaneously performs the null global ancestry only model and the local ancestry model (utilised in admixture mapping), we thus considered the use of a threshold tailored to admixture mapping appropriate for the LAAA model.</p>
<p>Reviewers additional comment: While the LAAA model is an extension of the APA model, the authors describe the LAAA test as 'models the combination of the minor allele and the ancestry of the minor allele at a specific locus, along with the effect of this interaction,' thus a joint allele and ancestry effects model. Grinde et al. (2019) proposed the significance threshold estimation approach, STEAM, specifically for the LA approach, which tests for ancestry effects alone and benefits from the reduced testing burden. However, it remains unclear why the authors found it appropriate to apply STEAM to the LAAA model, a joint test for both allele and ancestry effects, which does not benefit from the same reduction in testing burden.</p>
<p>(4) Batch effect screening and correction (line 174) is a quality control check. This section is discussed after global and local ancestry inferences in the methods. Was this QC step conducted after the inferencing? If so, the authors should justify how the removed SNPs due to the batch effect did not affect the global and local ancestry inferences or should order the methods section correctly to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Authors response: The batch effect correction method utilised a pseudo-case-control comparison which included global ancestry proportions. Thus, batch effect correction was conducted after ancestry inference. We excluded 36 627 SNPs that were believed to have been affected by the batch effect. We have amended line 186 to include the exact number of SNPs excluded due to batch effect.</p>
<p>
The ancestry inference by RFMix utilised the entire merged dataset of 7 510 051 SNPs. Thus, the SNPs removed due to the batch effect make up a very small proportion of the SNPs used to conduct global and local ancestry inferences (less than 0.5%). As a result, we do not believe that the removed SNPs would have significantly affected the global and local ancestry inferences. However, we did conduct global ancestry inference with RFMix on each separate dataset as a sanity check. In the Author response tables 1 and 2, we show the average global ancestry proportions inferred for each separate dataset, the average global ancestry proportions across all datasets and the average global ancestry proportions inferred using the merged dataset. The SAC and Xhosa cohorts are shown in two separate tables due to the different number of contributing ancestral populations to each cohort. The differences between the combined average global ancestry proportions across the separate cohorts does not differ significantly to the global ancestry proportions inferred using the merged dataset.</p>
<p>This is an excellent response and should remain accessible to readers to clarify this issue.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to confirm the association between the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-II region and tuberculosis (TB) susceptibility within admixed African populations. Building upon previous findings from the International Tuberculosis Host Genetics Consortium (ITHGC), this study sought to address the limitations of small sample size and the inclusion of admixed samples by employing the Local Ancestry Allelic Adjusted (LAAA) model, as well as identify TB susceptibility loci in an admixed South African cohort.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strengths of this study include the use of six TB case-control datasets collected over 30 years from diverse South African populations and ADMIXTURE for global ancestry inference. The former represents comprehensive dataset used in this study and the later ensures accurate determination of ancestral contributions. In addition, the identified association in the <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic> gene shows near-genomewide significance, enhancing the credibility of the findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness of this study includes insufficient significant discoveries and reliance on crossvalidation. This study only identified one variant significantly associated with TB status, located in an intergenic region with an unclear link to TB susceptibility. Despite identifying multiple lead SNPs, no other variants reached the genome-wide significance threshold, limiting the overall impact of the findings. The absence of an independent validation cohort, with the study relying solely on crossvalidation, is also a major limitation. This approach restricts the ability to independently confirm the findings and evaluate their robustness across different population samples.</p>
<p>Appraisal:</p>
<p>The authors successfully achieved their aims of confirming the association between the <italic>HLA-II</italic> region and TB susceptibility in admixed African populations. However, the limited number of significant discoveries, reliance on cross-validation, and insufficient discussion of model performance and SNP significance weaken the overall strength of the findings. Despite these limitations, the results support the conclusion that considering local ancestry is crucial in genetic studies of admixed populations.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>The innovative use of the LAAA model and the comprehensive dataset in this study make substantial contributions to the field of genetic epidemiology.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript is about using different analytical approaches to allow ancestry adjustments to GWAS analyses amongst admixed populations. This work is a follow-on from the recently published ITHGC multi-population GWAS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.84394">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.84394</ext-link>), with a focus on the admixed South African populations. Ancestry adjustment models detected a peak of SNPs in the class II HLA DPB1, distinct from the class II HLA DQA1 loci significant in the ITHGC analysis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Excellent demonstration of GWAS analytical pipelines in highly admixed populations. Further confirmation of the importance of the HLA class II locus in genetic susceptibility to TB.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Limited novelty compared to the group's previous existing publications and the body of work linking HLA class II alleles with TB susceptibility in South Africa or other African populations.

High-resolution HLA typing has detected significant signals in both the DQA1 and DPB1 regions identified by the larger ITHGC and in this GWAS analysis respectively (Chihab L et al.

This would have supported the importance of this ancestry adjustment versus prior ITHGC analysis.</p>
<p>The populations consider active TB and healthy controls (from high-burden presumed exposed communities) and do not provide QFT or other data to identify latent TB infection.</p>

<p>Thank you for your recommendation. In our manuscript (line 194), we mention that “…variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt; 1% were removed to improve the stability of the association tests.” A large proportion of imputed variants fell below this MAF threshold, and were subsequently excluded from this analysis. Below, we show the number of imputed variants across MAF bins for one of our datasets [RSA(A)] to substantiate this claim:</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggestions for Improved or Additional Experiments, Data, or Analyses:</p>
<p>(1) It might be beneficial to consider splitting the data into separate discovery and validation cohorts rather than relying solely on cross-validation. This approach could provide a stronger basis for independently confirming the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. However, we are hesitant to divide our already modest dataset (n=1544) into separate discovery and validation cohorts, as this would reduce the statistical power to detect significant associations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Clearly stating the process of cross-validation in the methods section and reporting relevant validation statistics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC), would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's performance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your recommendation. We would like to highlight this article, “<italic>GWAS in the southern African context</italic>” (1), which evaluated the performance of the LAAA model compared to other models in three- and five-way admixed populations. Given the thorough evaluation of the model’s performance in that study, we did not find it necessary to reassess its performance in this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Analysing racial cohorts separately to see if you can replicate previous results and find significant markers in combined non-African populations that are not evident in African-only samples might be useful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We would like to respectfully note that race is a social construct, and its use as a proxy for genetic ancestry can be problematic (2). In our study, we rather rely on genetic ancestry inferred using ancestry inference software to provide a more accurate representation of our cohort's genetic diversity. Additionally, our cohort consists mostly of a highly admixed population group, with some individuals exhibiting ancestral contributions from up to five different global populations. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize our samples into distinct “Africanonly” or “non-African” groups.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It might be worthwhile to consider using polygenic risk scores (PRS) to combine multiple genetic influences. This approach could help in identifying cumulative genetic effects that are not apparent when examining individual SNPs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your recommendation. While constructing a polygenic risk score (PRS) is beyond the scope of the current study, but an ongoing interest in our group, we recognize its potential value and will consider incorporating this approach in future research endeavours or a separate publication. A recent publication by Majara et al showed that that PRS accuracy is low for all traits and varies across ancestrally and ethnically diverse South African groups (3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Recommendations for Improving the Writing and Presentation:</p>
<p>Including a more thorough discussion of the methodological limitations, such as the challenges of studying admixed populations and the potential limitations of the LAAA model, would provide a more balanced perspective.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. To provide a more balanced perspective, we included the limitations of our study in the discussion, from line 429 to like 451.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor Corrections to the Text and Figures:</p>
<p>Including all relevant statistics would improve clarity. For example, providing confidence intervals for the odds ratios and discussing any observed trends or outliers would be beneficial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your recommendation. We have added 95% confidence intervals to all odds ratios reported in Table 3. However, beyond the association peak identified in the HL-II region associated with the phenotype, we do not observe any other trends or outliers in or LAAA analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Points for improvement:</p>
<p>(1) Related to the different datasets and inclusions in previous publications, it would also be good to better understand the different numbers of cases and controls included across the previous and current analyses, or discussion thereof. For instance, the RSA(M) dataset includes 555/440 cases/controls for this analysis and only 410/405 cases/controls in the ITHGC analysis. Other discrepancies are noted across the other published datasets compared to those included in this analysis, and these always need to be detailed in a supplement or similar to better understand if this could have introduced bias or was in fact correct based on the additional ancestry-related restriction applied.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. Table 1 of our manuscript lists number of individuals in the RSA(M) dataset, including related individuals. As described in line 131, related individuals were subsequently excluded during quality control: “Individual datasets were screened for relatedness using KING software (Manichaikul et al., 2010) and individuals up to second degree relatedness were removed.” The ITHGC only reported the number of unrelated individuals included their analyses, which would account for the discrepancies in the reported number of cases and controls.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The imbalance between cases and controls in this analysis is quite striking, and it is unusual to have the imbalance favour cases over controls. This contrasts with the ITHGC, where there are substantially more controls. There is no comment on how this could potentially impact this analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We have included a note on our case-control imbalance in the discussion:</p>
<p>“While many studies discuss methods for addressing case-control imbalances with more controls than cases (which can inflate type 1 error rates (Zhou et al. 2018; Dai et al. 2021; Öztornaci et al. 2023), few address the implications of a large case-to-control ratio like ours (952 cases to 592 controls). To assess the impact of this imbalance, we used the Michigan genetic association study (GAS) power calculator (Skol et al. 2006). Under an additive disease model with an estimated prevalence of 0.15, a disease allele frequency of 0.3, a genotype relative risk of 1.5, and a default significance level of 7 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, we achieved an expected power of approximately 75%. With a balanced sample size of 950 cases and 950 controls, power would exceed 90%, but it would drop significantly with a smaller balanced cohort of 590 cases and 590 controls. Given these results, we proceeded with our analysis to maximize statistical power despite the case-control imbalance.”</p>

<p>“Monomorphic sites were removed. Individuals were screened for deviations in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) for each SNP and sites deviating from the HWE threshold of 10-5 were removed.”</p>

<p>(5) It would be good in the supplement to see if there is a SNP peak in chromosome 20 with a hit that reached significance in the Bantu-speaking African ancestry.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your recommendation. We have included a regional plot for the lead variant identified on chromosome 20 originating from Bantu-speaking African ancestry in the supplementary material (Supplementary Figure 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) It would be good to mention the p-values of rs28383206 from the ITHGC paper in this cohort for KhoeSan and Bantu-speaking African ancestries.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have included the following paragraph from line 352:</p>
<p>“The lead variant identified in the ITHGC meta-analysis, <italic>rs28383206</italic>, was not present in our genotype or imputed datasets. The ITHGC imputed genotypes using the 1000 Genomes (1000G) reference panel (4). Variant <italic>rs28383206</italic> has an alternate allele frequency of 11.26% in the African population subgroup within the 1000G dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs28383206">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs28383206</ext-link>). However, <italic>rs28383206</italic> is absent from our in-house whole-genome sequencing (WGS) datasets, which include Bantu-speaking African and KhoeSan individuals. This absence suggests that <italic>rs28383206</italic> might not have been imputed in our datasets using the AGR reference panel, potentially due to its low alternate allele frequency in southern African populations. Our merged dataset contained two variants located within 800 base pairs of r_s28383206: rs482205_ (6:32576009) and <italic>rs482162</italic> (6:32576019). However, these variants were not significantly associated with TB status in our cohort (Supplementary Table 1).” Supplementary Table 1 can be found in the supplementary material:</p>

<p>(7) It would improve the readability of the ancestry proportions listed on lines 236 and 237 if these population groups were linked with the corresponding specific population used in Figure 1, as has been done in Table 2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have amended Figure 1 to include the corresponding population labels mentioned in Table 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In line 209, it is not clear why the number of alleles of a specific ancestry at a locus is referred to as a covariate in admixture mapping when the corresponding marginal effect is the parameter of interest.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We have amended the description as follows:</p>
<p>“(2) Local ancestry (LA) model:</p>
<p>This model is used in admixture mapping to identify ancestry-specific variants associated with a specific phenotype. The LA model evaluates the number of alleles of a specific ancestry at a locus and includes the corresponding marginal effect as a covariate in association analyses.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Table 3 would benefit from a column on whether the SNP was genotyped or imputed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have included a column indicating whether the SNP was genotyped or imputed, as well as an additional column with the INFO score for imputed genotypes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) The authors should remove the print and download icons in Figure 1 on lines 240 and 241.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have amended the figure as requested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) In the quality control, the authors use a more relaxed threshold for missingness in individuals (90%) and genotypes (5%) and have strayed away from the conventional 97%-98%. An explanation of the choice of these thresholds will be helpful to the reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We aimed to use similar genotype and individual missingness thresholds outline by the ITHGC meta-analysis (which utilised a threshold of 10% for both genotype and individual missingness) and the previous LAAA analysis paper performed by Swart et al. in 2021. We have amended line 116 for more clarity:</p>
<p>“Individuals with genotype call rates less than 90% and SNPs with more than 5% missingness were removed as described previously (5).”</p>
