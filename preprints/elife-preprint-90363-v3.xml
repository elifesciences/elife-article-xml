<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Caesarean section scar diverticulum (CSD) is a significant cause of infertility among women who have previously had a Caesarean section, primarily due to persistent inflammatory exudation associated with this condition. Even though abnormal bacterial composition is identified as a critical factor leading to this chronic inflammation, clinical data suggests that a long-term cure is often unattainable with antibiotic treatment alone. In our study, we employed metagenomic analysis and mass spectrometry techniques to investigate the fungal composition in CSD and its interaction with bacteria. We discovered that local fungal abnormalities in CSD can disrupt the stability of the bacterial population and the entire microbial community by altering bacterial abundance via specific metabolites. For instance, <italic>Lachnellula suecica</italic> reduces the abundance of several <italic>Lactobacillus spp</italic>., such as <italic>Lactobacillus jensenii</italic>, by diminishing the production of metabolites like <italic>Goyaglycoside A</italic> and <italic>Janthitrem E</italic>. Concurrently, <italic>Clavispora lusitaniae</italic> and <italic>Ophiocordyceps australis</italic> can synergistically impact the abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus spp</italic>. by modulating metabolite abundance. Our findings underscore that abnormal fungal composition and activity are key drivers of local bacterial dysbiosis in CSD.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We believe that the methodologies and tools currently available for contaminant identification and removal, while highly effective for their intended purpose, reinforce our decision to focus on high-abundance species. This focus minimizes the potential impact of rare contaminants on our study's conclusions. In light of this, our study's methodology remains robust and well-suited for achieving our research objectives.
In our revised manuscript, we will include a discussion of these points (highlight in the manuscript supplement in this mail), further clarifying our approach and the rationale behind our methodological choices. We hope that this additional information will address the concerns raised and provide a clearer understanding of the context and reliability of our findings.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Caesarean section (CS) is a prevalent surgery worldwide, and its rate has increased in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Although CS can significantly reduce dystocia and stillbirths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], Caesarean section scar diverticulum (CSD) affect about 19.4-88% of women receiving this operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. CSD emerges from poor healing of the local uterine incision, forming a depression or cavity that connects with the uterine cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Recently, CSD has drawn widespread attention because of its potential damage to subsequent fertility. For example, Gurol and colleagues found that the possibility of subsequent pregnancy decreases by an average of 10% after CS relative to a previous vaginal delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. A niche can reduce the chances of embryo implantation and increase the likelihood of spontaneous miscarriages if the implantation occurs close to or in the CSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Our previous studies have shown that the persistent effusion of CSD is a key cause of failed embryo implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The unique microbial community composition in the female reproductive tract is essential in maintaining female reproductive health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the abnormal alterations in the local microbiota of Cesarean scar defects (CSD) cause continuous leakage through local inflammation and immune imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Further investigations of ours revealed the underlying mechanism demonstrating that abnormal bacteria in CSD deplete protective fatty acids and generate N-(3-hydroxy-eicosanoyl)-homoserine lactone, thus leading to promoting apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and endometrial epithelial cells, ultimately impairing women’s reproductive capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Nonetheless, the causative factors behind bacterial dysbiosis in complex microbial communities remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Fungi and bacteria, as integral components of the human microbiome, establish complex interactions with each other and the host. The collection of genomes and genes carried by fungal species coexisting within a specific environmental or biological niche is commonly called as the “mycobiome” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. However, in CSD, the mycobiome remains poorly understood, particularly in comparison to the microbiome. The interaction between microbial communities in the reproductive tract, particularly bacteria and fungi, is critical in maintaining female reproductive health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Therefore, this study aims to examine the composition and function of fungi in CSD, as well as their interactions with bacteria, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of microbial communities in CSD. This study also aims to identify potential therapeutic approaches to enhance fertility by building on current research.</p>

<title>Recruitment of participants and metagenomic sequencing</title>
<p>Forty-eight participants were included in this study, including 24 in the CSD group and 24 in the CON group. The clinical characteristics of the participants are shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. To better characterize the composition of the cervical microbiota, we performed ultra-high-depth metagenomic sequencing. The effective data volume of each sample ranged from 14.25 to 18.63 G, the N50 statistical distribution of contigs ranged from 230 to 245 bp, and the number of ORFs in the gene catalogue (non-redundant gene set) constructed after redundancy removal was 281,107.</p>

<p>Alpha diversity based on Pielou index (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1 A</xref>) and Shannon index (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1 B</xref>) calculations showed that species richness and evenness in the CSD group were significantly higher than those in the control group (T-test).

<p>The composition of CST community types in the CSD group and CON group differed. The proportion of CST III decreased in the CSD group, while the more unstable CST IV-B and CST IV-C increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1 D</xref>). The CST community types in the CON group were dominated by <italic>Lactobacillus spp</italic>. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1 D</xref>). CST subtype analysis revealed more detailed community types. In CST I (dominated by <italic>L. crispatus</italic>) and CST III (dominated by <italic>L. iners</italic>), the CSD group was mainly distributed in the B subtypes with a lower abundance of <italic>L. crispatus</italic> and <italic>L. iners</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1 E</xref>). The stacked bar chart of species composition shows the species composition characteristics of each sample (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1 F</xref>). One hundred and sixty-two differential species were identified between the two groups.

<title>The co-occurrence network among microbial community</title>
<p>We constructed co-occurrence networks for fungal species in the CSD and CON groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3 A</xref>). The network in the CSD group had fewer connections and weaker random robustness than the CON group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3 B</xref>), indicating greater fragility of the CSD fungal co-occurrence network. Subsequently, a cross-domain network between bacteria and fungi was constructed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3 C</xref>). The connection between bacteria and fungi in the CSD group was reduced compared with that in the CON group. At the same time, the CSD group had weaker random robustness than the CON group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3 D</xref>). We selected species with a sample coverage rate greater than or equal to 60% for Spearman correlation analysis and visualized the data using heatmaps (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3 E</xref>) and networks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3 F</xref>).

<p>Functional gene analysis indicates significant differences in the functional gene composition of microbial communities between the CSD and CON groups (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1 A</xref>). The CSD group has two significantly higher KEGG modules than the CON group, including M00142 (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase, mitochondrion) and M00151 (cytochrome bc1 complex respiratory unit) (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1 B</xref>). The CSD group has significantly increased activity in the inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels and platelet activation, while the activity of the galactose metabolic process has decreased (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1 C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Caesarean section scar diverticulum (CSD) significantly affects female fertility, posing a challenge to women who wish to conceive. Our research team conducted a preliminary investigation on bacteria-host interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Current findings suggest that fungi play crucial roles in maintaining bacterial community and microbiome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. This study explores the intricate fungal-bacterial interactions within the microbiome of CSD, building on our team’s previous research findings.</p>
<p>We achieved more precise bacterial community compositions by implementing higher-resolution metagenomics than our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. <italic>Lactobacillus jensenii</italic> of the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genus exhibited the greatest discrepancy between the two groups. This species has been linked to integral aspects of women’s reproductive health. It has been demonstrated that a reduction in <italic>L. jensenii</italic> abundance has a close correlation with early-stage embryo arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, research suggests that <italic>L. jensenii</italic> may hold potential in facilitating vertical transmission from mother to infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Fungi and bacteria, as integral components of the human microbiome, establish complex interactions with each other and the host. The characteristics of fungal communities in CSD an CON group are similar, but there are differences in species composition. <italic>Clabispora lusitaniae</italic> is the species with the largest difference between the two groups. In addition, the co-occurrence network of fungal communities and the stability of the bacterial-fungal cross-domain network in the CSD group are poorer than those in the CON group, indicating that the cervical microbiota stability is disrupted in CSD, resulting in local microbial-immune imbalance. A previous study confirmed that persistent exudation in CSD is a crucial factor affecting embryo implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Several studies have shown that microbial dysbiosis can affect local immune balance and cause inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Fungi play an important role in maintaining the stability of bacteria and the entire microbiome. Studies have shown that adding specific fungi can promote the growth of certain bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], while fungi also play an important role in improving the adaptability of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. To further understand how abnormal fungal community status in CSD affects bacteria, leading to the disruption of local stability, we used LC/MS technique for metabolite detection. The metabolite analysis results showed differences in the metabolite spectra between the CSD and CON groups, and the regulatory mode of several different fungal species on metabolites was mainly negative regulation. By integrating fungal, bacterial, and metabolite information, we found that <italic>Lachnellula suecica</italic> played an important role in regulating the abundance of several <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species. <italic>Lachnellula suecica</italic> reduces the abundance of several <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species, including <italic>Lactobacillus jensenii</italic>, by decreasing the metabolites Goyaglycoside A and Janthitrem E. Meanwhile, <italic>Clavispora lusitaniae</italic> and <italic>Ophiocordyceps australis</italic> can also synergistically affect the abundance of Lactobacillus by influencing metabolite abundance.</p>
<p>So far, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of bacterial and fungal communities and changes in environmental metabolites in Caesarean section scar diverticulum (CSD). While our study provides significant insights, it is important to note that our methodology did not include the use of negative controls. This is a notable limitation, as negative controls are critical in distinguishing true microbial signals from potential contamination, particularly for rare species. The absence of negative controls could potentially affect the discrimination and identification of such rare species within our samples. Consequently, while our results provide valuable information on the prevalent microbial interactions within CSD, they should be interpreted with caution, especially when considering the implications for clinical treatment plans.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our analysis did not extend to examining the antibiotic sensitivity of the key fungi and bacteria identified, which limits the direct application of our results to clinical treatments. Future studies should consider including negative controls and antibiotic sensitivity analysis to validate our findings and extend the implications for clinical practice.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the study’s results highlight the significant role of fungal composition and activity in driving bacterial dysbiosis in CSD. This insight is crucial for informing clinical treatment strategies and suggests that addressing fungal populations could be an important aspect of managing CSD. Future research is needed to further elucidate the complex interactions within the CSD microbiome and to develop more comprehensive treatment approaches that address both bacterial and fungal components.</p>

<title>Participant recruitment and sample collection</title>
<p>The subjects were recruited at the Reproductive Medical Center of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were previously described in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. All participants were fully informed, volunteered to participate in this study, and signed informed consent forms. All study processes were reviewed and approved by the Sixth Affiliated Hospital Ethics Committee of Sun Yat-Sen University (IRB no. 2019ZSLYEC-005S).</p>
<p>The sample collection procedure is as described above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. In short, after cleaning the external genitalia and vagina, a sterile disposable swab is inserted into the cervical canal, and the swab is rotated five times to collect the sample fully. The sample is rapidly transferred to liquid nitrogen for quenching and then stored at -80°C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>DNA extraction and metagenomic sequencing</title>
<p>According to the manufacturer’s instructions, the total DNA was isolated from the sample using QIAamp® Fast DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA concentration and integrity were evaluated by NanoDrop2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA was fragmented with S220 Focused-ultrasonicators (Covaris, USA) and purified with Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter Co., USA). Then, the library was constructed using the TruSeq Nano DNA LT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequencing was performed using Illumina NovaSeq 6000.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Raw Data Preprocessing</title>
<p>Parallel computing in research is implemented with GNU Parallel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>
<p>The sequencing raw data was stored in FASTQ files. After trimming and filtering with Trimmomatic (v0.36) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], the clean paired-end reads were aligned to the host genome (hg38) with bowtie2 (Presets: --very-sensitive-local) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], and the matched reads were discarded. The clean reads were assembled into contigs using MEGAHIT software (--k-list 21,33,55,77) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] with a filtering threshold of 500 bp. The ORFs were predicted using Prodigal software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] and were translated into amino acid sequences. CD-HIT software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] was used to remove redundancy from the ORF predictions of each sample and mixed assembly with default parameyers, and to obtain non-redundant initial Unigenes. The clustering was performed with default parameters of 95% identity and 90% coverage, and the longest sequence was selected as the representative sequence. Bowtie2 software was used to align the clean reads of each sample to the non-redundant gene set (95% identity), and the abundance information of genes in each corresponding sample was calculated from the number of reads and the length of the genes.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Taxa and functional annotation</title>
<p>The representative sequences of the redundant gene set were aligned with NCBI’s NR database using DIAMOND software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], and annotations with e &lt;1e-5 were selected to obtain proteins with the highest sequence similarity, thereby obtaining functional annotations and species annotations. Species present in only &lt;10% of samples were excluded. The Valencia software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] was used to perform community state type (CST) assignment for each sample. The abundance of species is calculated using the sum of the gene abundance corresponding to the species. LEfSe (Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] was used to screen differentially abundant species by using MicrobiotaProcess R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. The first comparison uses the Kluskal-Wallis test, the second comparison uses the Wilcoxon test, and finally LDA is used to determine the difference, and the p value is corrected using fdr. The calculation and visualization of species diversity and abundance are executed by the EasyMicroPlot R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] and EasyAmplicon pipline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Annotations were performed using the KO, COG, and CAZy databases to explore changes in enzyme family related to the microbiome. Differential functional analysis was conducted using the STAMP software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Construction of co-occurrence network</title>
<p>In network construction, we used more stringent species filtering criteria and only included species detected in 50% of samples in the analysis. The construction and random robustness comparison of fungal and bacterial-fungal co-occurrence networks were executed by the ggClusterNet R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Spearman correlation analysis was used to calculate correlations, the cutoff value of the correlation coefficient was set to 0.6, and p values were corrected using FDR. The stability analysis of the network is implemented by the Robustness.Random.removal function of the ggClusterNet R package with the default parameters.</p>

<title>Metabolite detection using liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS)</title>
<p>A separation buffer (methanol/acetonitrile/water [2:2:1]) was used to extract metabolites from cervical swabs. Ten ul was taken from each sample and mixed to form a quality control (QC) sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], which was used to evaluate stability during the experiment. The metabolite signals in each sample were detected using liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) (ACQUITY UPLC I-Class plus, Waters). Progenesis QI v2.3 software was used for qualitative analysis of metabolites, with parameters of 5ppm precursor tolerance, 10 ppm product tolerance, and 5% product ion threshold (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK). All output data were normalized using internal standards, and the results were displayed as peak values (test sample peak area/internal standard sample peak area). Compound identification was performed using human metabolome database (HMDB), Lipidmaps (V2.3), Metlin, EMDB, PMDB, and a self-built database based on mass-to-charge ratio (M/z), secondary fragmentation, and isotope distribution.</p>
<p>The screening of differential metabolites was performed using the OPLS-DA (orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis) method, with a VIP value&gt;1 for the first principal component and a P value&lt;0.05 for T-test as the threshold. MetPA was used for differential metabolic pathway analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. We used Spearman correlation analysis to evaluate the correlation between the microbial community and metabolites. The network was visualized using Cytoscape software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>].</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Shotgun data have been analysed to obtain fungal and bacterial organisms abundance. Through their metabolic functions and through co-occurrence networks, a functional relationship between the two types of organisms can be inferred. By means of metabolomics, function-related metabolites are studied in order to deepen the fungus-bacteria synergy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Data obtained in bacteria correlate with data from other authors.</p>
<p>
The study of metabolic &quot;interactions&quot; between fungi and bacteria is quite new.</p>
<p>
The inclusion of metabolomics data to support the results is a great contribution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>All my concerns have been clarified</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for your patience and guidance through this revision process. I would like to add an important aspect to our previous discussion regarding the identification and impact of potential contaminants in our study.</p>
<p>In recent years, advanced tools such as SCRuB (recently published in Nature Biotechnology, DOI:10.1038/s41587-023-01696-w) and the widely-used tool decontam have been developed to address the issue of contaminants in metagenomic studies. These tools primarily operate based on sequence similarity, identifying potential contaminants by marking and removing those found in only a minority of samples or those that display patterns indicative of laboratory contamination.</p>
<p>As the reviewer rightly pointed out, contaminants are often rare species that appear in very few samples. Our study, focusing on high-abundance species in the vaginal microbiome, is less susceptible to the influences of such rare contaminants. This approach aligns with the methodology employed by leading research groups in the field, such as Professor Jacques Ravel's lab. Their decision not to use blank controls in several of their studies on the female reproductive tract microbiome likely stems from a similar understanding — that the impact of rare contaminants is minimal on the study's conclusions, especially when high-abundance species are the main focus.</p>
<p>We believe that the methodologies and tools currently available for contaminant identification and removal, while highly effective for their intended purpose, reinforce our decision to focus on high-abundance species. This focus minimizes the potential impact of rare contaminants on our study's conclusions. In light of this, our study's methodology remains robust and well-suited for achieving our research objectives.</p>
<p>In our revised manuscript, we will include a discussion of these points, further clarifying our approach and the rationale behind our methodological choices. We hope that this additional information will address the concerns raised and provide a clearer understanding of the context and reliability of our findings.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering these additional points. We look forward to your feedback on our revised manuscript.</p>
