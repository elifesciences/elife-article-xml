<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Epigenetic clocks that quantify rates of aging from DNA methylation patterns across the genome have emerged as a potential biomarker for risk of age-related diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and environmental and social stressors. However, methylation clocks have not been validated in genetically diverse cohorts. Here we evaluate a set of methylation clocks in 621 AD patients and matched controls from African American, Hispanic, and white co-horts. The clocks are less accurate at predicting age in genetically admixed individuals, especially those with substantial African ancestry, than in the white cohort. The clocks also do not consistently identify age acceleration in admixed AD cases compared to controls. Methylation QTL (meQTL) commonly influence CpGs in clocks, and these meQTL have significantly higher frequencies in African genetic ancestries. Our results demonstrate that methylation clocks often fail to predict age and AD risk beyond their training populations and suggest avenues for improving their portability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biological aging is the progressive accumulation of cellular damage leading to degeneration and organismal death (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Aunan et al., 2016</xref>). DNA methylation patterns at CpG sites across the genome correlate strongly with the aging process, an effect that has been quantified using statistical models called “methylation clocks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jones, Goodman, and Kobor, 2015</xref>). The first-generation of methylation clocks were trained to predict chronological age from methylation levels at selected CpGs from across the genome (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). A second-generation of clocks were trained to use methylation levels to predict mortality risk as proxied by a combination of biomarkers of frailty and physiological decline (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Morgan E. Levine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, a third-generation of clocks have been trained to predict the rate of aging based cohorts with longitudinal data on biomarkers of frailty (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Belsky et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Greater predicted DNA methylation age compared to an individual’s chronological age, known as epigenetic age acceleration, has been associated with an increased risk of many age-related diseases, including coronary heart disease, white matter hyperintensities, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Hodgson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Horvath, Gurven, et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Horvath and Ritz, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Morgan E Levine et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Raina et al., 2017</xref>). As such, methylation clocks show potential as predictive biomarkers of the aging process and age-related health outcomes, and may capture relevant biological signals associated with aging. The clocks are also increasingly being used in social epidemiology research to quantify associations of epigenetic aging with exposure to adverse social and environmental factors that often differ across groups (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aiello et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Chiu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Krieger et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Non, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>While methylation is shaped by the environment of an individual, it is also strongly influenced by genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kader and Ghai, 2017</xref>). Millions of methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs)—genetic variants that associate with the methylation level of a CpG site across individuals—have been identified (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). MeQTL influence methylation levels via many mechanisms, including disruption of CpGs and effects on transcription factor binding, gene expression, and other gene regulatory processes (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Banovich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Oliva et al., 2023</xref>). Methylation patterns also vary between human groups, and approximately 75% of variance in methylation between human groups associates with genetic ancestry (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Galanter et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that meQTLs often vary in frequency in different genetic ancestries.</p>
<p>Despite these factors that lead to differential methylation levels in different genetic ancestries, methylation clocks have been developed and evaluated primarily individuals of European genetic ancestry due to biases in available genomic data. We hypothesized that lack of genetic diversity in the training data of methylation clocks could limit their generalizability across global and admixed populations. Similar factors have posed challenges for the application of polygenic risk scores (PRS) across human groups; PRS models often rapidly decrease in accuracy when applied to individuals not represented in the training set (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Novembre et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Privé et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>To quantify whether current methylation clocks are generalizable across global populations, we analyzed data from MAGENTA, a diverse AD study which has generated blood methylation and genotyping data for 621 individuals from the Americas, including genetically admixed individuals from African American, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Peruvian cohorts. We evaluate the accuracy of first-, second-, and third-generation methylation clocks at predicting age in these individuals, and evaluate whether age acceleration metrics from these clocks associate with AD risk, as they do in individuals of European ancestry. We also investigate the impact of genetic diversity on clock CpGs by intersecting clock CpG sites with variants from different human groups from gnomAD, and by comparing the frequencies of meQTL that influence clock CpG sites from three sets of independent meQTLs across different genetic ancestries. Our results highlight obstacles to the application of methylation clocks as biomarkers for precision medicine and epidemiology, but they also identify promising avenues for considering genetic diversity in the development, application, and interpretation of methylation clocks.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Our analyses are based on genotyping and blood DNA methylation data collected by the MA-GENTA study from 621 individuals from the Americas with AD and non-demented controls. The MAGENTA study is focused on late-onset Alzheimer’s and thus the average age of participants is 76 years old. Reflecting AD prevalence, the study is 68% female. The individuals come from five cohorts, collected from the United States (white, African American, Cuban), Peru, and Puerto Rico (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). As described in detail in the Methods, to facilitate comparisons relevant to understand global differences in our study, we opted to use a combination of geographic and race-based identifiers that are likely to best reflect underlying differences in genetic ancestry and admixture components.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>We apply a range of first-, second-, and third-generation methylation-based epigenetic aging clocks to these individuals. We then evaluate their accuracy in predicting chronological age, quantify whether they identify accelerated aging in individuals with AD, and explore genetic factors that may influence clock performance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Methylation clock accuracy is lower in cohorts with substantial African ancestry</title>
<p>To test whether current methylation clocks are able to predict age accurately in diverse, genetically admixed groups, we evaluated age predictions for the control individuals in the MAGENTA study. We first analyzed the widely used Horvath clock, which was trained on data from several tissues and cell types to accurately predict age across the lifespan using methylation levels at 353 CpG sites.</p>
<p>Age predicted from DNA methylation (DNAm age) using the Horvath clock was strongly correlated with chronological age (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.72) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). While this correlation is lower than reported in the original study (<italic>&gt;</italic>0.9), it is consistent with previous studies of older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Marioni et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the white cohort, the correlation between DNAm age and chronological age were significantly lower for Puerto Ricans (<italic>r</italic> = 0.45, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007) and African Americans (<italic>r</italic> = 0.51, <italic>p</italic> = 0.016) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The correlations for Cubans (<italic>r</italic> = 0.68, <italic>p</italic> = 0.385) and Peruvians (<italic>r</italic> = 0.72, <italic>p</italic> = 0.52) were similar in magnitude to the white cohort.</p>
<p>We noticed that the two cohorts with low correlation come from regions where individuals often have substantial amounts of African ancestry. To explore how admixture levels associated with the accuracy of the Horvath clock in predicting age, we estimated the global proportions of African (YRI), European (CEU), and American (PEL) ancestries in each individual from the MAGENTA cohort using reference groups from the 1000 Genomes Project (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Methylation clock accuracy was lowest for the cohorts with substantial African ancestry: African Americans (median 85% African) and Puerto Ricans (median 15% African). In contrast, the clocks performed similarly to the white cohort in groups lacking substantial African ancestry: Cubans (6% African) and Peruvians (2% African).</p>

<label>2.2</label>
<title>Accuracy of age prediction on admixed individuals varies across methylation clocks</title>
<p>To investigate the performance of other methylation clocks at predicting chronological age in admixed individuals, we selected several additional publicly available open-source clocks. We considered two other “first-generation” clocks that were trained to predict chronological age: the Hannum clock (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>) and a model developed by <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref> that used large datasets for training and achieved substantially higher performance than previous age predictors. We hereafter refer to this elastic net model as “Zhang2019 EN”.</p>
<p>Both models achieved higher correlations with chronological age than the Horvath clock across the cohorts in the MAGENTA study. For example, Hannum has a correlation of 0.74 in the white cohort, and consistent with previous evaluations, Zhang2019 EN has a correlation of 0.88. These relative performance trends held across cohorts, but again, the African Americans and Puerto Ricans, the cohorts with substantial African ancestry, had the lowest age correlations for each clock (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we evaluated the PhenoAge clock, a “second-generation” clock that is trained on biomarkers of frailty and physiological deterioration (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Morgan E. Levine et al., 2018</xref>). The correlation between DNAm age and chronological age was lower for this clock in comparison to the other methylation clocks (<italic>r</italic> = 0.53 in the white cohort). This is likely due to the fact that this clock was not trained to predict age directly, but rather markers of aging. This clock did not show as substantial a difference in performance between cohorts as seen for the Horvath clock, but the African American and Puerto Rican populations again had the lowest correlation of all cohorts.</p>
<p>Overall, these results demonstrate that current methylation clocks vary in the correlation of their predicted DNAm age with chronological age in genetically admixed cohorts. The clocks are also consistently the least accurate in predicting age cohorts with substantial proportions of African ancestry.</p>

<title>Most methylation clocks do not identify accelerated aging in admixed Alzheimer’s cohorts</title>
<p>DNAm age has been proposed as a promising biomarker and predictive tool for age-related disease risk, particularly because of associations between accelerated DNAm age (compared to chronological age) and the presence of diseases such as coronary heart disease, Parkinson’s disease, and AD. However, these results have largely been observed in European-ancestry cohorts.</p>
<p>To evaluate the ability of methylation clocks to identify accelerated aging and risk for agerelated disease in diverse, genetically admixed individuals, we quantified the association of methylation age acceleration with AD status in cohorts from the MAGENTA study. In addition to the clocks tested in the previous section, we also included a “third generation” clock,</p>
<p>DunedinPACE, that aims to predict the pace of aging as measured by change in biomarkers over time from methylation data, rather than age itself (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Belsky et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The cell type composition in blood is known to change with age, which if not accounted for, can confound age acceleration estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jaiswal and Ebert, 2019</xref>). Thus, we focused on intrinsic age acceleration estimates computed using established algorithms to correct for cell type composition.</p>
<p>To establish a baseline for this analysis, we tested whether individuals with AD in the white cohort show significantly greater age acceleration than non-demented controls. As expected from previous studies (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Morgan E Levine et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), AD cases have modest but significantly greater age acceleration as measured by the Horvath clock than controls (<xref rid="d1e1313" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>; median 1.7 vs. 1.5 years, <italic>p</italic> = 0.041). For each of the other clocks, AD cases had higher median age acceleration than controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), though due to the relatively small sample size, the differences only reached statistical significance for the DunedinPACE clock (median 1.09 vs. 1.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.044).</p>

<p>Having established that previously reported age acceleration in AD was detectable in our framework, we evaluated whether the clocks found accelerated aging in the admixed AD cohorts. Focusing first on the Horvath clock, we observed inconsistent relationships between age acceleration and AD status. None of the admixed cohorts showed a significant difference, and controls even had higher median age acceleration in Peruvians and Cubans (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Across the other clocks, none consistently identified greater age acceleration in AD cases across all populations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Among the first- and second-generation clocks, only PhenoAge demonstrated a significant ability to differentiate AD cases from controls in any of the non-European ancestry groups, specifically in African American individuals (p = 0.008), which were included in its training set. Cubans consistently showed greater age acceleration in controls rather than cases, while none of the other admixed cohorts even had consistent directions of effect across methods.</p>
<p>DunedinPACE stood out in the evaluation, as it identified significantly greater aging in AD cases compared to controls in the white (p = 0.044), African American (p = 0.0019), and Puerto Rican (p = 0.0090) cohorts using its “pace of aging” metric. However, no significant differences were found for Cubans (p = 0.26) or Peruvians (p = 0.81).</p>

<title>Combining predictions across methylation clocks does not improve their performance</title>
<p>Inspired by recent work on the ensembling of PRS to better predict disease risk from genetic variation across populations (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Monti et al., 2024</xref>), we evaluated whether combining age predictions would lead to greater accuracy in age prediction and AD risk prediction in the admixed cohorts. To investigate this, we averaged the age predictions for each individual in the MAGENTA study across five methylation clocks: Horvath, Hannum, Zhang2019 EN, Zhang2019 BLUP, and PhenoAge clocks. (The Zheng2019 BLUP is a variation of the Zhang2019 EN clock that does not use strong regularization.)</p>
<p>The ensemble method’s DNAm age prediction is more strongly correlated with chronological age in comparison to the Horvath and PhenoAge clocks, but it could not improve upon the best predictors (Zhang2019 clocks) across populations (<xref rid="d1e1313" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>We next evaluated whether the ensemble intrinsic age acceleration estimates would associate more strongly with AD disease status relative to the standalone methylation clocks. Following the same evaluation framework as for the individual clocks, we found only one significant difference in age acceleration. Cuban control individuals had significantly <italic>lower</italic> age acceleration than AD cases (<xref rid="d1e1313" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, a simple ensemble does not lead to stronger performance at either task in admixed cohorts.</p>

<title>Many methylation clock CpGs are disrupted by genetic variants, but the variants are extremely low frequency</title>
<p>Our results so far demonstrate that existing methylation clocks do not perform consistently across genetically admixed individuals with ancestries under-represented in clock training data. Thus, we sought to investigate potential mechanisms underlying the decreased performance of some clocks. We first quantified how often a genetic variant disrupted a CpG site included in a clock. This scenario could lead to inaccuracies across cohorts given the loss of potential for methylation and the ability of the site to contribute to the age prediction.</p>
<p>Of the 353 CpG sites considered in the Horvath clock, 245 (69%) have at least one disruptive genetic variant observed in at least one individual in the gnomAD database of variants identified in a cohort of 76,156, including thousands of individuals of non-European ancestry. However, these variants are extremely rare (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>); the average frequency is 0.0001, with the most common case being a variant observed in just one individual. Only one clock CpG disrupting variant had a frequency greater than 1%. Thus, genetic variation in clock CpG sites themselves is unlikely to be the main cause of lack of generalization of the Horvath clock.</p>

<title>Clock CpG methylation QTLs vary in frequency across ancestries</title>
<p>Differences in the presence or frequency of meQTL that influence clock CpGs between genetic ancestries could lead to decreased DNAm age prediction accuracy (and therefore weaker associations with disease) in diverse and admixed cohorts. For example, if a clock is trained on a cohort without an meQTL, the learned weights for the CpG will not have accounted for the effects of the meQTL.</p>
<p>To quantify whether differences in meQTL across genetic ancestries could potentially influence methylation clocks, we analyzed the gnomAD allele frequencies for the 29,033 Horvath clock meQTL tag variants in multiple global populations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The meQTLs are at significantly higher frequencies in African ancestry populations (median 0.068) than in each of the eight other population groups considered (0.004–0.046; p <italic>&lt;</italic> 3.85 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup><italic>−</italic>25</sup>). There were also 2,328 meQTL that were only observed in African populations.</p>
<p>To connect these results to individuals with recent admixture, like many in the MAGENTA study, we also tested whether the Horvath clock meQTL differed in frequency in local ancestry blocks of different origins in genetically admixed individuals from gnomAD. We used pre-computed local ancestry calls for 7,612 Latino/Admixed American individuals to compare allele frequencies for each meQTL in three ancestral backgrounds: African, Amerindigenous, and European. The clock CpG-affecting meQTLs were at higher frequencies in African local ancestry backgrounds (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with our finding that these meQTLs are most frequent in African ancestry individuals at the global population level.</p>

<title>Susceptibility to meQTL varies across methylation clocks</title>
<p>Given the strong potential for meQTL to influence the Horvath clock (76% of its CpGs have an meQTL), we expanded this analysis and quantified the number and proportion of clock CpGs that are affected by meQTL for all clocks considered here (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The other first-generation clocks have lower proportions of their CpG sites affected by meQTLs (Hannum: 8%, Zhang2019 EN: 1%). PhenoAge is similarly low, with 7% of its CpGs affected by at least one meQTL. Finally, DunedinPACE had no meQTLs affecting its 173 clock CpG sites.</p>

<p>Thus, the clock with the largest decrease in performance in admixed cohorts (in terms of predicting chronological age and identifying age acceleration in AD) has the most and largest fraction of meQTLs influencing its CpGs. On the opposite side of the spectrum, DunedinPACE, the best performing clock at identifying AD cases in the MAGENTA study, had no meQTLs. The three other clocks with intermediate performance in the admixed cohorts, all have meQTL for some CpGs, but much lower fraction than the Horvath clock.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Methylation clocks are promising biomarkers of aging and social stress, and as tools for mechanistic studies of diseases related to the aging process. Despite their widespread use in these applications, methylation clocks have not been comprehensively evaluated in diverse human groups. These groups are underrepresented in genetic and genomic databases and underserved in biomedical research in terms of access to healthcare and quality of healthcare.</p>
<p>In this study, we sought to fill this gap by evaluating commonly used methylation clocks in genetically admixed individuals from the Americas. We found that most clocks did not predict age as accurately in admixed control individuals as in the white cohort, especially for individuals with substantial African genetic ancestry. We next found that most methylation clocks could not discern between AD patients and non-demented controls based on age acceleration metrics in cohorts with genetic ancestries distinct from their training populations.</p>
<p>To evaluate potential genetic factors that could contribute to this decrease in performance, we hypothesized that two types of variants could reduce clock accuracy: 1) variants that disrupt clock CpG sites prevent methylation, and 2) meQTLs that influence clock CpG site methylation. Both scenarios could lead to over or under estimations of age, and therefore spurious associations with age-related disease, if they differ in frequency across genetic ancestries. While we discovered that 245 of the 353 CpG sites used by the Horvath clock are disrupted in at least one individual in gnomAD, these variants are extremely rare and thus unlikely to be a major driver of differences between the cohorts. In contrast, among meQTLs from multiple global populations, we found 29,033 unique variants that affected the Horvath clock CpG sites. Many of these variants are common, and they are most frequent in African ancestry individuals from gnomAD. We also showed that they are most frequent in African local ancestry blocks in admixed Latino individuals from the Americas.</p>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that methylation clocks—a widespread tool in aging, genomics, and social epidemiology research—perform inconsistently across individuals of different genetic ancestries. These results further underline the need for more diversity in the development and evaluation of genomic tools for precision medicine.</p>
<p>We hope that these results also encourage researchers using these tools to study diseases of aging or social stressors in diverse groups to exercise caution when interpreting differences in age acceleration. We have shown that many methylation clocks differ significantly in their accuracy at predicting age between cohorts. Thus, what might appear to be a faster pace of aging, could simply be the result of a difference in genetic ancestry from the training cohort. Applying existing methylation clocks to diverse individuals could lead to grave consequences and exacerbate existing disparities in access to quality healthcare, as well as provide spurious conclusions about an individual’s health. Due to the increased potential for false positives and false negatives when applying the clocks as predictive biomarkers, individuals at risk might not receive the medical attention they need, and additional stress could unncessarily be placed on individuals in good health. These challenges must be addressed before methylation clock are adopted as biomarkers for precision medicine.</p>
<p>The challenges we identify here for methylation clocks mirror the limitations of PRS, wherein phenotype prediction models decrease in accuracy on individuals genetically distant from the training population. While there are substantial biological differences in the processes modeled by methylation clocks and PRS, we are optimistic that recent progress on building PRS that are more portable across cohorts will provide strategies for improving methylation clocks.</p>
<p>Our results suggest two promising approaches for building more robust clocks. First, given the large number of meQTL in the human genome and their differences in frequency across human populations, we suggest training clocks only on CpG sites that do not have known meQTL. Given that the biological signatures driving methylation clock performance appear to influence large fractions of the genome, we do not anticipate that this will substantially limit overall performance. The strong and relatively consistent performance across cohorts of the DunedinPACE clock, which lacks CpGs with meQTL, supports this approach. It also suggests that methylation clocks that predict the pace of aging (rather than age itself) may be more robust, but further work is needed to validate this hypothesis. Second, we encourage including individuals from multiple genetic ancestries in the training cohorts. The ability of the PhenoAge clock, which included African Americans in the training cohort, to detect significant age acceleration in the African American AD cases suggests this may improve generalizability.</p>
<p>There are caveats and limitations to our study that we hope future work will address. First, the impact of environment on methylation clock accuracy and differences in environmental factors for global populations that might lead to decreases in methylation clock accuracy are difficult to study with the data at hand. Given this, we focused on genetic influences on CpG sites that could lead to spurious associations in diverse populations. However, work is needed to investigate other factors that might cause methylation clocks to not generalize across individuals, such as the methods that account for cell type composition heterogeneity in blood that might not be as accurate across individuals of different populations. Second, while we attempted to evaluate a representative set of first-, second-, and third-generation clocks, we were not able to evaluate all methylation clocks. In particular, some with closed source that were only available as a web server could not be used due to data privacy restrictions for the MAGENTA samples. Another limitation is the use of blood samples to generate methylation data for the study of a neurodegenerative disease focused on the central nervous system. However, we note that all methylation clocks tested in the present study were developed using blood samples, either exclusively (Hannum, PhenoAge, Zheng2019 EN, Zheng2019 BLUP, and DunedinPACE) or as part of the tissues used in training (Horvath). In addition, these clocks and their association with age-related diseases such as AD have all been validated in multiple tissues, including blood. Multiple studies in the AD literature point to changes in blood such as gene expression changes, immune cell type composition, and disruption of the blood brain barrier in AD patients relative to non-demented controls, such that signals related to AD pathology can be identified from this peripheral tissue (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Griswold et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">Shigemizu et al., 2022</xref>) and through epigenetic age acceleration (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Hodgson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Marioni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Raina et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, while the MAGENTA study is an excellent resource for exploring methylation clocks and AD in admixed individuals, it is not representative of all genetic ancestries and combinations. Moreover, the sample sizes vary between the MAGENTA cohorts, with the Cuban and Peruvian cohorts being particularly small relative to the others. This limits our ability to find differences in the age accelerations between AD patients and controls as measured by the methylation clocks. However, we are reassured by the complementary findings in African cohorts on the decreased performance of methylation clocks at age prediction and the role of meQTL (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Meeks et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results show that many existing methylation clocks have inconsistent performance and limited portability across genetically admixed cohorts. We encourage future efforts in the development of methylation clocks and other genomics-based aging biomarkers to be genetics- and ancestry-aware to ensure the accuracy of these tools for all individuals, regardless of their genetic background.</p>

<sec id="s4a1">
<title>Cohort Selection</title>
<p>All participants in the MAGENTA study were recruited through previous studies of AD, including Feliciano-Astacio et al., 2019, Marca-Ysabel et al., 2021, and <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Griswold et al., 2020</xref>. Blood samples were taken for all individuals ascertained and processed at the following sites: the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (Miami, FL, US), Wake Forest University (Winston-Salem, NC, US), Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH, US), Universidad Central Del Caribe (Bayamón, PR), and the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Neurologicas (Lima, PE). Ascertainment protocols were consistent across sites and capture cognitive function, family history of AD/related dementias, sociodemographic factors, and dementia staging. All diagnoses were assigned by clinical experts following criteria for diagnosis and staging from the National Institute on Aging Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA).</p>
<p>The MAGENTA study is based on pre-existing sample collections which vary in terms of the demographic information collected for each participant. Because the original ascertainment of MAGENTA study participants was international, different population descriptors were used across different ascertainment sites/cohorts. To facilitate comparisons relevant to understand the global differences noted in our study, we use a combination of geographic and race-based identifiers that are likely to best reflect underlying differences in genetic ancestry and admixture components. The label “white” is applied to legacy samples from North Carolina, Tennessee, and South Florida where participants either self-identified with this descriptor or were (in some legacy instances) administratively assigned as White race. The label “African American” is applied to samples collected via ascertainment in North Carolina and South Florida using population descriptors that specifically targeted enrollment of self-identified Black/African American participants. “Puerto Rican”, “Cuban”, and “Peruvian” labels are applied to samples collected as part of ascertainment efforts in these geographic areas. While more precise descriptors of self-identity are preferred, the advanced age of study participants and the older dates of some sample collections make recontact to collect these data impossible. All participants or their consenting proxy provided written informed consent as part of the study protocols approved by the site-specific Institutional Review Boards.</p>

<title>Estimating epigenetic age and its correlation with chronological age in the MAGENTA study</title>
<p>We applied multiple commonly used first-, second-, and third-generation methylation clocks to all individuals in the MAGENTA study with genome-wide methylation data.

We also applied DunedinPACE, a third-generation clock separately, because it was not included in the <italic>methyl-clock</italic> library (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Belsky et al., 2022</xref>). Because this clock does not explicitly predict age, it is not included in the analyses of correlation with biological age. Unless otherwise specified, default options were used for all clocks.</p>
<p>The methylation clocks considered analyze different numbers of CpG sites. For each clock, the sites considered were taken from the <italic>methylclock</italic> library or the original publication. In the case of missing data, the <italic>methylClock</italic> library imputes methylation status using the <italic>mpute</italic>.<italic>knn</italic> function from the <italic>impute</italic> R library. The MAGENTA cohort had low proportions of missing data for clock CpGs.

<p>We computed the Pearson correlation of estimated epigenetic age and chronological age for the controls in each cohort.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study assesses epigenetic clocks across ancestries, including in the context of accelerated aging in Alzheimer's Disease patients. It provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for population differences in age estimation accuracy across a variety of epigenetic clocks, but the degree to which these differences reflect continuous variation in ancestry, and/or are confounded by environmental or power differences is not entirely clear; consequently, the evidence that reduced portability is rooted in genetics is <bold>incomplete</bold>. Given the accelerating use of epigenetic clocks across fields, this study is nevertheless likely to be of interest to researchers working on human genetic and epigenetic variation or who apply epigenetic clocks to diverse human populations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cruz-González and colleagues draw on DNA methylation and paired genetic data from 621 participants (n=308 controls; n=313 participants with Alzheimer's Disease). The authors generate a panel of epigenetic biomarkers of aging with a primary focus on the Horvath multi-tissue clock. The authors find weaker correlations between predicted epigenetic age and chronological age in subgroups with higher African ancestry than within a subgroup identified as White. The authors then examine genetic variation as a potential source for between-group differences in epigenetic clock performance. The authors draw on a large collection of publicly available methylation quantitative trait loci datasets and find evidence for substantial overlap between clock CpGs located within the Horvath clock and methQTLs. Going further, the authors show that methQTLs that overlap with Horvath clock CpGs show greater allelic variation in African ancestral groups pointing to a potential explanation for poorer clock performance within this group.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an interesting dataset and an important research question. The authors cite issues of portability regarding polygenic risk scores as a motivation to examine between-group differences in the performance of a panel of epigenetic clocks. The authors benefit from a diverse cohort of individuals with paired genetic data and focus on a clinical phenotype, Alzheimer's disease, of clear relevance for studies evaluating age-related biomarkers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors tackle an important question using a diverse cohort the current manuscript is lacking some detail that may diminish the potential impact of this paper. For example:</p>

Thus, is an alternative explanation simply that any weaker correlations observed in this study are driven by sample size and a restricted age range? Reporting the chronological ages (and ranges) across subgroups in the current study would help in this regard. Similarly, given the lack of association between AD status and epigenetic age (and very small effect in the white group), it may be of interest to examine the correlation between chronological age and epigenetic age in each group including the AD participants: would the between-group differences in correlations between chronological age and epigenetic be altered by increasing the sample size?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper seeks to characterize the portability of methylation clocks across groups. Methylation clocks are trained to predict biological aging from DNA methylation but have largely been developed in datasets of individuals with primarily European ancestries. Given that genetic variation can influence DNA methylation, the authors hypothesize that methylation clocks might have reduced accuracy in non-European ancestries.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors evaluate five methylation clocks in 621 individuals from the MAGENTA study. This includes approximately 280 individuals sampled in Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Peru, as well as approximately 200 self-identified African American individuals sampled in the US. To understand how methylation clock accuracy varies with proportion of non-European ancestry, the authors inferred local ancestry for the Puerto Rican, Cuban, Peruvian, and African American cohorts. Overall, this paper presents solid evidence that methylation clocks have reduced accuracy in individuals with non-European ancestries, relative to individuals with primarily European ancestries. This should be of great interest to those researchers who seek to use methylation clocks as predictors of age-related, late-onset diseases and other health outcomes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One clear strength of this paper is the ability to do more sophisticated analyses using the local ancestry calls for the MAGENTA study. It would be valuable to capitalize on this strength and assess portability across the genetic ancestry spectrum, as was recently advocated by Ding et al. in Nature (2023). For example, the authors could regress non-European local ancestry fraction on measures of prediction accuracy. This could paint a clearer picture of the relationship between genetic ancestry and clock accuracy, compared to looking at overall correlations within each cohort.</p>
<p>The authors present two possible reasons that methylation clocks might have reduced accuracy in individuals with non-European ancestries: genetic variants disrupting methylation sites (i.e. &quot;disruptive variants&quot;), and genetic variants influencing methylation sites (i.e. meQTLs). The authors conclude disruptive variants do not contribute to poor methylation clock portability, but the evidence in support of this conclusion is incomplete. The site frequency spectrum of disruptive variants in Figure 4 is estimated from all gnomAD individuals, and gnomAD is comprised of primarily European individuals. Thus, the observation that disruptive variants are generally rare in gnomAD does not rule them out as a source of poor clock portability in admixed individuals with non-European ancestries.</p>
<p>It is also unclear to what extent meQTLs impact methylation clock portability. The authors find that the frequency of meQTLs is higher in African ancestry populations, but this could reflect the fact that some of the analyzed meQTLs were ascertained in African Americans. The number of meQTL-affected methylation sites also varies widely between clocks, ranging from 6 to 271; thus, meQTLs likely impact the portability of different clocks in different ways. Overall, the paper would benefit from a more quantitative assessment of the extent to which meQTLs influence clock portability.</p>
<p>The paper implies that methylation clocks have an inferior ability to predict AD risk in admixed populations relative to white individuals, but the difference between white AD patients and controls is not significant when correcting for multiple testing. This nuance should be made more explicit.</p>
<p>Finally, this paper overlooks the possibility that environmental exposures co-vary with genetic ancestry and play a role in decreasing the accuracy of methylation clocks in genetically admixed individuals. Quantifying the impact of environmental factors is almost certainly outside of the scope of this paper. However, it is worth acknowledging the role of environmental factors to provide the field with a more comprehensive overview of factors influencing methylation clock portability. It is also essential to avoid the assumption that correlations with genetic ancestry necessarily arise from genetic causes.</p>

<p>This manuscript examines the accuracy of DNA methylation-based epigenetic clocks across multiple cohorts of varying genetic ancestry. The authors find that clocks were generally less accurate at predicting age in cohorts with large proportions of non-European (especially African) ancestry, compared to cohorts with high European ancestry proportions. They suggest that some of this effect might be explained by meQTLs that occur near CpG sites included in clocks, because these variants may be at higher frequencies (or at least different frequencies) in cohorts with high proportions of non-European ancestry relative to the training set. They also provide discussions of potential paths forward to alleviate bias and improve portability for future clock algorithms.</p>
<p>The topic is timely due to the increasing popularity of DNA methylation-based clocks and the acknowledgment that many algorithms (e.g., polygenic risk scores) lack portability when applied to cohorts that substantially differ in ancestry or other characteristics from the training set. This has been discussed to some degree for DNA methylation-based clocks, but could of course use more discussion and empirical attention which the authors nicely provide using an impressive and diverse collection of data.</p>
<p>The manuscript is clear and well-written, however, some key background was missing (e.g., what we know already about the ancestry composition of clock training sets) and most importantly several analyses would benefit from being taken one step further. For example, the main argument of the paper is that ancestry impacts clock predictions, but this is determined by subsetting the data by recruitment cohort rather than analyzing ancestry as a continuous variable. Extending some of the analyses could really help the authors nail down their hypothesized sources of lack of portability, which is critical for making recommendations to the community and understanding the best paths forward.</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing out this omission. The age ranges are similar across cohorts. No individuals under 60 were considered, and the average ages per cohort ranged from 72 to 76. Neither average age nor age range was consistently higher or lower in the admixed cohorts for which the clocks had lower performance compared to the White cohort. We will report the age distributions in supplementary material in the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors compare correlations between chronological age and epigenetic age in sub-groups within to correlations reported by Horvath (2013). Attempting to draw comparisons between these two datasets is problematic.

</disp-quote>
<p>Our conclusions about the reduced accuracy of the clocks in admixed individuals are based on comparisons within the MAGENTA cohorts, not on the comparisons to previous reports. We show significantly reduced accuracy on African American and Puerto Rican cohorts in MAGENTA compared to the White MAGENTA cohort. The reviewer is correct that the lower correlation in each of the cohorts compared to those in the Horvath study is due to the older age range of our cohort. Indeed, other studies applying the Horvath clock have seen similar correlations to those observed on the White MAGENTA cohort (Marioni et al., 2015, Horvath 2013, and Shireby et al., 2020). Following the suggestion to increase sample size, we conducted the chronological age vs. epigenetic age correlation analysis with the inclusion of AD cases. The significantly lower performance of the clock on Puerto Ricans and African Americans relative to White individuals remains after including all individuals in each cohort. We will include these results on the full cohorts in MAGENTA in the revision.</p>

<p>We used correlation because this is commonly used to evaluate the performance of epigenetic age clocks, but we agree that direct error quantification provides a complementary perspective. We confirm that the African American and Puerto Rican cohorts have higher error than the White cohort, and we will report these comparisons in the revision.</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing out the need for additional context on data generation. All omics data from the MAGENTA study were generated using protocols that aim to minimize technical artifacts and batch effects.

<p>(5) Marioni et al., (2015) found a very weak cross-sectional association between DNAm Age and cognitive function (r~0.07) in a cohort of &gt;900 participants.

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that previous links between DNAm Age and AD/cognitive function have been small in magnitude. For example, the PhenoAge paper (Levine et al., 2018) and a study using the Horvath clock (Levine et al., 2015) found age acceleration of less than a year in AD patients relative to non-demented individuals. These effects have been detected in studies with relatively small sample sizes (e.g., 700 for Levine et al. 2015 and 604 for Levine et al. 2018). Our study is of similar size, but the cohort-specific analyses have lower power. Nonetheless, we replicate the modest, but significant association with AD in the white MAGENTA cohort. We have performed power calculations and find that we have 26% power to detect an effect of this size in the Cubans, 46% for the Peruvians, 66% for the Whites, 74% for the Puerto Ricans, and 84% for the African Americans. Given the relatively high power in the Puerto Rican and African American cohorts, we suggest that the reduced accuracy of the clocks contributes to the lack of association. We will also add caveats about power and the small sample size in the revision.</p>

<p>1. The methQTL analyses presented are suggestive of potential genetic influence on DNAm at some Horvath CpGs. Do authors see differences in DNAm across ancestral groups at these potentially affected CpGs? This seems to be a missing piece together (e.g., estimating the likely impact of methQTL on clock CpG DNAm).</p>

<p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion. We will add this analysis in the revision. This will enable us to test for further evidence for our hypothesis about the role of ancestryspecific meQTL on clock accuracy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper seeks to characterize the portability of methylation clocks across groups. Methylation clocks are trained to predict biological aging from DNA methylation but have largely been developed in datasets of individuals with primarily European ancestries. Given that genetic variation can influence DNA methylation, the authors hypothesize that methylation clocks might have reduced accuracy in non-European ancestries.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors evaluate five methylation clocks in 621 individuals from the MAGENTA study. This includes approximately 280 individuals sampled in Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Peru, as well as approximately 200 self-identified African American individuals sampled in the US. To understand how methylation clock accuracy varies with proportion of nonEuropean ancestry, the authors inferred local ancestry for the Puerto Rican, Cuban, Peruvian, and African American cohorts. Overall, this paper presents solid evidence that methylation clocks have reduced accuracy in individuals with non-European ancestries, relative to individuals with primarily European ancestries. This should be of great interest to those researchers who seek to use methylation clocks as predictors of agerelated, late-onset diseases and other health outcomes.</p>

<p>Thank you for this summary.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One clear strength of this paper is the ability to do more sophisticated analyses using the local ancestry calls for the MAGENTA study. It would be valuable to capitalize on this strength and assess portability across the genetic ancestry spectrum, as was recently advocated by Ding et al. in Nature (2023). For example, the authors could regress non-European local ancestry fraction on measures of prediction accuracy. This could paint a clearer picture of the relationship between genetic ancestry and clock accuracy, compared to looking at overall correlations within each cohort.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion. We agree that modeling portability across genetic ancestry as a spectrum would help support our conclusions. We will add this to the revision.</p>

<p>The authors present two possible reasons that methylation clocks might have reduced accuracy in individuals with non-European ancestries: genetic variants disrupting methylation sites (i.e., &quot;disruptive variants&quot;) and genetic variants influencing methylation sites (i.e., meQTLs). The authors conclude disruptive variants do not contribute to poor methylation clock portability, but the evidence in support of this conclusion is incomplete. The site frequency spectrum of disruptive variants in Figure 4 is estimated from all gnomAD individuals, and gnomAD is comprised of primarily European individuals. Thus, the observation that disruptive variants are generally rare in gnomAD does not rule them out as a source of poor clock portability in admixed individuals with non-European ancestries.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this question. The allele frequencies were so low that even if they all occurred in individuals of non-European ancestries, they would still be incredibly rare. Nonetheless, in the revision, we will make this clear by reporting ancestry-specific allele frequencies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is also unclear to what extent meQTLs impact methylation clock portability. The authors find that the frequency of meQTLs is higher in African ancestry populations, but this could reflect the fact that some of the analyzed meQTLs were ascertained in African Americans. The number of meQTL-affected methylation sites also varies widely between clocks, ranging from 6 to 271; thus, meQTLs likely impact the portability of different clocks in different ways. Overall, the paper would benefit from a more quantitative assessment of the extent to which meQTLs influence clock portability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the meQTL likely influence the clocks in different ways and that the ascertainment of the meQTLs in different populations makes direct comparisons challenging. To provide mechanistic insights into the ways that meQTL influence the methylation clocks, we plan to leverage the individual-level genetic data generated for the MAGENTA individuals. This will allow us to explore whether the individuals who have the specified clock-influencing meQTL receive less accurate predictions from the methylation clocks. In addition, the new analysis of whether individuals from different cohorts have different methylation levels at clock CpGs with ancestry-variable meQTLs will help establish the differences between groups (see response to Reviewer #1 point 6). Finally, to resolve potential bias due to ascertaining some of the meQTL in African Americans, we will conduct the same analyses from the manuscript, holding out the set of meQTL from African Americans. These results will be included in the revision.</p>

<p>The paper implies that methylation clocks have an inferior ability to predict AD risk in admixed populations relative to white individuals, but the difference between white AD patients and controls is not significant when correcting for multiple testing. This nuance should be made more explicit.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the signal is not particularly strong in the white cohort, but the effect size is in line with previous studies. We will add power calculations and discussion to help the interpretation of these results (see response to Reviewer #1 point 5).</p>

<p>Finally, this paper overlooks the possibility that environmental exposures co-vary with genetic ancestry and play a role in decreasing the accuracy of methylation clocks in genetically admixed individuals. Quantifying the impact of environmental factors is almost certainly outside of the scope of this paper. However, it is worth acknowledging the role of environmental factors to provide the field with a more comprehensive overview of factors influencing methylation clock portability. It is also essential to avoid the assumption that correlations with genetic ancestry necessarily arise from genetic causes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We entirely agree about the importance of discussing environmental exposures. We did not intend to discount them in our manuscript. We will clarify their potential role and the scope of our analyses in the revision. We expect that environmental factors certainly contribute to differences between groups. The revisions outlined above may help us better quantify the genetic contribution.</p>

<p>This manuscript examines the accuracy of DNA methylation-based epigenetic clocks across multiple cohorts of varying genetic ancestry. The authors find that clocks were generally less accurate at predicting age in cohorts with large proportions of nonEuropean (especially African) ancestry, compared to cohorts with high European ancestry proportions. They suggest that some of this effect might be explained by meQTLs that occur near CpG sites included in clocks, because these variants may be at higher frequencies (or at least different frequencies) in cohorts with high proportions of non-European ancestry relative to the training set. They also provide discussions of potential paths forward to alleviate bias and improve portability for future clock algorithms.</p>
<p>The topic is timely due to the increasing popularity of DNA methylation-based clocks and the acknowledgment that many algorithms (e.g., polygenic risk scores) lack portability when applied to cohorts that substantially differ in ancestry or other characteristics from the training set. This has been discussed to some degree for DNA methylation-based clocks, but could of course use more discussion and empirical attention which the authors nicely provide using an impressive and diverse collection of data.</p>
<p>The manuscript is clear and well-written, however, some key background was missing (e.g., what we know already about the ancestry composition of clock training sets) and most importantly several analyses would benefit from being taken one step further. For example, the main argument of the paper is that ancestry impacts clock predictions, but this is determined by subsetting the data by recruitment cohort rather than analyzing ancestry as a continuous variable. Extending some of the analyses could really help the authors nail down their hypothesized sources of lack of portability, which is critical for making recommendations to the community and understanding the best paths forward.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these suggestions. As noted in our response to reviewer #2, we will analyze ancestry as a continuous variable in the revision. We will also add details on the training of previous clocks and previous work on clock accuracy.</p>
