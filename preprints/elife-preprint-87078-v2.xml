<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The axon initial segment (AIS) constitutes not only the site of action potential initiation, but also a hub for activity-dependent modulation of output generation. Recent studies shedding light on AIS function used predominantly post-hoc approaches since no robust murine <italic>in vivo</italic> live reporters exist. Here, we introduce a reporter line in which the AIS is intrinsically labeled by an ankyrin-G-GFP fusion protein activated by Cre recombinase, tagging the native <italic>Ank3</italic> gene. Using confocal, superresolution, and two-photon microscopy as well as whole-cell patch-clamp recordings <italic>in vitro, ex vivo</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we confirm that the subcellular scaffold of the AIS and electrophysiological parameters of labeled cells remain unchanged. We further uncover rapid AIS remodeling following increased network activity in this model system, as well as highly reproducible <italic>in vivo</italic> labeling of AIS over weeks. This novel reporter line allows longitudinal studies of AIS modulation and plasticity <italic>in vivo</italic> in real-time and thus provides a unique approach to study subcellular plasticity in a broad range of applications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The axon initial segment (AIS) is the cellular compartment where most neurons integrate synaptic input and generate their primary output signal, the action potential (AP)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</sup>. Recently, technological advances have shed new light on this critical axonal microdomain, in particular its structure, molecular composition, and regulation. The AIS constitutes a central site for the regulation of neuronal output. It is critical for the initiation of AP and receives input from specialized inhibitory neurons which enables syn-chronization of neuronal firing across nearby cells<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]</sup>. Much like synapses, the AIS responds to changes in neuronal activity with different types of homeostatic plasticity, defined by structural changes in AIS length, position, and channel architecture, respectively<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]</sup>. Most recent studies investigating AIS function and plasticity relied on <italic>ex vivo</italic> immunofluorescent staining in fixed neuronal tissue and cultures using antibodies against elements of the AIS cytoskeleton and post-hoc analysis. These targets make sense, since the scaffolding proteins ankyrin-G and βIV-spectrin cluster voltage-gated ion channels at the AIS and provide a cellular anchor between the axonal membrane and cytoskeleton<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]</sup>. Recent approaches allow for live labeling of the AIS using antibodies against the extracellular domain protein neurofascin-186<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]</sup> or by transfecting cultured primary neurons with ankyrin-G-GFP constructs<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup>. However, these techniques are limited in their application due to challenges imposed by the AIS itself. For example, ankyrin-G and βIV-spectrin are large proteins that are therefore difficult to express<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]</sup> and their overexpression, when successful, may conceivably have an altering impact on AIS architecture and/or function. Also, all currently available live reporters are solely established for <italic>in vitro</italic> applications. Other studies uncovering the role of the AIS in the modulation of neuronal excitability combined electrophysiological recordings with post-hoc immunostainings<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]</sup>, preventing longitudinal tracking of AIS plasticity in the same cells over time.</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, we have generated a mouse line for Credependent expression of an ankyrin-G-GFP fusion protein using the native <italic>Ank3</italic> locus. This novel mouse line allows the monitoring of AIS parameters <italic>in vitro</italic> (isolated cells, organotypic cultures, OTC), <italic>ex vivo</italic> (acute brain slices), and <italic>in vivo</italic> (living mice). Using this model, we demonstrate efficient labeling of AIS and nodes of Ranvier (noR) <italic>in vitro, ex vivo</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic> by expression of Cre recombinase. The Cre-dependence of this model allows labeling of the AIS and noR in genetically defined neuronal populations and with temporal precision in the living animal or acute slice, depending on the selected Cre-line or Cre-supplementing virus. We show that ankyrin-G-GFP mice have normal AIS properties, including clustering of binding partners, inhibitory synaptic contacts, and nanostructure. In addition, we demonstrate that the electrophysiological properties of ankyrin-G-GFP neurons are indistinguishable from those found in wildtype littermate controls, including AP properties and excitatory synaptic function. In a proof-of-principle approach, we further demonstrate AIS plasticity in OTC from ankyrin-G-GFP mice. Finally, we show that AIS can be imaged <italic>in vivo</italic> with two-photon microscopy in both superficial and deep brain regions and that the ankyrin-G-GFP-labeled AIS can be imaged over days and weeks. Thus, our model allows the monitoring of ankyrin-G-dependent structures, like the AIS and noR, in neuronal cultures, acute slices, and intact animals, providing a much-needed tool for the visualization and analysis of axonal plasticity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Intrinsic AIS labeling in various experimental <italic>in vitro, ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> systems</title>
<p>Ankyrin-G is an intracellular scaffolding protein critical for the formation and maintenance of the AIS, where it recruits multiple cytoskeletal elements, ion channels, transporters, and cell adhesion molecules that are necessary for normal AIS function<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]</sup>. We therefore decided to use ankyrin-G as backbone to design a conditional mouse model to intrinsically label the AIS (see Methods). Ankyrin-G tolerates the addition of a GFP tag, since ankyrin-G-GFP can rescue multiple functions of ankyrin-G in <italic>Ank3</italic> null neurons, including scaffolding of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, clustering of the spectrin cytoskeleton, and recruitment of inhibitory synapses<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]</sup>. To intrinsically label ankyrin-G with GFP, we utilized a FLEx cassette system to flip out the last exon of <italic>Ank3</italic> and replace it with the last exon of <italic>Ank3</italic> fused with the coding sequence for GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Given the heterogeneous expression of ankyrin-G in various cell compartments across multiple tissues, constitutive tagging of the endogenous <italic>Ank3</italic> allele would make it difficult to visualize ankyrin-G-dependent structures. By contrast, our system allows us to only GFP-label ankyrin-G in cells expressing Cre recombinase, allowing the visualization of ankyrin-G in genetically and temporally defined cell populations.</p>

<p>When generating GFP fusion proteins, it is critical to confirm that GFP does not interfere with normal protein function. To this end, we utilized the linker-GFP sequence from the rescue plasmids used in multiple studies from our group and others to examine the function of the three main classes of brain ankyrin-G isoforms, 190, 270, and 480 kDa, respectively. Importantly, these GFP fusions have been shown to be sufficient to rescue <italic>Ank3</italic> knockout or silencing in the formation of the AIS, noR, GABAergic synapses, and dendritic spines<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>To characterize the ankyrin-G-GFP (ank-G-GFP) mouse, we utilized several of the most common recombination systems and experimental paradigms used in cellular neuroscience and confirmed intrinsic AIS features in different neuronal cell types <italic>in vitro, ex vivo</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic> across multiple brain regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Ank-G-GFP mice were first used to generate hippocampal OTC, which were then exposed to AAV expressing Cre-recombinase under control of the synapsin promotor (AAV5-pmSyn1-EBFP-Cre). After 48 hours, neurons exposed to the virus showed GFP expression along their AIS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, left panel). We confirmed the GFP signal as originating from AIS by staining against βIV-spectrin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, middle panel). Not all AIS in OTC neurons were GFP<sup>+</sup>, likely due to the transfection efficiency with AAV-Cre. By directly injecting viruses, and by crossbreeding ank-G-GFP mice with different Cre driver lines, we overcame this limitation and used acute slices or cryosections to verify efficient labeling of the AIS. The injection of ank-G-GFP animals with a synapsin-Cre-tdTomato AAV resulted in ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, left panel), which again were βIV-spectrin<sup>+</sup> as well (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, middle panel).

<p>Mating of ank-G-GFP mice with a line expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II alpha chain (CaMKIIα) promoter resulted in reproducible reporter detection in CaMKII-expressing neurons in layer II neocortical pyramidal neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Neurons not expressing CaMKII were negative for ank-G-GFP, but as expected, additional staining against βIV-spectrin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, middle panel) resulted in labeling of all AIS in the section, allowing for clear distinction between the different populations (ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup>-AIS vs ank-G-GFP<sup>−</sup>-AIS).</p>
<p>Ank-G-GFP expression is not limited to typical cortical neurons (pyramidal cells, interneurons). We found reliable ank-G-GFP expression in retinal whole-mount preparations, both in peripheral and central retinal ganglion cells (RGC; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>; ank-G-GFP x CaMKII-Cre animals). Colabeling of ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS with antibodies directed against native ankyrin-G in RGC indicated that the vast majority of RGC express CaMKII and consequently, their AIS are positive for both GFP and the intrinsic AIS marker ankyrin-G (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Interneuron populations showed similar selective labeling when using appropriate Cre driver lines. Mating of ank-G-GFP animals with parvalbumin (PV)-Cre mice highlighted exclusive GFP signal in AIS that belonged to PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons as shown in <italic>ex vivo</italic> acute slices of the cer-ebellum (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, left panel). Again, double labeling against βIV-spectrin indicated distinct GFP expression only in those neurons that expressed PV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, middle panel). In all experiments outlined above, double labeling against the characteristic AIS markers βIV-spectrin and ankyrin-G, respectively, served as control of AIS identity of labeled structures and we found that ank-G-GFP reporter expression always colocalized with these markers.</p>

<title>Ank-G-GFP localizes to nodes of Ranvier</title>
<p>The 480 kDa isoform of ankyrin-G is also localized to nodes of Ranvier (noR) in myelinated axons where it serves as a scaffold for voltage-gated ion channels similar to those found at the AIS<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]</sup>. Consequently, the ank-G-GFP construct should also be discernible in this axonal microdomain. In mice expressing ank-G-GFP in CaMKIIa-positive excitatory neurons, noR in the alveus of hippocampal CA3 were visible as distinct puncta that co-localized with other nodal markers such as ankyrin-G and Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Of note, only CaMKII-expressing neurons showed ank-G-GFP signals in noR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, green circles). Ank-G-GFP<sup>-</sup> noR were still characterized by the colocalization of ankyrin-G and Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, blue circles). To confirm that the expression of ank-G-GFP does not disrupt the nodal structure, we examined the localization of the paranodal Contactin-associated protein (Caspr)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]</sup>. Immunostaining against GFP, ankyrin-G, and Caspr revealed normal localization of ank-G-GFP and Caspr to the node and paranode, respectively, in myelinated axons of CaMKII-positive neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The quantification of node shape and fluorescence signals of Na <sub>v</sub> 1.6 and ankyrin-G showed no differences between GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>-</sup> nodes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, S1A and B). We note that these groups belong to genetically distinct subgroups of cells, but consistent node lengths and Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 levels indicate that the GFP label does not grossly disrupt node structure. Furthermore, GFP label intensities within GFP-positive nodes did not interfere with Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 levels (Fig. S1C, top panel). Instead, we found a strong correlation between GFP and ankyrin-G in GFP<sup>+</sup> nodes, demonstrating the specificity of our model (Fig. S1C, bottom panel).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="525891v2_fig5.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>A major feature of the AIS is its endowment with voltage-gated ion channels, the anatomical prerequisite for proper AP generation and propagation <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]</sup>. Colabeling of the sodium channel isoform Na <sub>v</sub> 1.6 with βIV-spectrin in ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS in cortical layer V pyramidal neurons showed homogeneous signals of Na<sub>v</sub> 1.6 across the length of neighboring GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>-</sup> AIS. Note that previously published data found a preference of Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 for distal expression at the AIS in the layer V prefrontal cortex (instead of layer II somatosensory cortex<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]</sup>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, S2D). Likewise, similar expression of K <sub>v</sub> 2.1 was observed in GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>-</sup> AIS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, S2E).</p>
<p>The AIS is also characterized by the expression of several cell adhesion molecules, chief among them neurofascin-186 (NF-186), which is important for the recruitment of ion channels to the AIS during development<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup>. Potential disruption of normal AIS assembly in our reporter model may have an impact on the assembly of the extracellular niche at the AIS, how-ever, immunostaining against NF-186 in ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS produced the expected co-staining pattern (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The AIS-related proteins TRIM46, organizing the fasciculation of microtubules in the AIS<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]</sup>, and FGF14, regulating voltage-gated ion channels at the AIS<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]</sup>, were also detected in ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons throughout the neocortex of ank-G-GFP x CaM-KII-Cre mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, E</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether the cisternal organelle (CO), an AIS-specific intra-axonal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-store, remained unperturbed by ank-G-GFP expression. The actin-binding protein synaptopodin (synpo) has been shown to be a reliable and reproducible marker for the CO in the AIS<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]</sup>. Immunostaining with antibodies against GFP, synpo, and βIV-spectrin in layer V pyramidal neurons of primary motor cortex of ank-G-GFP x CaMKII-Cre mice revealed labeling of the CO within the AIS of ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) with the typical synpo<sup>+</sup> spine apparatus as part of the dendritic domain visible in all samples (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, magenta puncta in the background). Three-dimensional reconstruction of ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS indicated numerous synpo clusters residing within the axonal compartment as previously reported<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]</sup>. To test whether GFP-expression had an impact on the normal distribution of synpo clusters in pyramidal neurons, we quantified cluster number per AIS and compared GFP<sup>-</sup> and GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS from the same ank-G-GFP x CaMKII-Cre mice. No significant difference between GFP<sup>-</sup> and GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS was observed (GFP<sup>-</sup> AIS 3.1 ± 1.7 clusters vs GFP<sup>+</sup> 3.3 ± 1.7 clusters; <italic>n</italic> = 50 AIS from 3 animals, <italic>P</italic> = 0.6444, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>Another hallmark of the AIS is its axo-axonic innervation pattern, which we tested using immunostaining against ank-G-GFP, the vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT), a reliable presynaptic marker<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]</sup>, and βIV-spectrin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Data revealed that indeed, ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS were contacted by vGAT<sup>+</sup> axo-axonic interneurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Conceivably, GFP-expression in ank-G-GFP mice could have an impact on the number of GABAergic synapses at the AIS. Therefore, we quantified the number of vGAT<sup>+</sup> puncta along GFP<sup>-</sup> and GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS from the same ank-G-GFP x CaMKII-Cre mice. We found no significant difference between these groups (GFP<sup>-</sup> AIS 20.7 ± 2.3 vGAT puncta vs GFP<sup>+</sup> 20.8 ± 2.2 vGAT puncta; <italic>n</italic> = 50 AIS from 3 animals, <italic>P</italic> = 0.7917, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). We note that GFP<sup>-</sup> and GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS belong to genetically different cell types (defined by CamKIIa expression) that might not necessarily feature the same synpo or vGAT distributions. A further characteristic of the AIS is its occasional ensheathing in microglial processes, which is the case for approximately 4% of all AIS in rodent cortex<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]</sup>. We therefore performed immunostaining against the microglial marker Iba1 in ank-G-GFP x CaMKII mice and found scarce, but clearly distinguishable interaction of select GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS with microglial processes in S1 layer II/III pyramidal neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). In those cases, the majority of the microglial cell body was in contact with the soma of a pyramidal neuron and extended one or more processes alongside the AIS towards its distal end (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>The AIS nanostructure is maintained after GFP fusion to ankyrin-G</title>
<p>The nanostructure of the AIS scaffold in cortical neurons exhibits a stereotypical subcellular organization, in which a periodic spacing of actin and spectrin rings intercalates with voltage-gated ion channels at approximately 170 - 190 nm distance, depending on the cell type studied<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]</sup>.

<p>Here, we aimed to verify that the introduction of GFP into this scaffold did not disturb its spatial organization. Dissociated hippocampal neurons derived from the ank-G-GFP line without prior Cre exposure were infected with lentiviruses expressing functional Cre-recombinase (+Cre) or a deficient version of Cre without recombinase activity as control (ΔCre), both fused to nuclear GFP (nGFP) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Conventional confocal microscopy after immunostaining against the AIS marker βIV-spectrin showed that ΔCre neurons exhibited no GFP staining at their βIV-spectrin<sup>+</sup> AIS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> left), whereas intrinsic GFP labeling of the AIS was achieved in cultures exposed to functional Cre-recombinase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> middle). Using Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy, we assessed the nanoscale distribution of ankyrin-G, both via intrinsic GFP label as detected by the FluoTag-X4-GFP nanobody (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> right, upper panel) as well as via antibody staining directed against the C-terminus of ankyrin-G (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> right, lower panel). To further elucidate the nanoscale distribution of AIS proteins in control vs Cre-recombinase exposed cells, we performed immunostaining against the C-terminus of ankyrin-G (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, left panel), βIV-spectrin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, middle panel), and K<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, right panel), which has been shown to cluster at the AIS<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]</sup>. Comparing ΔCre to +Cre neurons, we found an equally reproducible staining for all three markers (compare upper and lower rows in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Autocorrelation analysis verified the characteristic 190 nm periodic organization of the proteins investigated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>; left = ankyrin-G, middle = βIV-spectrin, right = K<sub>v</sub>1.2). Further, an autocorrelation amplitude analysis, which calculates the difference between the autocor-relation value at 190 nm and the average values at 95 nm and 285 nm, respectively, was performed, showing no significant difference between untreated, ΔCre or +Cre ank-G-GFP cultures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>; left = ankyrin-G, middle = βIV-spectrin, right = K<sub>v</sub>1.2). In summary, our data indicate that ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS develop normally and upon Cre-activation, retain their nanoscale organization.</p>

<title>Cellular excitability is not affected by GFP fusion to ankyrin-G</title>
<p>In order to utilize the ank-G-GFP line to study electrophysiological consequences associated with AIS function and plasticity, we verified that the fusion protein itself does not change the basic excitatory properties of ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons in different systems. We investigated whether cells expressing the fusion protein exhibit different electrophysiological properties as compared to wildtype cells. We used two common model systems: (i) dissociated hippocampal neurons infected either with Cre recombinase or a recombination-deficient ΔCre virus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A, B</xref>), and (ii) hippocampal neurons in acute slices of adult mice that were generated from the ank-G-GFP x CaMKII-Cre matings. These were compared to acute slices from both ank-G-GFP littermate controls not exposed to Cre, and standard wildtype C57Bl/6J mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C, D</xref>). In dissociated hippo-campal neurons, we first determined passive membrane properties such as resting membrane potential (RMP) and input resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub>) and found no significant difference between neurons expressing Cre-recombinase and ΔCre controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Similarly, AP properties, including amplitude, half-width, voltage threshold, current threshold, and rheobase were unaf-fected (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Plotting the input/output relation with a comparison of the maximum slope f’ (max) of the I/F-curve further provided evidence that the GFP fusion construct does not alter the firing properties of infected neurons in vitro. The same electrophysiological parameters were tested in <italic>ex vivo</italic> hippocampal acute slices from three groups: (i) wildtype mice, (ii) ank-G-GFP mice without Cre exposure, and (iii) ank-G-GFP x CamKII-Cre mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C, D</xref>). We found no evidence of an impact of the GFP fusion protein on any of the investigated passive and active properties (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>, D, Supplementary Table 1).</p>

<title>Ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS undergo structural plasticity after changes in net-work state <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic></title>
<p>Previous post-hoc studies of AIS plasticity indicated that the AIS scales its length, and sometimes position, in response to changes in network activity (reviewed in<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]</sup>). Using the new live reporter, we tested whether the same principles apply to ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup> AIS. We employed previously reported experimental conditions of network alterations<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]</sup> to elicit structural AIS changes <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). To that end, hippocampal OTC were prepared from ank-G-GFP mice at P4 and transfected with an AAV pmSyn1-EB-FP-Cre virus at DIV 1 to trigger GFP expression. Since previous research indicated that AIS elongation is a process that requires a longer time frame of network silencing (days to weeks<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]</sup>), we first blocked synaptic transmission via NMDA receptors by maintaining OTC in the presence of 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> for 20 days. Under these conditions, AIS elongated significantly (Ctrl 27.9 ± 3.0 µm vs MgSO<sub>4</sub> 32.1 ± 2.4 µm, <italic>n</italic> = 6 OTC, 50 AIS per OTC; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A, B</xref>). The same effect was observed when cultures were maintained in MgSO<sub>4</sub> for 10 days (Ctrl 32.1 ± 3.5 µm vs MgSO<sub>4</sub> 35.9 ± 1.2 µm, <italic>n</italic> = 6 OTC, 50 AIS per OTC; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). Induction of increased network activity by exposing OTC to chronic depolarizing conditions (6 mM KCl) for 20 days and 10 days, respectively, did not result in significant length changes (KCl(10 days) 29.9 ± 1.8 µm, KCl(20 days) 27.0 ± 2.7 µm, <italic>n</italic> = 6 OTC, 50 AIS per OTC; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test for B, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests for C and D).</p>

<p>AIS plasticity is proposed as a homeostatic mechanism<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]</sup> and should be reversible as network activity returns to baseline. We therefore tested the reversibility of AIS plasticity by applying rescue conditions. After initial exposure to the activity-altering conditions for 10 days, OTC were cultured under normal growth conditions for an additional 10 days (to DIV 20; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). In MgSO<sub>4</sub>-treated OCT, AIS length returned to baseline after rescue (Ctrl MgSO<sub>4</sub> 27.9 ± 3.0 µm vs rescue 30.6 ± 2.3 µm; <italic>n</italic> = 6 OTC, 50 AIS per OTC; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>).</p>
<p>Rescue paradigms in KCl-treated cultures did not affect AIS length as was expected (Ctrl KCl 27.9 ± 3.0 µm vs rescue 28.9 ± 1.9 µm; <italic>n</italic> = 6 OTC, 50 AIS per OTC; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>, all tests performed as unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test).</p>
<p>AIS shortening after increased network activity occurs in a rapid time frame (1 hour) and is bidirectional with a return to baseline after an initial length change<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]</sup>. To test whether rapid AIS plasticity could be observed live in ank-G-GFP mice, we applied a different strategy. Ank-G-GFP mice were injected with an AAV5-CaMKIIa-Cre virus triggering Cre expression in a subset of hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). After 3 weeks of virus expression, stable ank-G-GFP signals were detected in a subset of pyramidal neurons using epifluorescence in acute slices. Using pipette application of 15 mM KCl targeting individual neurons, we observed rapid changes in fluorescent signals based on the intrinsic GFP (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). Direct application of high potassium resulted in a relative length reduction only of the AIS associated with the affected neuron, while all surrounding labeled AIS maintained their initial length (<italic>n</italic> = 4 pairs of sample and control AIS; 10 min Ctrl vs KCl: <italic>P</italic> = 0.0068; 20 min Ctrl vs KCl: <italic>P</italic> = 0.0045; 30 min Ctrl vs KCl: <italic>P</italic> = 0.0130; paired <italic>t</italic>-tests, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). Interestingly, within minutes of the KCl application to the axon hillock, we observed the partial disappearance of the proximal onset of an individual AIS (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>, insets). This was quite striking since the majority of previous studies on this topic could only access AIS length and position changes in a post-hoc manner and never in the same cell. Using patch-clamp recordings, we verified that neurons tolerate and survive the treatment in the respective time frame. We here demonstrate that actual structural AIS changes do occur rapidly within 10 min and that they can be visualized and monitored within the same neuron.</p>

<title>Live imaging of ank-G-GFP<sup>+</sup>-AIS <italic>in vivo</italic> reveals long-term stability of AIS length</title>
<p>As outlined above, previous studies investigating AIS plasticity relied on post-hoc analysis in fixed sections. We conducted the ultimate test of the ank-G-GFP reporter using live cell imaging in intact animals in a longitudinal approach. Three different <italic>in vivo</italic> systems were applied to test the reliability, reproducibility, and stability of intrinsic ank-G-GFP signals in vivo. First, we imaged and tracked the same pyramidal neuron AIS in S1 for 1 week (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A-C</xref>). After implanting cranial windows in 3 months old ank-G-GFP x CaMKII-Cre animals, the AIS of layer II/III neurons in S1 were imaged based on their intrinsic GFP signal, which proved to be robust and easy to visualize (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A-C</xref>). We compared the same region of interest at a 7-day interval and analyzed the length of the same individual AIS (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>, C). Quantification revealed that the same AIS maintained their average length reliably (week 1, magenta: 17.3 ± 3.9 µm vs week 2, green: 16.8 ± 3.9 µm, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, n = 30 AIS; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). This indicated that neither previous imaging nor potential physiological alterations in a 1-week time frame changed GFP expression in such a way that it caused global length differences. Plotting of mean AIS length from week 1 and week 2 indicated a strong and significant correlation among individual AIS lengths measured in the same ROI (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.7892, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <italic>n</italic> = 30 AIS; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). In addition to constitutive expression of ank-G-GFP in intercrossed transgenic mice, AIS could also be monitored <italic>in vivo</italic> using a viral approach in two additional systems: 1) specific subpopulations of cross-callosal pyramidal neurons of the caudal forelimb region of M1 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>) and 2) principal neurons of deep brain areas, like the basolateral amygdala (BLA) via gradient reflective index (GRIN) lenses (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we introduce a mouse line that allows Cre-dependent expression of an ank-G-GFP fusion protein using the native <italic>Ank3</italic> locus, thus enabling the monitoring and analysis of AIS and noR parameters in living mice.

<p>An increasing number of studies have shown that neurons respond to changes in neuronal activity by altering the length, position, and/or channel distribution of the AIS<sup>[3-7, 51]</sup>. For example, sensory deprivation elicits lengthening of the AIS and a corresponding increase in neuronal excitability in the barrel cortex<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]</sup>. Conditions that mimic mild traumatic brain injury cause decreases in AIS length in the somatosensory cortex<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]</sup>. AIS plasticity in response to changes in network activity has further been observed in the avian<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]</sup> and rodent auditory system<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]</sup>, isolated hippocampal neurons<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]</sup>, hippocampal OTC<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]</sup>, and numerous other models (reviewed in<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]</sup>). However, a limitation of these studies is the post-hoc analysis of neuronal populations from different animals, which confines our understanding of the temporal regulation of this process at the single-cell level. The ank-G-GFP model allows live imaging of the AIS under different physiological and pathophysiological conditions, generating a novel approach to the investigation and discovery of structure/function relationships and the temporal regulation of these processes in health and disease. While significant inroads into the understanding of AIS assembly and plasticity have been made recently<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]</sup>, this live reporter offers a unique tool to truly understand the actual molecular mechanisms involved.</p>
<p>Ankyrin-G plays a critical role in the establishment of the AIS and is responsible for the clustering of known AIS proteins, including voltage-gated ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and inhibitory synaptic components<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]</sup>. Given this requirement for ankyrin-G to assemble the AIS, the use of GFP-tagged native ankyrin-G as a molecular marker for the AIS allows early insight into AIS assembly <italic>in vivo</italic>. Beyond the initial ankyrin-G-dependent assembly of the AIS, other components of the AIS participate in its stability, including voltage-gated sodium channels, βIV-spectrin, and neurofascin<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the temporal and spatial regulation of these interactions under normal steady-state conditions and during events of plasticity.</p>
<p>Some components of the AIS, including voltage-gated sodium channels, alter their position along with ankyrin-G during homeostatic plasticity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]</sup>, indicating a tight coupling of ankyrin-G and some binding partners. Other AIS constituents, like ankyrin-G-dependent GABAergic synapses, can uncouple their AIS position from that of ankyrin-G<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]</sup>. Thus, future experiments with the ank-G-GFP mouse could combine live cell markers for other AIS proteins to study the mechanisms of AIS localization and plasticity and how these proteins are coupled and/or uncoupled from ankyrin-G during the development and maturation of the CNS. A recent study utilizing our mouse line provided new insights into rapid AIS plasticity mediated by the rapid internalization of AIS-localized sodium channels<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Beyond the AIS, ankyrin-G is also localized to other subcellular locations within neurons. For example, ankyrin-G is highly concentrated at noR, where it participates in the clustering of voltage-gated ion channels at the nodal membrane<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]</sup>. Similar to what has been observed with the AIS, post-hoc approaches have identified variability in noR length, which could theoretically result in the regulation of AP propagation velocity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]</sup>. Here, we demonstrate efficient labeling of noR in ank-G-GFP mice, underlining the ank-G-GFP mouse as a useful tool for monitoring size and position as well as glial interaction of noR <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition to noR, ankyrin-G is also localized to the somatic membrane in mature neurons of the neocortex and hippocampus, where it regulates GABAergic synaptic density<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]</sup>. Consistent with our previous results, we observe ank-G-GFP accumulation on somatic membranes in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Finally, the 190 kDa isoform of ankyrin-G localizes to subdomains within dendritic spines, where it plays an important role in glutamate receptor stability and dendritic spine morphology<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</sup>. Since the ank-G-GFP mouse uses a carboxy-terminal GFP tag that would be present on all three major classes of <italic>Ank3</italic> transcripts in the CNS (190, 270, and 480 kDa isoforms), future experiments with the ank-G-GFP line could examine ankyrin-G dynamics within dendritic spines during synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>In summary, we here provide a novel reporter mouse model for the next generation of experiments focusing on excitable axonal microdomains in living tissue, a so far unattainable goal. AIS plasticity remains a highly relevant, yet understudied core neuronal mechanism that has a significant impact on how neurons integrate and participate in local networks. The actual mechanisms of AIS plasticity remain largely unknown. Their investigation would greatly benefit from this model, allowing for the visualization of subcellular modifications during diverse network states, including in disease models. The ank-G-GFP reporter mouse, in combination with the high temporal and spatial resolution now obtained by e.g. voltage or calcium imaging, will move an entire research field forward. In addition, the added benefit of also studying noR and other ankyrin-G-dependent structures including those in the peripheral nervous system, will open up avenues of investigations that have so far not been available to researchers.</p>

<p>Ank-G-GFP mice were imported to Germany and a breeding colony maintained at the animal facility of the Medical Faculty Mannheim of Heidelberg University and subsequently shipped to and maintained by the Interfaculty Biomedical Research Facility in Heidelberg (IBF), Germany, and the University of Basel, Switzerland. All experiments were approved by the animal welfare officer of Heidelberg University and the cantonal veterinary office Basel-Stadt (3001 and 3058). Animal maintenance and experimental procedures were performed in strict accordance with German, Swiss, and US law, the guidelines of the European Community Council and the state government of Baden-Württemberg (Project T01/19, G-188/15, 35-9185/G-119/20, I-18/08, I-20/06). Ank-G-GFP mice were bred as a homozygote line and crossed to various Cre-driver lines as outlined below. Control animals were male C57BL/6N mice (Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany, Strain Code: 027) and mixed gender Thy1-GFP (Tg/Thy1-EGFP; MJrs/J provided by Jackson Laboratory Maine, USA). For experimentation, animals were 4-6 weeks old (20-25 g) and kept in groups of up to four individuals, with nesting material made of cellulose. Animals were maintained on a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle with controlled temperature and humidity, and access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

<title>Generation of mouse line</title>
<p>We used the Flip-excision (FLEx) system<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]</sup> to introduce a conditional GFP-tag into the final exon of ankyrin-G, the major scaffolding protein of the AIS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]</sup>). A FLEx cassette containing the last exon of <italic>Ank3</italic> (ENSMUSE00001313132, exon 42) followed by a copy of the last exon of <italic>Ank3</italic> fused with the coding sequence for eGFP in the reverse orientation was generated using standard molecular methods. The entire cassette was flanked by alternating loxP and lox2272 sites. In the presence of Cre recombinase, the cassette orientation is irreversibly flipped by sequential recombination and excision of two of the lox sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The result is the expression of an ankyrin-G-GFP fusion product from the endogenous locus only in cells expressing Cre recombinase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The linker sequence between Ank3 and GFP is the same sequence used in previously described 190-, 270-, and 480-kDa ankyrin-G-GFP plasmids<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]</sup>. Importantly, these ankyrin-G-GFP fusion products have been able to rescue all functions of ankyrin-G tested to date, suggesting that the addition of GFP to the ankyrin-G carboxy-terminus does not affect ankyrin function<sup>[8, 20, 62-66]</sup>. A neomycin resistance cassette, driven by the phosphoglycerate promoter (PGK-neo) and flanked by flippase recognition target (FRT) sites, was inserted between exon 42 and the 5’ LoxP site. The linearized construct was introduced into 129X1/SvJ ES cells by electroporation, and G418-resistant clones were screened using polymerase chain reaction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). One of the primers was anchored outside of the 5’ homology arm to allow the detection of the FLEx cassette within the correct chromosomal location. ES cells selected for the presence of the FLEx cassette using G418 were injected into C57BL/6NHsd blastocysts. A high percentage of chimeric animals were obtained and bred to C57BL/6NHsd mice to produce heterozygous animals. The FRT-flanked neo cassette was excised by crossing the Ank3-GFP mouse with a mouse expressing flippase recombinase. Mutant mice were backcrossed to C57BL6/J mice (Jackson Laboratory) and were compared to C57BL6/J mice as WT controls.</p>

The basic staining protocol is the same for all tissue types, with a small adaptation of fixative, fixation times, and blocking buffer outlined in Supplementary Table 4. After fixation, isolated hippocampal neurons were quenched for 5 min in PBS supplemented with 100 mM glycine and 100 mM ammonium chloride.

<title>In vivo two-photon imaging</title>
<p>Somatosensory cortex: Implantation of cranial windows and two-photon imaging were performed following the protocol provided in<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]</sup>. Mice were single-housed after surgery and typically imaged starting 21 days after surgery. Two-photon imaging was performed with a TriMScope II microscope (LaVision BioTec GmbH) equipped with a pulsed Ti:Sapphire laser (Chameleon; Coherent). The ank-G-GFP signal was imaged at 920 nm wavelength using a 25x water immersion objective (Nikon, NA = 1.1). Anesthetized imaging sessions lasted no longer than 1 h.</p>
<p>BLA and motor cortex: Two-photon images were acquired by combining two channels, green and red, either for a single plane image for BLA (250 frames averaged) or a z-stack along a 50 µm volume (1 µm step; 600 frames per plane, averaged online) for the motor cortex. using a custombuilt two-photon microscope (Independent NeuroScience Services, UK). Mice were head-fixed with a custom-designed head bar system and placed on a running-wheel during imaging. The microscope was equipped with a resonant scanning system and a pulsed Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon Vision S, Coherent). The microscope system was controlled by ScanImage software (Version 5.7, Vidrio Technologies). The ank-G-GFP and mCherry signals were imaged at 940 nm or 980 nm wavelength, and green and red fluorescent photons were collected through an objective lens (CFI75 LWD 16X W, 0.80 NA, Nikon). Photons were separated by a dichroic mirror (T565lpxr, long pass, Chroma) and barrier filters (green: ET510/80m, red: ET630/75m, Chroma), and measured by photomultiplier tubes (PMT2101, Thorlabs). The imaging frame was 512 x 512 pixels and images were acquired at 30 Hz. Due to the spatially non-uniform optical distortion that GRIN lens images produce<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]</sup>, it is challenging to produce correct scale bars for these images. Therefore, the scale bars indicated in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref> are an estimate of the size of the image. After acquisition, the images of each channel were merged and averaged to create dual-color images using ImageJ (Version: 2.0). 3D reconstructions of dual-color z-stacked images were created using the 3D Viewer plugin of ImageJ. Signal intensities in both green and red channels were adjusted in ImageJ for visualization purposes.</p>

<title>3D Image reconstruction</title>
<p>Three-dimensional visualization of microglia, AIS, and synaptopodin clusters were obtained by surface reconstruction of deconvoluted confocal images. All images were acquired under close to ideal sampling density according to the Nyquist rate and further processed by blind iterative deconvolution based on the optical properties of the microscope and the sample using AutoQuant X3 (Media Cybernetics). To render x-y-z information of individual objects, surface structures were reconstructed using Imaris 9.8 (Bitplane, Zurich) according to previously published protocols<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]</sup>.

<title>AIS and noR length analysis</title>
<p>Based on confocal images, AIS and noR length analysis was performed using a self-written software tool (AISuite, Roos &amp; Engelhardt; available at github.com/jhnnsrs/aisuite2;<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]</sup>). Loading the original bioformat file into the software enables complete visualization of the three-dimensional expansion of the AIS and noR. Measurements were conducted by drawing a line through the AIS into the somatic domain as well as into the distal section of the axon and through the node, respectively. The ROI is then straightened along its vectors through affine transformations. The resulting transformation represents an AIS and noR, respectively, with surrounding tissue, straightened along its axis. A normalized intensity profile for the image channels is then calculated. For AIS, we defined the beginning and end as the first and respectively the last pixel value over a threshold of 40% of the normalized fluorescence. The physical dimensions were assessed by converting the pixel data with the help of the meta data present in the bioformat file (here: 0.21 µm = 1 pixel): For AIS, the distance to soma was calculated as the distance from the start of the traced line to the start of the AIS, length as the extending line to the distal AIS. In total, 50 AIS per OTC per preparation (animal) and condition were quantified.</p>
<p>For noR, GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>-</sup> noR were randomly chosen within 6 areas of white matter out of different samples, selected only based on ankyrin-G expression.

<p>In this <bold>valuable</bold> paper, the authors created a reporter mouse line in which the Axon Initial Segment (AIS) is intrinsically labeled by an ankyrin-G-GFP fusion protein activated by Cre recombinase, tagging the native Ank3 gene. Using confocal, superresolution, and two-photon microscopy as well as whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, the authors <bold>convincingly</bold> document that the subcellular scaffold of the AIS and electrophysiological parameters of labeled cells remain unchanged. They further uncover rapid AIS remodeling following increased network activity in this model system, as well as highly reproducible in vivo labeling of AIS over weeks.</p>

<p>This paper introduces a new transgenic mouse line that allows the labelling of the AIS and nodes of Ranvier by tagging Ank-G with GFP in a Cre-dependent manner. The authors characterise the properties of the AIS and nodes of Ranvier when labelled with GFP to show that it has no adverse effects on the properties of the AIS and nodes of Ranvier, nor on most measures of intrinsic excitability in neurons. They also show that this mouse line can be used to follow AIS plasticity in vitro and to visualise the AIS of neurons in vivo. This is a very useful and timely tool that will make an important impact in the field.</p>

<p>The axon initial segment (AIS) is the axonal domain where most neurons integrate inputs and generate action potentials. Though structural and electrophysiological studies have allowed to better understand the mechanisms of assembly and maintenance of this domain, as well as its functions, there is still a need for efficient tools to study its structural organization and plasticity in vivo.</p>
<p>In this article, the authors describe the generation of a knock-in mouse reporter line allowing the conditional expression of a GFP-tagged version of AnkyrinG (Ank-G), which is a major protein of the axon initial segment and the nodes of Ranvier in neurons. This reporter line can in particular be used to study axon initial segment assembly and plasticity, by combining it with mouse lines or viruses expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of a neuronal promoter. Furthermore, the design of the line should allow to preserve the expression of the main Ank-G isoforms observed in neurons and could thus allow to study Ank-G related mechanisms in various neuronal subcompartments.</p>
<p>Some mouse lines allowing the neuronal expression of AIS/node of Ranvier markers coupled to a fluorescent protein exist, however they correspond to transgenic lines leading to potential overexpression of the tagged protein. Depending on the promoter used, their expression can vary and be absent in some neuronal populations (in particular, the Thy-1 promoter can lead to variable expression depending on the transgene insertion locus). Furthermore, these lines do not allow conditional expression of the protein regarding neuronal subtypes nor controlled temporal expression. Finally, a thorough description of the in vivo expression of the tagged protein at the AIS, and its impact on the structural and electrophysiological properties of the AIS are missing for these lines.</p>
<p>The present reporter line is thus definitely of interest, as the authors convincingly show that it can be used in various contexts (from in vitro to in vivo). It could in particular be used to study the assembly and plasticity of the domains where Ank-G is expressed. The strength of this work is that it thoroughly characterizes the reporter line expression and shows that it does not alter the structural nor the electrophysiological properties of the labeled neurons. The additional data presented by the authors in the revised version adequately complete the previously shown data and address the questions raised by the reviewers.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>R1-01 - Does ank-G-GFP label all isoforms (190, 270 and 480kDa) of ankG? From the images of the AIS and noR it appears that the large forms (270 and 480 kDa) are probably tagged with GFP. Did the authors check for puncta along dendrites and in dendritic spines, which are thought to be formed by the small (190 kDa) isoform? Perhaps a western blot to show that Ank-G-GFP labels all isoforms would be a useful addition to this study.</p>

<p>We believe that AnkG-GFP indeed labels the major Ank3 transcripts in the brain, including the 190, 270, and 480 kDa isoforms, based both on known mRNA exon usage and on Western blot analysis (data not shown). Thus, theoretically, this model would be useful for examining the localization of 190 kD ankyrin-G to dendritic spines. While we attempted to examine this in sections from tissue, it was difficult to separate punctate ankyrinG-GFP labeling from the background. However, these experiments were done in genetic crosses that would label most pyramidal neurons in a given area (i.e. CaMKIIa-Cre). Given the Cre-dependence of this model, future experiments could utilize sparse transduction with a Cre virus that also fills neurons with soluble fluorophores (i.e. mCherry or tdTomato) to mark isolated neurons and identify dendritic spines, as exemplified in Fig. 2D. This would allow examination of subcellular localization of ankyrin-G within single pyramidal cells before and after induction of synaptic plasticity.</p>

<p>R1-02 - In Figure 2, does all the native Ank-G get replaced by Ank-G-GFP? In Fig. 2E the GFP signal along the AIS of CamKII +ve neurons does not appear to be very homogeneous compared to the BIV-spectrin label. Have the authors carried out more experiments like those in 2F, using antibodies that label AnkG together with the GFP fluorescence of the labeled AnkG? It would also be informative to know if, as one might expect, the total levels of ankG-GFP correlate with the levels of ankG at the AIS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this is an important point and conducted additional experiments to address your concerns. Of course, we cannot exclude that some unmodified ankyrin-G remains in the AIS or other structures. We expect the turnover of the protein to be rather slow, and native ankyrin-G likely remains to some degree. However, our quantification demonstrates that the ankyrin-G-GFP labeling is sufficiently homogeneous to accurately represent AIS size, indicating proportional levels of GFP to native ankyrin-G. Animals were crossed with a CaMKIIa-Cre driver line and ex vivo slices were imaged live and after immunolabeling. We found a strong correlation between live ankyrin-G-GFP (patch clamp chamber), postfix ankyrin-G-GFP, postfix ankyrin-G, and βIV-spectrin immunosignals of the same AIS. Furthermore, our measurements of AIS length using the intrinsic GFP signal in combination with ankyrin-G, or βIV-spectrin antibodies showed significant overlap (see R103). We now included these graphs as supplemental Fig. S2 in the manuscript (pp. 8-9, ll. 173-177).</p>

<p>R1-03 - Does the length and position of the AIS change when Ank-G is tagged with GFP? This seems like important information that is needed to make sure that there are no structural differences in AIS morphology when compared to native Ank-G.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very important point. We used the βIV-spectrin signal to compare the length of AIS with and without GFP modification in acute slices after patch-clamp recordings (N= 3 animals, 27 GFP+ and 48 GFP- AIS). As secondary control, we plotted the measurements of 160 AIS from a Thy1-GFP mouse line (N = 3 animals, 160 AIS). We found no significant difference in the length and position of the βIV-spectrin signal between GFP positive and negative AIS (p=0.3364 unpaired t-test, p=0.6138 non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, respectively). We have now included this analysis as Supplemental Fig. S2A in the manuscript (pp. 8-9, ll. 173-177).</p>

<p>R1-04 - How was node length measured in Figure 3? Was this done using the endogenous ank-G signal? In this figure, it would be informative to also quantify the number of noRs with a Nav1.6 stain. Perhaps even check if there are correlations between Ank-G-GFP and Nav1.6 levels. In this figure, it appears that comparisons are carried out between Ank-G-GFP +ve and -ve neurons in the same cryosections, from Ank-G-GFP mice crossed with CamKIIa-Cre. I worry that this may not be comparing the same types of axons. What cells do the CamKIIa -ve axons belong to? Also, the labels on the bar graph are confusing - perhaps GFP+ve and GFP-ve would be clearer?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an important point. We forgot to declare the signal which was used to measure node length in the manuscript. We have corrected this error and clearly state now in the Fig.3C legend that we used the ankyrin-G signal to quantify node length. Furthermore, using CaMKIIa-Cre mediated expression triggers ankyrin-G-GFP only in a genetically defined subset of neurons. Nodes that do not belong to this subgroup might very well have different node properties. Yet, we cannot assign potential differences in node length to the presence or absence of the GFP label, since we do not have an independent labeling technique for the very same subset of neurons. Since node lengths were similar and showed the same spread of lengths in our sample (Fig. 3C), we assume that the GFP length does probably not affect node length to a significant degree. We have now discussed this limitation in the result (p. 7, ll. 159-165) and method section (p. 30, ll. 644-645) and provide Supplementary Fig. S1 for more clarity. As suggested by the reviewer, we have measured mean fluorescence intensities between 91 GFP+ and 141 GFP- nodes using automated image processing in Imaris. The nodes were again defined by the ankyrin-G signal. We found no difference in length and ellipticity between the groups. We repeated this analysis and compared fluorescence intensities of Nav1.6 and ankyrin-G antibodies and again found no statistical differences between both groups. As suggested by the reviewer, we investigated whether ankyrin-G-GFP interferes with the fluorescence intensities of sodium channels (Nav1.6) and ankyrin-G in general. While the GFP signal showed a strong correlation with ankyrin-G, we found no interdependence with the Nav1.6 signal, indicating that the GFP label does not interfere with the general molecular composition of the nodes. We included these new analyses in Supplemental Fig. S1 (p. 7, ll. 159-165).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>R1-05 - In Figure 4 it would also be important to show the distribution of AIS molecules along the AIS, compared to the GFP signal, to establish whether this spatial arrangement of AIS-specific molecules remains intact. For example, Nav1.6 has been described as a more distally-located channel. As the authors point out, the example in A appears to show precisely this feature, but there is no quantification. The same applies to Kv1.2. This would also allow the authors to provide some quantification across multiple AISs, rather than just example images.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that quantifying and comparing AIS-associated proteins would be informative. We measured the intensity profiles of Nav1.6 and Kv2.1 in neighboring AIS and found no preferences for either end of the AIS, neither of GFP-positive nor GFP-negative AIS. We want to note that not all neurons exhibit a distal localization of Nav1.6 and hypothesize that our samples (neocortex layer II) also fall into this group. We included this new graph as Supplemental Fig. S2D and E in the manuscript (p. 9, ll. 180-184).</p>

<p>R1-08 - In Figure 4, did the +Cre condition result in all cells showing a GFP-labelled AIS? If not, were the autocorrelations for +Cre-treated neurons done specifically on cells that expressed AnkG-GFP?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We assume the reviewer refers to the autocorrelation in Figure 6. In this in vitro paradigm, we used virus-induced Cre expression which triggered ankyrin-G-GFP in almost all neurons. The orange boxplots describe the autocorrelation of all ankyrin-G, using a C-terminal antibody as in Fig.6C, but in neurons that also express ankyrin-G-GFP. The green samples use the GFP signal of ankyrin-GFP. We clarified this in the graph and legend of Fig. 6C (pages 14-15).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>R1-09 - As mentioned above in Figure 3, the comparisons in Figure 5 (GFP +ve and -ve neurons) may not be comparing like-for-like neurons. I imagine that many of the CamKII+ve cells in the cortex and hippocampus will be GABAergic interneurons, whereas presumably all of the CamKII+ve neurons will be pyramidal cells. Have the authors made sure that they are comparing across the same cell types? The fact that the number of axo-axonic synapses is similar across the two populations (Fig. 5B) does suggest that similar neuron types (presumably pyramidal cells) were compared in the hippocampus, but some other way of making sure would be a nice addition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the grey and green boxes are not sampled from the same subset of neurons, since only CaMKIIa-positive principal cells will express ankyrin-G-GFP. However, we are confident that the selected AIS belong to pyramidal neurons in both cases. Principal neurons can be well distinguished from interneurons not only by the size, shape, and position of their somas but also by the length and thickness of their AIS. We have performed previous studies on the AIS of interneurons using genetic GAD and parvalbumin markers. Thus, we are confident that the plots in 5A and 5B are sampled from pyramidal neurons, though certainly from genetically different subsets. We now highlight and discuss this limitation in the result section (p. 11, ll. 215-217) and modified the graph in Fig. 5A and 5B for clarity.</p>

<p>R1-10 - In Figure 6, what was the promoter for the DCre and Cre+ lentivirus? Was this also driven by CamKIIa? In culture it is not always easy to be sure of neuronal identity - did the authors try to bias their analysis to specific neuronal types?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, the nature of the promotor was not stated in the legend or method section, which we now corrected. We used lentiviral FUW-nGFP-Cre and FUW-nGFP-ΔCre constructs to trigger ankyrin-G-GFP expression. Both viruses use the CMV (Cytomegalovirus) promoter, which drives constitutively high levels of gene expression in a wide range of cell types, including neuronal cells. The majority of neurons in dissociated hippocampal cultures are excitatory, especially larger cells with larger AIS, which were preferably used in the analysis. Thus, we cannot claim that AIS nanostructure is intact in cultured interneurons, but this is also true for in vivo conditions in general. Since mice did not show any obvious behavioral phenotypes, we are positive that interneuron functionality is preserved. We also note that the parallel expression of nuclear GFP in the infected neurons was undesired, but did not impact STED imaging due to that technique’s high resolution.</p>

<p>R1-11 - The ability to visualize the plasticity of the AIS in real-time is an important advance in the field. The loss of proximal Ank-G-GFP signal upon local application of 15 mM KCl is particularly interesting. The fact that neighboring AISs are not affected is surprising - do the authors know how local their KCl application was? Also, although the neighboring AISs are a nice control, the one control lacking here is the local application of normal solution (preferably 15 mM NaCl to account for osmolarity changes) to make sure that this does not affect the properties of the AIS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used KCl puffs in previous, unrelated experiments where we observed that only cells directly in front of the pipette are visibly depolarized by an acute KCl puff (measured by patch-clamp). Due to technical limitations, patched and live imaged neurons were generally in the first 2-5 cell layers of the brain slice, which is well perfused by the constant flow of oxygenated ACSF. KCl is thus quickly diluted and carried away. We have visualized the concentration gradients via puff application by puffing the fluorescent marker fluorescein in the same recording condition. The cone of fluorescence was only visible in front of the pipette and vanished in less than a second post-pressure application. To verify that it is indeed KCl and not the mechanical stress that lead to the loss of proximal Ank-G-GFP, one would indeed need an ACSF puff control, which we did for other studies. However, this is not the point we wanted to make. Instead of studying live single-cell AIS plasticity, we want to demonstrate that such investigations are generally possible using the ankyrin-G-GFP line.</p>

<p>R2-02 - What is the rationale of doing Ank-G co-labelling in the case of Ank-G-GFP expression, rather than Pan-Nav staining for example? The co-staining with Nav1.6 antibody, when present, is however convincing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used the co-labeling to emphasize that the ankyrin-G-GFP construct allows reliable investigation of the whole AIS. This is why we wanted to demonstrate that the ankyrin-G-GFP signal overlaps with other AIS markers, as well as all ankyrin-G in general (including potentially remaining native and unlabeled ankyrin-G). This was also a point raised by Reviewer 1, which is why we provided some additional graphs (see response R1-02). However, we agree that staining with another independent marker, such as Nav1.6 or βIVspectrin was necessary.</p>

<p>R2-03 - Figure 2D and F: what is the rationale for not using betaIV-Spectrin staining as in the other panels of this figure? Furthermore, could betaIV-Spectrin localization be affected by Ank-GGFP expression, as betaIV-Spectrin is known to depend on Ank-G for its AIS targeting? Are there any other AIS markers, which localization is known to be independent of Ank-G, that could have been used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have compiled this figure from a multitude of different experimental setups from different labs to showcase the reliability and robustness of the ankyrin-G-GFP label. This is why the type of staining is not consistent among panels. However, we provide some quantification on the possible impact of ankyrin-G-GFP expression on the βIV-spectrin signal and the composition of the AIS in general. The STED image verifies that the basic subcellular arrangement of the cytoskeleton, including βIV-spectrin, remains intact (Fig. 6). Most AIS markers are at least in some way dependent on ankyrin-G expression, but FGF14 and neurofascin may be the most independent candidates (Fig. 4).</p>

<p>This is an important issue. We did not perform any electrophysiological recordings in OTCs in the course of this study. Panel E uses acute hippocampal slices like in Fig. 7. We have performed patch-clamp experiments up to DIV 10 for an unrelated study (see graph for action potential firing, Author response image 2). There are not many studies performing electrophysiology in slice cultures due to the formation of a glial scar on top of the slices. However, multielectrode array (MEA) recordings demonstrated that hippocampal organotypic slice cultures remain viable and show electric activity past DIV 20 (though with decreased viability and activity).
