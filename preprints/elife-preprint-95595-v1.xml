<title>Abstract</title><p>In response to an ever-increasing demand of new small molecules therapeutics, numerous chemical and genetic tools have been developed to interrogate compound mechanism of action. Owing to its ability to characterize compound-dependent changes in thermal stability, the proteome-wide thermal shift assay has emerged as a powerful tool in this arsenal. The most recent iterations have drastically improved the overall efficiency of these assays, providing an opportunity to screen compounds at a previously unprecedented rate. Taking advantage of this advance, we quantified 1.498 million thermal stability measurements in response to multiple classes of therapeutic and tool compounds (96 compounds in living cells and 70 compounds in lysates). When interrogating the dataset as a whole, approximately 80% of compounds (with quantifiable targets) caused a significant change in the thermal stability of an annotated target. There was also a wealth of evidence portending off-target engagement despite the extensive use of the compounds in the laboratory and/or clinic. Finally, the combined application of cell- and lysate-based assays, aided in the classification of primary (direct ligand binding) and secondary (indirect) changes in thermal stability. Overall, this study highlights the value of these assays in the drug development process by affording an unbiased and reliable assessment of compound mechanism of action.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A critical aspect of any drug development effort is the ability to define the mechanism of action. Most small molecule therapeutics function by engaging a protein (target) through a direct physical interaction, thereby inhibiting or activating a specific target in order to modulate enzymatic activity, cell signaling pathways, or gene expression. Because of its unique ability to probe cell function on a proteome-wide scale, mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a powerful tool for interrogating compound mechanism of action by aiding in the validation of known targets and the identification of new targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Moellering and Cravatt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Daub, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schürmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Frantzi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Robers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kuljanin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Meissner et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to traditional proteomic approaches that profile protein expression and post-translational modifications (PTMs), the mass spectrometer has also become indispensable for unbiased assessments of compound target engagement and, by extension, mechanism of action. This has led to the development of numerous MS-based methods to screen the proteome for evidence of ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Molina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jafari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Savitski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gaetani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ball et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Van Vranken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beusch et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>All proteins have a characteristic melting temperature, and this physical property can be influenced by numerous factors (ligand-binding, protein-protein interactions, and PTMs), which can make a given protein more or less resistant to thermal denaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Koshland, 1958</xref>). Classically, the thermal shift assay was used to study a single protein of interest, however, by coupling the traditional thermal shift assay with modern quantitative proteomics and sample multiplexing, it is possible to assess changes in protein thermal stability on a proteome-wide scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Molina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jafari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Savitski et al., 2014</xref>). As such, MS-coupled thermal shift assays have emerged as a powerful tool for studying compound target engagement and mechanism of action.</p>
<p>The cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and thermal proteome profiling (TPP) use tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics to quantify complete melting curves and assign melting temperatures to thousands of proteins, simultaneously, making it possible to screen the proteome for ligand-induced changes in protein thermal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jafari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Molina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Savitski et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, the proteome integral solubility alteration (PISA) assay was proposed to improve the efficiency of the proteome-wide thermal shift assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gaetani et al., 2019</xref>). Rather than building complete melting curves, PISA uses TMT-based quantitative proteomics to estimate, or integrate, the area under a protein melting curve (<xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A</xref>). Instead of TMT labelling the soluble fraction from each individual temperature—as in CETSA and TPP—PISA pools the soluble fractions of multiple samples heated across a thermal gradient such that a single TMT reporter represents an entire integrated melting curve. In the end, any change in protein thermal stability (or a thermal shift) can be quantified as a fold change in the abundance of soluble protein in a compound-treated sample vs. a vehicle-treated control after thermal denaturation and high-speed centrifugation. Therefore, an increase in melting temperature, which one could determine using CETSA or TPP, will lead to an increase in the area under the curve and an increase in the soluble protein abundance relative to controls (positive log2 fold change). Conversely, a decrease in melting temperature will result in a decrease in the area under the curve and a decrease in the soluble protein abundance relative to controls (negative log2 fold change). In the end, the ability to compress entire melting curves into a single TMT channel enables the synchronized interrogation of multiple compounds at multiple concentrations with multiple replicates in one experiment.</p>
<p>Owing to improved scalability, PISA results in an 8-fold theoretical improvement in throughput compared to TPP and CETSA. Therefore, PISA makes it feasible to readily approach large-scale chemical perturbation experiments, such as chemical library screening. With this in mind, we sought to establish an efficient platform for screening chemical libraries for drug-induced changes in protein thermal stability. We selected 96 compounds with known mechanisms of action for PISA screening in live K562 cells and further assayed 70 of the compounds in native lysates. Using these data, we identified evidence of on-target binding, as well as putative examples of off-target engagement. In addition to direct drug binding, we were able to identify secondary changes in protein thermal stability that did not result from direct engagement and, instead, likely stemmed from other factors such as PTMs or macromolecular interactions. Overall, this study serves as a roadmap for the scalable implementation of protein thermal stability quantitation to interrogate compound mechanism of action.</p>

<title>Establishing a workflow for large-scale chemical perturbation screening</title>
<p>To enable large-scale chemical perturbation screening, we first sought to establish a robust workflow for assessing protein thermal stability changes in live K562 cells. In a PISA experiment differential thermal stability (i.e., a change in melting temperature or a thermal shift) is defined as a significant deviation in protein abundance following thermal melting and high-speed centrifugation. Most commonly this is manifested as a log2 fold change comparing a compound treated sample to a vehicle-treated control (<xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A</xref>). The ranges of temperatures used in a PISA experiment can impact the magnitude of the fold-change measurements, with narrower temperature ranges often resulting in larger fold changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2020</xref>). After testing a number of ranges experimentally, we ultimately settled on a temperature range of 48°C-58°C, which encompasses the back half of most protein melting curves in K562 cells (<xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jarzab et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>To highlight the advantage of this window, K562 cells were treated with each of the clinically-available CDK4/6 inhibitors—ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib—or DMSO (10 µM, 30 minutes; Figure 1 – source data 1). Notably, all three compounds and a DMSO control were able to be assayed with four biological replicates in a single TMTPro 16plex experiment, requiring just 24 hours of instrument time. The cells were either heated across a range of 37°C-62°C (to approximate a full melting curve) or 48°C-58°C (thermal window) and any changes in protein thermal stability were assessed by PISA. In cells heated across the full melting curve, CDK4 and CDK6 experienced minimal log2 fold changes, whereas utilizing the narrower range yielded a statistically-significant change in CDK4 and CDK6 abundance following thermal denaturation and centrifugation, which, in a PISA experiment, is consistent with a ligand-induced thermal shift or, more specifically, a thermal stabilization (<xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition to CDK4/6, several other kinases experienced a significant change in thermal stability in response to treatment with each compound (<xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1D-G</xref>). In fact, each of the three CDK4/6 inhibitors appear to engage a unique set of kinases, which might contribute to their disparate clinical and molecular phenotypes (<xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hafner et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, there was a thermal destabilization (negative log2 fold change) of RB1, a well-established phosphorylation target of CDK4/6 (<xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Narasimha et al., 2014</xref>). The simplest explanation of this shift is that inhibition of CDK4/6 prevents phosphorylation of RB1 thereby inducing a change in its thermal stability.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>A large-scale chemical perturbation screen in K562 cells</title>
<p>We next sought to execute a large-scale chemical screen in live K562 cells. To that end, we curated a custom chemical library comprised of 96 commonly used cancer drugs and tool compounds. Each compound selected for the library had at least one well-annotated target and a known mechanism of action (Table 1). Of these 96 compounds, 70 targeted protein kinases, while the remaining 26 compounds targeted other classes of proteins including histone deacetylases (HDACs), lysine demethylases, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), and others (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The library also contained multiple compounds targeting certain proteins— eight HDAC inhibitors, four aurora kinase inhibitors, and six BRAF inhibitors, etc. To initiate the screen, K562 cells were treated with each compound in biological duplicate at 10 µM for 30 minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The live cells were heated across a thermal gradient (48°C-58°C) and any changes in protein thermal stability were assessed using PISA (<xref rid="fig1-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2</xref>). This resulted in a total of 256 samples, which were arranged into 16 TMTpro 16-plex experiments, which required a minimum of 384 hours of instrument time (<xref rid="fig1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In total, we quantified approximately 6,800 proteins per treatment for a total of 871,120 drug-protein thermal stability measurements (<xref rid="fig1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3B,C</xref> and Figure 1 – source data 2). Compared to the full dataset, annotated targets of the library compounds had significantly different thermal stability compared to non-targets (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p=3.56×10<sup>-17</sup>). To define high-confidence thermal stability changes, we developed an empirically derived framework (see Methods; <xref rid="fig1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3D</xref>). Briefly, we determined the log2 fold change of each compound treatment in reference to the vehicle-treated control and then quantified the trimmed standard deviation of all stability measurements for a given protein across all treatments. In order to be considered a hit, the log2 fold change needed to be 3.5 standard deviations from the mean and have an absolute value greater than or equal to 0.2 (|log2<italic>Cmpd/DMSO</italic>|&gt;0.2, |nSD|&gt;3.5; <xref rid="fig1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3D-G</xref>). The fold change filtering removed background proteins while the per protein standard deviation filtering removed proteins that were observed to engage in large numbers of non-specific interactions, such as the kinase GAK (Figure 1 – source data 2). From the 871,120 total protein thermal stability measurements, filtering the data resulted in 3,156 putative hits (|log2<italic>Cmpd/DMSO</italic>|&gt;0.2, |nSD|&gt;3.5; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Upon assembling compound-centric thermal stability profiles, known compound targets could be easily resolved. For example, in cells treated with OTS167, the primary target, MELK, had one of the largest negative log2 fold changes (log2<italic>Cmpd/DMSO</italic>: −0.840; nSD: −5.688), which is consistent with a thermal destabilization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition to its intended target, OTS167 also induced consistent protein thermal stability changes in other kinases (WEE1, PRKD3, CDK11B, AURKA, and others). These findings are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that the mechanism of action for OTS167 is in part driven by off-target protein engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Giuliano et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, treatment with GSK-LSD1 caused a marked thermal stabilization of its primary target—the lysine demethylase, KDM1A (log2<italic>Cmpd/DMSO</italic>: 1.726; nSD: 26.825; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition to the primary target, GSK-LSD1 also stabilized several proteins known to form a complex with KDM1A, including GSE1 and RCOR1/3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, we observed disparities in how different molecules targeting the same protein impact the target. The library contained two compounds known to target AKT1—MK-2206, an allosteric inhibitor and CCT128930, an ATP- competitive inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amiran et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hirai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yap et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, engagement of the allosteric ligand, MK-2206, induced a large change in AKT1 thermal stability, while the ATP-competitive inhibitor appeared to have no effect (<xref rid="fig1-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 4A,B</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond the known targets, these data define a set of high-confidence ligand-induced thermal stability changes for each of the 96 compounds assayed in this screen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). OTS167 caused a significant change in the thermal stability of 154 proteins, including other protein kinases, which likely stem from off-target engagement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,D</xref>). GSK-LSD1 treatment, on the other hand, resulted in only ten significant changes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,D</xref>). While OTS167 was among the most active compounds in the screen (as defined by total filtered changes), treatment with the PLK1 inhibitor volasertib resulted in the most thermal stability changes (435, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). While there were several other compounds that caused &gt;100 changes in thermal stability (ER-27319, BS-181, SGI-1776, etc.), the median number of thermally stabilized or destabilization proteins per compound was 14.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Our screening library contained two dual PLK1/BRD4 inhibitors—volasertib and BI 2536—which have similar chemical structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Appropriately, the thermal stability profiles that resulted from treatment with each compound correlated well (rspearman = 0.49, p &lt; 1.0×10<sup>-15</sup>), highlighted by consistent changes in the thermal stability of PLK1, BRD4, and the proteome in general (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition to these dual PLK1/BRD4 inhibitors, the library also contained two compounds—JQ-1 and CPI-203—which target BRD4, but not PLK1. While the thermal stability profiles of the dual PLK1/BRD4 inhibitors were correlated, this was not the case for volasertib and JQ-1. Indeed, there was clear evidence that JQ-1 could engage BRD4 but not PLK1 however, there was little overall correlation, suggesting that the observed volasertib-dependent changes are largely PLK1-depepndent (<xref rid="fig1-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to determine if the set of high-confidence thermal stability alterations could provide insights related to compound mechanism of action. PF-3758309 is designated as a PAK4 inhibitor. Including PAK4, treatment with this inhibitor caused a total of 102 proteins to undergo a significant change in protein thermal stability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Expectedly, this list included a number of protein kinases including MELK, TBK1, WEE1, and others (<xref rid="fig1-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 4D</xref>). Unexpectedly, there was also a significant enrichment of spliceosome subunits among these proteins (<xref rid="fig1-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 4D</xref>). These changes could stem from upstream inhibition of a kinase that regulates splicing and that the mechanism of action of this compound might, at least, in part, works through an alteration of this process. This result is consistent with a recent study that identified PF-3758309 as a potent modulator of pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, these data provide further evidence that PF-3758309 is a promiscuous kinase inhibitor capable of impacting the assembly and/or activity of the spliceosome.</p>

<title>A protein-centric view of compound-dependent changes in thermal stability</title>
<p>Having established criteria for identifying significant compound-dependent changes in protein thermal stability, we focused on the known targets of the library compounds in order to identify key factors affecting the interpretation of PISA data. In total, we quantified at least one known target for 79 of the 96 compounds assayed in the primary screen (84%) and found that 56 (71%) of these compounds induced a thermal shift of an annotated target (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). While compound treatment more commonly resulted in a thermal stabilization of known targets (positive log2 fold change), we also observed a number of examples in which inhibitor binding stimulated a thermal destabilization (negative log2 fold change). Consistent thermal stabilization was observed for proteins including BRD4, HDAC1, and AURKA. Conversely, compound engagement by PLK1 resulted in a consistent thermal destabilization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, both positive and negative log2 fold changes represent evidence of target engagement and specific proteins are consistently stabilized or destabilized in response to inhibitor binding.</p>

<p>Next, we characterized the magnitude of thermal stability changes that we measured for known targets. Having treated cells with each compound at 10 µM, we assumed that each target was fully saturated with a given compound. Therefore, the measurements likely reflect the maximal ligand-induced thermal stability changes for each target. We observed a large range of thermal stability measurements for known compound-target pairs, from a four-fold reduction in protein stability to a four-fold increase in protein stability upon compound engagement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We also observed many proteins with small (15%) but consistent stabilization following compound treatment. p38α-targeting compounds ralimetinib and doramapimod caused a large apparent increase in p38α thermal stability (log2<italic>Cmpd/DMSO</italic> = 1.52 and 1.94, respectively), while compounds targeting PI3K (pictilisib, duvesilib, and IC-87114), on the other hand, generated smaller thermal stability changes (log2<italic>Cmpd/DMSO</italic> = 0.258, 0.319, and 0.213, respectively; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In all cases, each of these measurements surpassed the nSD cutoff of 3.5 for each particular target. Taken at face value, one might conclude that the greater thermal stability effect that doramapimod exerts on p38α is more meaningful than the much smaller change that pictilisib exerts on PIK3CB, however, this is not necessarily true as both compounds can engage their targets at nanomolar concentrations. Instead, we posit that maximum ligand-induced change in thermal stability is target-specific. Therefore, a small thermal stability change for one protein (PIK3CB, log2<italic>Cmpd/DMSO</italic> ≥ 0.2), might be just as meaningful as a large change for another (p38α, log2<italic>Cmpd/DMSO</italic> ≥ 2).</p>

<title>Using the cell-based screening data to identify off-target compound engagement</title>
<p>Having defined a set of high-confidence thermal stability changes for each compound, we next looked for potential examples of off-target engagement. In addition to volasertib and BI 2536 (PLK1/BRD inhibitors), several other compounds from the screen also thermally destabilized PLK1 to a similar extent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These included two promiscuous kinase inhibitors—OTS167 and PF-3758309. In addition to these compounds, two other ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors also impacted the thermal stability of PLK1—NVP-TAE-226, a FAK inhibitor and palbociclib, one of the CDK4/6 inhibitors used to establish our workflow. Because these two compounds induced a change in thermal stability to a similar magnitude as BI 2536 and volasertib, we hypothesized that these molecules might bind the active site and inhibit PLK1.</p>
<p>To further explore the impact of NVP-TAE-226 and palbociclib on PLK1 thermal stability, we treated K562 cells with increasing concentrations of BI 2536, NVP-TAE-226, and palbociclib, ranging from 100 nM to 10 µM and performed cell-based PISA profiling to quantify the changes in thermal stability that occurred at each inhibitor concentration (Figure 2 – source data 1 and source data 2). Ideally, this would provide a relative assessment of the ability of each molecule to engage (and inhibit) PLK1. Appropriately, BI 2536 caused a dose-dependent decrease in PLK1 thermal stability down to the lowest dose tested (100 nM; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1C</xref>). Treatment with palbociclib and NVP-TAE-226 also caused a dose-dependent decrease in PLK1 thermal stability, however, each of these compounds appeared to impact PLK1 thermal stability to a lesser extent than BI 2536. In fact, 100 nM BI 2536 treatment impacted PLK1 thermal stability to the same degree as 10 µM treatments with palbociclib and NVP-TAE-226 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we synchronized HCT116 cells in G2/M phase to test the ability of each compound to directly inhibit PLK1 in a cell-based assay. During this phase of the cell cycle, PLK1 is active and known to phosphorylate TCTP (at serine 46), a protein involved in microtubule stabilization (Ulise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Cucchi et al., 2010</xref>). Following synchronization, these cells were treated with increasing concentrations of each compound and phosphorylation of TCTP at S46 was assayed to read out PLK1 activity. BI 2536 completely abolished PLK1- dependent phosphorylation of TCTP at all tested doses. Palbociclib and NVP-TAE-226 also inhibited TCTP phosphorylation however, these compounds were much less potent than BI 2536 and were only able to inhibit PLK1 at doses between 1 µM and 10 µM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, these results closely mirror the PISA data, providing further evidence that proteomic thermal stability measurements accurately recapitulate target engagement. Therefore, palbociclib and NVP-TAE-226 appear to be weak inhibitors of PLK1, which is consistent with previous studies that suggested these compounds as off-target inhibitors of this kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hafner et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the PISA data, palbociclib was able to engage both CDK4/6 and PLK1, while BI 2536 was only able to engage PLK1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). This is despite the fact that both compounds have a similar chemical structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). In order to further interrogate this disparity, we modeled palbociclib and BI 2536 into co-crystal structures of PLK1 (PDB: 2rku) and CDK6 (PDB: 5l2i) with their ‘specific’ inhibitors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H,I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kothe et al., 2007</xref>). When we overlaid BI 2536 in the active site of CDK6, we observed three points of steric clashing with the protein density of the CDK6 active site. These findings were consistent with the lack of thermal stabilization of CDK4/6 when cells were treated with BI 2536. From overlaid projections of palbociclib and BI 2536 in PLK1, we did not observe steric interference in binding suggesting that both of these inhibitors could readily bind to the active site of PLK1. These data are again consistent with our observed thermal destabilization of PLK1 when cells were treated with either BI 2536 or palbociclib.</p>

<title>PISA screening in crude cell extracts</title>
<p>Thus far we have focused exclusively on protein thermal stability in living cells, but PISA can also be used to screen for changes in cell lysates or crude extracts. Having already assembled one of the largest drug-based thermal denaturation studies in cells, we wanted to further profile a subset of these compounds in native extracts. We selected 70 compounds from the cell-based screen for further interrogation in native extracts. For this screen, we prepared crude extracts by dounce homogenizing K562 cells in PBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>). The crude extracts were treated with each of the 70 compounds in biological duplicate at 10 µM for 30 minutes and any changes in thermal stability were determined using PISA. In total, the 70 compounds and DMSO controls generated a total of 160 samples, which were arrayed across 10 TMT 16-plex experiments and quantified using approximately 240 hours of instrument time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>We quantified an average of 7,840 proteins per treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1B</xref>), which resulted in a total of 627,176 thermal stability measurements from all K562 lysate-based experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – source data 2). After applying the same filters used in the cell-based screen, our dataset consisted of 2,176 protein thermal stability changes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1C</xref>). Similar to the cell-based studies, the known targets of library compounds frequently experienced a significant change in thermal stability (<xref rid="fig3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1C-G</xref>). For example, treatment of K562 lysates with MK-2206 and GSK-LSD1 stabilized AKT1/2 and KDM1A, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition to AKT1/2, MK-2206 also stabilized additional kinases, including subunits of RPS6K and PI3K, which highlights the ability of this approach to find putative off-target engagements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Finally, we observed a GSK- LSD1-dependent stabilization of several KDM1 binding partners, which echoes the similar observation made in cell-based experiments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Since changes in thermal stability in lysate-based experiments stem almost exclusively from direct ligand binding events, we expected to observe fewer overall stability changes in this setting compared to cell-based experiments. As expected, the lysate-based screen (2,176) yielded fewer significant changes than the cell-based screen (3,156). It is also important to note that three compounds (vorinostat, Y-33075, and GSK-1070916) contribute 1,200 (55%) of all significant changes in the lysate-based screen. It is highly unlikely that these three molecules actively engage so many proteins and, therefore, the 2,176 hits in the lysate-based screen were likely affected in part by artefactual effects of lysate-based analyses. Overall, the median number of protein thermal stability changes in lysates was 66% of those observed in cells, with 9.5 proteins in lysate-based experiments compared to 14.5 in cell-based experiments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>We directly compared the overall ability of the cell- and lysate-based approaches to identify the known target(s) of each compound. In the cell-based screen, we assayed 96 molecules and quantified known targets of 79 of these inhibitors. Of the 70 molecules assayed in K562 lysates, we quantified protein targets for 64 (91%) of these molecules and found that 45 (70%) of these compounds induced a change in an annotated target (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E,F</xref>). In each case we observed a thermal stability change of a known target for about 70% of the inhibitors we screened (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). However, when we combined the data from the two approaches, we were able to quantify targets for 59 of the 69 compounds that were assayed in both settings and were able to observe a significant change in thermal stability for 82% of these compounds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Therefore, combining the two approaches allows for greater coverage of the cellular proteome and provides a better chance of observing the protein target for a compound of interest.</p>

<title>Cell- and lysate-based PISA are complimentary approaches to determine compound engagement</title>
<p>Having re-screened dozens of compounds in lysate-based experiments, we wanted to assess the complementarity of these approaches. We focused on the known compound targets quantified in both cell- and lysate-based experiments and compared the thermal stability changes measured using each approach (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Encouragingly, we observed compounds that impacted the thermal stability of their known targets in both cell- and lysate-based approaches. These include GSK-1070916 and MK-2206, which stabilized AURKA and AKT1, respectively, in both cell- and lysate-based experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Conversely, we observed compounds that failed to impact the thermal stability of their target proteins in either the cell-based or lysate-based experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1A</xref>).

<p>We note that the magnitudes of the thermal stability changes varied between the cell- and lysate-based approaches. Yet, compounds that stabilized their annotated protein targets in cells also tended to stabilize their targets in lysates with one notable exception. Sotrastaurin induces a thermal stabilization of its target, PRKCA, in lysates (log2<italic>Cmpd/DMSO</italic> = 0.924), but a thermal destabilization in cells (log2<italic>Cmpd/DMSO</italic> = −0.502; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>). These data suggest that the thermal destabilization observed in cell-based experiments might stem from a complex biophysical rearrangement.</p>
<p>While many compounds significantly altered their known targets using both approaches, there were some compounds that preferentially altered the thermal stability of known targets in one experimental setting but not the other (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). For example, there were four compounds known to target BRD4 (JQ-1, CPI-203, BI 2536, and volasertib) that were assayed in both cell- and lysate-based experiments. Treatment of cells with any of these four inhibitors resulted in a log2<italic>Cmpd/DMSO</italic> ∼ 2, while the lysate-based assays resulted in smaller thermal stability changes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1A</xref>). Conversely, multiple inhibitors caused a significant shift in BRAF thermal stability in lysates (AZ 628, PLX-4720, L-779450) but did not impact BRAF thermal stability in cell-based assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, certain protein targets are more prone to thermal stability changes in one experimental setting compared to the other.</p>

<title>Combining cell- and lysate-based data to discover off-target engagement</title>
<p>Having demonstrated the complementarity of the cell- and lysate-based approaches, we sought to explore the corroborative value of integrating these data. We reasoned that any unexpected ligand-induced changes in thermal stability that were shared between the two approaches would provide strong evidence of compound engagement. Despite an absence in the library of compounds designated as RIPK1 kinase inhibitors, there were four compounds that significantly stabilized RIPK1 in cells and lysates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although three of the compounds—GSK-2656167, GSK-2606414, and tozasertib—had previously been shown to be off-target inhibitors of RIPK, AZD-5438, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, had never been attributed such activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Byth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Martens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rojas-Rivera et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, this compound was capable of stabilizing RIPK1 to a similar extent as the other three known RIPK1 off-target inhibitors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to gain a sense of the potency of AZD-5438 (and the other molecules), we assayed these compounds alongside necrostatin-2, a bona fide RIPK1 inhibitor, in HCT116 lysates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> – source data 1). Treatment with necrostatin-2 or GSK-2606414 resulted in a similar thermal stability change for RIPK1, that was far greater than both tozasertib and AZD-5438 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1C-F</xref>). Treatment of HCT116 cells with TNFα, a Smad mimetic, and a pan-caspase inhibitor (zVAD) will lead to an initiation of necroptosis and, importantly, autophosphorylation of S116 by RIPK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Laurien et al., 2020</xref>). While each of our putative RIPK1 inhibitors was capable of inhibiting this autophosphorylation, AZD-5438 and tozasertib were less potent than necrostatin-2 and GSK-2606414 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Therefore, the thermal stability measurements made in our lysate-based PISA experiment correlated with compound potency. This demonstrates that the combination of cell- and lysate-based data can be employed to identify instances of off-target engagement, even for weak inhibitors.</p>
<p>In addition to compound potency, the combined cell and lysate data provided valuable information regarding compound specificity. While it is difficult to separate necrostatin-2 and GSK-2606414 based on potency, necrostatin-2 had a greater apparent specificity with respect to RIPK1 engagement. Indeed, necrostatin-2 only impacted the thermal stability of RIPK1 in the lysate-based experiments (<xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1C</xref>). GSK-2606414, on the other hand, engaged other kinases including CSK, LIMK1, and TBK1 (<xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1D</xref>). Finally, AZD- 5438 and tozasertib were less potent and less specific for RIPK1 than necrostatin-2 (<xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1E,F</xref>).</p>

<title>Disparities in cell- and lysate-based data pinpoint secondary changes in protein thermal stability</title>
<p>While the data suggests that cell- and lysate-based PISA are equally valuable in screening the proteome for evidence of target engagement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), cell-based experiments have added potential to identify secondary changes in protein thermal stability that occur independent of direct ligand binding. These changes could occur as a result of changes in interactions with other proteins, ligands, nucleic acids, or the effects of PTMs. Importantly, all of these factors can help to define compound mechanisms of action. This type of change was previously highlighted in the context of the CDK4/6 inhibitors. Indeed, treatment of cells with CDK4/6 inhibitors induced a thermal destabilization of RB1, which we attributed to a change in phosphorylation due to upstream target inhibition (<xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – Figure supplement 1C</xref>). Other CDK inhibitors (AZD-5438 and flavopiridol) also lead to a significant destabilization of RB1. In lysates, on the other hand, when cellular signaling networks are disrupted, RB1 thermal stability was unaffected by these compounds (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This concept is also apparent when comparing the PF-3758309- dependent thermal stability profiles in each experimental setting (<xref rid="fig5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 1A</xref>). Indeed, there is a striking difference in the number of significant changes in cells (102) vs. lysates (21). This disparity is driven by splicesome subunits, which are significantly impacted in cell-based experiments but unaffected in lysates. This supports the interpretation that the apparent thermal destabilization of the spliceosome in cells is the result of secondary changes rather than direct ligand binding.</p>

<p>Exploiting the disparities between cell- and lysate-based data can be a powerful tool in determining compound mechanism of action in the absence of reliable evidence of target engagement. These studies were performed in K562 cells/lysates, a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line that expresses the BCR-ABL fusion. Consistent with previous reports, treatment of K562 cells with BCR-ABL-targeted compounds did not induce any apparent change in the thermal stability their primary target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Molina et al., 2013</xref>). We were, however, able to detect a change in thermal stability for well-known BCR-ABL substrates—most notably CRKL and CRK (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 1B-D</xref>). Importantly, the change in CRKL thermal stability only occurred in cell-based experiments and not in lysates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> – figure supplement 1B,C). These data are consistent with a distal effector of thermal stability. A number of other compounds that largely target tyrosine kinases also caused a significant thermal destabilization of CRKL in K562 cells but not lysates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). We treated K562 cells with a small panel of kinase inhibitors and found that compounds that induce a thermal destabilization of CRKL also inhibit phosphorylation at Y207 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, the change in CRKL thermal stability correlates with a change in phosphorylation and is likely dependent on the inhibition of a primary compound target—such as BCR-ABL—that then inhibits CRKL phosphorylation. These data highlight that protein thermal stability measurements can reveal critical insights into primary and secondary effectors of compound mechanism of action, including kinase-substrate relationships.</p>

<sec id="s2i">
<title>Using secondary changes to identify putative off-target effects</title>
<p>Previously, we demonstrated that the combined cell and lysate data could identify off-target inhibition through direct target engagement. Next, we wanted to determine if secondary effects could be used to determine putative off-target engagement. In addition to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we also observed a strong thermal destabilization of CRKL in response to treatment with the CHEK1 inhibitor AZD-7762 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B,C</xref> and Figure 5 – figure supplement 5B). Importantly, our screen contained two additional inhibitors known to engage CHEK1 (CCT241533 and BML-227), neither of which had any impact on CRKL thermal stability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, the AZD-7762-dependent destabilization of CRKL is unlikely to be related to on-target inhibition of CHEK1 and, instead, likely stems from off-target engagement of other kinases. Consistent with our hypothesis, AZD-7762 induced a change in the thermal stability of many tyrosine kinases in lysate-based experiment including FER, LYN, CSK, and YES1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E,F</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> – figure supplement 5E). These putative interactors were not limited to tyrosine kinases but also included dozens of serine/threonine kinases. Overall, these data illustrate how secondary changes in protein thermal stability can be exploited to identify putative examples of off-target engagement.</p>

<title>Library-scale assays connect consistent thermal stability changes</title>
<p>Binary comparisons of compounds with shared targets such as volasertib and BI 2536 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) revealed consistent thermal stability responses for known targets PLK1 and bromodomain proteins. Next, we set out to determine if small but consistent effects on the proteome due to drug treatment could reveal new information concerning compound engagement of proteins, protein classes, or protein complexes. To address this, we implemented a network-based approach using the correlation of thermal stability changes for each protein. To this end, we mapped the all-by-all correlation of proteins in the cell-based dataset. We filtered the 70,392,100 binary comparisons to include only the correlations in the top ∼5% of absolute magnitude (rspearman &gt; 0.35). Because 70 of the 96 compounds used were kinase inhibitors, we further focused on correlated thermal stability changes within the 396 human kinases we quantified in our dataset (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>We first sought to determine if the network-based approach could reveal consistent thermal stability responses for kinases with conserved sequences or general kinase families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Eid et al., 2017</xref>). Strikingly, for the highly conserved 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinases, we observed highly correlated thermal stability for three members, RPS6KA1, RPS6KA2, and RPS6KA3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). We reasoned that this may be a function of the sequence conservation between these proteins or direct binding interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Huttlin et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2017</xref>). To this end we compared the cell and lysate data. In cells, RPS6KA1, RPS6KA2, and RPS6KA3 were generally destabilized by compound treatment. However, in lysates, these proteins were generally stabilized, even by the same compound that destabilized the proteins in cells, such as NVP-TAE-226. These data were in line with what we observed for sotrastaurin engagement of PRKCA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, within our thermal stability network, we observed PRKCA thermal stability was significantly correlated with PRKCB and PRKCQ (<xref rid="fig6-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p>
<p>Both RPS6K and PRKC subnetworks reveal correlation between kinases of the same kinome group. RPS6K proteins belong to the CAMK kinases, and PRKC proteins belong to the AGC kinases. To explore this within group correlation, we annotated the network of quantified human protein kinases based on their established groupings (AGC, Atypical, CAMK, CK1, CMGC, STE, TK, TKL, Other) along with a set of non-protein kinases (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Within the kinase network, we observed correlated thermal stability changes within and between families of kinases. For example, we observed correlated profiles between isoforms of p38α/MAPK14 (a CMGC kinase) and the MAPKAPK2/3 (CAMK kinases, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C,D</xref>). MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3 were both stabilized with treatment of the p38 kinase inhibitor doramapimod. Indeed, these proteins are known to both act as substrates of p38 and to form complexes in divergent human cancer cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). We further observed interconnected correlation networks within larger kinase groups. The AGC kinases, including AKT1/2 and ROCK1/2 were particularly well correlated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). AKT1 and AKT2 was driven in part by their thermal stability change due to AKT inhibitor MK-2206 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>We reasoned that because protein kinases and non-protein kinases share similar structures and cofactor binding pockets, that non-protein kinases may represent an important class of off-target effectors for our library compounds. Within the correlated thermal stability profile network, we observed strong correlation due to compound-based thermal stability changes within the non-protein kinase group. PIP4K2A, PIP4K2B, and PIP4K2C thermal stabilities were highly correlated in both cells and lysates (<xref rid="fig6-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 1C-E</xref>). For example, the PLK1 inhibitor BI 2536 stabilized all three PIP4K proteins in both cells and lysates. It is worth noting that the magnitude of thermal stability changes for these PIP4K proteins was higher in cells than in lysates consistent with loss of membranes and cellular metabolite concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>). Yet the thermal stability responses in both assays were highly consistent for all three proteins using either approach. We explored the observation of small but consistent changes further and observed significant correlation of the SRPK1, SRPK2, and RIOK2 kinases (<xref rid="fig6-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). In our final datasets, we did not call any of these proteins as hits due to either the large numbers of thermal stability effects (SRPK1, SRPK2) or the small magnitude of their thermal stability changes (RIOK2). However, with correlations of 0.95 and 0.77 for SPRK1-SPRK2 and SPRK1-RIOK2, it is clear that these proteins respond consistently to chemical perturbation suggesting that our initial filters for full PISA datasets may mask some real and important protein-compound engagements.</p>
<p>Finally, we observed a thermal stability correlation between the CMGC kinases CDK16, GSK3A, and GSK3B (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). CDK inhibitors have been reported as active for GSK3 kinases owing to phylogenetic and structural conservation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fischer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Meijer et al., 2003</xref>). In our cell-based approach the inhibitor AZD5438 has dual efficacy for GSK3A and CDK16 and we observed that thermal stability responses for CDK16, GSK3A, and GSK3B were correlated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). This effect was driven in part by annotated inhibitors of CDKs (AZD5438, flavopiridol) or GSKs (AZD5438, LY2090314). Yet, known inhibitors of several kinases stabilized both GSKs and CDK16, including MELK (OTSSP167), JAK (LY2784544), FAK (defactinib), and PAK4 (PF- 3738309), as well as the PARP inhibitor rucaparib (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>). Interestingly, compounds such as VE821 (ATR), A205804 (ICAM-1), CC-401 (JNK), and L-779450 (Raf) exhibited GSK3 specific thermal stabilization in cells. The consistent and differential responses of CDK16 and the GSKs offers clues into compound specificity or the utilization of combined effects in cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The determination of protein-compound engagement and mechanism of action is an essential aspect of the drug development process. Herein we present approachable methods for the implementation and interpretation of proteome-wide thermal shifts assays on at 96-well plate scale. Taking advantage of the 8-fold increase in efficiency afforded by PISA, we catalogued compound-dependent changes in protein thermal stability in response to 96 compounds in living K562 cells and 70 compounds in native extracts. This study resulted in a total of 871,120 thermal stability measurements in living cells and an additional 627,176 measurements in lysates. Exploiting this wealth of data, we were able to find clear evidence of on-target engagement for the majority of compounds tested in both cell- and lysate-based experiments. Furthermore, there were numerous potential examples of off-target engagement. In addition to direct target engagement, there were many secondary changes in protein thermal stability that occurred independent of direct binding. Finally, using an all-by-all analysis of compounds and proteins, we demonstrated how structurally related proteins and protein complexes engage consistently with our library of compounds. Our study serves as an unbiased assessment of the current technology and serves as a comprehensive guide for ongoing work to enable library-scale study of protein-compound and protein-ligand interactions.</p>
<p>One of the most valuable features of the proteome-wide thermal shift assay, including PISA, is the ability to screen compounds in both living cells and native lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Molina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Savitski et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that these two approaches are not redundant, but, rather, provide complimentary data that can be employed to help establish compound mechanism of action. First and foremost, each approach was equally proficient in identifying direct ligand (inhibitor) binding events (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In both cell- and lysate-based PISA experiments, about 70% of all compounds (whose target was quantified) induced a significant change in the thermal stability of its well-established target(s). Furthermore, when the two datasets were combined, that figure increased to over 80%. This is because certain targets, like BRAF, for example were more prone to undergo a change in thermal stability in one experimental setting rather than the other (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, a compound-dependent thermal shift that occurs in a lysate-based experiment is almost certain to stem from direct target engagement. This is because cell signaling pathways and cellular structures are disrupted and diluted. Cell-based studies, on the other hand, have the added potential to identify secondary changes that occur independent of direct engagement. As a result of this dichotomy, we found that, on average, compounds caused a greater number of thermal shifts in cells than lysates. This is further evidenced by the PF-3758309-dependent thermal destabilization of the spliceosome. Finally, we documented a number of examples of phosphorylation-dependent thermal shifts. For example, compounds targeting CDKs tended to impact the thermal stability of RB1. Likewise, compounds targeting tyrosine kinases induced a thermal destabilization of downstream phosphorylation targets like CRKL and CRK. In these examples, an inhibitor engages and inhibits a direct target, which, in turn, prevents the phosphorylation of a downstream target thereby inducing a change in thermal stability.</p>
<p>The idea of area under the curve analysis (PISA) remains a relatively recent modification of the traditional proteome-wide thermal shift assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gaetani et al., 2019</xref>). Using this dataset, we were able to benchmark many aspects of this advance and highlight many important considerations when designing and interpreting these experiments. First, we highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate thermal window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In this study we selected a temperature range of 48°C-58°C, however, it is possible that deploying multiple thermal windows could be a viable strategy for focused interrogation of a small number of high-value compounds. In utilizing thermal windows, the goal is to maximize the potential magnitudes of the final fold change measurements. Still, we observed a large range in the magnitudes of the log2 fold changes that were quantified for known compound targets. This is despite the fact, that we utilized a high treatment dose (10 µM) to maximize the magnitude of the fold change of the primary target. Ultimately, the data seemed to indicate that the maximal PISA fold change is protein-specific. Therefore, a log2 fold change of 2 for one compound-protein pair could be just as meaningful as a log2 fold change of 0.2 for another. In either case though we find that it is essential to optimize the thermal denaturation to ensure maximally useful effect sizes when comparing compounds.</p>
<p>While the primary screen was carried out at fixed dose, the increased throughput of PISA allowed for certain compounds to be assayed at multiple doses in a single experiment. In these instances, there was a clear does-dependent change in thermal stability of primary targets, off-targets, and secondary targets. This not only helped corroborate observations from the primary screen, but also could provide a qualitative assessment of relative compound potency. Specifically, the compounds that most strongly impacted the thermal stability of targets, also acted as the most potent inhibitors. In order to be a candidate for this type of study, a target must have a large maximal thermal shift (magnitude of log2 fold change) because there must be a large enough dynamic range to clearly resolve different doses. From this study, PIK3CB (maximal log2 fold change ∼0.2) would make a bad candidate, while p38α (maximal log2 fold change ∼2.0) would be a good candidate. Importantly, however, it should be possible to tune the thermal window in order to specifically increase the maximal log2 fold change of PI3KCB for dose-dependency studies.</p>
<p>Each of the compounds used in this study have a well-defined target and known mechanism of action. Furthermore, many of the compounds have been used extensively as tool compounds in basic research and as therapeutics in the treatment of multiple cancers. Despite the frequency with which many of these compounds have been used, the data generated in this study suggests that the current mechanistic understanding of many (if not all) of these compounds remains incomplete. For example, we found that the clinically-deployed CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib is capable of directly engaging and inhibiting PLK1. Despite being a weak inhibitor of PLK1, this activity likely still contributes to the mechanism of action of palbociclib and further supports the conclusions of a previous study that implicated palbociclib as a potential inhibitor of PLK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hafner et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, PISA helped reveal that the CHEK1 inhibitor AZD-7762 is, in fact, a highly promiscuous kinase inhibitor that, amongst many other kinases, appears to engage a number of tyrosine kinases and inhibits downstream signaling. While this compound has not been approved for clinical use, it has been used frequently as a tool compound to study the biological impact of CHEK1 inhibition. Additionally, the PLK1 inhibitor BI 2536 engages non-protein kinases such as PIP4K2A/B/C. As inhibition of PIP4K2s has been shown un hematological cells, this potentially suggests the mechanism of dose-limiting hematologic events upon patient treatment with BI 2536 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Frost et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lima et al., 2022</xref>). Overall, these examples, and the dataset as a whole, suggest that proteome-wide thermal shift assays and PISA, specifically, are valuable tools to help resolve the full range of compound activities. Despite this utility, however, it is important to note that these assays, alone, are unlikely to paint a full picture of mechanism of action. Instead, they represent a valuable tool that can be coupled with other MS-based and genetic approaches.</p>
<p>In the end, this study highlights the immense power of thermal stability assays in screening large collections of molecules to help define target engagement and mechanism of action on a proteome-wide scale. While this type of study is ideal for finding the targets of compounds that have been identified in high-throughput screening, they can provide valuable information in almost any context. This includes compounds that seemingly already have a well-defined target. Despite finding many ways to utilize this data, we expect that this dataset contains many interesting observations that can not only be used to better understand specific drugs, but also has the potential to reveal new biology. Moving forward, we hope that this data will serve as a valuable resource for those interested in drug development and the research community at large.</p>

Peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) were adjusted to a 1% false discovery rate (FDR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Elias and Gygi, 2007</xref>) PSM filtering was performed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Huttlin et al., 2010</xref>) while considering the following parameters: XCorr, ΔCn, missed cleavages, peptide length, charge state, and precursor mass accuracy. Each run was filtered separately. Protein-level FDR was subsequently estimated at a data set level. For each protein across all samples, the posterior probabilities reported by the LDA model for each peptide were multiplied to give a protein-level probability estimate. Using the Picked FDR method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Savitski et al., 2015</xref>) proteins were filtered to the target 1% FDR level. TMT reporter ion intensities were measured using a 0.003 Da window around the theoretical <italic>m/z</italic> of each reporter ion. Proteins were quantified by summing reporter ion counts across all matching PSMs. Reporter ion intensities were adjusted to correct for the isotopic impurities of the different TMT reagents according to manufacturer specifications. Peptides were filtered to exclude those with a summed signal-to-noise (SN) &gt; 160 across all TMT channels. To control for different total protein loading within a TMT experiment, the summed protein quantities of each channel were adjusted to be equal within the experiment.</p>

<title>Protein engagement hit calling</title>
<p>Compound engagement was determined based on relative thermal stability to DMSO controls. Owing to the fact that the duplicate analyses used in the initial screen would result in common statistical tests (Welch’s t-test) being underpowered, we used a combination of fold changes compared to DMSO and individual protein variance to call hits. First, relative thermal stability to the DMSO controls was determined. Second, for each protein across all cells or lysate assays, the number of standard deviations away from the mean thermal stability measurement (z-score) for a given protein was quantified. Cutoffs for fold change and z-score were determined to limit the number of hits derived from DMSO-treated samples. We maintained the same cutoffs across both datasets. We considered proteins to engage a compound if both replicates of the compound treatments resulted when the thermal stability fold change compared to DMSO greater than an absolute value of log20.2 and an absolute z-score greater than 3.5. This resulted in a false hit rate (nDMSO-Hits) of 1% across all lysate-based assays and 3% for all cell-based assays.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Follow-up PISA data were analyzed using Perseus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>). Significant changes were determined using a permutation-based FDR with the following settings – FDR – 0.05, S0 – 0.1, and number of randomizations – 250. Individual fold change values were calculated in reference to the mean of the vehicle-treated samples.</p>
<p>Correlation analyses were run in R version 4.3.1 using rank-based Spearman’s rho (rspearman) to minimize the effects of thermal stability-based outliers. The list of binary comparisons was filtered to include the top 5% of highly correlated and anticorrelate protein pairs. Significant pairwise correlations for individual comparisons were determined using the psych package.</p>

K562 cells (N=4) were treated with 10 µM palbociclib (D), ribociclib (E), or abemaciclib (F) for 15 minutes and assayed using PISA. (C) The log2 fold changes for specific proteins are plotted for each treatment using a full melting curve (left) or thermal window (48°C-58°C; right). (D-F). Data is presented as a volcano plot to highlight significant changes in abundance utilizing the thermal window (48°C-58°C).

<p>K562 cells were treated with each of the 96 compounds at 10 µM for 30 minutes. Three compounds and a DMSO control were assayed in duplicate (batch). All 96 compounds and 32 DMSO controls were assayed using thirty-two treatment batches. Following treatment, an equal number of cells were transferred to 10 PCR tubes. The cells were placed in a thermal cycler and heated across a thermal gradient from 48°C- 58°C for 3 minutes. The cells were allowed to cool to room temperature for 5 minutes. An equal volume from each PCR tube was pooled and spun at 300 x g for 3 minutes to pellet cells. Cells were washed one with PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% NP-40, which will dissolve membranes without disrupting heat-induced protein aggregates. The lysates were centrifuged for 90 minutes at 21,000 x g to separate soluble protein from aggregates. An equal volume of each soluble fraction (∼20 µg) was prepared for LC-MS/MS analysis. Two treatment batches were combined for each TMTpro 16-plex. Each soluble fraction was reduced and alkylated. Each sample was precipitated onto SP3 carboxylate-coated beads to facilitate a buffer exchange. Proteomes were eluted off the SP3 beads into digestion buffer and digested with a combination of Lys-C and trypsin. Peptides from each sample were labeled with a unique TMTpro reagent. TMT-labelled peptides were pooled into a single sample, which was desalted using a sep-pak. Dried peptides were resuspended in HPLC buffer A and fractionated by basic reverse-phase HPLC. Twelve to twenty-four fractions were stage-tipped and analyzed on an Orbitrap Eclipse with a FAIMS device enabled (Thermo Fisher). Changes in thermal stability were determined by comparing compound-treated samples to vehicle-treated controls.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an interesting and potentially important paper, which however has some deficiencies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A significant amount of potentially useful data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One issue is a confusion of thermal stability with solubility. While thermal stability of a protein is a thermodynamic parameter that can be described by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, which relates the free energy difference between the folded and unfolded states as a function of temperature, as well as the entropy of unfolding. What is actually measured in PISA is a change in protein solubility, which is an empirical parameter affected by a great many variables, including the presence and concentration of other ambient proteins and other molecules. One might possibly argue that in TPP, where one measures the melting temperature change ∆Tm, thermal stability plays a decisive or at least an important role, but no such assertion can be made in PISA analysis that measures the solubility shift.</p>
<p>Another important issue is that the authors claim to have discovered for the first time a number of effects well described in prior literature, sometimes a decade ago. For instance, they marvel at the differences between the solubility changes observed in lysate versus intact cells, while this difference has been investigated in a number of prior studies. No reference to these studies is given during the relevant discussion.</p>
<p>The validity of statistical analysis raises concern. In fact, no calculation of statistical power is provided. As only two replicates were used in most cases, the statistical power must have been pretty limited. Also, there seems to be an absence of the multiple-hypothesis correction.</p>
<p>Also, the authors forgot that whatever results PISA produces, even at high statistical significance, represent just a prediction that needs to be validated by orthogonal means. In the absolute majority of cases such validation is missing.</p>
<p>Finally, to be a community-useful resource the paper needs to provide the dataset with a user interface so that the users can data-mine on their own.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Using K562 (Leukemia) cells as an experimental model, Van Vracken et. al. use Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) to investigate changes in protein stability after exposing either live cells or crude cell lysates to a library of anti-cancer drugs. This was a large-scale and highly ambitious study, involving thousands of hours of mass spectrometry instrument time. The authors used an innovative combination of TPP together with Proteome Integral Solubility Alternation (PISA) assays to reduce the amount of instrument time needed, without compromising on the amount of data obtained.</p>
<p>The paper is very well written, the relevance of this work is immediately apparent, and the results are well-explained and easy to follow even for a non-expert. The figures are well-presented. The methods appear to be explained in sufficient detail to allow others to reproduce the work.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Using CDK4/6 inhibitors, the authors observe strong changes in protein stability upon exposure to the drug. This is expected and shows their methodology is robust. Further, it adds confidence when the authors report changes in protein stability for drugs whose targets are not well-known. Many of the drugs used in this study - even those whose protein targets are already known - display numerous off-target effects. Although many of these are not rigorously followed up in this current study, the authors rightly highlight this point as a focus for future work.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the off-target effects of several drugs could've been more rigorously investigated, it is clear the authors have already put a tremendous amount of time and effort into this study. The authors have made their entire dataset available to the scientific community - this will be a valuable resource to others working in the fields of cancer biology/drug discovery.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work aims to demonstrate how recent advances in thermal stability assays can be utilised to screen chemical libraries and determine the compound mechanism of action. Focusing on 96 compounds with known mechanisms of action, they use the PISA assay to measure changes in protein stability upon treatment with a high dose (10uM) in live K562 cells and whole cell lysates from K562 or HCT116. They intend this work to showcase a robust workflow that can serve as a roadmap for future studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strength of this study is the combination of live and whole cell lysates experiments. This allows the authors to compare the results from these two approaches to identify novel ligand-induced changes in thermal stability with greater confidence. More usefully, this also enables the authors to separate the primary and secondary effects of the compounds within the live cell assay.</p>
<p>The study also benefits from the number of compounds tested within the same framework, which allows the authors to make direct comparisons between compounds.</p>
<p>These two strengths are combined when they compare CHEK1 inhibitors and suggest that AZD-7762 likely induces secondary destabilisation of CRKL through off-target engagement with tyrosine kinases.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One of the stated benefits of PISA compared to the TPP in the original publication (Gaetani et al 2019) was that the reduced number of samples required allows more replicate experiments to be performed. Despite this, the authors of this study performed only duplicate experiments. They acknowledge this precludes the use of frequentist statistical tests to identify significant changes in protein stability. Instead, they apply an 'empirically derived framework' in which they apply two thresholds to the fold change vs DMSO: absolute z-score (calculated from all compounds for a protein) &gt; 3.5 and absolute log2 fold-change &gt; 0.2. They state that the fold-change threshold was necessary to exclude non-specific interactors. While the thresholds appear relatively stringent, this approach will likely reduce the robustness of their findings in comparison to an experimental design incorporating more replicates. Firstly, the magnitude of the effect size should not be taken as a proxy for the importance of the effect. They acknowledge this and demonstrate it using their data for PIK3CB and p38α inhibitors (Figures 2B-C). They have thus likely missed many small, but biologically relevant changes in thermal stability due to the fold-change threshold. Secondly, this approach relies upon the fold-changes between DMSO and compound for each protein being comparable, despite them being drawn from samples spread across 16 TMT multiplexes. Each multiplex necessitates a separate MS run and the quantification of a distinct set of peptides, from which the protein-level abundances are estimated. Thus, it is unlikely the fold changes for unaffected proteins are drawn from the same distribution, which is an unstated assumption of their thresholding approach. The authors could alleviate the second concern by demonstrating that there is very little or no batch effect across the TMT multiplexes. However, the first concern would remain. The limitations of their approach could have been avoided with more replicates and the use of an appropriate statistical test. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify if any of the missed targets passed the z-score threshold but fell below the fold-change threshold.</p>
<p>The authors use a single, high, concentration of 10uM for all compounds. Given that many of the compounds likely have low nM IC50s, this concentration will often be multiple orders of magnitude above the one at which they inhibit their target. This makes it difficult to assess the relevance of the off-target effects identified to clinical applications of the compounds or biological experiments. The authors acknowledge this and use ranges of concentrations for follow-up studies (e.g. Figure 2E-F). Nonetheless, this weakness is present for the vast bulk of the data presented.</p>
<p>The authors claim that combining cell-based and lysate-based assays increases coverage (Figure 3F) is not supported by their data. The '% targets' presented in Figure 3F have a different denominator for each bar. As it stands, all 49 targets quantified in both assays which have a significant change in thermal stability may be significant in the cell-based assay. If so, the apparent increase in % targets when combining reflects only the subsetting of the data. To alleviate this lack of clarity, the authors could update Figure 3F so that all three bars present the % targets figure for just the 60 compounds present in both assays.</p>
<p>Aims achieved, impact and utility:</p>
<p>The authors have achieved their main aim of presenting a workflow that serves to demonstrate the potential value of this approach. However, by using a single high dose of each compound and failing to adequately replicate their experiments and instead applying heuristic thresholds, they have limited the impact of their findings. Their results will be a useful resource for researchers wishing to explore potential off-target interactions and/or mechanisms of action for these 96 compounds, but are expected to be superseded by more robust datasets in the near future. The most valuable aspect of the study is the demonstration that combining live cell and whole cell lysate PISA assays across multiple related compounds can help to elucidate the mechanisms of action.</p>
