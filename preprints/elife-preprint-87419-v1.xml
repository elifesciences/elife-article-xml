<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Accumulating evidences indicate that acetate is increased in energy stresses such as diabetes mellitus and prolonged starvation. However, it is largely unknown how and where acetate is produced and what is its biological significance. We observed overproduction of acetate in an amount comparable to ketone bodies in patients and mice with diabetes or starvation. Mechanistically, ACOT 12&amp;8 are dramatically upregulated in liver to convert FFA-derived acetyl-CoA to acetate and CoA. This conversion not only provides large amount of acetate which fuels brain preferentially rather than muscle, but also recycles CoA which is required for sustained fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. Taken together, we suggest that acetate is an emerging novel ketone body and may be used as a parameter to evaluate the progression of energy stress in the future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Homeostasis disorder of energy metabolism associated with emergency status such as untreated diabetes mellitus, prolonged starvation and ischemic heart/brain diseases leads to serious threats to human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Field et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Galgani and Ravussin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Martinic and von Herrath, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Must et al., 1999</xref>). In response to such disorder, the metabolic patterns of multiple organs have to be remodelled to rescue the imbalance and bring whole organism through the crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Denechaud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fruhbeck et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Goldberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hirai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Meier and Gressner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nishimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Palikaras et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Russell and Cook, 1995</xref>). Ketone bodies, namely acetoacetate (AcAc), Î²-hydroxybutyrate (3-hydroxybutyrate, 3-HB) and acetone, which are overproduced from fatty acids in liver during the conditions of reduced carbohydrate availability such as diabetes and starvation, are released into blood, and serve as a kind of vital alternative metabolic fuel for extrahepatic tissues including brain, skeletal muscle and heart, where they are converted to acetyl-CoA and oxidized in tricarboxylic cycle (TCA) for the provision of large amount of energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Cahill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">DâAcunzo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dentin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Krishnakumar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Puchalska and Crawford, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Robinson and Williamson, 1980</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the acetate increased significantly in diabetic status and prolonged starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akanji et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Seufert et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Todesco et al., 1993</xref>), and acetate has been considered as a nutrient that nourishes organism by conversion to acetyl-CoA for further catabolism in TCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lindsay and Setchell, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schug et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schug et al., 2016</xref>). Inversely, acetyl-CoA can also be hydrolyzed to acetate by corresponding acyl- CoA thioesterases (ACOTs) family protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Swarbrick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tillander et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, it is not very clear where, under what condition and how acetate is produced, and what is its biological significance. Considering the high similarity of acetate and ketone body in their production (from acetyl-CoA) and catabolism (converted back to acetyl-CoA), we thoroughly investigated the production and utilization of acetate with ketone bodies as a control and suggest that acetate is an emerging novel ketone body that plays important roles similar to classic ketone bodies in the status of energy stresses such as diabetes mellitus and prolonged starvation.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Acetate is dramatically elevated in energy stresses in mammals</title>
<p>To investigate if acetate is produced as do ketone bodies, we detected the serum glucose, 3-HB, AcAc and other metabolites of 19 diabetes mellitus patients with 8 healthy volunteers as control (<bold><xref rid="figS1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>âsource data 1</bold>). We observed a significant increase of acetate in parallel with the raising of canonical ketone bodies (3-HB and AcAc) and serum glucose in diabetes mellitus patients as compared with healthy control (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). We then detected acetate in mouse models and found that the levels of serum acetate and ketone bodies were dramatically elevated to the same extent in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type I diabetic C57BL/6 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>) and BALB/c mice (<bold><xref rid="figS1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref></bold>) as well as in type II diabetic <italic>db/db</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<bold><xref rid="figS1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref></bold>). As expected, starvation also leads to marked descending of serum glucose concentration and ascending of serum acetate and ketone bodiesâ level in normal C57BL/6 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>) and BALB/c mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>â figure supplement 2</bold>). These data demonstrate that serum acetate is boosted to the same extent as the canonical ketone bodies in the status of energy stresses including diabetes mellitus and starvation. For the sake of simplicity, we designate such acetate hereinafter as energy stress-induced acetate (ES-acetate).</p>

<title>ES-acetate is derived from FFAs in mammalian cells</title>
<p>Next we asked from what nutrients ES-acetate is derived. In mammals, serum acetate contains generally three sources: dietary acetate, metabolic product of gut microbiota and the intermediate of intracellular biochemical processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schug et al., 2016</xref>). As the mice used above were fed with acetate free diet, we thus focused on gut microbiota and endogenous biochemical reaction. To determine whether gut microbiota contribute to the production of ES-acetate, mice were pre-treated with antibiotics to eliminate gut microbes (saline as control) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sivan et al., 2015</xref>). We observed that antibiotics pre-treatment failed to obviously affect the acetate production induced by either starvation (<bold><xref rid="figS2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref></bold>) or diabetes (<bold><xref rid="figS2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2â figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>), demonstrating that ES-acetate is mainly produced endogenously. Next we detected acetate secreted in culture medium by several cell lines using NMR (<bold><xref rid="figS2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A, B</xref></bold>) and GC-MS (<bold><xref rid="figS2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C, D</xref></bold>) and found that these cells showed different ability in producing acetate. Consistently, Liu et al. reported that acetate is derived from glucose in mammalian cells supplied with abundant nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). We observed the secretion of different amounts of U-<sup>13</sup>C-acetate after cells were cultured in medium supplemented with U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose indeed (<bold><xref rid="figS2c" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>âfigure supplement 3A</bold>). Interestingly, we also observed the production of 36.6% of non-U-<sup>13</sup>C-acetate, indicating that this proportion of acetate is derived from nutrients other than glucose (<bold><xref rid="figS2c" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3B</xref></bold>). We then examined if the acetate secreted by cultured cells is derived from amino acids (AAs) and free fatty acids (FFAs) upon starvation. After different cells were cultured in Hanksâ balanced salt solutions (HBSS, free for glucose, fatty acids and amino acids) supplemented with FFAs or amino acids for 20 h, supplementation of FFAs (<bold><xref rid="figS2d" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4D, E</xref></bold>) rather than amino acids (<bold><xref rid="figS2d" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A-C</xref></bold>) significantly increased acetate levels, suggesting the major contribution of FFAs to acetate production. To confirm this observation, a series of widely used cell lines and mouse primary hepatocytes (MPH) were cultured in HBSS supplemented with U-<sup>13</sup>C-palmitate, followed by detection of secreted U-<sup>13</sup>C-acetate (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). These cell lines displayed quite different ability in conversion of palmitate to acetate and were accordingly divided into FFA-derived acetate-producing cells (FDAPCs: LO2, MPH and AML12, etc.) and no-FFA-derived acetate-producing cells (NFDAPCs: HEK-293T and Huh7, etc.). All of the FDAPCs secreted U-<sup>13</sup>C-acetate in a dose-dependent manner of U-<sup>13</sup>C-palmitate supplemented (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-D</xref></bold>). We also observed that high fat diet induced a significant rise of acetate production in both normal and STZ-induced diabetic mice (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>). Taken together, we suggest that acetate can be derived from free fatty acids in the status of energy stresses.</p>

<title>ACOT12 and ACOT8 are involved in acetate production in mammalian cells</title>
<p>It was reported that acyl-CoAs with different length of carbon chain could be hydrolyzed to FFAs specifically by corresponding acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOTs) family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tillander et al., 2017</xref>). Acetyl-CoA, the shortest chain of acyl-CoA and the critical product of Î²-oxidation, is hydrolyzed to acetate by acyl-CoA thioesterase 12 (ACOT12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Swarbrick et al., 2014</xref>). We next analyzed GEO database and found out that the expression of <italic>ACOT1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>/<italic>8</italic>/<italic>12</italic> is upregulated significantly along with the increase of Î²-oxidation and ketogenesis in mice liver after 24 h of fasting (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>â figure supplement 1A</bold>). To determine which ACOT is responsible for ES-acetate production, we overexpressed a series of ACOTs in HEK-293T cells and observed large amount of acetate production when either ACOT8 or ACOT12 was overexpressed (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>), indicating the involvement of these two ACOTs in ES-acetate production. Consistently, the protein levels of both ACOT12 and ACOT8 are upregulated robustly in livers of either starved mice or STZ-induced type I diabetic mice (<bold><xref rid="figS3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B, C</xref></bold>). Furthermore, when ACOT12 and ACOT8 were separately overexpressed in NFDAPCs HEK-293T and Huh7, FFAs-derived acetate was significantly increased (<bold><xref rid="figS3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D, E</xref></bold>). Similarly, overexpression of wildtype (WT) ACOT12 and ACOT8, rather than their enzyme activity-dead mutants, in HEK-293T (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>) and Huh7 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>) cells drastically increased U-<sup>13</sup>C-acetate production derived from U-<sup>13</sup>C-palmitate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ishizuka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Swarbrick et al., 2014</xref>). On the contrary, knockdown (KD) of ACOT12 or ACOT8 in FDAPCs MPH (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, F</bold>) and LO2 (<bold><xref rid="figS3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F, G</xref></bold>) diminished U-<sup>13</sup>C-acetate production. These data reveal that ACOT12 and ACOT8 are responsible for ES-acetate production.</p>

<title>Hepatic ACOT12 and ACOT8 are responsible for ES-acetate production in energy stresses</title>
<p>Next we were prompted to figure out which organ and subcellular structure are mainly involved in the generation of ES-acetate. Firstly, we analyzed the expression of ACOTs at mRNA level in various tissues of human and mice by employing GTEx and GEO databases, individually. <italic>ACOT12</italic> is mainly expressed in human liver together with ketogenic enzymes (<italic>HMGCS2</italic>, <italic>HMGCSL</italic>, <italic>ACAT1</italic> and <italic>BDH1</italic>), and <italic>ACOT8</italic> is expressed ubiquitously at a relative high level in most tissues (<bold><xref rid="figS4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref></bold>). <italic>ACOT12</italic> is also expressed mainly in mouse liver and kidney, however <italic>ACOT8</italic> seems to be expressed at a much low level in nearly all mouse tissues examined (<bold><xref rid="figS4b" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref></bold>). Different from their expression patterns of mRNA in GEO database, we observed high protein levels of both ACOT12 and ACOT8 in mouse liver and kidney (<bold><xref rid="figS4b" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B</xref></bold>). Consistently, adenovirus- mediated liver-targeted knockdown of either ACOT12 or ACOT8 dramatically abolished acetate production of starved or diabetic C57BL/6 mice (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-F</xref></bold>) and conditional deletion of ACOT12 or ACOT8 in liver dramatically decreased acetate production in starved mice (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G-J</xref></bold>), demonstrating that liver is the main organ responsible for ES-acetate production. Moreover, U-<sup>13</sup>C-acetate derived from U-<sup>13</sup>C- palmitate in glucose free HBSS was diminished by replenishment of glucose (<bold><xref rid="figS4c" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref></bold>), in accordance with the concept that as energy sources glucose is preferable to fatty acids. These observations demonstrate that hepatic ACOT12 and ACOT8 are induced and responsible for ES-acetate production in diabetes mellitus and during starvation.</p>

<title>ACOT 12&amp;8-catalyzed acetate production is dependent on FFAs oxidation in both mitochondrion and peroxisome</title>
<p>Then we made efforts to clarify in which subcellular domains acetate is produced.</p>
<p>Immunofluorescence (IF) staining and cell fractionation showed that ACOT12 was largely localized in cytosol and ACOT8 mainly in peroxisome (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, B</bold>). Itâs well- known that fatty acids of different chain length can be oxidized to yield acetyl-CoA in either mitochondria or peroxisome of hepatocyte, and that mitochondrial acetyl-CoA produced in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is often exported to cytosol in the form of citrate which is further cleaved back to acetyl-CoA by ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lazarow, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Leighton et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lodhi and Semenkovich, 2014</xref>). We thus examined acetate production after mitochondria- or peroxisome-yielded acetyl-CoA had been blocked. Knockdown or etomoxir inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the main mitochondrial fatty acids transporter, decreased more than one-half of U-<sup>13</sup>C-palmitate-derived U-<sup>13</sup>C-acetate production in LO2 cell lines, in spite of mitochondria Î²-oxidation being nearly completely abolished (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-E</xref></bold>).

MCFAs generated in peroxisome is exported into cytosol and absorbed directly by mitochondria. Cytosolic acyl-CoA derived from medium- and long-chain fatty acids (M/LCFAs) is transferred into mitochondria through CPT1A. All fatty acids and acyl-CoA in mitochondria undergo FAO to be degraded to acetyl-CoA. Then acetyl-CoA together with oxaloacetate is synthesized to citrate in TCA cycle, and citrate is exported into cytosol where it is lysed to acetyl-CoA by ACLY. Acetyl-CoA is finally converted to acetate by cytosol-localized ACOT12.</p></caption>

<title>ACOT12&amp;8-catalyzed recycling of CoA from acetyl-CoA is crucial for sustainable fatty acid oxidation</title>
<p>Afterwards, we tried to explore the biological significance of ES-acetate production in response to energy stresses by detecting a series of serum metabolic parameters. Knockdown of ACOT12 or ACOT8 failed to alter the levels of preprandial and postprandial blood glucose as well as insulin, implying that these two molecules may not be involved in glucose metabolism on non-energy stresses (<bold><xref rid="figS6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A-C</xref></bold>). However, knockdown of them caused significant accumulation of total FFAs and various saturated or unsaturated fatty acids examined while triacylglycerol (TG) was not altered (<bold><xref rid="figS6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D-J</xref></bold>). Considering the fact that upon diabetes and prolonged starvation mobilized lipid is mainly transported in the form of plasma albumin-bound fatty acids, rather than TG, these results suggest that ACOT12 and ACOT8 might be required for rapid degradation of fatty acids in these cases. Indeed, we detected attenuated FAO in ACOT12 and ACOT8 knockdown MPH and LO2 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, B; <xref rid="figS6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1K, L</xref></bold>). Then we were prompted to identify the mechanism underlying such attenuation of FAO. A clue is the knowledge that reduced free Coenzyme A (CoA) is a crucial coenzyme for many metabolic reactions including those involved in oxidative degradation of fatty acid and maintenance of the balance between reduced CoA pool and oxidized CoA pool is definitely important for the sustainment of those reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sivanand et al., 2018</xref>). We spontaneously wanted to know if ACOT12&amp;8-catalyzed conversion of acetyl-CoA to free CoA plays a key role in maintaining free CoA level and the balance between reduced CoA and oxidized CoA. To our surprise, in ACOT12/8 KD MPHs, the levels of reduced CoA was decreased by 75.2% and 68.3%, acetyl-CoA increased for 3.49 and 1.71 folds, and the ratios of reduced CoA to acetyl-CoA declined from 7.62 to 0.41 and 0.89, separately (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-E</xref></bold>). In accordance with such alteration, other oxidized CoAs (octanoyl-CoA, caproyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA) whose generation requires sufficient reduced CoA as coenzyme were diminished (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>â figure supplement 2A-C</bold>). In contrast, metabolites (acetoacetyl-CoA; cholesterol, CHOL; high density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL-C; low density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C) with acetyl-CoA as the direct substrate for their synthesis were markedly increased (<bold><xref rid="figS6b" ref-type="fig">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2D-G</xref></bold>). It is important to point out that among all oxidized CoA examined, the level of acetyl-CoA is far higher than others and the switch between acetyl-CoA and reduced CoA plays a significant role in regulation of CoA pool balance (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>; <xref rid="figS6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2H</xref></bold>). This observation explains why ACOT12- and ACOT8-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA to free CoA and acetate is the crucial step for the maintenance of reduced CoA level and sustained FAO.</p>

<title>Hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA by ACOT12&amp;8 is beneficial to ketogenesis</title>
<p>Distinct from other oxidized CoA, HMG-CoA, a key intermediate for ketone bodiesâ synthesis with acetyl-CoA as a substrate, was declined dramatically in ACOT12 and ACOT8 KD MPHs, demonstrating that ACOT12/8 may be positive regulators of HMG- CoA level (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>). Accordingly, the main ketone bodies AcAc and 3-HB were decreased significantly in STZ-induced diabetic mice with knockdown of ACOT12 or ACOT8 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, C</bold>). To clarify the mechanism underlying ACOT12/8 regulation of HMG-CoA, we detected the protein level of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2), the key enzyme for HMG-CoA synthesis. Interestingly, HMGCS2 was remarkably downregulated in ACOT12/8 KD MPHs (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D-G</xref></bold>), indicating that ACOT12&amp;8 are positive regulators of HMGCS2 protein level. A previous study shows that HMGCS2 activity is suppressed by acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). We thus examined the acetylation of HMGCS2 and observed a clear increase of its acetylation in ACOT12/8 KD MPHs (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref></bold>), and such alteration is corresponding to the increase of acetyl-CoA level (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold>), the direct substrate of acetylation. This observation demonstrates that ACOT12&amp;8 are also positive regulators of HMGCS2 activity by hydrolyzing acetyl-CoA to avoid accumulation of acetyl-CoA and over- acetylation of HMGCS2. Taken together, we suggest that upon energy stress, ACOT12/8 are upregulated and in turn enhance the function of HMGCS2 by increasing not only its amount but also its activity, facilitating ketone body production to fuel the extrahepatic tissues.</p>

<title>Acetate is beneficial to extrahepatic tissues during energy stresses</title>
<p>It has been well studied that the ketone bodies are produced mainly in liver in diabetes mellitus and prolonged starvation and in turn fuels crucial extrahepatic organs like brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Puchalska and Crawford, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Robinson and Williamson, 1980</xref>).

Moreover, we performed intraperitoneal injection of both acetate and 3-HB simultaneously in fasting mice and compared the serum concentration curves of them. Interestingly, acetate took not only less time to reach peak plasma level than 3-HB (5 min vs 12 min), but also much less time to be eliminated (20 min vs 120 min), implying that acetate may be more rapidly absorbed and consumed than 3-HB by extrahepatic organs of mice (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref></bold>) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sakakibara et al., 2009</xref>). These results suggest that acetate is an emerging novel ketone body produced in liver from FFA and functioning to fuel extrahepatic organs, in particular brain, in the emergency status such as energy stresses. Next, we wondered the physiological significance of ES-acetate to animal behaviors under energy stresses and performed a list of behavioral tests: forelimb grip force test for assessing forelimb muscle strength, rotarod test for examining neuromuscular coordination, elevated plus maze test (EPMT) for assessing anxiety-related behavior, Y-maze test (YMZT) and novel object recognition (NOR) test for evaluating working memory and cognitive functions. Itâs clear that the forelimb strength and running time in rotarod test were dramatically declined in diabetic mice, further deteriorated by knockdown of ACOT12 or ACOT8, and rescued by administration of exogenous acetate (<bold><xref rid="figS8b" ref-type="fig">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2A, B</xref></bold>). Interestingly, the parameters related to muscle force and movement ability in other tests including total distance in YMZT, total entries in YMZT and total distance in NOR test were also decreased in diabetic mice and further worsened by knockdown of ACOT12 or ACOT8 (<bold><xref rid="figS8b" ref-type="fig">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2E, F</xref> and H</bold>). These observations demonstrate that ES-acetate is important for muscle force and neuromuscular coordinated movement ability.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is well known that glucose and ketone bodies are the main fuels for brain in different physiological conditions. In normal condition brain uses glucose as the main energy source. In contrast, it utilizes ketone bodies as an important energy source in the status of energy stress such as diabetes mellitus and prolonged starvation, because in these cases body glucose storage has been already exhausted and gluconeogenesis cannot provide sufficient glucose. As a result, sustained mobilization of stored lipid and the resultant production of ketone bodies from fatty acid oxidation is crucial for nourishing extrahepatic tissues, in particular brain in energy stresses. However, sustained fatty acid oxidation in hepatocyte needs rapid recycling of free CoA which is the crucial co- enzyme for FAO. Our study elucidates that such requirement is satisfied by ACOT12- and ACOT8-catalized conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate and CoA. It is important to point out that the significance of ACOT12- and ACOT8-catalized recycling of free CoA for FAO is analogous to that of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-catalyzed recycling of NAD<sup>+</sup> for glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Castro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cerdan et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to providing CoA, this reaction also provide acetate which serves as an energy source to fuel extrahepatic tissues (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8I</xref></bold>). As an alternative fuel in emergency status, acetate may be preferred by brain, because it is directly converted to acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACSS), undoubtedly more convenient than acetoacetate and 3-HB which need 2 and 3 enzyme-catalyzed steps to be converted to acetyl-CoA, individually. In this regard, we suggest to consider acetate as an emerging novel ketone body and its blood level should be detected, together with classic ketone bodies, to indicate the status of FAO in liver and lipid mobilization in adipose tissue upon energy stress.</p>
<p>In summary, in this study we clarify where and how acetate is produced in energy stresses and identify the profound biological significance of acetate production catalyzed by ACOT 12&amp;8. More importantly, we suggest that acetate is an emerging novel ketone body and may be used as a parameter to evaluate the progression of energy stress in the future.</p>

<title>Animal behavior analysis</title>
<p>Behavior analysis were performed by using age-matched male C57BL/6 mice that were about 4 months old. Diabetes mellitus, as mentioned above, was induced by STZ in normal or adenovirus-mediated liver-specific RNAi mice. Mice were moved to the experimental room 1 h before starting the experiment. All objects or apparatus were thoroughly cleaned with 75% alcohol between trials to remove odors. For Forelimb Grip Force Test, the forelimb grip forces were measured by a Grip Strength Meter (Ugo Basile, Italy) and the peak force was defined as the average of three successive measurements. The rotarod test was performed by a progressive acceleration setting from 5 to 40 rpm for 2 min using a five-lane apparatus (Ugo Basile, Italy). Before rotarod test, all mice were trained under a condition of 5 rpm 2 min daily for 2 days. For acetate rescuing experiments, the forelimb grip force test and rotarod test were conducted after 5 min of intraperitoneal injection of acetate. The Elevated Plus Maze Test (EPMT) was performed with an elevated plus maze (40 cm in length, 10 cm in width, 50 cm in height, Panlad, Spain) which consists of four elevated arms radiating from a central platform, forming a plus shape. Two of the opposed arms were enclosed by a wall of 20 cm in height. Each mouse was placed in the same area, and then left to explore the maze for 5 min. The amount of time spent in the open and closed arms was measured with a video-imaging system (Dazzle DVC100 Video). Data analyses were performed using active-monitoring software (smart3.0). Y-Maze Test (YMZT) was carried out using a Y-shaped maze with three light-colored, opaque arms (30 cm in length, 6 cm in width, 5 cm in height, Panlad, Spain) orientated at 120 angles from each other. Each mouse was placed in the same area, and then left to explore the maze for 5 min. The number of entries into the arms and alterations were recorded with a video- imaging system (Dazzle DVC100 Video). Data analyses were performed using active- monitoring software (smart3.0). The one-trial Novel Object Recognition (NOR) Test was carried out using an open-field apparatus (40Ã40Ã40 cm, Panlad, Spain) as test box and the protocol consisted of two test sessions separated by an over 20-min delay during which mice were returned to their home cage. In each test session, every mouse was placed in the same area, and then left to explore the open field for 5 min. For the first session, the mice were trained in the arena where two cubes (5 Ã 5 Ã 5 cm, familiar object) were placed as objects A and B. For second session, the mice were trained in the arena where one object A and one cylinder (5 cm diameter, 5 cm height, novel object) designated as object C were placed. The time and distance of novel and familiar objects exploration were recorded with a video-imaging system (Dazzle DVC100 Video) during the trials of each session. Data analyses were performed using active-monitoring software (smart3.0). The ratio of object C exploration time to total time represents the object recognition index.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work examines hepatic acetate production via ACOT12/18 in starvation and diabetes. The investigators use <bold>solid</bold> loss of function strategies in cells, including mouse primary hepatocytes, and in vivo mouse experiments to show that ACOTs are necessary for normal acetate production in the context of fasting and type 1 diabetes. Given that acetate is commonly thought to primarily represent a fermentation product, this study is of interest as it describes hepatic pathways converting fatty acids to acetate.</p>

<p>The authors investigate the roles of ACOT12/8 in the production of acetate by the liver. They observe that acetate concentration parallels ketone concentrations during fasting and T1DM. They show that acetate is produced from fatty acids in hepatocytes. They also provide data from human subjects who were classified as either &quot;healthy&quot; or &quot;diabetic,&quot; but there is no other characterization or description of these people, making it difficult to ascertain the context by which they were studied. Nevertheless, these findings could be gleaned from the literature, and yet there remains surprising uncertainty regarding the mechanism of acetate production by the liver. The authors use ShACOT12/8 and liver-specific ACOT12/8 knockout mice to demonstrate that these acetyl-CoA hydrolases are largely necessary for acetate production. There is data on this role for ACOTs in the literature, but they have yet to be widely studied. Using a 3H-palmitate assay, the authors then find that loss of these ACOTs inhibit fatty acid oxidation and propose that the mechanism involves scavenging CoA, analogous to the canonical role of ketogenesis. The idea is plausible but only partially proven. A related finding is that loss of these ACOTs inhibit ketogenesis, which the authors attribute to the loss of function of HMGC2S, partially through acetylation. These mechanisms suffer some limitations based on the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartmentation of the two processes, but the observations appear sound. Finally, the authors try to demonstrate that hepatic ACOT-mediated acetate production is necessary for normal motor function. The tracer data used to support the importance of acetate metabolism do not include loss of function models and generally need to be reported more transparently. Conceptually, one may be skeptical of the rather dramatic loss of motor function in the context of a relatively minor circulating nutrient. This may be a significant finding but requires more supporting evidence. Overall, the authors convincingly show that ACOT12/8 are critical for hepatic acetate production in mice, which will be helpful for the field, but the ramifications will require further investigation.</p>

<p>Catabolic conditions lead to increased formation of ketone bodies in the liver, which under these conditions play an important role in supplying energy to metabolically active organs. In this manuscript, the authors explore the concept of whether and to what extent hepatic formation of acetate might contribute to energy supply under metabolic stress conditions. The authors show that patients with diabetes have increased acetate levels, which is explained as a consequence of the increased fatty acid flux from adipose tissue to the liver. This is confirmed in a preclinical model for type 1 diabetes, where acetate concentrations are in a similar range to ketone bodies. Acetate concentrations also increase under physiological conditions of fasting. Using stable isotopes, the authors show that palmitate is used as the primary source for acetate production in primary hepatocytes. Using cell culture studies and adenoviral-mediated knockdown in mice, it can be shown that the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate is catalyzed in peroxisomes by acyl-CoA thioesterase8 (ACOT8) and after transport of citrate from mitochondria and subsequent conversion to acetyl-CoA in the cytosol by ACOT12. Remarkably, ACOT8/12 not only regulate the formation of acetate but play a crucial role in the maintenance of cellular CoA concentration. Accordingly, depletion of ACOT8/12 activity leads to a reduction of other CoA derivatives such as HMG-CoA, which resulted in the inhibition of ketone body synthesis. In diabetic mice, ACOT 8 or ACOT12 knockdown appears to lead to some limitations in strength and behavior.</p>
<p>In summary, the authors clearly demonstrate that hepatic release-mediated by ACOT8 and ACOT12-determines the plasma concentration of acetate. This is a very remarkable observation, since most studies assume that short-chain fatty acids in plasma are primarily generated by fermentation of dietary fiber by intestinal bacteria. The authors demonstrate in very well performed studies the metabolic changes that result from impaired thiolysis. On the other hand, the ACOT12 phenotype has been demonstrated in a recently published study (PMID: 34285335). In this study, ACOT12 deficiency caused NAFLD, thus it would be worth to determine whether deficiency of ACOT12 and/or ACOT8 promotes de novo lipogenesis under the conditions of the present study. As a further limitation, it should be noted that the relevance of acetate production for the energy supply of peripheral organs including the central nervous system could not be clearly demonstrated. For instance, impaired ketone body production due to impaired CoA availability could affect the metabolic activity of various organs. Moreover, the human cohort is not very well described, e.g. it is unclear whether the patients have type 1 or type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Wang et al. investigated the role of acetate production, a byproduct of fatty acid oxidation, in the context of metabolic stressors, including diabetes mellitus and prolonged fasting. Mechanistically, they show the importance of the liver enzymes ACOT8 (peroxisome) and ACOT12 (cytoplasm) in converting FFA-derived acetyl-CA into acetate and CoA. The regeneration of CoA allows for subsequent fatty acid oxidation. Inhibiting the generation of acetate has negative motor and behavioral consequences in streptozocin-treated mice, which are mitigated with acetate injection.</p>
<p>This paper's strengths include using multiple mouse models, metabolic stressors (db/db-/-, streptozocin, and prolonged starvation), numerous cell lines, precise knockout and rescue experiments, and complimentary use of mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analytical platforms. The presented data support the conclusions of this paper, but some aspects need to be clarified.</p>
<p>For example, for all animal studies, please list the age and sex of the animals at the time of the experiments. Sex and age are important biological variables that can affect metabolism, and such characteristics are needed when comparing results from different research groups.</p>
<p>In clinical medicine, common ketones that are measured are acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone. However, the data presented here suggest the importance of measuring acetate when patients present with ketoacidosis in uncontrolled diabetes or starvation.</p>
