<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cyanobacteria are key contributors to biogeochemical cycles through photosynthesis and carbon fixation. In filamentous, multicellular cyanobacteria these functions can be influenced through gliding motility, which enables filaments to localise in response to light and also form aggregates. Here, we use the aggregate forming species <italic>Fluctiforma draycotensis</italic> to study gliding motility dynamics in detail. We find that filaments move in curved and straight trajectories interspersed with re-orientation or reversal of direction. Most reversals take few seconds but some take substantially longer, resulting in a long-tailed distribution of stoppage times. Mean filament speeds range around a micron per second with a relatively uniform distribution against filament length, implying that all or fixed proportion of cells in a filament contribute to movement. We implement a biophysical model that can recapitulate these findings. Model simulations show that for filaments to reverse quickly, cells in a filament must achieve high coordination of the direction of the forces that they generate. To seek experimental support of this prediction, we track individual cells in a filament. This reveals that cells’ translational movement is fully coupled with their rotation along the long-axis of the filament, and that cellular movement remains coordinated throughout a reversal. For some filaments, especially longer ones, however, we also find that cellular coordination can be lost, and filaments can form buckles that can twist around themselves, resulting in plectonemes. The experimental findings and the biophysical model presented here will inform future studies of individual and collective filament movement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cyanobacteria are key contributors to global primary production and oxygen generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. They display high diversity and are adapted to a wide range of habitats from the soil crust to freshwater, and the ocean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Within this diversity, some cyanobacterial species display multicellularity, existing as filaments composed of individual cells. Many of these filamenteous cyanobacteria display a specific type of motility, known as gliding motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Gliding motility enables filaments to position themselves in response to light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and also to form aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], thereby enhancing photosynthesis and additional functions such as nitrogen fixation and iron acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Gliding motility is a specific form of bacterial motility that does not involve flagella [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. In single celled bacteria, studies in the species <italic>Flavobacterium johnsoniae</italic> and <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> have shown that gliding motility involves membrane-bound protein complexes moving in helical patterns across and around the cell body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. These membrane proteins are suggested to reach so-called focal adhesion points, at cell-surface contact points, where they convert their motion into axial forces that translate the cell and rotate it around its long axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Mutational studies in these species, as well as filamenteous cyanobacteria, have also identified proteins involved in the biosynthesis and secretion of a sugar polymer, so-called slime, to be essential for gliding motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In filamentous cyanobacteria, helically organised surface fibril proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] and junctional protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] were identified and suggested to link with motility and slime secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Type IV pili machinery is also implicated in filamenteous cyanobacteria gliding, both in <italic>Nostoc punctiforme</italic>, where only differentiated filaments called hormogonia display gliding motility[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], and in other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite these ongoing efforts on identifying the molecular mechanisms of force generation, the dynamics of gliding motility in filamentous cyanobacteria remains poorly characterised. In particular, it is not clear how filamentous cyanobacteria achieve coordination of cellular propulsive forces during gliding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. A better understanding of motility dynamics can provide insights into cellular coordination and inform molecular studies of propulsion. Study of the motility dynamics at the filament level is also relevant to population-level observations, such as aggregate formation. Current theoretical explanations for these observations make use of specific assumptions about filament behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], which can be better justified, or ruled out, upon better understanding of movement dynamics.</p>
<p>Here, we study gliding motility dynamics in a filamentous cyanobacterium <italic>Fluctiforma draycotensis</italic>, capable of gliding motility and extensive aggregate formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. We focus specifically on characterisation of movement dynamics, rather than elucidating their underlying molecular mechanisms. To this end, we used extensive time lapse microscopy under phase, fluorescent, and total internal reflection (TIRF) modalities. We found that gliding motility involves movement on curved or straight trajectories interspersed with rapid re-orientation or reversal events and with mean speeds independent of filament length. We were able to recapitulate these findings with a physical model of filament movement, which predicts a high importance for cellular coordination to achieve rapid reversals. We were able to confirm this prediction by tracking individual cells during a reversal. The single-cell analysis also revealed a direct coupling of translational and rotational movement, which can generate torsional forces during reversals. In support of such forces, we found that longer filaments tend to readily buckle and twist upon themselves to form plectonemes. The formation of plectonemes is associated with loss of cell-to-cell coordination during reversals, leading to filament ends moving independently. The presented findings quantify individual filament movement and provide a physical model of gliding motility that is consistent with experimental observations. Together, they will inform future studies on the molecular and physical mechanisms of force generation and collective behaviour of filaments.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Filament movement is interspersed with stoppage events, whose duration has a long-tailed distribution</title>
<p>Using time-lapse microscopy, we observed filament movement on glass slides and under agar pads (see <italic>Methods</italic>). We found that filaments move on straight or curved trajectories that are interspersed with re-orientation or reversal of direction (see Supplementary Movies S 1 and S 2). Under agar, it was possible to distinguish a region of different phase contrast, which aligns with the trajectories of the filaments, as forming a ‘track’ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and Movie S 3) (we note that it is possible that the tracks are associated with the secreted slime, see <italic>Discussion</italic> section). Lone filaments’ trajectories are mostly confined to these tracks, involving a stoppage and reversal at each end of the track (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), while filaments entering a circular track did not readily reverse (Movie S 4). We also observed filaments sometimes reversing without reaching track ends, but when this happened, it was usually at a consistent location (Movie S 5). Thus, the observed tracks under phase microscopy constitute a confining space that bounds filament movement and dictates reversal frequency (see <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). On glass, filament movement still displayed a go-stop-go pattern, but stoppages led to both reversal and re-orientation of direction, and as a result, trajectories were less well-defined (Movie S 2). Reversals and re-orientations were associated with a deceleration-acceleration of filaments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). This decrease in speed can either result from external counter forces or loss of propulsive force, for example through filaments reaching end of a track under agar or detaching from the surface on glass (see Movies S 1 and S 2). Mean filament speeds ranged around one micron per second and displayed a relatively uniform distribution against filament length (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Since filament speed results from a balance between propulsive forces and drag, the latter observation shows that all (or a fixed proportion of) cells in a filament contribute to propulsive force generation.</p>

<p>We can consider the reversal / re-orientation events of a filament akin to tumbling events seen in flagella-based bacterial motility. To this end, we were interested in the distribution of time spent during reversals, which we call the “dwell time”. Analysing over 1700 reversal events across 65 filaments, we found that dwell times display a long-tailed distribution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). On glass, we found a similar long-tailed distribution from 256 reversal / reorientation events(<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Most reversals happened within few seconds, while a minority involved significant time spent stationary. We found that there was no clear difference between dwell time of leading and trailing ends of the filament (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Taken together, these findings show that filament reversals are mostly rapid events and that they don’t involve delays across the filament.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>A biophysical model captures filament movement dynamics and highlights a key role for cell-to-cell coordination for achieving fast reversals</title>
<p>As summarised in the introduction, molecular basis of propulsive forces are not fully understood. However, the presented quantification of motility dynamics highlights three key observations that can be used to develop a plausible biophysical model of filament movement. Firstly, and most obviously, cells in a filament remain physically linked during motion and therefore must exert mechanical forces onto each other. Secondly, all or most cells contribute to propulsive force generation, as seen from a uniform distribution of mean speed across different filament lengths. Thirdly, and finally, reversals are associated with reduction in speed (or stoppage) and usually happen within seconds.</p>
<p>We implement the first two observations by modelling cells in a filament as beads connected by springs, with each cell capable of generating propulsion and exerting pull and push forces onto others (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <italic>Methods</italic>). The third observation shows that cells have a mechanism to alter the direction of their propulsive force. To this end, we model reversals as resulting from a stochastic cellular signalling pathway that is linked to mechano-sensing of external and internal forces acting on a given cell (see <italic>Methods</italic> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eqs. (3)</xref>,<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">(6)</xref>). This modelling choice effectively assumes that cells have an intrinsic reversal rate, but adjust this in such a way to reduce any compression or extension that they perceive. In addition, and to account for cellular sensing dynamics, we introduce a memory (i.e. a refractory period) that limits cells ability to switch force direction if they have recently done so (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eqs. (3)</xref>,<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">(4)</xref> in <italic>Methods</italic>).</p>

<p>Given this model, we simulated movement of filaments in a 1-dimensional space and in the presence of an external force field. The latter allows us to implement a reduction of speed and analyse filament movement on a defined track, as observed experimentally for the movement under agar (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). For appropriate choice of parameters, we found that this model can produce sustained back-and-forth movement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and Movie S 6). The ability of the model to present reversals can be understood from the way it implements mechano-sensing at the cell level. When leading cells reach the track ends, the external force field causes an increase in their tendency to reverse the direction of their propulsive force (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). When this happens, trailing cells are compressed by both those in front and behind them, and, if cell-cell coupling is strong enough, are forced to reverse as well. Thus, the mechano-sensing creates a signal that travels across the filament and sustains a coordinated reversal event. The same dynamics can also be created from stochastic reversal of few individual cells, and as such, we observed also reversals in the model simulations without the filament reaching the track ends, for some parameter values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>To better understand how the key model parameters affect reversals, we run simulations across a wide range of parameter values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). To quantify reversal dynamics, we considered two measures that are based on cell-to-cell coordination and extent of reversals. The reversal-related measure, <italic>M</italic>, gives the ratio of the number of actual reversals over the estimated number of reversals obtained by considering an idealised filament, that has a defined mean speed and reverses deterministically and instantaneously at track ends (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq. (7)</xref>. Thus, a value of <italic>M</italic> ≈ 1 can indicate regular and rapid reversals at track ends, however, it can also indicate simply a high reversal frequency. The coordination measure, <italic>S</italic>, gives the extent of homogeneity of cellular propulsive forces across a filament (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn9">Eq. (9)</xref>), with a high value indicating cells behaving in synchrony throughout their movement. Evaluating <italic>S</italic> and <italic>M</italic> together allows us to better quantify coordination in reversal dynamics along a track. We find that both measures are sensitive to the strength of the cell-to-cell coupling and the memory parameter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Indeed, when both parameters are reduced, reversals become more erratic, with filaments undergoing many reversals and individual cells having opposing propulsive force directions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and Movie S 7). As expected from these results, these two parameters also affect the shape of the dwell time distribution resulting from model simulations (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). For sufficiently high cell-to-cell coupling and memory parameters, simulated filaments reverse rapidly, and primarily at track ends, and cellular propulsive force directions remain homogeneous throughout their movement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). To explore if real filaments’ movement conform to such expected dynamics arising from high cell-to-cell coupling, we quantified the number of expected reversals using individual filament and track lengths, and the observed mean filament speed from all observations. We found that for the high majority of the filaments, the number of observed reversals matches closely with the expected number of reversals, in qualitative agreement with the model simulations performed with sufficiently high cell-to-cell coupling parameter (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>).</p>

<title>Filament movement shows high cell-to-cell coordination and coupling of translation with rotation</title>
<p>Taken together, the experimental and model results presented so far show that most reversals are rapid events, and to achieve them the filaments should have high cell-to-cell coupling in their movement. To explore this model-highlighted idea of cellular coordination and to better understand what happens during a reversal at the single cell level, we undertook Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, which illuminates only an ≈ 200 nm thick band of the sample and allows observation of surface features (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>, top panels). This allowed us to clearly identify individual cells and their septa with neighboring cells, which we tracked to quantify individual cell movement. We found that cell movement across the filament mostly stays coordinated during a reversal, in terms of speed and direction of movement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, bottom panels, see also associated Movie S 8).</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition to identifying individual cells, TIRF microscopy revealed membrane-bound protein complexes localised predominantly near the poles of each cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, top panel). We have also tracked these complexes and found that their trajectories match 2-dimensional projections of a 3-dimensional helical trajectory, showing that filaments rotate as they translate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, top panel and Movie S 8). The angle <italic>θ</italic>, that the trajectories make with the long axis of the filament shows a normal distribution with a mean of 21.2 degrees, while the angular speed of the protein complexes are well correlated with the linear velocity of the filament (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). These findings indicate either a helical force generation or a screw-like structure on the cell exterior that causes a strong coupling between rotation and translation. It is interesting to note in this context, that staining filaments with fluorescently labelled Concanavalin A (see <italic>Methods</italic>), which binds to slime, results in an helical pattern along the filament long axis (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). In time-lapse TIRF movies, cellular protein complexes can be seen moving through this fluorescence pattern, suggesting that the slime surrounds the filaments as a tubular structure, fixed in position relative to filament movement (Movie S 9). The tubular nature of slime is further supported by scattering electron microscopy (SEM) images, which show features around the filaments that look like collapsed slime tubes <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>.</p>

<title>Reversals in longer filaments can lead to buckling and plectoneme formation, causing loss of cellular coordination</title>
<p>The above findings show that filaments display high level of cell-to-cell coordination, supporting the model result that cellular coordination is one of the requirements for rapid reversals. In addition, we find a strong coupling between rotation and translation. Thus, it is possible that any differences in cell movement, for example the leading cells initiating reversal earlier, could lead to torsional forces developing along the filament. Supporting this, we note that cellular speeds display a steep acceleration immediately after a reversal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), a charactheristic observed in all filaments analysed with TIRF. In a few filaments, we have also observed indication of leading cells initiating reversal earlier than trailing ones (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref> and Movie S10). To further explore this possibility of de-coordinated movement dynamics along the filament, and emergence of associated torsional forces, we sought to analyse longer filaments with the expectation that such dynamics are expected to arise more readily in longer filaments. We found that longer filaments, where observed, readily display buckling, and sometimes these buckled loop regions twist upon themselves and form plectonemes. Almost all of the 61 observed cases of buckling and plectoneme formation involved filaments longer than 400 microns (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that plectonemes can form, we next wanted to understand cell-to-cell coordination during such events. While it was not possible to capture a filament with TIRF microscopy, during a plectoneme formation event, we were able to record whole-filament movies at low magnification. A representative case is shown on <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> (and associated Movie S 11), where we were able to analyse movement dynamics for each end of the filament. We found that the filament initially moves in a coordinated manner, on a well-defined trajectory and the two ends of the filament being coordinated in speed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). With the start of buckling and plectoneme formation, however, this coordination gets disrupted, with one end of the filament moving faster than the other, and finally reversing independently of the other end (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). This de-coordination seems to resolve towards the end of the recorded movement sequence, when the plectoneme resolves (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and Movie S 11). This representative case exemplifies the fact that buckling, and more specifically plectoneme formation, can result in de-coordination of cells within a filament and independent movement of filament ends. We have observed more extreme cases of such dynamics on glass, where plectonemes result in complete de-coordination in filament movement (Movie S 12). We also observed that plectonemes can get “dragged” and sometimes entangle other filaments (Movie S 13), a dynamic process that could be relevant for initiating aggregation of multiple filaments.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Here, we analysed the motion dynamics of the filamentous, gliding cyanobacterium <italic>F. draycotensis</italic>. We show that gliding involves movement of filaments on curved or straight trajectories, interspersed with re-orientation or reversal events. Filament speed decreases and then increases around a reversal event, with mean speed around one micron per second, independently of filament length. We find that the time spent in reversal displays a long-tailed distribution, with most reversals taking few seconds, but some involving considerable time of filaments being stationary. We show that these experimental observations can be recapitulated by a physical model that assumes individual force generation by each cell, mechanical-coupling among cells, and mechano-sensory (coordinated) control of force direction. This model suggests that such coordination of propulsion direction among cells in a filament is important for being able to achieve fast reversals. In line with this insight, we find that cells in a filament remain highly coordinated during reversals and that their translational movement is coupled with rotation along the long axis of the filament. Following from the latter observation, we find that longer filaments can readily buckle, and buckled regions can twist upon themselves to form plectonemes. The formation of plectonemes results in de-coordination of cellular movement and independent dynamics for filament ends. We hypothesize such dynamics to be linked with the loss of sensory coupling among cells, and de-coordination of the direction of their propulsive forces. Taken together, these results provide a useful characterisation of gliding motility, which will inform future studies on both molecular mechanisms of force generation and collective behaviours of filaments.</p>
<p>In terms of molecular mechanisms of propulsive force generation, our findings that rotational and translational movement are closely coupled in <italic>F. draycotensis</italic> and that slime presents itself as a helical tubular structure around filaments could be highly relevant. Rotation, as well as its absence, has been commented on in several species of gliding, filamenteous cyanobacteria, but not quantified before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], while it has been highlighted as a key dynamical feature in the propulsive force generation in gliding, single-celled bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Helical patterning of slime, as observed here, as well as surface fibrillar arrays, were described in several filamentous cyanobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Taken together, these observations point to the possibility that propulsive force generation involves helical tracks surrounding the cell and either motor complexes moving on them, as suggested for single-celled, gliding bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] or pili being pushed across them. Recent studies from <italic>Nostoc</italic> species indicate propulsion to result from pili extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], but whether that species presents filament rotation or fibrillar arrays is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Photoresponses in the motility behaviour is shown in several gliding filamentous cyanobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], but a fully quantitative analysis of these at the single filament level is currently lacking. In this context, an interesting observation we made in this study is the presence of fluorescent, membrane-bound protein complexes. We hypothesize that these complexes are associated with light sensing, since our tracking of them in TIRF microscopy always coincided with reversal of filaments. Thus, it is possible that the wavelength at which they get excited (437nm laser used in TIRF microscopy) is also acting as a sensory signal for reversals. This possibility will be explored in a future study, along with further characterization of any phototaxis behavior in <italic>F. draycotensis</italic>.</p>
<p>Gliding motility in filamentous cyanobacteria is commonly associated with aggregate or macro-scale structure formation. These formations are relevant in the context of physiological functions of the cyanobacteria, and their associated microbial communities, as shown in the case of <italic>F. draycotensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Similarly, in the case of the ocean-dwelling species of the <italic>Trichodesmium</italic> genus, aggregate formation is linked with the biogeo-chemically relevant processes of iron acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. The results presented here show that de-coordination of cellular forces within a filament can lead to formation of plectonemes, which can entangle multiple filaments together. Further studies of this process can elucidate how aggregate and macro-scale formations develop and inform their physical modelling.</p>
<p>Given that gliding motility is observed in phylogenetically diverse bacteria, it is possible for it to be under-pinned by different molecular mechanisms and present different motion dynamics. The inter-connectivity of propulsion and slime secretion is difficult to disentangle purely by molecular approaches, and development of physical models solely based on identified proteins can be limited. In particular, drastically different physical models can be constructed from observed molecular constituents. We advocate coupling of molecular studies with detailed analysis of motion dynamics, as quantification of these can provide an additional framework to constrain and test different models, ultimately providing a more complete understanding of gliding motility and associated collective behaviors.</p>

<title>Sampling and Culturing</title>
<p>Cultures of <italic>F. draycotensis</italic> were grown in medicinal flasks, in volumes of 30 mL BG11+ with added vitamin mix as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Cultures were kept under visible light irradiance of ≈ 30 <italic>µ</italic>M·photons·m<sup><italic>−</italic>2</sup>s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>, across a repeating 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle. Samples were obtained from cultures aged between 4 and 8 weeks, by withdrawing 0.5 mL of material containing several pieces of biofilm, transferring the aliquot into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube and vortexing for 1 minute to break up the material. If the mixture was not homogeneous, additional mixing was performed using a 1 mL mechanical pipette.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Sample Preparation for Imaging</title>
<p>Prior to imaging, collected innoculate was diluted into fresh BG11+ media with vitamin mix to a desired dilution (typically 1:50). For microscopy performed with 1.5 − 2% agarose pads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], 3<italic>µ</italic>L of the homogenised diluted sample was added to the pad. The droplet was then left to dry for 10-15 minutes, depending on the age of the agarose pad and room humidity. Where stated, the agarose pad was flipped onto a 22×50 mm cover glass, sandwiching the sample between the agarose and the glass. Otherwise, the sample was left on top of the agarose and the pad placed in a cover glass bottomed dish (MatTek/CellVis) for microscopy.</p>
<p>As described, some samples were imaged inside a millifluidic chamber device (Ibidi <italic>µ</italic>-Slide III 3D Perfusion) or on glass slides, using a 1.5 × 1 cm Gene frame (Thermo Scientific) as a spacer. For glass slide samples, the Gene frame sticker was placed on the standard glass slide. To the frame 200 <italic>µ</italic>L of diluted sample was added, and the chamber was sealed with a cover glass.</p>
<p>Regardless of sample preparation method, all prepared samples were left to settle for 30-60 minutes, being kept on a laboratory bench under room temperature and illumination.</p>

<p>Light microscopy was performed on an Olympus IX83 microscope, using a CoolLED pE-300 illumination system.

Phase imaging was performed with a low exposure rate (≈ 5 ms). Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured through a Chroma DSRed filter cube, with a recorded excitation light power of 17.4 mW and an exposure time of 100 ms.

<title>Image Analysis</title>
<p>Images were analysed with custom-written software in Python. Analyses involved tracking individual filaments, cells, or membrane complexes on each cell, across time-lapse images. In the case of filament tracking, movies of a larger field of view were cropped to focus on single filaments, and these were processed by fitting a contour on the filament and deriving a mid-point spline from this. By repeating this process across each image in a time-lapse, it was possible to track the position of middle, trailing, and leading ends of the filament and their speed. In the case of longer time-lapse movies, any drift in the images was stabilised using stationary filaments within the larger field of view.

<p>To model the process of reversals, we envision that each cell can decide on the direction of its propulsive force. This idea is motivated by the fact that all studied uni-cellular gliding bacteria incorporate directional change, and individual cells in filamentous cyanobacteria are observed to change the location of their Type IV pili apparatus across the cell poles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. To model cellular direction change, we introduce a function, <italic>ω</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>x, t</italic>), describing the internal “state” of each cell and dictating its active state by the relation <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>x, t</italic>) = tanh(<italic>ω</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>x, t</italic>)). From a biological perspective, <italic>ω</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>x, t</italic>) abstract the behavior of a cellular signalling network that integrates external and internal inputs for the cell and sets its propulsive direction. To this end, we define <italic>ω</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>x, t</italic>) as integrating several inputs, as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">

where <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub> is a friction coefficient, <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) is a Gaussian white noise, <italic>U</italic><sub>c</sub> is a confinement potential, <italic>f</italic><sub>ext</sub>(<italic>x, t</italic>) is an (adimensional) external force field, and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub> is a mechano-sensing (adimensional) potential. The confinement potential is a mathematical abstraction that allows us to maintain the output of <italic>ω</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>x, t</italic>) in a finite interval. This potential is given by:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">

</disp-formula>
with <italic>A</italic> = 1. The parameter <italic>ω</italic><sub>max</sub> determines the extreme values that <italic>ω</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>x, t</italic>) can attain. As such, this parameter acts as a memory term; when given terms in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq.

<p>The noise term captures any fluctuations, either internal to the cellular signalling networks or caused by external noise (thermal or otherwise). It ensures that the individual cells can also turn on or off or switch direction spontaneously. The noise term <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) follows ⟨<italic>η</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>)<italic>η</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sup><italic>′</italic></sup>)⟩ = 2<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub><italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub><italic>δ</italic>(<italic>t</italic> − <italic>t</italic><sup><italic>′</italic></sup>), with <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub><italic>/γ</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub> a diffusion coefficient, and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub> being the temperature that characterises the magnitude of the fluctuations of <italic>ω</italic> in absence of external stimuli.</p>
<p>Following the experimental observations, we postulate the existence of an external, mechanical stimulus that keeps filaments on a well-defined trajectory on agar, i.e. a track. We assume for simplicity that the track is fixed and extends from <italic>x/l</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0 to <italic>x/l</italic><sub>0</sub> = <italic>L</italic>. The external stimulus field is given by the following functional form:

where the quantity <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub> = <italic>f</italic><sub>ext</sub><italic>/l</italic><sub>0</sub> + <italic>δK</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub> is an effective spring constant. The function <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub> encodes the feed-back to a mechanical stress (compression/extension) applied on the cell, compelling the direction of the self-propulsion so that this stress is relieved.</p>
<p>Notice that, within the model, <italic>f</italic><sub>ext</sub> essentially encodes the basal strength of the response of the cells to stimuli, either extra-or inter-cellular. The mechano-sensing can be more (<italic>δK</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub> <italic>&gt;</italic> 0) or less (<italic>δK</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub> <italic>&lt;</italic> 0) relevant than the external stimulus; naturally, we impose <italic>δK</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub> <italic>&gt;</italic> −|<italic>f</italic><sub>ext</sub>|, i.e. there can not be a positive feedback to compression.</p>

<title>Simulation details</title>
<p>We integrate the equations of motion <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. (1)</xref> using a stochastic predictor-corrector algorithm, while the <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">equations Eq. (3)</xref> are integrated using the Euler-Maruyama algorithm. In both cases, we employ an integration time step Δ<italic>t</italic> = 10<sup><italic>−</italic>3</sup><italic>τ, τ</italic> being the unit of time. As mentioned above, we set the average length of an unperturbed cell as the unit of length and set the unit of time as the diffusion time of a single inactive cell <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="579126v3_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. For convenience, we set the unit of energy as the active “work” <italic>ϵ</italic> = <italic>f</italic> <sup><italic>a</italic></sup><italic>l</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1; as such, we fix <italic>f</italic> <sup><italic>a</italic></sup> =1 throughout the simulations. We further fix the friction coefficient to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="579126v3_inline4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. We assume that the motion of the filament is dominated by its self-propulsion, i.e. <italic>f</italic> <sup><italic>a</italic></sup><italic>l</italic><sub>0</sub> ≫ <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub><italic>T</italic> and we set <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic> = 0.01<italic>ϵ</italic>.</p>
<p>Concerning the parameters that enters in the evolution of <italic>ω</italic>, the scale of the “energy” should be set here by <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub>. However, we set <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic><sub><italic>ω</italic></sub> = 0.1 for convenience; we find that reasonably smooth reversals can be obtained for such a choice, maintaining the other parameters within the same order of magnitude. Indeed, we fix <italic>f</italic><sub>ext</sub> = 10.</p>

<title>Movement characterisation</title>
<p>The analysis of experimental and simulated trajectories focuses on the dwell time and the number of reversals. The dwell time is computed as follows: the trajectory is smoothed via a spline and the velocity is computed via numerical differentiation. A dwell time is defined as the interval within which the velocity remains, in absolute value, below 15% of its maximal value.</p>
<p>A reversal corresponds to a change of sign of the centre of mass velocity of the filament; we name <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> the number of reversals counted along a trajectory. We define two quantities: the reversal efficiency <italic>M</italic> and the reversal rate <italic>ν</italic>. The former quantity is defined as
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="579126v3_eqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
With <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="579126v3_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>m</sub> the measurement time (either in experiments or simulations). The quantity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="579126v3_inline6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the number of reversals one would expect from an ideal filament, that reverses smoothly and deter-ministically in a negligible time and then travels at constant speed. In simulations, <italic>v</italic> = <italic>f</italic> <sup><italic>a</italic></sup><italic>/γ</italic> = 1<italic>l</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>/τ</italic> while in experiments we estimate <italic>v</italic> ≈ 1<italic>µm/s</italic>. The quantity <italic>τ</italic> <sup>(<italic>e</italic>)</sup> is, thus, the ideal time between two reversals, i.e. the time the centre of mass would take to travel from its initial condition (after a reversal) to the track boundary. The reversal rate is simply defined as the number of reversals over the measurement time
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="579126v3_eqn8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Finally, we define a syncronisation index <italic>S</italic> as
<disp-formula id="eqn9">
<graphic xlink:href="579126v3_eqn9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where the average is performed over time or over the different realisations. Essentially, for each conformation, we compute the (instantaneous) average propulsion direction; as we are interested in the overall synchronisation of the filament regardless of its direction, we take the absolute value.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors use microscopy experiments to track the gliding motion of filaments of the cyanobacteria Fluctiforma draycotensis. They find that filament motion consists of back-and-forth trajectories along a &quot;track&quot;, interspersed with reversals of movement direction, with no clear dependence between filament speed and length. It is also observed that longer filaments can buckle and form plectonemes. A computational model is used to rationalize these findings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Much work in this field focuses on molecular mechanisms of motility; by tracking filament dynamics this work helps to connect molecular mechanisms to environmentally and industrially relevant ecological behavior such as aggregate formation.</p>
<p>The observation that filaments move on tracks is interesting and potentially ecologically significant.</p>
<p>The observation of rotating membrane-bound protein complexes and tubular arrangement of slime around the filament provides important clues to the mechanism of motion.</p>
<p>The observation that long filaments buckle has the potential to shed light on the nature of mechanical forces in the filaments, e.g. through the study of the length dependence of buckling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript makes the interesting statement that the distribution of speed vs filament length is uniform, which would constrain the possibilities for mechanical coupling between the filaments. However, Figure 1C does not show a uniform distribution but rather an apparent lack of correlation between speed and filament length, while Figure S3 shows a dependence that is clearly increasing with filament length. Also, although it is claimed that the computational model reproduces the key features of the experiments, no data is shown for the dependence of speed on filament length in the computational model. The statement that is made about the model &quot;all or most cells contribute to propulsive force generation, as seen from a uniform distribution of mean speed across different filament lengths&quot;, seems to be contradictory, since if each cell contributes to the force one might expect that speed would increase with filament length.</p>
<p>The computational model misses perhaps the most interesting aspect of the experimental results which is the coupling between rotation, slime generation, and motion. While the dependence of synchronization and reversal efficiency on internal model parameters are explored (Figure 2D), these model parameters cannot be connected with biological reality. The model predictions seem somewhat simplistic: that less coupling leads to more erratic reversal and that the number of reversals matches the expected number (which appears to be simply consistent with a filament moving backwards and forwards on a track at constant speed).</p>
<p>Filament buckling is not analysed in quantitative detail, which seems to be a missed opportunity to connect with the computational model, eg by predicting the length dependence of buckling.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors combined time-lapse microscopy with biophysical modeling to study the mechanisms and timescales of gliding and reversals in filamentous cyanobacterium Fluctiforma draycotensis. They observed the highly coordinated behavior of protein complexes moving in a helical fashion on cells' surfaces and along individual filaments as well as their de-coordination, which induces buckling in long filaments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provided concrete experimental evidence of cellular coordination and de-coordination of motility between cells along individual filaments. The evidence is comprised of individual trajectories of filaments that glide and reverse on surfaces as well as the helical trajectories of membrane-bound protein complexes that move on individual filaments and are implicated in generating propulsive forces.</p>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<p>The biophysical model is one-dimensional and thus does not capture the buckling observed in long filaments. I expect that the buckling contains useful information since it reflects the competition between bending rigidity, the speed at which cell synchronization occurs, and the strength of the propulsion forces.</p>
<p>Future directions:</p>
<p>The study highlights the need to identify molecular and mechanical signaling pathways of cellular coordination. In analogy to the many works on the mechanisms and functions of multi-ciliary coordination, elucidating coordination in cyanobacteria may reveal a variety of dynamic strategies in different filamentous cyanobacteria.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors present new observations related to the gliding motility of the multicellular filamentous cyanobacteria Fluctiforma draycotensis. The bacteria move forward by rotating their about their long axis, which causes points on the cell surface to move along helical paths. As filaments glide forward they form visible tracks. Filaments preferentially move within the tracks. The authors devise a simple model in which each cell in a filament exerts a force that either pushes forward or backwards. Mechanical interactions between cells cause neighboring cells to align the forces they exert. The model qualitatively reproduces the tendency of filaments to move in a concerted direction and reverse at the end of tracks.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The observations of the helical motion of the filament are compelling.</p>
<p>The biophysical model used to describe cell-cell coordination of locomotion is clear and reasonable. The qualitative consistency between theory and observation suggests that this model captures some essential qualities of the true system.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that molecular studies should be directly coupled to the analysis and modeling of motion. I agree.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is very little quantitative comparison between theory and experiment. It seems plausible that mechanisms other than mechano-sensing could lead to equations similar to those in the proposed model. As there is no comparison of model parameters to measurements or similar experiments, it is not certain that the mechanisms proposed here are an accurate description of reality. Rather the model appears to be a promising hypothesis.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors use microscopy experiments to track the gliding motion of filaments of the cyanobacteria Fluctiforma draycotensis. They find that filament motion consists of back-and-forth trajectories along a &quot;track&quot;, interspersed with reversals of movement direction, with no clear dependence between filament speed and length. It is also observed that longer filaments can buckle and form plectonemes. A computational model is used to rationalize these findings.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Much work in this field focuses on molecular mechanisms of motility; by tracking filament dynamics this work helps to connect molecular mechanisms to environmentally and industrially relevant ecological behavior such as aggregate formation.</p>
<p>The observation that filaments move on tracks is interesting and potentially ecologically significant.</p>
<p>The observation of rotating membrane-bound protein complexes and tubular arrangement of slime around the filament provides important clues to the mechanism of motion.</p>
<p>The observation that long filaments buckle has the potential to shed light on the nature of mechanical forces in the filaments, e.g. through the study of the length dependence of buckling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for listing these positive aspects of the presented work.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript makes the interesting statement that the distribution of speed vs filament length is uniform, which would constrain the possibilities for mechanical coupling between the filaments. However, Figure 1C does not show a uniform distribution but rather an apparent lack of correlation between speed and filament length, while Figure S3 shows a dependence that is clearly increasing with filament length. Also, although it is claimed that the computational model reproduces the key features of the experiments, no data is shown for the dependence of speed on filament length in the computational model. The statement that is made about the model &quot;all or most cells contribute to propulsive force generation, as seen from a uniform distribution of mean speed across different filament lengths&quot;, seems to be contradictory, since if each cell contributes to the force one might expect that speed would increase with filament length.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the data shows in general a lack of correlation, rather than strictly being uniform. In the revised manuscript, we intend to collect more data from observations on glass to better understand the relation between filament length and speed.</p>
<p>In considering longer filaments, one also needs to consider the increased drag created by each additional cell - in other words, overall friction will either increase or be constant as filament length increases. Therefore, if only one cell (or few cells) are generating motility forces, then adding more cells in longer filaments would decrease speed.</p>
<p>Since the current data does not show any decrease in speed with increasing filament length, we stand by the argument that the data supports that all (or most) cells in a filament are involved in force generation for motility. We would revise the manuscript to make this point - and our arguments about assuming multiple / most cells in a filament contributing to motility - clear.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The computational model misses perhaps the most interesting aspect of the experimental results which is the coupling between rotation, slime generation, and motion. While the dependence of synchronization and reversal efficiency on internal model parameters are explored (Figure 2D), these model parameters cannot be connected with biological reality. The model predictions seem somewhat simplistic: that less coupling leads to more erratic reversal and that the number of reversals matches the expected number (which appears to be simply consistent with a filament moving backwards and forwards on a track at constant speed).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the coupling between rotation, slime generation and motion is interesting and important when studying the specific mechanism leading to filament motion. However, we believe it even more fundamental to consider the intercellular coordination that is needed to realise this motion. Individual filaments are a collection of independent cells. This raises the question of how they can coordinate their thrust generation in such a way that the whole filament can both move and reverse direction of motion as a single unit. With the presented model, we want to start addressing precisely this point.</p>
<p>The model allows us to qualitatively understand the relation between coupling strength and reversals (erratic vs. coordinated motion of the filament). It also provides a hint about the possibility of de-coordination, which we then look for and identify in longer filaments.</p>
<p>While the model results seem obvious in hindsight, the analysis of the model allows phrasing the question of cell-to-cell coordination, which has not been brought up previously when considering the inherently multi-cell process of filament motility.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Filament buckling is not analysed in quantitative detail, which seems to be a missed opportunity to connect with the computational model, eg by predicting the length dependence of buckling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please note that Figure S10 provides an analysis of filament length and number of buckling instances observed. This suggests that buckling happens only in filaments above a certain length.</p>
<p>We do agree that further analyses of buckling - both experimentally and through modelling would be interesting.  This study, however,  focussed on cell-to-cell coupling / coordination during filament motility. We have identified the possibility of de-coordination through the use of a simple 1D model of motion, and found evidence of such de-coordination in experiments. Notice that the buckling we report does not depend on the filament hitting an external object. It is a direct result of a filament activity which, in this context, serves as evidence of cellular de-coordination.</p>
<p>Now that we have observed buckling and plectoneme formation, these processes need to be analysed with additional experiments and modelling. The appropriate model for this process needs to be 3D, and should ideally include torques arising from filament rotation. Experimentally, we need to identify means of influencing filament length and motion and see if we can measure buckling frequency and position across different filament lengths. These works are ongoing and will have to be summarised in a separate, future publication.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors combined time-lapse microscopy with biophysical modeling to study the mechanisms and timescales of gliding and reversals in filamentous cyanobacterium Fluctiforma draycotensis. They observed the highly coordinated behavior of protein complexes moving in a helical fashion on cells' surfaces and along individual filaments as well as their de-coordination, which induces buckling in long filaments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this accurate summary of the presented work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provided concrete experimental evidence of cellular coordination and de-coordination of motility between cells along individual filaments. The evidence is comprised of individual trajectories of filaments that glide and reverse on surfaces as well as the helical trajectories of membrane-bound protein complexes that move on individual filaments and are implicated in generating propulsive forces.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for listing these positive aspects of the presented work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Limitations:</p>
<p>The biophysical model is one-dimensional and thus does not capture the buckling observed in long filaments. I expect that the buckling contains useful information since it reflects the competition between bending rigidity, the speed at which cell synchronization occurs, and the strength of the propulsion forces.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Cell-to-cell coordination is a more fundamental phenomenon than the buckling and twisting of longer filaments, in that the latter is a consequence of limits of the former. In this sense, we are focussing here on something that we think is the necessary first step to understand filament gliding. The 3D motion of filaments (bending, plectoneme formation) is fascinating and can have important consequences for collective behaviour and macroscopic structure formation. As a consequence of cellular coupling, however, it is beyond the scope of the present paper.</p>
<p>Please also see our response above. We believe that the detailed analysis of buckling and plectoneme formation requires (and merits) dedicated experiments and modelling which go beyond the focus of the current study (on cellular coordination) and will constitute a separate analysis that stands on its own. We are currently working in that direction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Future directions:</p>
<p>The study highlights the need to identify molecular and mechanical signaling pathways of cellular coordination. In analogy to the many works on the mechanisms and functions of multi-ciliary coordination, elucidating coordination in cyanobacteria may reveal a variety of dynamic strategies in different filamentous cyanobacteria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point again and seeing the value in combining molecular and dynamical approaches.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is very little quantitative comparison between theory and experiment. It seems plausible that mechanisms other than mechano-sensing could lead to equations similar to those in the proposed model. As there is no comparison of model parameters to measurements or similar experiments, it is not certain that the mechanisms proposed here are an accurate description of reality.

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the referee that the model we put forward is one of several possible. We note, however, that the assumption of mechanosensing by each cell - as done in this model - results in capturing both the alignment of cells within a filament (with some flexibility) and reversal dynamics. We have explored an even more minimal 1D model, where the cell’s direction of force generation is treated as an Ising-like spin and coupled between nearest neighbours (without assuming any specific physico-chemical basis). We found that this model was not fully able to capture both phenomena. In that model, we found that alignment required high levels of coupling (which is hard to justify except for mechanical coupling) and reversals were not readily explainable (and required additional assumptions). These points led us to the current, mechanically motivated model.</p>
<p>The parameterisation of the current model would require measuring cellular forces. To this end, a recent study has attempted to measure some of the physical parameters in a different filamentous cyanobacteria [1] and in our revision we will re-evaluate model parameters and dynamics in light of that study. We will also attempt to directly verify the presence of mechano-sensing by obstructing the movement of filaments.</p>
