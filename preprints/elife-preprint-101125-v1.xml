<title>Abstract</title><p>Peptidoglycan (PG) serves as an essential target for antimicrobial development. An overlooked reservoir of antimicrobials lies in the form of PG-hydrolyzing enzymes naturally produced for polymicrobial competition, particularly those associated with the type VI secretion system (T6SS). Here we report that a T6SS effector TseP, from <italic>Aeromonas dhakensis</italic>, represents a family of effectors with dual amidase-lysozyme activities. <italic>In vitro</italic> PG-digestion coupled with LC-MS analysis revealed the N-domain’s amidase activity, which is neutralized by either catalytic mutations or the presence of the immunity protein TsiP. The N-domain, but not the C-domain, of TseP is sufficient to restore T6SS secretion in T6SS-defective mutants, underscoring its critical structural role. Using pull-down and secretion assays, we showed that these two domains interact directly with a carrier protein VgrG2 and can be secreted separately. Homologs in <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> exhibited analogous dual functions. Additionally, N- and C-domains display distinctive GC contents, suggesting an evolutionary fusion event. By altering the surface charge through structural-guided design, we engineered the TseP<sup>C4+</sup> effector that successfully lyses otherwise resistant <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cells, enabling the T6SS to inhibit <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in a contact-independent manner. This research uncovers TseP as a new family of bifunctional chimeric effectors targeting PG, offering a potential strategy to harness these proteins in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance urgently demands global interventions, and the bacteria cell wall remains a promising target. Our research introduces a novel family of bifunctional, cell-wall-damaging T6SS effectors. More importantly, we demonstrate an effective strategy to enable an otherwise ineffective enzyme to target both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Our findings highlight a promising path forward using cell-wall-damaging effectors, a largely untapped resource, in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a critical global health crisis, with bacterial AMR implicated in approximately 4.95 million deaths in 2019, and predictions estimating up to 10 million deaths per year by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Developing novel antimicrobials is thus of paramount importance but also a highly challenging task. Bacterial cell walls, mainly composed of peptidoglycan (PG) and crucial for survival, serve as a primary target for antimicrobials. However, the discovery of conventional PG-inhibiting small molecules is impeded by fewer choices and increasing resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The naturally occurring PG-lysing enzymes, secreted by bacteria for competition in polymicrobial environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), remain underexplored for AMR treatment.</p>
<p>As a widespread molecular weapon in Gram-negative bacteria, the type VI secretion system (T6SS) can directly inject PG-lysing enzymes and other antibacterial toxins into neighboring microbes and anti-eukaryotic toxins to yeast and mammalian cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The conserved structure of T6SS consists of a double tubular structure, a baseplate TssEFGK complex, and a transmembrane TssJLM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). A spear-like inner tube, made of stacks of Hcp hexamers, is ejected outward upon contraction of an outer sheath made of stacks of TssB/C hexamers, and a VgrG-PAAR spike complex sitting atop the Hcp tube is delivered concomitantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Although the ejected Hcp spear can penetrate neighboring bacterial cells, T6SS-elicited damages are largely dependent on the secreted effectors rather than the penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Numerous T6SS effectors have been predicted in Gram-negative bacteria, and known effectors display diverse functions including damaging the cell wall and membrane, DNase, and metal scavenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Despite the functional diversity of T6SS effectors, PG-targeting effectors seem to be most commonly associated with the T6SSs.</p>
<p>The conserved structure of PG comprises repeating disaccharide units of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM), with a short peptide (most commonly <sub>L</sub>-Ala-<sub>D</sub>-Glu-<italic>m</italic>-DAP-<sub>D</sub>-Ala-<sub>D</sub>-Ala) attached to each NAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Adjacent peptide chains of PG are cross-linked, forming a continuous network that envelops bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). T6SS effectors known to target PG fall into two categories, T6SS amidase/endopeptidase (Tae) families cleaving the peptides and T6SS glycoside hydrolase (Tge) families cleaving the glycan backbone. Tae effectors have been found to cleave bonds between <sub>D</sub>-Glu and <italic>m</italic>DAP, between <italic>m</italic>DAP and <sub>D</sub>-Ala, and between NAM and <sub>L</sub>-Ala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Tge effectors possess β-(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>)-N-acetyl-muramidase activities and N-acetylglucosaminidase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The recent discovery of Tse4 in <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, cleaving both the glycan strand and the crosslinked peptide cross-bridge, suggests dual enzymatic activities could be found in a single effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). However, such bifunctionality among effectors is rare.</p>
<p>As a ubiquitous waterborne pathogen, <italic>Aeromonas dhakensis</italic> can cause soft tissue infection and bacteremia in fish and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). The T6SS of <italic>A. dhakensis</italic> type strain SSU is active under laboratory conditions and can secrete three known antimicrobial effectors, a membrane-targeting TseC, a lysozyme-like TseP, and a nuclease TseI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Our previous findings have established that TseP serves a structural role because its expression can restore the T6SS secretion in the Δ<italic>3eff</italic> mutant lacking all three effector genes, and the C-terminal domain, TseP<sup>C</sup>, possesses lysozyme activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). However, the function of the N-terminal domain, TseP<sup>N</sup>, which lacks any recognizable conserved motif, has remained elusive. This study unveils TseP<sup>N</sup> is capable of cleaving the peptide link between NAM and <sub>L</sub>-Ala as an amidase. Both TseP<sup>N</sup> and TseP<sup>C</sup> can be secreted separately by the T6SS, but only TseP<sup>N</sup> can compensate for T6SS defects, indicating its critical role as a structural component. Additionally, TseP<sup>N</sup> exhibits approximately 10% higher GC content than TseP<sup>C</sup>, and homologs of TseP<sup>N</sup> and TseP<sup>C</sup> exist independently in divergent species. This disparity in GC content and the presence of domain-specific homologs suggest an evolutionary fusion event. We further show that TseP<sup>C</sup> can be engineered to hydrolyze resistant Gram-positive <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cells, conferring the T6SS with the capability to kill Gram-positive bacteria in a contact-independent manner. This research identifies a novel class of amidase-lysozyme bifunctional effectors, provides insights into effector evolution, and highlights the potential of engineering these effectors as antimicrobials.</p>

<title>TseP<sup>N</sup> and TseP<sup>C</sup> can be independently secreted by the T6SS</title>
<p>To delineate the regions of TseP crucial for T6SS-mediated secretion, we constructed two TseP truncations, TseP<sup>N</sup> and TseP<sup>C</sup>, and then expressed them in the Δ<italic>3eff</italic> mutant using the pBAD arabinose-inducible vectors. Consistent with our previous results, protein secretion assays show that the Δ<italic>3eff</italic> mutant, akin to the T6SS null Δ<italic>vasK</italic>, failed to secrete Hcp (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Complementation with TseP and TseP<sup>N</sup>, but not TseP<sup>C</sup>, restored Hcp secretion, despite at a reduced level relative to the wild type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We next tested whether the T6SS assembly is restored using a chromosomal sheath-labeled construct TssB-sfGFP. Fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that complementation with both TseP and TseP<sup>N</sup>, but not the TseP<sup>C</sup>, restored sheath assembly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Because both Hcp secretion and sheath assembly are hallmarks of T6SS assembly, these findings highlight the important structural role of the TseP N-terminus.</p>

<p>Interestingly, we noticed that TseP<sup>N</sup>, but not TseP<sup>C</sup>, was secreted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The lack of TseP<sup>C</sup> secretion might be due to a defective T6SS. To test this, we expressed different plasmid-borne TseP constructs in a panel of SSU mutant strains. Western blot analysis not only confirmed the secretion of TseP and TseP<sup>N</sup> but also detected the secretion of TseP<sup>C</sup>, albeit to a lesser extent, in both wild-type and the Δ<italic>tseP</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Considering that VgrG2 is the carrier protein for TseP delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), we next tested whether TseP<sup>N</sup> and TseP<sup>C</sup> could interact with VgrG2. Pull-down analysis showed direct interaction of VgrG2 with TseP<sup>N</sup> and TseP<sup>C</sup>, in contrast to the sfGFP and MBP negative controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These results indicate TseP<sup>N</sup> and TseP<sup>C</sup> can be secreted independently by the T6SS.</p>

<title>TseP<sup>N</sup> is a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent amidase</title>
<p>When analyzing TseP-mediated PG hydrolysis products using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS), we detected two distinctive peaks and determined their corresponding products to be NAM-NAG disaccharides and Tri/Tetra peptides (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>), the latter suggesting an amidase activity. The released peptides were also detected in samples treated with TseP<sup>N</sup> and the catalytically inactive C-terminal lysozyme mutant TseP<sup>E663A</sup>, but not with TseP<sup>C</sup> or its inactive TseP<sup>C-E663A</sup> mutant, indicating that the amidase activity is attributed to TseP<sup>N</sup>.</p>

<p>Sequence comparison with known amidases suggests that the TseP<sup>N</sup> contains a predicted Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding domain with several conserved residues H19, H23, H109, H339, H359, and E539 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). To test the effect of these residues on the TseP<sup>N</sup> amidase, we replaced these sites with alanines using site-directed mutagenesis and then purified a set of TseP<sup>N</sup> mutant proteins. Subsequent PG-digestion assays, coupled with UPLC-MS analysis, showed significantly reduced amidase activity in these mutants compared to TseP<sup>N</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the role of metal ions for TseP’s amidase activity, we added the chelating agent EDTA to the PG-digestion mixture, which abolished the amidase activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). To further identify the specific metal ion involved, we also purified TseP in the presence of EDTA and then supplemented it with Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a combination of both. PG-digestion assays revealed that adding Zn<sup>2+</sup>, but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>, restored the amidase function (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the dual functionality of TseP, we sought to determine if TsiP, known as the immunity protein neutralizing the lysozyme activity, could inhibit the amidase, by mixing purified TsiP with TseP, TseP<sup>N</sup>, and TseP<sup>C</sup> in varying molar ratios. Enzymatic assays using purified PG showed that TsiP could effectively inhibit both amidase activity and peptidoglycan hydrolysis activity of TseP, TseP<sup>N</sup> and TseP<sup>C</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, Supplemental Figure S1). Additionally, pull-down assays showed that TsiP interacts with not only TseP<sup>C</sup> but also TseP<sup>N</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that TseP<sup>N</sup> is a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent amidase.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Amidase activity is not required for T6SS assembly or lysozyme function</title>
<p>To determine whether the amidase activity is important for the structural role of TseP<sup>N</sup>, we expressed these amidase-inactive mutants in the Δ<italic>3eff</italic> TssB-sfGFP mutant and tested T6SS-related functions. Secretion analysis revealed that expression of TseP<sup>H339A</sup>, but not the other mutants, restored Hcp secretion similar to wild-type TseP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). As control, we examined the expression of these TseP variants and found comparable signals in the cell lysates and secretion samples. Observations of TssB-sfGFP sheath assembly in the Δ<italic>3eff</italic> TssB-sfGFP mutant further supported these findings, with the TseP<sup>H339A</sup> strain showing dynamic assembly of T6SS similar to the strain expressing the wild-type protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Supplemental Figure S2A). Further analysis through bacterial competition assays, with <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 strain as prey, mirrored these results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).

Although it is unclear why the other mutations failed to complement, the H339A amidase-inactive mutation exhibiting a similar complementary role to wild type TseP suggests that the amidase activity is not required for T6SS assembly.</p>

<title>TseP homologs exhibit similar dual functions</title>
<p>Homolog searching analysis reveals a broad distribution of TseP homologs across Gram-negative bacteria (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Supplemental Figure S3).

We also constructed inactivating mutations in their predicted catalytic residues for each protein to serve as controls (Supplemental Figure S3). Subsequent PG-hydrolysis and UPLC-MS analysis confirmed that both AHA_1849 and PSPTO_5204 exhibit dual amidase and lysozyme activities, capable of cleaving both peptide and glycan chains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).</p>

<p>Additionally, by analyzing the GC-contents of the two <italic>Aeromonas</italic> homologs, we found that the GC-content of TseP<sup>N</sup> is about 10% higher than that of TseP<sup>C</sup> and 10% lower than the upstream VgrG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that these two domains might have been horizontally transferred and subsequently fused during evolution. To explore this hypothesis further, we searched for homolog proteins with similar structures to either TseP<sup>N</sup> or TseP<sup>C</sup> in the Foldseek Search AFDB50 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), yielding 1000 proteins with comparable predicted structures.

<p>The crystal structure revealed that TseP<sup>C</sup> comprises a smaller lobe of seven helices and a larger lobe of ten helices, separated by a concave groove (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B</xref>, Supplemental Figure S4A). The surface electrostatic potential of TseP<sup>C</sup>, calculated using the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS), consists of both electronegative and electropositive regions, unlike the predominantly electronegative groove of lysozyme (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, Supplemental Figure S4B). The electropositive surface of TseP<sup>C</sup> consists of residues R723 and K796, with an adjacent residue Y720 corresponding to W62 in lysozyme, altering which is known to affect substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Additionally, the previously predicted catalytic dyad (E655 and E663) was located near the groove. Although this structural arrangement resembles that of other lysozyme family members, TseP<sup>C</sup> exhibits a less compact conformation with a notably wider groove compared to the typical lysozyme (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the lysozyme possesses catalytic sites at E53 and D70 in the substrate-binding groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), while the active residues in the TseP<sup>C</sup> structure are E654 and E663, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). To test the effect of E663 for TseP<sup>C</sup> activity, we purified a mutant E663D (TseP<sup>C-E663D</sup>) protein and perform PG digestion assays. The results show that TseP<sup>C-E663D</sup> lost the activity, suggesting the greater distance within the groove requires this glutamate residue (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These results collectively highlight the key structural features that may account for the increased activity of TseP<sup>C</sup> relative to the hen-egg lysozyme.</p>

<title>Engineered TseP<sup>C</sup> can lyse Gram-positive cells</title>
<p>To test whether TseP can degrade various cell walls, we purified PG from <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, a model Gram-positive bacterium, for use as substrate. However, we failed to detect any PG hydrolysis treated with TseP or TseP<sup>C</sup>, in contrast to the lysozyme (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Further purification of PG with NaOH treatment, removing PG-associated peptides, led to effective hydrolysis of PG by TseP and TseP<sup>C</sup>, suggesting a difference in substrate accessibility between the lysozyme and TseP. By comparing protein surface electrostatic potentials between the lysozyme and TseP<sup>C</sup>, we noticed a more electronegative surface patch in TseP<sup>C</sup>, suggesting a potential electrostatic repulsion from negatively charged PG (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, Supplemental Figure S4B). To increase electropositive regions while minimizing impact on activity, we mutated four negative charge residues distant from the active site and obtained a quadruple mutant TseP<sup>C4+</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The T6SS plays a pivotal role in bacterial competition, using a variety of antibacterial effectors to kill competing cells. The exploration of effector functions holds the promise of unlocking a largely untapped source of novel antimicrobials, presenting innovative approaches to address the escalating antimicrobial resistance crisis. Here we report that TseP represents a novel family of dual-functional chimeric effectors, exhibiting both amidase and lysozyme activities. Our study reveals that the N-terminus of TseP not only serves a critical structural role in T6SS assembly but also acts as a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent amidase. The N- and C-domains are both secreted and functionally independent, and may be subject to an evolutionary fusion event to form the chimeric full-length TseP. Such multifunctionality underscores a complex evolutionary strategy aimed at promoting T6SS-mediated competitiveness.</p>
<p>Among the known T6SS effectors, those targeting the bacterial PG layer represent a prevalent category. Certain T6SSs are capable of translocating multiple PG-targeting effectors. For instance, the H1-T6SS in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> deploys Tse1 and Tse3, while <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> secretes VgrG3 and TseH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Tse1 and TseH exhibit endopeptidase activities, whereas Tse3 and VgrG3 have potent lysozyme activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Yet, it remains relatively uncommon to identify effectors that possess dual functionality, capable of cleaving both the glycan chains and the cross-linked peptides within the bacterial cell wall. To date, the sole established example is Tse4 from <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, which acts both as a transglycosylase to cleave the glycan strand and as an endopeptidase to cut the peptide cross-bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Our enzymatic assays reveal that TseP distinguishes itself from Tse4 with dual roles as a lysozyme and an amidase, as well as a structural role for T6SS assembly. Further homology searches and biochemical validations of homolog activities substantiate that TseP constitutes a new family of dual-functional effectors.</p>
<p>Our data demonstrate that the N-terminus of TseP can modulate T6SS assembly, which provides further evidence that effectors play a crucial structural role in T6SS assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Although this notion has now been shown in several species, the molecular details remain elusive. The assembly of a non-contractile mutant T6SS in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in the absence of effectors suggests that effectors might be needed to stabilize a polymerizing T6SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). In comparison to TseP<sup>C</sup>, the N-terminus not only contributes to T6SS assembly but also exhibits 10% higher GC content. Additionally, both N and C-terminus can be independently secreted by the T6SS. Using structure-assisted homolog search, we have identified TseP<sup>N</sup> and TseP<sup>C</sup>-only proteins in different species. These data suggest that these two domains may result from independent effector proteins and have undergone an evolutionary fusion event.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that expressing TseP in the periplasm is highly toxic, but this toxicity is mitigated when catalytic mutations are introduced into the C-terminal lysozyme domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). This indicates that the N-terminal amidase is either less toxic or is tightly regulated by the concentration of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the growth medium. Although the total intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration during growth in LB has been reported to be around 0.1mM—approximately 100 times higher than the Zn<sup>2+</sup> level in the LB medium—the bioavailable (free) Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration within <italic>E. coli</italic> cells remains exceedingly low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). A similar dependency on metal ions was observed with another cell-wall-targeting endopeptidase effector, TseH, whose activity is dependent on the environmental concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Such metal ion dependencies might lead to misbelief about these effectors being cryptic or inactive, complicating the discovery and functional analysis of these important proteins.</p>
<p>TseP is predicted to contain an EF-hand calcium-binding domain with a “helix-loop-helix” motif, a feature previously unreported in T6SS effectors (Supplemental Figure S5A). However, mutations introduced to this domain, aimed at exploring its role in T6SS assembly and TseP toxicity, did not reveal any critical effect on TseP functions under the conditions tested (Supplemental Figure S5, B and C). It is possible that this EF-hand motif is active under more Ca<sup>2+</sup> stringent conditions or during infections. Further study is required to decipher its physiological function. Additionally, while constructing TseP variants with different residue changes, we noticed that even single residue changes could reduce the expression, secretion or the structural role of TseP, highlighting the technical challenge of heterologous effector engineering (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Supplemental Figure S6, A and B).</p>
<p>Because the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria generally prohibits the entry of cell-wall lysing proteins, the relatively exposed Gram-positive bacteria are likely more amenable to such treatments. However, the T6SS, exclusively found in Gram-negative bacteria, primarily targets Gram-negative species. To date, only two T6SSs, identified in <italic>Acidovorax citrulli</italic> and <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), have shown the capability to kill Gram-positive bacteria. Additionally, no Gram-positive cell wall lysing effectors have been reported; for instance, Tse4 from <italic>A. baumannii</italic> cannot directly lyse <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cultures but requires T6SS delivery. Our biochemical characterization and engineering of TseP<sup>C</sup> not only establishes its exceptional enzymatic activity but also demonstrates an effective strategy to acquire Gram-positive-cell lysing activities, as well as to equip the T6SS of <italic>A. dhakensis</italic> with a contact-independent killing ability. These results highlight the potential of antimicrobial effector engineering in addressing antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study unveils a new family of dual functional chimeric T6SS effectors and demonstrates the potential for bioengineering these proteins to broaden their antimicrobial spectrum. The engineered TseP<sup>C</sup> represents the first effector variant capable of directly lysing <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cultures, paying the way for engineering the diverse set of T6SS cell-wall targeting effectors. The urgent need for new antimicrobials necessitates the exploration of innovative strategies. The insights from our research into T6SS and its diverse effectors signal promising directions for future work in microbial biology and antimicrobial therapy. When enhanced through protein engineering, these enzymes have the potential to address bacterial infections not only in medical settings but also in food safety and animal health.</p>

<title>Peptidoglycan purification</title>
<p>Peptidoglycan was extracted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Bacteria were cultured at 37 °C for 8 h. Cells were then centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 3,000 × <italic>g</italic> and the cell pellets were washed with ultrapure water. After washing, the bacteria were resuspended in ultrapure water to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 70-100 and then added dropwise to an equal volume of boiling 8% SDS solution. The mixture was slowly stirred while boiling for 3 h and then cooled naturally to room temperature. The precipitate was collected at 20 °C for 1 h at 100,000 × <italic>g</italic> and washed with ultrapure water five times. To remove the residual proteins and DNA, the precipitate was resuspended in 10 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and treated with 5 mg DNase I and 16 mg trypsin at 37 °C for 16 h. After treatment, the mixture was centrifuged at room temperature for 1 h at 100,000 × <italic>g</italic>, and the pellets were dissolved and treated with an equal volume of boiling 8% SDS solution for another 3 h. The purified peptidoglycan was obtained after washing with ultrapure water, freeze-dried, and stored at −20℃.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> enzymatic assays and enzyme kinetics</title>
<p>To characterize the <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymatic activity of TseP and its homologs, 500 μg of purified <italic>E. coli</italic> PG was co-incubated with an equal amount of proteins in a 0.1 ml reaction system at 37 °C for 12 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and subjected to analysis by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS). The Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column was chosen as the solid phase, with solvent A (water with 0.1% [v/v] formic acid) and solvent B (methanol) as the mobile phase. Analyte separation was achieved by a linear gradient of solvent B, which was gradually increased from 1% to 20% over 65 min. Thereafter, a rapid gradient adjustment was followed to increase the concentration of solvent B from 20% to 100% in 1 min, with a retention period of 5 min to ensure complete separation. Finally, the system was flushed with 99% solvent A for 4 min to complete the process.</p>
<p>To measure the enzyme kinetics of TseP<sup>C</sup>, a dye-release method was used to detect the PG hydrolyzing. Prior to use, the purified PG was labelled by Remazol Brilliant Blue (RBB) following a previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Briefly, purified PG was incubated with 20 mM RBB in 0.25 M NaOH for 12 h at 37°C. The RBB-labelled PG was collected via centrifugation for 10 min at 21,400 × <italic>g</italic> and washed with ultrapure water several times until no RBB dye could be detected in the supernatant. This RBB-labelled PG was then applied for the enzyme kinetics analysis. In each reaction, 10 nM enzyme was mixed with different concentrations of RBB-labelled PG at 37°C for 10 min. Undigested PG was pelleted by centrifugation at 21,400 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and the dye release in the supernatant was quantified by measuring its absorbance at OD<sub>595</sub>.</p>

<title>Bacterial competition assays</title>
<p>Killer and prey strains were grown aerobically in liquid LB medium until they reached OD<sub>600</sub> values of 1 and 2, respectively. Later, the cells were harvested via centrifugation and gently resuspended in fresh LB broth. Killer and prey cells mixed at a ratio of 5:1 were deposited onto LB-agar plates supplemented with 0.01% (w/v) L-arabinose and co-incubated for 6 h at 28°C. Afterward, the mixed cells were recovered in fresh LB broth and vigorously vortexed to dislodge the agar. For the Gram-positive bacterial killing, the SSU and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells were mixed at a ratio of 20:1 with 0.01% L-arabinose in liquid LB medium for 24 h at 28°C. The mixtures were then serially diluted and plated onto specific antibiotic-containing plates.</p>

<title>Bioinformatics analysis</title>
<p>The gene sequences of <italic>A. dhakensis</italic> SSU were retrieved from the draft genome assembly (GenBank accession NZ_JH815591.1) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The resulting sequences were then aligned using Clustal Omega (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>), and the alignment was visualized using ESPript with its default settings (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://espript.ibcp.fr)">https://espript.ibcp.fr)</ext-link>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Model of TseP dual functions and engineering</title>
<p>This schematic illustrates the dual amidase-lysozyme activities of TseP and demonstrates an effective engineering strategy to enhance T6SS and its effector capabilities. The T6SS can independently secrete both the N- and C-terminal domains, with multiple evidence suggesting an evolutionary fusion event. These domains interact directly with the upstream-encoded carrier protein VgrG2 for secretion. TseP<sup>N</sup>, the N-terminal domain, functions as a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent amidase, while the C-terminal domain, TseP<sup>C</sup>, exhibits lysozyme activities. However, in its native form, TseP<sup>C</sup> does not lyse Gram-positive <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells. Through structural-guided design, TseP<sup>C</sup> was engineered to create TseP<sup>C4+</sup> by altering its surface charge. This modification enables TseP<sup>C4+</sup> to lyse <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells without affecting its T6SS-dependent secretion. Consequently, the T6SS-equipped cell acquires the ability to lyse <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in a contact-independent manner. Given the diversity of TseP-like effectors and T6SS species, this approach holds significant potential for modulating interspecies competition and combating antimicrobial resistance.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study describes how a single effector of the Type Six Secretion System (T6SS) has two distinct enzymatic functions that together may contribute to bacterial survival and dynamics in a community and provide potential for developing new antimicrobial compounds. The authors have deployed a range of methods in biochemistry, microbiology, and microscopy, generating <bold>solid</bold> data that support the main assertions. While the manuscript could benefit from additional clarifying experiments and a more detailed discussion of the methods, it will appeal to those studying T6SS, particularly those interested in effectors and bacterial enzymes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript performs a comprehensive biochemical, structural, and bioinformatic analysis of TseP, a type 6 secretion system effector from Aeromonas dhakensis that includes the identification of a domain required for secretion and residues conferring target organism specificity. Through targeted mutations, they have expanded the target range of a T6SS effector to include a gram-positive species, which is not typically susceptible to T6SS attack.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>All of the experiments presented in the study are well-motivated and the conclusions are generally sound.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are some issues with the clarity of figures. For example, the microscopy figures could have been more clearly presented as cell counts/quantification rather than representative images. Similarly, loading controls for the secreted proteins for the westerns probably should be shown.</p>
<p>Also, some of the minor/secondary conclusions reached regarding the &quot;independence&quot; of the N and C term domains of the TseP are a bit overreaching.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang et al. investigate the role of TseP, a Type VI secretion system (T6SS) effector molecule, revealing its dual enzymatic activities as both an amidase and a lysozyme. This discovery significantly enhances the understanding of T6SS effectors, which are known for their roles in interbacterial competition and survival in polymicrobial environments. TseP's dual function is proposed to play a crucial role in bacterial survival strategies, particularly in hostile environments where competition between bacterial species is prevalent.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The dual enzymatic function of TseP is a significant contribution, expanding the understanding of T6SS effectors.</p>
<p>(2) The study provides important insights into bacterial survival strategies, particularly in interbacterial competition.</p>
<p>(3) The findings have implications for antimicrobial research and understanding bacterial interactions in complex environments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript assumes familiarity with previous work, making it difficult to follow. Mutants and strains need clearer definitions and references.</p>
<p>(2) Figures lack proper controls, quantification, and clarity in some areas, notably in Figures 1A and 1C.</p>
<p>(3) The Materials and Methods section is poorly organized, hindering reproducibility. Biophysical validation of Zn²⁺ interaction and structural integrity of proteins need to be addressed.</p>
<p>(4) Discrepancies in protein degradation patterns and activities across different figures raise concerns about data reliability.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) are employed by bacteria to inject competitor cells with numerous effector proteins. These effectors can kill injected cells via an array of enzymatic activities. A common class of T6SS effector are peptidoglycan (PG) lysing enzymes. In this manuscript, the authors characterize a PG-lysing effector-TseP-from the pathogen Aeromonas dhakensis. While the C-terminal domain of TseP was known to have lysozyme activity, the N-terminal domain was uncharacterized. Here, the authors functionally characterize TsePN as a zinc-dependent amidase. This discovery is somewhat novel because it is rare for PG-lysing effectors to have amidase and lysozyme activity.</p>
<p>In the second half of the manuscript, the authors utilize a crystal structure of the lysozyme TsePC domain to inform the engineering of this domain to lyse gram-positive peptidoglycan.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The two halves of the manuscript considered together provide a nice characterization of a unique T6SS effector and reveal potentially general principles for lysozyme engineering.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The advantage of fusing amidase and lysozyme domains in a single effector is not discussed but would appear to be a pertinent question. Labeling of the figures could be improved to help readers understand the data.</p>
