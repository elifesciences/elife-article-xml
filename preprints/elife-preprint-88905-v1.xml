<title>Abstract</title><p>IQ motif-containing proteins can be recognized by calmodulin (CaM) and are essential for many biological processes. However, the role of IQ motif-containing proteins in spermatogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we identified a loss-of-function mutation in the novel gene IQ motif-containing H (<italic>IQCH</italic>) in a Chinese family with male infertility, characterized by a cracked flagellar axoneme and abnormal mitochondrial structure. To verify the function of IQCH, <italic>Iqch</italic>-knockout mice were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology which reproduced the human phenotypes. Mechanistically, IQCH can bind to CaM and then regulate the expression of RNA-binding proteins (especially HNRPAB), which are indispensable for spermatogenesis. Collectively, this study firstly unveiled the function of IQCH, expanded the role of IQ motif-containing proteins in reproductive processes, and provided important guidance for genetic counseling and gene diagnosis for male infertility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spermatogenesis is the most complex biological process in male organisms and functions to produce mature spermatozoa from spermatogonia in three phases: (i) spermatocytogenesis (mitosis), (ii) meiosis, and (iii) spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hess and Renato de Franca 2008</xref>). This delicate process can be easily disturbed and further cause male reproductive disorders. Male infertility affects 7% of men in the general population, and its causes vary, ranging from anatomical or genetic abnormalities, systemic diseases, infections, trauma, iatrogenic injury, and gonadotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Krausz et al. 2018</xref>). Approximately 10% of the human genome is related to reproductive processes; thus, male infertility is often predicted to be largely genetic in origin, whereas only 4% of infertile men are diagnosed with a distinct genetic cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Krausz and Riera-Escamilla 2018</xref>). Genetic causes are highly heterologous and involve chromosomal abnormalities, point mutations in single genes, copy number variations, microRNA dysfunction, and polygenic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Meschede and Horst 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Traven et al. 2017</xref>). The highest percentage of known genetic factors that account for up to 25% of male infertility are karyotype anomalies, Y chromosome microdeletions, and <italic>CFTR</italic> mutations, which are mostly associated with azoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Krausz and Riera-Escamilla 2018</xref>). However, in a relatively high proportion of infertile men (40%), the etiology cannot be recognized and is also referred to as idiopathic. With the help of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), some men have the chance to reproduce, however, there is a risk of passing on undetermined genetic abnormalities. In addition, genetic defects leading to fertilization failure and embryo development arrest cannot be effectively rescued by ART; thus, discovering novel genetic factors and further confirming their molecular mechanisms are of clinical importance.</p>
<p>Calcium (Ca) is an essential element that acts as a universal intracellular second messenger. Ca is indispensable for many physiological processes in male reproduction, including spermatogenesis, sperm movement, capacitation, hyperactivation, acrosome reaction, chemotaxis, and fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Valsa et al. 2015</xref>). Therefore, Ca deficiency is mentioned to be a main contributor to male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Beigi Harchegani et al. 2019</xref>). Calmodulin (CaM) is defined as a major Ca sensor that activates many kinds of enzymes in response to an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> by interacting with a diverse group of cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Klee et al. 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Means et al. 1982</xref>). CaM binds to proteins through recognition motifs, including the short CaM-binding motif containing conserved Ile and Gln residues (IQ motif) for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding and two related motifs for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nie et al. 2009</xref>). The identified IQ motif-containing proteins include a good range of proteins with biological functions, one of which is sperm surface proteins, suggesting that IQ motif-containing proteins might play a potential role in male reproductive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wen et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dolmetsch et al. 2001</xref>). Moreover, it has been revealed that CaM is predominantly expressed in the mammalian testis, from the pachytene to meiotic division stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Smoake et al. 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kakiuchi et al. 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">YAMAMOTO 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Sano et al. 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Kägi et al. 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Moriya et al. 1995</xref>). However, limited IQ motif-containing proteins have been reported to be responsible for male fertility. It has been shown that the IQ motif-containing D (IQCD) is primarily accumulated in the acrosome area of spermatids during mouse spermiogenesis, and the acrosome reaction was inhibited in human spermatozoa by anti-IQCD antibody, suggesting a potential function of IQCD in fertilization and the acrosome reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zhang et al. 2019</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Iqcf1</italic> knockout (KO) male mice showed significantly less fertility, which was related to reduced sperm motility and acrosome reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fang et al. 2015</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Iqcg</italic> is required for mouse spermiogenesis, which is attributable to its role in flagellar formation and/or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Harris et al. 2014</xref>). Humans and mice without IQCN presented failed fertilization rates related to manchette assembly defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dai et al. 2022</xref>). Although reliable findings provide substantial clues for IQ motif-containing proteins participating in male reproductive processes, the relevant regulatory mechanism and the function of many other IQ motif-containing proteins in spermatogenesis have not been determined thus far.</p>
<p>Here, we revealed a novel IQ motif-containing protein, IQCH, which is essential for spermiogenesis and fertilization. Disrupting IQCH leads to deficient acrosome action and abnormal structure of the axoneme and mitochondria in both humans and mice. Moreover, it is suggested that the interaction of IQCH and CaM is a prerequisite for IQCH function, which further regulates the expression of RNA-binding proteins (especially HNRPAB) during spermatogenesis. Collectively, our findings unveiled a novel genetic diagnostic indicator of male infertility, and the uncovered mechanism of IQCH in spermatogenesis might shed new light on the treatment of this disease.</p>

<title>Identification of a novel IQ motif-containing protein, IQCH, involved in male fertility</title>
<p>A 33-year-old man from a consanguineous family with primary infertility for four years was recruited in our study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Semen analysis of this patient revealed an inordinately decreasing sperm motility and count, as well as abnormal sperm morphology (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In addition to the proband, his great uncle was also affected, he had never conceived during sexual intercourse without contraception in his marriage. We further explored the possible genetic cause through WES analysis, and a homozygous deletion variant in <italic>IQCH</italic> (c.387+1_387+10del) was identified in the proband. This variant is rare in the general human population according to the 1000 Genomes Project (0.007%), ExAC Browser (0.059%), and gnomAD databases (0.024%). We further clarified the putative contribution of this variant in this family by Sanger sequencing. Noticeably, this homozygous variant was affirmed in his infertile great-uncle, and the fertile parents of the proband carried the heterozygote of this variant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Moreover, we used the minigene splicing assay to examine the effect of this variant on <italic>IQCH</italic> mRNA splicing. The electrophoresis results revealed that WT-<italic>IQCH</italic> yielded one transcript with a size of 381[bp, whereas the Mut-<italic>IQCH</italic> resulted in one strong band of 263[bp (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, i). Sanger sequencing further showed that the variant resulted in the absence of the whole exon 4, which was expected to translate into a truncated protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, ii and iii). Therefore, we further constructed a plasmid containing the aberrant cDNA sequence of <italic>IQCH</italic> caused by the splicing mutation to verify the effect of the variant on protein expression. The western blotting results showed that the Mut-c<italic>IQCH</italic> plasmid did not express IQCH while the WT-c<italic>IQCH</italic> plasmid did (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, iv). We further conducted immunofluorescence staining of spermatozoa from the proband and the control. We barely detected the expression of IQCH protein in the spermatozoa from the proband compared to the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Taken together, these results reveal that this identified <italic>IQCH</italic> variant is responsible for the splicing abnormality and further causes the lack of IQCH expression, which is likely the genetic cause of male infertility in this family.</p>

<title>Nonfunctional IQCH leads to sperm with cracked axoneme structures accompanied by defects in the acrosome and mitochondria</title>
<p>A comprehensive sperm morphology analysis was further conducted on the proband (the semen was not available from his great-uncle). Papanicolaou staining revealed that the spermatozoa displayed multiple flagellar morphological abnormalities, such as coiled, bent, irregular, and even fractured tails (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These morphological anomalies were confirmed more precisely by SEM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Significantly, more subtle abnormalities, such as axoneme exposure, bending, and cracking, were further identified between the midpiece and the principal piece of the proband’s spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). As expected, a deranged or incomplete ‘9+2’ microtubule structure of the flagella were observed from the proband by TEM analysis (fig. S1, A). In addition, we detected ultrastructural defects in the spermatozoa nucleus, including irregular shape, large vacuoles, and deformed acrosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The mitochondria of the spermatozoa had an abnormal arrangement and enlarged diameter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Moreover, we performed immunofluorescence staining for the marker of the acrosome (peanut agglutinin: PNA) as well as the mitochondrial marker (Transcription Factor A, Mitochondrial: TFAM) to confirm the deficient of the acrosomes and mitochondria in the proband’s spermatozoa. The results of the PNA and TFAM staining suggested that the spermatozoa acrosomes and mitochondria were severely defective in the proband compared to the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, D and E). In addition, we performed SEPTIN4 (SEPT4) staining, a functional marker of the annulus, to explore whether the flagellar fracture at the joint between the middle piece and principal piece was caused by a nonfunctional annulus. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the SEPT4 signal of the spermatozoa between the proband and the control (fig. S1, B).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Impairment of male fertility in mice without <italic>Iqch</italic></title>
<p>To further consolidate the role of IQCH in male reproduction, we first explored the pattern of <italic>Iqch</italic> expression in mice by qPCR and found that <italic>Iqch</italic> was predominantly expressed in the mouse testis compared to other organs (fig. S2, A). Additionally, we investigated the temporal expression of <italic>Iqch</italic> in mouse testes on different postnatal days. The results revealed that the expression of <italic>Iqch</italic> showed a significant increase on postnatal Day 21, peaked on postnatal Day 35, and then presented stable expression (fig. S2, A). To better understand the role of IQCH during spermatogenesis, we performed immunofluorescence staining of the germ cells at different developmental stages in human and mouse testes. The exact localization of IQCH shared the same pattern in human and mouse spermatogenesis, being mainly detected in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes and round spermatids and the flagella of late spermatids (fig. S2, B and C). The testis-enriched expression of <italic>Iqch</italic>/IQCH suggested its potential role in spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>We next generated <italic>Iqch</italic> knockout (KO) mice using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We used a guide RNA targeting exons 2 through 3 of <italic>Iqch</italic> to achieve the knockout (fig. S3, A). PCR, RT-PCR, and western blotting analysis further confirmed the success of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mouse construction (fig. S3, B). The <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice showed no overt abnormalities in their development or behavior. The <italic>Iqch</italic> KO female mice showed normal fertility, and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining further showed that the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO female mice had normal follicle development compared to the WT mice (fig. S3, C-E). However, the fertility of the KO male mice was significantly reduced compared to that of the WT mice, including a reduction in the pregnancy rate and litter size (Fig. S3, F). There was no detectable difference in the testis/body weight ratio between the WT and <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice (fig. S3, G), and the histology of testes and epididymides in the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice showed no obvious abnormalities compared to the WT mice (fig. S4, A and B).</p>
<p>However, the results of the computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) affirmed that sperm motility was significantly reduced in the KO mice, and the sperm count was slightly decreased (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Movie S1 and S2). Moreover, morphological anomalies of the sperm flagella were easily observed, such as an unmasking, bending, or cracking axoneme, which recapitulated the flagellar phenotype of the infertile patient (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, A and B). We further found that during the spermatogenic process, the abnormality of axoneme exposure had already occurred when the spermatozoa flagellum developed (fig. S5, A). Intriguingly, tail defects, including bending and cracking between the middle piece and the principal piece, were mainly present in the epididymal spermatozoa (fig. S5, B), suggesting that more severe flagellum breakage might occur during sperm movement.</p>

<p>We further performed TEM analysis to investigate the ultrastructural defects in the testicular and epididymal spermatozoa of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice. In contrast to the WT mice, the spermatozoa of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice showed dilated intermembrane spaces of mitochondria and even loss of some mitochondrial material (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). However, the annulus did not present significant differences between the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO and WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), indicating that the disruptive link between the flagellar middle piece and the principal piece might result from mitochondrial defects but not the annulus.

<title>Poor IVF outcomes in the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO male mice</title>
<p>To evaluate the cause of the damaged fertility of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO male mice, mature oocytes from WT female mice in their reproductive period were retrieved and placed into culture dishes with sperm from the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice and WT mice for IVF treatment. We found that 70% of the embryos had pronuclei in the WT group, while the fertilization rate of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO group was dramatically reduced, accounting for 47% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Consequently, the rates of both two-cell embryos and blastocysts were significantly lower in the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO male mice than in the WT male mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Noticeably, the inactive acrosome reaction was observed in most of the sperm from the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), leading to the inability to cross the zona pellucida (fig.

<title>RNA-binding proteins are the most relevant targets by which IQCH regulates spermatogenesis</title>
<p>To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which IQCH regulates male fertility, we performed LC-MS/MS analysis using mouse sperm lysates and detected 288 interactors of IQCH. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the IQCH-bound proteins revealed a particular enrichment in fertilization, sperm axoneme assembly, mitochondrial organization, calcium channel, and RNA processing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).

A total of 1,993 differential proteins were quantified, including 807 upregulated proteins and 1,186 downregulated proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).

<p>Importantly, the cross-analysis revealed that 76 proteins were shared between the IQCH-bound proteins and the IQCH-activated proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), implicating this subset of genes as direct targets. Among the 76 proteins, 21 were RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), 10 of which were suggested to be involved in spermatogenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kuroda et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Yang et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chapman et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fukuda et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Legrand et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sechi et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Liang et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tian and Petkov 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wang et al. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Xu et al. 2022</xref>); 8 were involved in mitochondrial function; and 4 were calcium channel activity-related proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). We focused on SYNCRIP, HNRNPK, FUS, EWSR1, ANXA7, SLC25A4, and HNRPAB, the loss of which showed the greatest influence on the phenotype of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice. Specifically, SYNCRIP, HNRNPK, FUS, EWSR1, and HNRPAB are RBPs that are linked to spermatogenesis by controlling mRNA translation or spermatid post-meiotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kuroda et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fukuda et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sechi et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tian and Petkov 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Xu et al. 2022</xref>).

</fig>
<p>Among these interactors of IQCH, HNRPAB was the most significantly downregulated protein seen by proteomic analysis (Data S1), implying that HNRPAB might be the main target of IQCH. As an RBP, HNRPAB has been suggested to play an important role in spermatogenesis by regulating the translation of testicular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fukuda et al. 2013</xref>). We thus employed RNA-seq analysis using the sperm from the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO and WT mice to investigate the effects of RNA levels when IQCH is absent. Importantly, among the downregulated genes, most were related to male fertility, such as axoneme assembly, spermatid differentiation, flagellated sperm motility, and fertilization (fig. S9). We hypothesized that this downregulation is linked to HNRPAB binding. Considering the disrupted fertilization and axoneme assembly in the <italic>Igch</italic> KO mice, we chose the essential molecules involved in these two processes, including <italic>Catsper1</italic>, <italic>Catsper2</italic>, <italic>Catsper3</italic>, <italic>Ccdc40</italic>, <italic>Ccdc39</italic>, <italic>Ccdc65</italic>, <italic>Dnah8</italic>, <italic>Irrc6,</italic> and <italic>Dnhd1</italic>, to confirm our speculation. We carried out RNA immunoprecipitation on formaldehyde cross-linked sperm followed by qPCR to evaluate the interactions between HNRPAB and <italic>Catsper1</italic>, <italic>Catsper2</italic>, <italic>Catsper3</italic>, <italic>Ccdc40</italic>, <italic>Ccdc39</italic>, <italic>Ccdc65</italic>, <italic>Dnah8</italic>, <italic>Irrc6,</italic> and <italic>Dnhd1</italic> in the KO and WT mice. As expected, the binding between HNRPAB and those important molecules was detected in the WT mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), supporting the functional role of HNRPAB in testicular mRNAs. Intriguingly, significantly decreased interactions between HNRPAB and those molecules were observed in the KO mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Therefore, it is indicated that IQCH is involved in spermatogenesis by mainly regulating RBPs, especially HNRPAB, to further mediate essential mRNA expression in the testis.</p>

<title>The interaction of IQCH and CaM is a prerequisite for IQCH function</title>
<p>Given that IQCH is a calmodulin-binding protein, we hypothesized that IQCH regulates these key molecules by interacting with CaM (fig. S10, A and B). As expected, CaM interacted with IQCH, as indicated by LC-MS/MS analysis. We initially confirmed the binding of IQCH and CaM in the WT sperm but not in the KO sperm by the Co-IP assay (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). In addition, their colocalization was detected during spermatogenesis by immunofluorescence staining (fig. S10, C).</p>
<p>To confirm that the interaction of IQCH and CaM is the prerequisite for regulating HNRPAB expression, we downregulated IQCH or CaM in K562 cells, which express both IQCH and CaM. As expected, reduced binding of IQCH and CaM was observed in both cell lines with IQCH or CaM knocked down, with a concomitant decrease in the expression of HNRPAB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>, fig. S10, D). We then overexpressed IQCH and knocked down CaM or overexpressed CaM and knocked down IQCH in K562 cells to check the change in HNRPAB levels. Consistently, the two situations also showed a reduction in the expression of HNRPAB resulting from the diminished interaction between IQCH and CaM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>, fig. S10, E).</p>
<p>We further confirmed that the IQ motif of IQCH is required for CaM binding using a microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay. The binding affinity between IQCH (target) from cell lysates overexpressing GFP-<italic>IQCH</italic> plasmids and recombinant CaM (ligand) was enhanced with increasing concentrations of recombinant CaM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). However, their binding was disrupted when the IQ motif of IQCH was deleted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). The Co-IP assay verified the above findings (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). Not surprisingly, the expression of HNRPAB in cells co-transfected with <italic>IQCH</italic> (△IQ) and <italic>CaM</italic> plasmids was lower than that in the cells overexpressing the WT-<italic>IQCH</italic> and <italic>CaM</italic> plasmids (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). Collectively, our findings suggest that IQCH interacts with CaM via IQ-motif to manipulate the expression of important molecules, especially HNRPAB, to play a role in spermatogenesis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Throughout the evolution of divergent species, IQCH has been conserved, indicating its fundamental role in organisms. As a novel CaM-binding protein, IQCH was first identified in human and mouse testes and exclusively localized in spermatocytes and spermatids, suggesting its potential activity in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yin et al. 2005</xref>). However, since IQCH was identified, no other findings have supported its function in male reproduction. In this study, we found that the mutation of <italic>IQCH</italic> impaired male fertility, including flagellar morphological abnormalities and axoneme cracking. Aberrant ultrastructure in sperm with the <italic>IQCH</italic> mutation was associated with severely defective acrosomes and mitochondria. Furthermore, <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice showed similar irregularities in the flagellum, especially the axoneme and mitochondria. We also identified that <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice displayed different degrees of functional defects in acrosomes. Thus, our work supported the vital role of IQCH in flagellar and acrosome development.</p>
<p>To date, only four IQ motif-containing proteins, including IQCD, IQCF1, IQCG, and IQCN, have been suggested to participate in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Harris et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fang et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zhang et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dai et al. 2022</xref>). Most IQ motif-containing proteins function in Ca<sup>2+</sup>dependent biological processes by binding to CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Harris et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fang et al. 2015</xref>); thus, IQCD, IQCF1, and IQCN are involved in fertilization and are relevant to the acrosome reaction, sperm capacitation, or manchette assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fang et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zhang et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dai et al. 2022</xref>). In addition, because CaM has an impact on the actin cytoskeleton, <italic>Iqcg</italic> KO mice exhibit a detachment of sperm heads from tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Harris et al. 2014</xref>). In our study, the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice also showed an impaired acrosome reaction, which caused reduced fertilization. Intriguingly, the axoneme breaks at the annulus and the mitochondrial defects were outstanding in the flagella of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice, whose phenotypes were unexplored in the previously discovered IQ motif-containing proteins. Because CaM activation can stimulate actin cytoskeleton changes, it is reasonable that flagellum formation is defective when IQCH is absent. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a key player in the regulation of mitochondrial functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bravo-Sagua et al. 2017</xref>). Thus, the absence of IQCH leads to a failed interaction with CaM and disrupts normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which consequently causes mitochondrial defects in <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice and patients with <italic>IQCH</italic> variants. Our findings suggest that the fertilization function is the main action of IQ motif-containing proteins, while the IQ motif-containing protein has its own role in spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>However, there are few publications regarding the underlying mechanism of IQ motif-containing proteins manipulating reproductive processes, except for a recent study that stated that IQCN interacted with CaM to regulate the expression of CaM-binding proteins, including manchette-related proteins (LZTFL1, KIF27, and RSPH6A), IFT family proteins and their motor proteins (IFT22, IFT43, IFT74, IFT81, IFT140, IFT172, WDR19, TTC21B, and DYNC2H1), and ribosomal protein family proteins (RPS5, RPS25, RPS27, and RPSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dai et al. 2022</xref>). In our study, it was observed that IQCH regulates the expression of RBPs by their interactions. RBPs are a large class of proteins that assemble with RNAs to form ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). RBPs function at various stages of RNA processing, including alternative splicing, RNA modification, nuclear export, localization, stability, and translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Corley et al. 2020</xref>). RNA processing in male reproductive biology is essential for the production of mature sperm, and many RBPs have been demonstrated to be indispensable during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Morgan et al. 2021</xref>). Among the RBPs, HNRPAB, a heterogeneous nuclear RNP, showed the most significant reduction among the downregulated interactors of IQCH, suggesting that HNRPAB might be the most important employee of IQCH. It has been reported that HNRPAB plays a central role in spermatogenesis by regulating stage-specific translation of testicular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fukuda et al. 2013</xref>). As expected, a RIP assay using an anti-HNRPAB antibody revealed binding between HNRPAB and the mRNAs of several important genes (<italic>Catsper1</italic>, <italic>Catsper2</italic>, <italic>Catsper3</italic>, <italic>Ccdc40</italic>, <italic>Ccdc39</italic>, <italic>Ccdc65</italic>, <italic>Dnah8</italic>, <italic>Irrc6</italic>, and <italic>Dnhd1</italic>) involved in spermatogenesis. We further found that the interaction of IQCH and CaM is a prerequisite for regulating HNRPAB expression. We thus hypothesized that IQCH regulates male fertility by binding to CaM and controls HNRPAB to manipulate the expression of key mRNAs involved in spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study identified a novel IQ motif-containing protein-coding gene, <italic>IQCH</italic>/<italic>Iqch</italic>, which is responsible for spermatogenesis in humans and mice, broadening the scope of known male infertility-associated genes thus further illustrating the genetic landscape of this disease. In addition, our study suggested an unexplored mechanism in which IQCH regulates the expression of key RBPs in spermatogenesis, especially HNRPAB, by interacting with CaM to play crucial roles in fertilization and axoneme assembly. We believe that our findings will provide genetic diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for infertile males with <italic>IQCH</italic> pathogenic variants.</p>

Sperm was released from the cauda epididymis of 10-week-old male mice, and sperm capacitation was performed for 50 min using a TYH solution. The cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were obtained from the ampulla of the uterine tube 14 h after the hCG injection. The ampulla was torn with a syringe needle, and the COCs were gently squeezed onto liquid drops of an HTF medium. The COCs were then incubated with ∼5 μl of the sperm suspension in HTF liquid drops at 37 °C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 6 h, the eggs were washed several times using an HTF medium to remove the cumulus cells and then transferred to liquid drops of a KSOM medium.</p>

<title>Proteomic quantification</title>
<p>Proteins were extracted from the sperm samples using a RIPA lysis buffer (Applygen, Beijing, China, C1053) containing 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitors on ice. The supernatants were collected following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentrations were calculated by Bradford quantification and SDS-PAGE. An enzyme solution at a ratio of 1:20 of trypsin enzyme (μg) to substrate protein (μg) was added to 100 μg of the protein samples, vortexed, centrifuged at low speed for 1 minute, and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The peptide liquid obtained after salt removal was freeze-dried. The peptide sample was dissolved in 0.5 M TEAB and added to the corresponding iTRAQ labeling reagent and stored at room temperature for 2 h. The Shimadzu LC-20AB liquid phase system was used for purification, and the separation column was a 5 μm 4.6 × 250 mm Gemini C18 column for liquid phase separation of the sample. The dried peptide samples were reconstituted with mobile phase A (2% can, 0.1% FA) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was taken for injection. The separation was performed by UltiMate 3000 UHPLC (Thermo Fisher). The sample was first enriched in a trap column and desalted and then entered into a self-packed C18 column. The peptides separated by the liquid phase chromatography were ionized by a nanoESI source and then passed to a tandem mass spectrometer Q-Exactive HF X (Thermo Fisher) for DDA (Data Dependent Acquisition) mode detection. The raw data were converted to mgf files for bioinformatics analysis, and protein identification from tandem mass spectra was performed by database searching (UniProt). The protein quantification process includes the following steps: protein identification, tag impurity correction, data normalization, missing value imputation, protein ratio calculation, statistical analysis, and results presentation. Proteins with a 1.5-fold change and a p-value (using Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test) less than 0.05 were defined as differentially expressed proteins.</p>

<title>RNA sequencing</title>
<p>Total RNA (∼1 μg) was isolated from fresh spermatozoa from the WT mice (n=3) and the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice (n=3) using the RNAsimple Total RNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech, China, 4992858). A Ribo-Zero™ rRNA Removal Kit (MRZPL1224, llumina) was used to remove rRNA from the samples. RNA integrity was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies). An mRNA sequencing library for the RNA-seq was constructed using the TruSeq RNA Library Prep kit v2 (RS-122-2001, Illumina), followed by paired-end (2[×[100[bp) sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 Sequencing System (Illumina) at the Beijing Genomics Institute. Raw paired-end reads were filtered by FASTX-Toolkit. The quality of the reads was confirmed by FastQC (ver: 0.11.3). The raw data (raw reads) in the fastq format were processed through in-house Perl scripts. Feature Counts (ver: l.5.0-p3) were used to count the read numbers mapped to each gene. The FPKM of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and the read count mapped to the gene. Signaling pathway matching analysis for the differentially expressed gene (DEG) list was performed using KEGG Mapper in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genome.jp/kegg/">https://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>). The mapping of GO to DEGs was carried out using Blast2GO (ver: 4.1.9).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study combines experiments on human mutation and making a mouse model lacking IQCH and the functional consequences on spermatogenesis. The mouse model is <bold>compelling</bold> but some of the analysis is indirect and <bold>incomplete</bold> and would benefit from more rigorous direct approaches. With the experimental evidence that supports direct interaction between IQCH and potential RNA binding proteins strengthened, this paper would be of interest to cell biologists and male reproductive biologists working on the sperm flagellar cytoskeleton and mitochondrial structure.</p>

<p>By identifying a loss of function mutant of IQCH in an infertile patient, Ruan et al. show that IQCH is essential for spermiogenesis by generating a knockout mouse model of IQCH. Similar to infertile patients with a mutant of IQCH, IQCH knockout mice are characterized by a cracked flagellar axoneme and abnormal mitochondrial structure. Mechanistically, IQCH regulates the expression of RNA-binding proteins (especially HNRPAB), which are indispensable for spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>Although this manuscript contains a potentially interesting piece of work that delineates a mechanism of IQCH that associates with spermatogenesis, this reviewer feels that a number of issues require clarification and re-evaluation for a better understanding of the role of IQCH in spermatogenesis. With the shortage of logic and supporting data, causal relationships are still not clear among IQCH, CaM, and HNRPAB. The most serious point in this manuscript could be that the authors try to generalize their interpretations with a model that is too simplified from limited pieces of their data. The way the data and the logic are presented needs to be largely revised, and several interpretations should be supported by direct evidence.</p>

<p>The manuscript &quot;IQCH regulates spermatogenesis by interacting with CaM to promote RNA-binding proteins' expression&quot; by Ruan et al. identified a homozygous variant affecting the splicing of IQCH in two infertile men from a Chinese family. The authors also generated an IQCH knockout mouse model to confirm the abnormal sperm phenotypes associated with IQCH deficiency. Further molecular biological assays supported the important role and mechanism of IQCH in spermatogenesis. This manuscript is informative for clinical and basic research on male infertility.</p>

<p>In this study, Ruan et al. investigate the role of the IQCH gene in spermatogenesis, focusing on its interaction with calmodulin and its regulation of RNA-binding proteins. The authors examined sperm from a male infertility patient with an inherited IQCH mutation as well as IQCH CRISPR knockout mice. The authors found that both human and mouse sperm exhibited structural and morphogenetic defects in multiple structures, leading to reduced fertility in ICHQ-knockout male mice. Molecular analyses such as mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation indicated that RNA-binding proteins are likely targets of IQCH, with the authors focusing on the RNA-binding protein HNRPAB as a critical regulator of testicular mRNAs. The authors used in vitro cell culture models to demonstrate an interaction between IQCH and calmodulin, in addition to showing that this interaction via the IQ motif of IQCH is required for IQCH's function in promoting HNRPAB expression. In sum, the authors concluded that IQCH promotes male fertility by binding to calmodulin and controlling HNRPAB expression to regulate the expression of essential mRNAs for spermatogenesis. These findings provide new insight into molecular mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis and how important factors for sperm morphogenesis and function are regulated.</p>
<p>The strengths of the study include the use of mouse and human samples, which demonstrate a likely relevance of the mouse model to humans; the use of multiple biochemical techniques to address the molecular mechanisms involved; the development of a new CRISPR mouse model; ample controls; and clearly displayed results. There are some minor weaknesses in that more background details could be provided to the reader regarding the proteins involved; some assays could benefit from more rigorous quantification; some of the mouse testis images and analyses could be improved; and larger sample sizes, especially for the male mouse breeding tests, could be increased. Overall, the claims made by the authors in this manuscript are well-supported by the data provided and there are only minor technical issues that could increase the robustness and rigor of the study.</p>
<p>1. More background details are needed regarding the proteins involved, in particular IQ proteins and calmodulin. The authors state that IQ proteins are not well-represented in the literature, but do not state how many IQ proteins are encoded in the genome. They also do not provide specifics regarding which calmodulins are involved, since there are at least 5 family members in mice and humans. This information could help provide more granular details about the mechanism to the reader and help place the findings in context.</p>
<p>2. The mouse fertility tests could be improved with more depth and rigor. There was no data regarding copulatory plug rate; data was unclear regarding how many WT females were used for the male breeding tests and how many litters were generated; the general methodology used for the breeding tests in the Methods section was not very explicitly or clearly described; the sample size of n=3 for the male breeding tests is rather small for that type of assay; and, given that ICHQ appears to be expressed in testicular interstitial cells (Fig. S10) and somewhat in other organs (Fig. S2), another important parameter of male fertility that should be addressed is reproductive hormone levels (e.g., LH, FSH, and testosterone).</p>
<p>3. The Western blots in Figure 6 should be rigorously quantified from multiple independent experiments so that there is stronger evidence supporting claims based on those assays.</p>
<p>4. Some of the mouse testis images could be improved. For example, the PNA and PLCz images in Figure S7 are difficult to interpret in that the tubules do not appear to be stage-matched, and since the authors claimed that testicular histology is unaffected in knockout testes, it should be feasible to stage-match control and knockout samples. Also, the anti-ICHQ and CaM immunofluorescence in Figure S10 would benefit from some cell-type-specific co-stains to more rigorously define their expression patterns, and they should also be stage-matched.</p>
