<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Recombinant optogenetic and chemogenetic proteins are potent tools for manipulating neuronal activity and controlling neural circuit function. However, there are few analogous tools for manipulating the structure of neural circuits. Here, we introduce three rationally designed genetically encoded tools that use E3 ligase-dependent mechanisms to trigger the degradation of synaptic scaffolding proteins, leading to functional ablation of synapses. First, we developed a constitutive excitatory synapse ablator, PFE3, analogous to the inhibitory synapse ablator GFE3. PFE3 targets the RING domain of the E3 ligase Mdm2 and the proteasome-interacting region of Protocadherin 10 to the scaffolding protein PSD-95, leading to efficient ablation of excitatory synapses. In addition, we developed a light-inducible version of GFE3, paGFE3, using a novel photoactivatable complex based on the photocleavable protein PhoCl2c. paGFE3 degrades Gephyrin and ablates inhibitory synapses in response to 400 nm light. Finally, we developed a chemically inducible version of GFE3, chGFE3, which degrades inhibitory synapses when combined with the bio-orthogonal dimerizer HaloTag ligand-trimethoprim. Each tool is specific, reversible, and capable of breaking neural circuits at precise locations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neural circuits, groups of neurons connected by synapses, are the basic units of computation in the brain and are fundamental to understanding its function and pathology. Although there are many genetically encoded tools for modulating neuronal function, existing tools for eliminating synapses are inadequate for providing a clear understanding of neural circuits. Previously, we developed GFE3, a protein that can ablate inhibitory synapses efficiently, rapidly, and without toxicity by targeting an E3 ligase to the scaffolding protein Gephyrin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. GFE3 consists of GPHN.FingR (<bold>F</bold>ibronectin <bold>in</bold>trabody <bold>g</bold>enerated by m<bold>R</bold>NA display), a recombinant, antibody-like protein, which binds Gephyrin at inhibitory synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> fused to the RING domain of the E3 ligase XIAP (RING<sub>XIAP</sub>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. GFE3 mediates the ubiquitination of Gephyrin and disassembly of inhibitory synapses. Importantly, it specifically targets postsynaptic sites containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and can be expressed in genetically determined cell types. Thus, GFE3 can manipulate circuits in a manner that is not possible with optogenetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, DREADDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, and modulators of neurotransmitter release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, which donât target specific postsynaptic receptors, or with traditional pharmacological approaches that target specific receptors but do not allow for cell-type specificity. GFE3 has been used to probe the contribution of inhibitory inputs to LTP in hippocampal circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, recurrent loops in the oscillator that drives rhythmic whisking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, and the temporal coordination of vocalization and inspiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, no tool analogous to GFE3 that ablates excitatory synapses currently exists. Furthermore, because GFE3 is constitutively active, its temporal and spatial resolution is limited.</p>
<p>In this study, we generated three tools for ablating synapses based on GFE3: 1. PFE3, an excitatory synapse ablator; 2. paGFE3, a photoactivatable version of GFE3; 3. chGFE3, a chemically activated version of GFE3. We show that the expression of PFE3 in cultured neurons causes the loss of PSD-95 puncta and excitatory synapses, which is reversible. In vivo, its expression leads to the functional loss of excitatory synaptic transmission. We generated paGFE3 by incorporating GPHN.FingR and the RING<sub>XIAP</sub> into a novel photoactivatable complex based on the photocleavable protein PhoCl2c<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. paGE3 is activated by 400 nm light and causes ablation of inhibitory synapses within 5 hr of exposure that is subsequently reversible. In the absence of 400 nm light, paGFE3 has no background activity. In addition, the expression of paGFE3 labels inhibitory synapses, allowing their size and location to be monitored before and after ablation. chGFE3, a chemogenetic version of GFE3 analogous to paGFE3, mediates efficient, reversible degradation of labeled synapses when a cell-permeant chemical is added.</p>

<title>Degrading exogenous PSD-95 through ubiquitination</title>
<p>Initially, to generate an excitatory synapse ablator, we fused RING<sub>XIAP</sub> to PSD-95.FingR, which binds at high affinity and specificity to the scaffolding protein PSD-95, which is found at excitatory synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>XIAP</sub> did not efficiently ablate PSD-95 (data not shown). As an alternative, we fused PSD-95.FingR to the RING domain of the E3 ligase Mdm2 (RING<sub>Mdm2</sub>), which is necessary for PSD-95 degradation and excitatory synapse ablation during homeostatic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. To determine whether PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> degrades PSD-95, we examined how co-expression with PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> affected the expression of exogenous PSD-95-myc in COS7 cells. Cells transfected with PSD-95 alone had a PSD-95-myc expression level of 203 Â± 32 au, as measured by western blot, while the expression level of PSD-95 in cells co-expressing PSD-95-myc and PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> reduced to 107 Â± 12 au, a â¼50% decrease (n = 5, p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA with multiple comparisons). To determine whether this reduction in PSD-95 was due to ubiquitination, we tried a third condition, where the ubiquitination inhibitor TAK243<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> was added to cells co-expressing PSD-95-myc and PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2.</sub> In this case, PSD-95 expression levels increased to 239 Â± 31 au, a â¼20% increase relative to cells expressing PSD-95-myc alone, which was not significant (n = 5, p &gt; 0.6, ANOVA with multiple comparisons). Furthermore, cells co-expressing PSD-95-myc and PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> without TAK243 had â¼55% less PSD-95 vs. those with TAK243, a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA with multiple comparisons, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref><bold>, S1B</bold>).</p>

<p>To test whether TAK243 was blocking ubiquitination, we compared western blot staining of lysates from COS7 cells expressing Ubiquitin-HA with and without TAK243 (Fig. S1A). Staining with anti-HA showed a distinctive laddering pattern in the lane corresponding to cells expressing Ubiquitin-HA without TAK243 consistent with ubiquitination, whereas the lanes corresponding to cells expressing Ubiquitin-HA with TAK243 and a control lane with lysate from untransfected cells showed no staining, confirming that TAK243 blocks ubiquitination. Together, our results are consistent with PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> degrading exogenously expressed PSD-95 through ubiquitination in COS7 cells.</p>

<title>Degradation of endogenous PSD-95 in neurons</title>
<p>To test whether PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> can degrade endogenous neuronal PSD-95, we co-transfected doxycycline (Dox)-inducible TRE-PSD-95.FingR-HA-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> and transcriptionally regulated PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP in 14 DIV (days in vitro) cultures of rat cortical neurons. Note that PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP efficiently labels endogenous PSD-95, allowing its spatial distribution to be mapped in real-time in living cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, transcriptional regulation matches the expression level of PSD-95.FingR with that of endogenous PSD-95, facilitating labeling with very low background. Following incubation for four days, we imaged the neurons for PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP and subsequently induced the expression of PSD-95.FingR-HA-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> with Dox. After 48 hr, we reimaged the neurons for PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP and then fixed and stained them with anti-PSD-95 and anti-HA. We found that PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP labeling was reduced by 85% (p = 0.002, Wilcoxon, n = 9 cells, 3 independent experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>) consistent with efficient ablation of endogenous PSD-95. However, when we counted the number of puncta labeled with PSD-95.FingR at T0 and compared that to the number of puncta labeled with immunostaining of endogenous PSD-95 in the same cells at the end of the experiment, it showed a reduction of only 52% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E, F</xref> p &lt; 0.0001, Mann Whitney, n = 9 cells, 3 independent experiments). A strategy for improving this relatively low ablation rate might be provided by the results of experiments where the expression of MEF2 was found to cause the elimination of excitatory synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In those experiments, efficient synapse elimination was found to require a combination of ubiquitination mediated by Mdm2 and interaction with the proteasome, which was mediated by Protocadherin 10 (PCDH 10). PCDH 10 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cell adhesion protein that binds to both PSD-95 and the proteasome via its proteasome interacting region (PIR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, we reasoned that adding the PIR domain to the PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> complex might increase the efficiency with which PSD-95 is ablated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Optimization of degradation using the Proteasome Interacting Region</title>
<p>We generated a new protein, PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub>-PIR, which we called PFE3. To test PFE3, we co-transfected TRE-PFE3-HA with PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP in dissociated cultures of rat cortical neurons. Following four days of incubation, we imaged the PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP and induced the expression of PFE3-HA with Dox. The neurons were imaged 48 hr after induction of TRE-PFE3 and subsequently fixed and immunostained for endogenous PSD-95 and HA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). By comparing images at T0 and 48 hr, we found that the expression of PFE3 reduced the labeling of PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP by 65%, a significant difference (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B, D</xref>, n = 14 cells, 3 distinct experiments, p &lt; 0.0001, Mann Whitney). When we checked these results by counting PSD-95 puncta labeled with PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP at T0 and immunocytochemistry against endogenous PSD-95 at 48 hr (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), we found that Dox-inducible PFE3 reduced the number of endogenous PSD-95 puncta by 73% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, p &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney). Thus, PFE3 consistently and efficiently reduced both total labeling of PSD-95 by the PSD-95.FingR, and the number of endogenous PSD-95 puncta. As a control, we induced RandE3 (Random.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub>-PIR), which contained a fibronectin scaffold with a random binding pocket instead of PSD-95.FingR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The expression of RandE3 did not significantly affect PSD-95.FingR labeling (an increase of 30%, p &gt; 0.1, Wilcoxon, n = 8, 3 independent experiments) or the number of endogenous PSD-95 puncta (an increase of 2%, p &gt; 0.9, Wilcoxon, n = 8, 3 independent experiments, Fig. S2A-D).</p>

<p>To further characterize the effect of PFE3 expression, we determined how it affected the expression of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which mediate excitatory synaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We immunostained non-transfected cultured cortical neurons for PSD-95 and GluA1, a subunit of the AMPAR, and found that 89 Â± 1% of PSD-95 puncta were positive for GluA1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E, H</xref>, 7,570 synapses, 11 cells, 3 experiments). Neurons co-transfected with the PSD-95.FingR and TRE-RandE3-HA and induced with Dox for 48 hr showed no significant change in the percentage of PSD-95-positive synapses labeled with GluA1 compared to control neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F, H</xref>, 87 Â± 2%, 3,131 synapses, 9 cells, 2 experiments, p &gt; 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparisons). Quantification of GluA1 in PFE3-expressing cells showed that only 41 Â± 5% (1,341 synapses, 10 cells, 2 experiments) of the remaining PSD-95 puncta also contained GluA1, a significant decrease from untransfected cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G, H</xref>, p &lt; 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparisons) and RandE3 expressing cells (p &lt; 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparisons). Based on our result that PFE3 decreases PSD-95 puncta by 73% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and that only 41% of the remaining puncta are positive for GluA1, we estimate that PFE3 decreases the amount of GluA1 by approximately 90%. Thus, our experiments are consistent with PFE3 mediating a significant reduction in both PSD-95 and GluA1. Furthermore, because AMPARs are the predominant ionotropic glutamate receptor responsible for excitatory transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, our results suggest that PFE3 reduces functional excitatory connectivity.</p>

<title>Degradation of PSD-95 with PFE3 is reversible</title>
<p>To test whether the ablation of excitatory synapses by PFE3 is reversible, we used a paradigm used previously for testing GFE3. There, we found that because GFE3 degrades itself, it is sufficient to merely cease the induction of GFE3 expression to reverse its effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we initially transfected TRE-PFE3-P2A-GFP and PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP and incubated for 4 days. We then induced PFE3 expression with Dox for 48 hr and then replaced the medium with Dox-free medium for an additional 5 days to allow excitatory synapses to recover. Cells were imaged immediately before adding Dox, immediately after removing Dox, and after 5 days of incubation in Dox-free medium, followed immediately by fixation and immunostaining. We found that, as in previous experiments, the induction of PFE3 reduced PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP labeling (â81 Â± 5%, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I, J, L</xref>, p &lt; 0.01, Friedman multiple comparison) and a reduction in PSD-95.FingR puncta (â80 Â± 5%, p &lt; 0.01, Friedman multiple comparison, n = 8 cells, 4 experiments). Five days following removal of Dox, PSD-95.FingR labeling increased by 450 Â± 100%, which was significant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J-L</xref>, p &lt; 0.01, Friedman multiple comparison) and the number of PSD-95.FingR puncta increased by 400 Â± 65% (p &lt; 0.05, Friedman multiple comparison). PSD-95.FingR labeling was not significantly different before the addition of Dox vs. after its removal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2L</xref>, - 10 Â± 20%, p &gt; 0.5, Friedman multiple comparison), similarly the number of PSD-95.FingR puncta did not show a significant change before induction of PFE3 vs. after its removal (â11 Â± 18%, p &gt; 0.9, Friedman multiple comparison). Furthermore, immunocytochemistry of neurons following incubation with Dox-free media showed that endogenous PSD-95 is found on dendritic spines following synapse regrowth (Fig. S2J). Finally, PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP puncta showed a similar distribution overall before and after ablation (Fig. S2K). These results are consistent with PSD-95 degradation by PFE3 being reversible.</p>
<p>In a control experiment with RandE3, neurons showed no significant change in the total PSD-95.FingR labeling (+ 8 Â± 6%, p &gt; 0.9, Friedman test multiple comparisons, n = 13, 2 experiments) or the number of PSD-</p>
<p>95.FingR puncta (+8 Â± 6%, p &gt; 0.9, Friedman test multiple comparisons) before and after induction of RandE3 for 48 hr (Fig. S2E-H). Five days after the removal of Dox, both the total PSD-95.FingR labeling and the number of PSD-95.FingR puncta showed a nonsignificant decrease when compared with immediately before Dox addition (Fig. S2F-H, â20 Â± 6%, p &gt; 0.05, and â15 Â± 5%, p &gt; 0.2, respectively, Friedman multiple comparisons). Comparing the PSD-95.FingR before induction of RandE3 at T0 and 5 days after removal of Dox, we found nonsignificant changes in the total amount of PSD-95.FingR labeling (Fig. S2E, G, H â14 Â± 7%, p &gt; 0.1, Friedman multiple comparison) and the number of PSD-95.FingR puncta (â10 Â± 6%, p &gt; 0.7, Friedman multiple comparisons). Immunocytochemistry of the cells 5 days after removal of Dox confirms the labeling by PSD-95.FingR (Fig. S2I, J). Thus, PSD-95 degradation only occurs when the RING<sub>Mdm2</sub>-PIR domains are targeted by PSD-95.FingR. Finally, cotransfection of PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP and TRE-PFE3-P2A-GFP without exposure to Dox results in labeling of PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP that is not significantly different from labeling in cultures transfected with PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP alone, both in terms of total PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP labeling (p &gt; 0.2, Mann Whitney) and number of labeled puncta (p &gt; 0.4, Mann Whitney, Fig. S2L).</p>

These mice were injected intravitreally with AAVs encoding either CAG-PFE3-P2A-GFP or CAG-RandE3-P2A-GFP. After 3-4 weeks, retinas were isolated and mounted in a chamber for patch clamp recording as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Retinas were perfused in ACSF bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/ 5%CO<sub>2</sub>. ACET (1 ÂµM) and L-AP4 (10 ÂµM) were added to block synaptic transmission from photoreceptors to Off and On bipolar cells, respectively, to eliminate their natural response to light. Infected cells were identified by GFP expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). GFP-positive On Alpha retinal ganglion cells (Î±-RGCs) were identified by their large cell bodies, and their identity was confirmed by dye filling. Full-field 495 nm light (0.9 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) was delivered to the retina for 500 ms to trigger EPSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Synaptic currents were evoked by optogenetic stimulation of type 6 bipolar cells, which provide approximately 70% of the total synaptic input to On Î±-RGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. At a holding potential of â60 mV, these synaptic currents are almost purely AMPAergic, as the AMPAR antagonist DNQX blocks the response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Compared to RGCs infected with the control virus, RGCs infected with the PFE3 virus had EPSCs with &gt; 80% reduction in amplitude, 79 Â± 30 pA (n = 9 cells, 5 mice) vs. 445 Â± 78 pA (n = 8 cells, 3 mice), a significant difference (p &lt; 0.001, Mann Whitney, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-D</xref>), which is consistent with a reduction in postsynaptic receptor density. Overall, our results are consistent with PFE3 expression leading to the degradation of PSD-95, which, in turn, reduces the number of AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses, causing a reduction in synaptic transmission.</p>

<title>Photoactivatable degradation of inhibitory synapses</title>
<p>To generate a photoactivatable version of GFE3 to ablate inhibitory synapses, we first used existing photodimerization systems, such as the Cryptochrome (Cry2) system, but we found them to have substantial background activity leading to loss of inhibitory synapses even in the dark (Fig. S4A). To overcome this deficiency, we developed a new photoactivatable complex based on the intrinsically photocleavable protein PhoCl. PhoCl undergoes cleavage when exposed to violet (â¼400 nm) light, creating two peptides, the C-terminal ten amino acids, including the chromophore, and the remainder of the protein, referred to as the âempty barrelâ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Following photocleavage, a novel epitope is exposed on the empty barrel. Based on this property of PhoCl, we developed a photoactivatable complex, PhLIC (<bold>Ph</bold>oCl-based <bold>L</bold>ight-<bold>I</bold>nducible <bold>C</bold>omplex), consisting of the empty barrel and a 10-mer peptide called PhoCl binding peptide (PBP) that binds to the empty barrel but not to full-length PhoCl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Because PhoCl does not undergo cleavage in the dark or ambient light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, there should be no background formation of PhLIC. To generate PBP, we used the <italic>in vitro</italic> directed evolution technique, mRNA display, which we have used to create binders to synaptic proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> (Fig. S3A). We first constructed a library of â¼10<sup>14</sup> semi-random 10-mers, where each amino acid was biased towards the corresponding amino acid in the original C-terminus of PhoCl. Following the first selection, which lasted six rounds, we found PBPs that bound to cleaved PhoCl in COS7 cells but not in neurons (data not shown). We then remade the library by amplifying the remaining PBPs after the sixth selection round and performing another selection.</p>

<p>We tested the results of this second selection by generating full-length and photocleaved PhoCl2c (see methods) and then pulling it down with PBP. Note that PhoCl2c is an improved version of the original PhoCl containing 5 mutations and with faster and more efficient cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. We found that PBP pulled down photocleaved PhoCl2c, but not full-length PhoCl2c (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting that PhoCl2c/PBP complex, which we called PhLIC (<bold>Ph</bold>oCl-based <bold>L</bold>ight-<bold>I</bold>nducible <bold>C</bold>omplex), could act as a photoactivatable system with low background. We further tested PhLIC by co-transfecting COS7 cells with Golgi-targeted PhoCl2c (GTS-PhoCl2c) and PBP-tagRFP and exposing them to 400 nm light. If PBP binds to photocleaved PhoCl2c but not full-length PhoCl2c, we would expect PBP-tagRFP to be expressed diffusely throughout the cell initially and then translocate to the Golgi after photocleavage of PhoCl2c (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Following expression in COS-7 cells, GTS-PhoCl2c localized in a concentrated oval in the center of the cell consistent with Golgi localization. In contrast, PBP-tagRFP localized diffusely throughout the cytoplasm, with a ratio of labeling in the area colocalized with GTS-PhoCl2c vs. the rest of the cell of 1.5 Â± 0.1 (n = 11 cells, 2 experiments, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, E</xref>). Following exposure to 400 nm light for 1 min and incubation in the dark for 3 hr, PBP-tagRFP became 3.3 Â± 0.5 times more concentrated in the area colocalized with GTS-PhoCl2c staining than vs. the rest of the cell, a significant difference (P &lt; 0.001, n = 11, Wilcoxon, 2 experiments <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, F</xref>). Note that exposure to ambient light did not affect the localization of PBP-tagRFP (Fig. S3B-E), and exposing cells transfected only with tagRFP to 400 nm did not affect the localization of tagRFP (Fig. S3F-I). These experiments suggest that PhLIC shows robust activation upon exposure to 400 nm light but no activation in ambient light.</p>

<title>Photoactivatable GFE3</title>
<p>To generate a photoactivatable version of GFE3 using PhLIC (paGFE3), we fused PhoCl2c to transcriptionally controlled Gephyrin FingR (tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl2c) and PBP to RING<sub>XIAP</sub> (PBP-E3). Note that tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl2c performs two functions. It is targeted to inhibitory synapses, where it acts as an anchor that recruits PBP-E3 once PhoCl2c has been cleaved. It also acts as a label, allowing inhibitory synapses to be visualized before and after PhCl2c is cleaved (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). To test whether paGFE3 labels inhibitory synapses, we expressed tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl in cortical neurons in culture and co-labeled tagRFP and endogenous Gephyrin. The two labels are colocalized, consistent with tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl labeling inhibitory synapses (Fig. S4B). To test if paGFE3 caused background degradation of inhibitory synapses, we compared cultured cortical neurons transfected with paGFE3 (transcriptionally regulated tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl and PBP-E3) with similar neurons transfected with tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl alone and incubated for 5 days. Quantification of tagRFP labeling showed an 8% reduction, which was not significant (n = 10 cells, 1 experiment, p &gt; 0.4, Mann Whitney, Fig. S4A), consistent with no background degradation of Gephyrin in the dark. In contrast, when Cry2-tagRFP-GPHN.FingR and CIB1-RING<sub>XIAP</sub> were co-transfected into cultured cortical neurons and incubated for five days, tagRFP labeling was 48% less than when GPHN.FingR-Cry2-tagRFP was transfected by itself (650 Â± 90, au, n = 10 cells, 1 experiment vs.1250 Â± 110 au, n = 9 cells, 1 experiment), a significant difference (p &lt; 0.001, Mann Whitney, Fig. S4A).</p>

<p>To test whether the paGFE3 could mediate light-dependent degradation of Gephyrin, we expressed both components of paGFE3 (tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl2c and PBP-E3) in cultured cortical neurons and incubated them for five days. Subsequently, neurons were intermittently exposed to 400 nm light for 1 min (see methods). After 5 hr, the cultures were reimaged. The neurons showed a 61 Â± 3% reduction in tagRFP labeling (130 Â± 9 a.u. vs. 52 Â± 6 a.u., a significant difference, p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon, n=17 cells, 3 experiments, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-E</xref>) and a 40 Â± 6% drop in the number of GPHN.FingR puncta (268 Â± 24 vs. 161 Â± 20 puncta), a significant change (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon, n=17, 3 experiments, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-E</xref>). Importantly, cells expressing transcriptionally regulated tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl2c without PBP-RING had a much smaller reduction in labeling (10 Â± 2%, Fig. S4C-E) when exposed to 400 nm light as above, although it was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon, n=14 cells, 3 experiments, Fig. S4). However, the number of Gephyrin puncta labeled by the GPHN.FingR did not show a significant change (0.4 Â± 2%, p &gt; 0.7, Wilcoxon, n = 14 cells, 3 experiments, Fig. S4E), indicating the reduction in total GPHN.FingR labeling is likely a result of photobleaching and not due to the decrease in Gephyrin. Thus, our results are consistent with cells expressing paGFE3 undergoing efficient degradation of Gephyrin puncta when exposed to 400 nm light.</p>
<p>To determine whether Gephyrin ablation mediated by paGFE3 is reversible, we transfected both components of pa-GFE3 in dissociated cortical neurons as before. Four days after transfection, cells were imaged and then exposed to 400 nm light for 1 minute at time point T0. Five hr later, the cells were reimaged and incubated for another four days, at which point they were imaged again. We reasoned that the PhLIC-GFE3 complexes would be self-degrading, as was GFE3. Thus, in the absence of light, they should be degraded and allow regeneration of Gephyrin puncta after a sufficient waiting period. Comparing the images, we found the total fluorescence from the tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl2c label was reduced by 63 Â± 5% between T0 and +5 hr, then increased by 130 Â± 28% between +5 hr and +4 day, a significant difference (p &lt; 0.001 for T0 to +5 hr; p &lt; 0.05, +5 hr to +4 days, Friedman test, multiple comparisons, n = 9 cells, 2 experiments, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-I</xref>). In addition, there was a 20 Â± 9% decrease from T0 to +4 days, which was not significant (p &gt; 0.1, Friedman test, multiple comparisons, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>), suggesting that paGFE3 is reversible. We found similar results when we counted the number of GPHN.FingR puncta which showed a 43 Â± 7% reduction (p &lt; 0.01, Friedman test, multiple comparisons) followed by a 76 Â± 22% increase (P &lt; 0.05, Friedman test, multiple comparisons), representing a nonsignificant 6 Â± 12% decrease from the original (p &gt; 0.99, Friedman test, multiple comparisons, n = 9 cells, 2 experiments). We also found that puncta before and after ablation were in similar locations (Fig. S4F).Together, our results indicate that paGFE3 can mediate light-inducible degradation of endogenous Gephyrin that has virtually no background and is reversible.</p>

<title>Chemically induced GFE3</title>
<p>We also generated a chemogenetic version of GFE3 (chGFE3) that can be used when an inducible version of GFE3 is needed, but paGFE3 is unsuitable. We used a chemically induced dimerization system based on E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) and the HaloTag protein. When combined with the small molecule TH, a fusion of trimethoprim (TMP) and HaloTag ligand, eDHFR and HaloTag form a bio-orthogonal complex in eukaryotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the formation of the complex is reversible because the binding of eDHFR to TMP is not covalent and can be outcompeted by adding excess TMP. We divided GFE3 into its two principal components, GPHN.FingR and RING<sub>XIAP</sub> and fused transcriptionally regulated GPHN.FingR to the HaloTag peptide and RING<sub>XIAP</sub> to eDHFR, to give tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-HaloTag and eDHFR-E3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). As with tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl2c, tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-HaloTag will both label inhibitory synapses and provide an anchor to which E3 can be recruited to initiate the degradation of Gephyrin. To test whether recruiting eDHFR-E3 to inhibitory synapses would lead to the loss of Gephyrin, we transfected cultured neurons with transcriptionally controlled tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-HaloTag and DHFR-E3 (chGFE3). After visualizing Gephyrin puncta, neurons were treated with 100 nM TH to induce dimerization. Incubation of the neurons with TH for 4 hr showed a reduction of Gephyrin by 73% Â± 3% (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-E</xref> n = 12 cells, 3 experiments) and a reduction in the number of GPHN.FingR puncta by 53 Â± 7% (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon, n = 12 cells, 3 experiments). Incubating the neurons with TH for 24 hr reduced total Gephryin labeling by 89 Â± 2%, a significant reduction (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon, n = 12 cells, 3 experiments <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-I</xref>) and the number of GPHN.FingR puncta by 92 Â± 0.1% (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon, n = 12 cells, 3 experiments). Immunocytochemistry against endogenous Gephyrin confirms the loss of inhibitory synapses at 4 hr and 24 hr (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D, H</xref>). To confirm that Gephyrin loss depends on the dimerization between the GPHN.FingR and RING<sub>XIAP</sub> neurons were transfected with tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-HaloTag and SnapTag-E3 and treated with TH. There were nonsignificant increases in labeling with GPHN.FingR (+ 20 Â± 16%, p &gt; 0.5, Wilcoxon, n = 8, 2 experiments), and the number of GPHN.FingR puncta (+ 11 Â± 10%, p &gt; 0.99, Wilcoxon, n = 9, 2 experiments, Fig.S5A-C). Endogenous Gephyrin was also unaffected in these cells <bold>(Fig. S5D)</bold>. Thus, our results are consistent with chGFE3 mediating efficient chemically-induced degradation of Gephyrin.</p>

<p>The tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-Halotag/eDHFR-E3/TH complex should dissociate with the addition of excess TMP and reverse chGFE3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>). To test whether chGFE3 is reversible, we transfected cultured cortical neurons with GPHN.FingR-HaloTag and eDHFR-RING and treated with TH for 24 hr to induce degradation of Gephyrin, which led to a reduction of 83 Â± 4% in GPHN.FingR-HaloTag labeling and 91 Â± 2% reduction in the number of GPHN.FingR puncta (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K, L, N</xref>, p &lt; 0.0001 for both, Friedman test, multiple comparisons, n = 10 cells, 2 experiments). We then added 100 ÂµM TMP to the media for 24 hr to compete with TH to dissociate GPHN.FingR-RING<sub>XIAP</sub> dimers and block the formation of new dimers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6M</xref>). Imaging the neurons 48 hr after adding TMP later showed a 1450 Â± 760% increase in the total GPHN.FingR labeling and 1168 Â± 200% increase in the number of Gephyrin puncta at 72 hr, both of which were significant (p &lt; 0.05 for both, Friedman multiple comparisons, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6M, N</xref>). The amount of GPHN.FingR labeling at 72 hr compared to labeling at T0 was reduced by 24 Â± 5%, and the number of GPHN.FingR puncta decreased by 21 Â± 4%, both of which were not significant (p &gt; 0.2, Friedman multiple comparison, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K, M, N</xref>). Furthermore, immunocytochemistry shows colocalization between the GPHN.FingR and the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, the main ionotropic GABA receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, denoting a functional synapse <bold>(Fig. S5E)</bold>. Finally, we found that the Gephyrin puncta before and after ablation had similar distributions across dendrites (Fig. S5F). Thus, our results suggest that in neurons expressing chGFE3, adding TH causes ablation of inhibitory neurons, and adding TMP reverses the effect.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we developed three new synapse ablators: PFE3, which ablates excitatory synapses; paGFE3, a photoactivatable version of the inhibitory synapse ablator; GFE3; and chGFE3, a chemically activated version of GFE3. All three tools ablate specific postsynaptic sites and can be expressed in particular cell types, allowing circuit breaking with two-fold specificity.</p>
<p>PFE3 is composed of three distinct functional domains. Ubiquitination of PSD-95 is mediated by the E3 ligase Mdm2, the PIR domain recruits proteasomes to the synapse to degrade the ubiquitinated protein, and both domains are targeted to PSD-95 through PSD-95.FingR. Its design is based on work showing that coordinated actions of Mdm2 and PIR from Protocadherin 10 mediate the degradation of excitatory synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. These findings were corroborated when we found efficient degradation of PSD-95 and ablation of synapses was only achieved if all three components were included in PFE3. Expression of PFE3 caused highly efficient ablation of PSD-95 in cultured cortical neurons and blocked excitatory synaptic transmission in retinal ganglion cells in vivo.</p>
<p>Efficient elimination of excitatory synapses was achieved after 48 hr of PFE3 expression, which contrasts with PSD-95 knockout mice, where reductions in AMPA receptors and excitatory transmission were either not significant or small depending on the stage of development. One reason for this discrepancy could be that transcription of the MAGUK protein SAP-102, which is highly homologous to PSD-95, is upregulated in PSD-95 knockout mice and could provide compensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. PSD-95.FingR labels SAP-102<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, which suggests that PFE3 would degrade any SAP-102 that might otherwise compensate for the reduction in PSD-95. Thus, in the context of PFE3, the binding of PSD-95.FingR to MAGUKs homologous to PSD-95, such as SAP-102 and SAP97, could enable more effective and widespread ablation of excitatory synapses than if it bound only to PSD-95. Alternatively, compensatory changes in transcription could be relatively slow, or they respond specifically to changes in mRNA levels rather than protein levels. In the future, it should be possible to use PFE3 to explore mechanisms of compensation that maintain homeostasis when protein levels change.</p>
<p>Another obvious application of PFE3 is to probe the role of PSD-95 in maintaining synaptic structure. For instance, what is the relationship between PSD-95 and dendritic spines? It would also be interesting to closely examine how synapses change before and after ablation of PSD-95. PSD-95 puncta grow back in cultured neurons, but what would happen in mature neurons in vivo? If they grow back, would they reconnect with their original presynaptic partners, and if so, would neural circuit function be changed following regrowth? It would also be interesting to see whether it is possible to permanently alter the connectivity of circuits after extended periods of expression of PFE3.</p>
<p>We added temporal and spatial control capability to GFE3 by enabling its activation with light (paGFE3) or chemicals (chGFE3). We used a standard method for regulating a protein where two distinct domains that are necessary and sufficient for protein function are fused to separate components of a light- or chemically-induced protein complex. Previously, this approach has been used for controlling transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> neurotransmitter release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, gene editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and protease cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. However, background activation in photoactivatable complexes based on photoreceptors, such as cryptochrome 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, phototropin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, or Vivid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, makes them unsuitable for regulating GFE3, which is highly potent. As an alternative, we developed a novel photoactivatable complex, PhLIC, based on the photocleavable protein PhoCl and the 10-mer PBP, which exhibited no measurable background when tested in the context of paGFE3.</p>
<p>This lack of background would make paGFE3 ideal for use in transgenic animals such as mice or zebrafish, where the complex would have to remain inert for long periods before activation. Expressing paGFE3 in a Gal4 (zebrafish) or Cre (mouse) driver line would make it possible to ablate inhibitory synapses in specific cell types with precise temporal control and without injecting viruses. In addition, with precise application of 400 nm light, it could be possible to ablate inhibitory synapses with single-cell spatial resolution. Furthermore, the PhLIC complex could be used to make photoactivatable versions of proteins other than GFE3. For instance, it could be used to create a split version of a potent toxin, which requires that no background activity be present until photoactivation causes it to kill or alter the function of specific cells at a particular time.</p>
<p>chGFE3 is based on a system similar to one for degrading exogenous proteins with eDHFR tags<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Our system has the same benefits of efficiency and reversibility, but it can target endogenous Gephyrin and ablate inhibitory synapses. In addition, we showed that, like paGFE3, chGFE3 has no background. Although its desirable qualities overlap with those of paGFE3, it could be used in contexts where it would be too difficult or time-consuming to photoactivate GFE3. For instance, if the target cells were spread over a relatively large region or when sustained ablation is necessary. One potential drawback to applying chGFE3 in vivo is the necessity of injecting the chemical dimerizer TH. However, it may be that TH can be administered systemically, particularly since both components of TH (the HaloTag ligand and TMP) can each penetrate the brain when injected systemically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have generated novel proteins for ablating excitatory and inhibitory synapses, which can be used to probe the structure and function of neural circuits.</p>

<title>Preparation of cultured cortical neurons</title>
<p>Experimental protocols were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Southern California.</p>
<p>E19 embryos were removed, and cortices were dissected in Hankâs balanced salt solution (HBSS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. # 14025076) supplemented with 0.1 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. # 15630-080). Cortices were digested with neuronal isolation enzyme with Papain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat # 88285) for 30 min at 37Â°C. The tissue was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and washed three times with HBSS-HEPES. Subsequently, the tissue was triturated to dissociate the cells, and undissociated cells were separated out with a cell strainer (Falcon, cat # 352340). Neurons were plated at a density of 8 x 10<sup>4</sup> on 2-well chambered cover glass (Cellvis, cat # C2-1.5H-N) pre-treated overnight with 0.2 mg/mL Poly-D-Lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# P0899) and washed three times with water.

Full-length PhoCl was added to the reaction in excess. Incubation of the library with cleaved PhoCl for rounds 1 and 2 was conducted at 4Â°C, rounds 3-5 at room temperature, and round 6 at 30Â°C. The beads were then washed three times with selection buffer and once with TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20). The beads containing cleaved PhoCl and any peptides bound were used directly as template for PCR amplification of the library. The resulting PCR product was used as the library for the subsequent round of selection. The library underwent 6 rounds of selection.</p>

<p>To express channelrhodopsin-2 in type 6 cone bipolar cells, we crossed a CCK-Cre mouse line (Jackson Laboratory strain 012706) with the Jackson Laboratory Ai27 mouse, which contains a floxed channelrhodopsin2-TdTomato fusion protein sequence. Mice were intravitreally injected with either the PFE3 or control virus (1.5 Âµl). After 3-4 weeks, retinas were isolated and mounted in a recording chamber for patch clamp recording, as described previously (Jones et al., 2012). Retinas were perfused in ACSF bubbled with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>. ACET (1 ÂµM) and L-AP4 (10 ÂµM) were added to block synaptic transmission from photoreceptors to Off and On bipolar cells, respectively. Infected cells were identified by GFP expression. GFP-positive On a-RGCs were identified by their large cell bodies, and their identity was confirmed by dye filling. Full-field 495 nm light (0.9 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) was delivered to the retina for 10 ms to trigger EPSCs. Cells were voltage-clamped at â60 mV.</p>

<title>Chemogenetic GFE3</title>
<p>Cultured cortical neurons were prepared and transfected with 1Âµg tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-HaloTag and 250ng eDHFR-E3 as described above at 14DIV. Neurons were imaged at 18DIV in Imaging Buffer and coordinates of each neuron were saved in the Metamorph Software. Immediately after imaging, neurons were transferred back to the culture media and TH was added to the medium at 100nM final concentration. After 4 or 24 hours of incubation, neurons were transferred to Imaging Buffer and the same neurons were imaged to track changes in GPHN.FingR. To confirm loss of endogenous Gephyrin, neurons were immediately fixed and immunostained as described above. To recover inhibitory synapses, the cultured neurons were washed three times with conditioned media and incubated with conditioned media with 50mM TMP for 48 hrs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work is a continuation of a previous paper from the Arnold group, where they engineered GFE3, which allows to specifically ablate inhibitory synapses. Here, the authors generate 3 different actuators:</p>
<p>(1) An excitatory synapse ablator.</p>
<p>
(2) A photoactivatable inhibitory synapse ablator.</p>
<p>
(3) A chemically inhibitory synapse ablator.</p>
<p>Following initial engineering, the authors present characterization and optimization data to showcase that these new tools allow one to specifically ablate synapses, without toxicity and with specificity. Furthermore, they showcase that these manipulations are reversible.</p>
<p>Altogether, these new tools would be important for the neuroscience community.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate the engineering, optimization and characterization of these new probes. The main novelty here is the new excitatory synapse ablator, which has not been shown yet and thus could be a valuable tool for neuroscientists.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have convincingly demonstrated the use of these tools in cultured neurons. The biggest weakness is the limited information given for the use of these tools for in vivo studies. The authors provide one example of the use of these new tool to study retinal circuits, and show evidence that the excitatory synapse ablator reduces synaptic transmission in retinal slices. Still, more work will be required to use this tool in intact neuronal circuits. It remains unclear if it would be trivial to characterize how well these tools express and operate in vivo. This could be substantially different and present some limitations as to the utility of these tools.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study introduces a set of genetically encoded tools for the selective and reversible ablation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Previously, the authors developed GFE3, a tool that efficiently ablates inhibitory synapses by targeting an E3 ligase to the inhibitory scaffolding protein Gephyrin via GPHN.FingR, a recombinant, antibody-like protein (Gross et al., 2016). Building on this work, they now present three new ablation tools: PFE3, which targets excitatory synapses, and two new versions of GFE3-paGFE3 and chGFE3-that are photoactivatable and chemically inducible, respectively. These tools enable selective and efficient synapse ablation in specific cell types, providing valuable methods for disrupting neural circuits. This approach holds broad potential for investigating the roles of specific synaptic input onto genetically determined cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The primary strength of this study lies in the rational design and robust validation of each tool's effectiveness, building on previous work by the authors' group (Gross et al., 2016). Each tool serves distinct research needs: PFE3 enables efficient degradation of PSD-95 at excitatory synapses, while paGFE3 and chGFE3 allow for targeted degradation of Gephyrin, offering spatiotemporal control over inhibitory synapses via light or chemical activation. These tools are efficiently validated through robust experiments demonstrating reductions in synaptic markers (PSD-95 and Gephyrin) and confirming reversibility, which is crucial for transient ablation. By providing tools with both optogenetic and chemical control options, this study broadens the applicability of synapse manipulation across varied experimental conditions, enhancing the utility of E3 ligase-based approaches for synapse ablation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While this study provides valuable tools and addresses many critical points for varidation, examining potential issues with specificity and background ubiquitination in further detail could strengthen the paper. For PFE3, the study demonstrates reductions in both PSD-95 and GluA1. In their previous work, GFE3 selectively reduced Gephyrin without affecting major Gephyrin interactors or other PSD proteins. Clarifying whether PFE3 affects additional PSD proteins beyond GluA1 would be important for accurately interpreting results in experiments using PFE3. Additionally, further insight into PFE3's impact on inhibitory synapses would be valuable to assess the excitatory specificity and potential for circuit-level applications. For paGFE3 and chGFE3, the E3 ligase (RING domain of Mdm2) is overexpressed and thus freely diffusible within the cell as a separate construct. Although the authors show that Gephyrin is not significantly reduced without light or chemical activation, it remains possible that other proteins, particularly non-synaptic proteins, could be ubiquitinated due to the presence of freely diffusing E3 ligase in cytosol. Addressing these points would clarify the strengths and limitations of tools, providing users with valuable information.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>The biggest concern in this regard is: that almost all the characterization is performed in cultured dissociated neuronsâ¦</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While it is true that most of the characterization done in this paper was in cultured neurons, we verified that PFE3 mediates functional ablation of excitatory synapses in vivo (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the GPHN.FingR-XIAP (GFE3), a protein very similar to the complex formed following activation of paGFE3 and chGFE3, has been extensively tested by us and others in vivo(1-4).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>For paGFE3 and chGFE3, the E3 ligase (RING domain of Mdm2) is overexpressed throughout cells as a separate construct. Although the authors show that Gephyrin is not significantly reduced without light or chemical activation, it remains possible that other proteins could be ubiquitinated due to the overexpressed E3 domain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our previous paper(1), we tested neurons under 3 conditions: 1. expressing a construct similar to PBP-E3, consisting of a FingR with a randomized binding domain fused to the same XIAP ring domain used in paGFE3 and chGFE3 (RAND-E3). 2. expressing GPHN.FingR. 3. not expressing any exogenous proteins (control neurons). In each case, we found that expression of a variety of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins was not significantly different when exposed to either of these exogenous proteins compared with control neurons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>(1)  Can the authors use the tools to show the ablation of endogenous PSD95 without FingR overexpression?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The experiments described in Fig. 3 are an example of this type of experiment. Furthermore, the PSD-95.FingR was extensively tested and has been used in dozens of studies without any indication that its expression alters cellular function or morphology. Note also that the transcriptional regulation system of PSD-95.FingR limits the expression such that there is virtually no background, so it is not really being overexpressed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I am missing some control experiments for the excitatory synapses ablator- can the authors show that cells transfected with the plasmid and no DOX, show similar numbers of synapses as neurons without transfection?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added an experiment comparing cells expressing PSD-95.FingR alone, and others expressing PFE3 with no Dox. We found that the two types of cells express amounts of PSD-95 that are not significantly different (Fig. S2L).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) I am not quite sure how they used paired statistics on staining since they could only stain the cell at the end of the experiment. Are the comparisons performed on different cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These experiments were done on the same cells. However, the methods of labeling were different- the initial counting of synapses was done, so we agree with the reviewer that it would be best not to use a paired analysis. Accordingly, we have changed Figs. 1F and 2D.</p>
