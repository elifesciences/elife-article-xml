<title>Abstract</title><p>Ketamine (KET) and isoflurane (ISO) are two widely used general anesthetics, yet their distinct and shared neurophysiological mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of KET and ISO effects on c-Fos expression across the brain, utilizing hierarchical clustering and c-Fos-based functional network analysis to evaluate the responses of individual brain regions to each anesthetic. Our findings demonstrate that KET significantly activates cortical and subcortical arousal-promoting nuclei, with the temporal association areas (TEa) serving as a hub node, corroborating the top-down general anesthesia theory for dissociative anesthesia. In contrast, ISO activates the nuclei in the hypothalamus and brainstem, with the locus coeruleus (LC) as a hub node, implying a bottom-up mechanism for anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Notably, the coactivation of arousal-related nuclei, analgesia-related, neuroendocrine-related nuclei (e.g., prelimbic area (PL) and infralimbic areas (ILA), and the anterior paraventricular nucleus (aPVT), Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW), locus coeruleus (LC), parabrachial nucleus (PB), solitary tract nucleus (NTS) by both anesthetics underscores shared features such as unconsciousness, analgesia, and autonomic regulation, irrespective of their specific molecular targets. In conclusion, our results emphasize the distinct actions of KET and ISO while also uncovering the commonly activated brain regions, thus contributing to the advancement of our understanding of the mechanisms underlying general anesthesia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite considerable investigation into the molecular targets, neural circuits, and functional connectivity associated with various anesthetics, our comprehension of their effects on overall brain activity continues to be limited and incomplete (Hemmings et al., 2019). At the molecular level, ketamine (KET) and isoflurane (ISO) interact with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAa) receptors, respectively, modulating neuronal excitability and ultimately leading to a loss of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Franks, 2008</xref>). In systems neuroscience, the neural mechanisms of anesthetic induced unconsciousness involve both top-down and bottom-up processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mashour, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mashour and Hudetz, 2017</xref>). As evidenced by in vivo electrophysiology or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, the top-down paradigm illustrates that anesthetics induce unconsciousness by disrupting corticocortical and corticothalamic circuits responsible for neural information integration, while peripheral sensory information can still be conveyed to the primary sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schroeder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). The bottom-up approach, exemplified by ISO, involves the activation of sleep-promoting nuclei like ventral lateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) and inhibition of arousal centers in the brainstem and diencephalon, supporting the shared circuits of sleep and anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nelson et al., 2002</xref>). However, the limited spatial resolution of fMRI studies and the inability of EEG to capture specific brainstem nuclei hinder the acquisition of comprehensive whole-brain information. Although a substantial body of knowledge has been amassed, our understanding of the reciprocal responses among different brain regions during general anesthesia remains relatively sparse and fragmented. To bridge these gaps, further investigation using advanced techniques that can capture the whole-brain dynamics is needed to elucidate the complex interactions and shared mechanisms between various anesthetics.</p>
<p>Neuronal extracellular stimulation typically results in the elevation of adenosine 3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels and calcium influx, ultimately leading to the upregulation of immediate early genes (IEGs) such as c-fos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yap and Greenberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Morgan and Curran, 1989</xref>). The translation product of c-fos, c-Fos protein, offers single-cell spatial resolution and has been utilized as a biomarker to identify anesthetic-activated brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Previous investigations of c-Fos expression throughout the brain demonstrated that GABAergic agents inhibited cortical activity while concurrently activating subcortical brain regions, including the VLPO, median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), lateral septal nucleus (LS), Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW), and locus coeruleus (LC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yatziv et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Han et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, KET was shown to provoke wake-like c-Fos expression and intense augmentation of c-Fos expression in various brain regions at clinical dosages (75-100 mg/kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lu et al., 2008</xref>). It is important to note that these experiments administered KET at lights-on and GABAa receptor agonists at lights-off, potentially introducing circadian influences for direct comparison of ISO and KET. Moreover, it has been revealed that state of general anesthesia is not determined by activity in individual brain areas, but emerges as a global change within the brain. This change involves the activation of lateral habenular nucleus (LHb), VLPO, supraoptic nucleus (SO), and central amygdaloid nucleus (CeA), which are essential for anesthetics induced sedation, unconsciousness, or analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gelegen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hua et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jiang-Xie et al., 2019</xref>). However, brain-wide mapping and comparison of distinct anesthetic (KET and ISO) activated nuclei at a cellular level have not been fully elucidated.</p>
<p>In this study, we examined the distribution of nuclei activated by ISO and KET in 984 brain regions using immunochemical labeling and a customized MATLAB software package, which facilitated signal detection and registration to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). We compared whole-brain c-Fos expression induced by KET and ISO through hierarchical clustering and calculated inter-regional correlations by determining the covariance across subjects for each brain region pair. Significantly positively correlated regions were then extracted to construct functional networks and graph theory-based analyses were performed to identify hub nodes. Our results revealed distinct yet overlapping whole-brain activation patterns for KET and ISO.</p>

<title>A comparison of the activation patterns of c-Fos in 53 brain areas in response to ISO and KET</title>
<p>To examine the pattern of c-Fos expression throughout the brain, 1.5% ISO was continuously ventilated, or 100 mg/kg KET was administered 90 minutes before harvesting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Sample collection for all mice was uniformly conducted at 14:30 (ZT7.5), and the c-Fos labeling and imaging were performed using consistent parameters throughout all experiments. To quantitatively assess brain states across the four groups, we utilized electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) recordings (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The depth of anesthesia was evaluated based on the power ratio of the EEG within the delta (0.5–4 Hz) and theta (6–10 Hz) frequency bands, combined with the changes in the EMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Luo et al., 2023</xref>). Our findings showed that ISO and KET elevated EEG power ratio while reducing EMG power, suggesting both drugs induced a loss of consciousness. The raw images of brain slices were aligned to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on the standard mouse atlas available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://atlas.brain-map.org/">http://atlas.brain-map.org/</ext-link>, the mouse brain was segmented into nine hierarchical levels, totaling 984 regions. The primary level consists of grey matter, the secondary of the cerebrum, brainstem, and cerebellum, and the tertiary includes regions like the cerebral cortex and cerebellar nuclei, among others, with some regions extending to the 8th and 9th levels. The fifth level comprises 53 subregions, with detailed expression levels and their respective abbreviations presented in <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Do et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine the effects of ISO and KET on neural activity, we normalized c-Fos densities across brain regions to their control group averages region by region and log-transformed the data. Hierarchical clustering of these values revealed distinct patterns of drug-induced changes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), with both ISO and KET showing optimal clustering at a 0.5 cut-off value, as confirmed by high silhouette coefficients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Concurrently, we computed the number of clusters formed at each potential cut-off value and found that a 0.5 threshold resulted in four distinct clusters for both ISO and KET treatments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). After hierarchical clustering, we maintained the sequence of brain regions and substituted log relative c-Fos densities with Z-scores for both ISO and KET (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). While no significantly inhibited brain regions were detected in the ISO group (as no Z scores fell below −2), clusters 3 and 4 showed expression levels similar to or lower than those in the control group. These clusters are involved in sensory integration, motor coordination, and higher-order cognitive processing, with cluster 3 having a mean Z score of 0.27 (n=17) and cluster 4 a mean Z score of −1.1 (n=2), as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>. The most pronounced upregulation of ISO induced c-Fos expression was observed in the second cluster (n=13, mean Z score=4.7), which includes brain regions responsible for a variety of functions: the periventricular zone (PVZ) and lateral zone (LZ) of the hypothalamus, vital for endocrine and autonomic system regulation; the ventral striatum (STRv), pallidum (PAL), and lateral septal complex (LSX) of the striatum, key in reward and motivation; the tenia tecta (TT) and piriform area (PIR), essential for olfactory processing; and the infralimbic area (ILA) of the cortex, significant for emotional and cognitive functions. This collective upregulation in cluster 2 underlines ISO’s impact on hypothalamic regulation, reward mechanisms, and olfactory processing. KET administration elicited a significant activation in a broad array of brain regions, with Cluster 4 displaying the most substantial upregulation in expression. This cluster incorporates cortical areas central to sensory processing and emotional regulation, such as the visceral area (VISC), anterior cingulate area (ACA), and primary somatosensory cortex (SS) — as well as cerebral nuclei integral for motor coordination and motivational behaviors — specifically, the dorsolateral and ventrolateral pallidum (PALd, PALv) and striatum (STRd, STRv) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). ISO predominantly modulates brain regions associated with hormonal regulation, reward processing, and olfaction, with marked activation in the hypothalamic and striatal regions. In contrast, KET induces widespread activation across the brain, with heightened activity in a key cluster that includes cortical and cerebral nuclei governing complex sensory, emotional, and motor processes, thus highlighting its notable influence on higher-order functions.</p>

<title>Similarities and differences in ISO and KET activated c-Fos brain areas</title>
<p>To enhance our analysis of c-Fos expression patterns induced by ISO and KET, we expanded our study to 201 subregions. After log-transforming the c-Fos densities relative to controls, we applied hierarchical clustering to uncover patterns of brain activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), with detailed expression levels in <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. ISO demonstrates a more concentrated influence on brain activity with consistently higher clustering quality and fewer clusters than KET, suggesting a focused impact on specific brain functions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> maintains the order from hierarchical clustering and marks both the most activated brain regions in the top 10% of Z-scores with red boxes and areas of potential suppression with Z-scores below −2 with white boxes. ISO hierarchical clustering identified three distinct clusters, with cluster 3 exhibiting the highest mean Z-score of 7.27. This cluster encompasses regions like the supraoptic (SO), ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO), tuberal (TU), and central amygdala (CEA). Notably, the SO, VLPO, and CEA have been previously reported to play critical roles in the mechanisms of anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hua et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jiang-Xie et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, cluster 1 showed a relative decrease in expression (n= 91, mean Z-score: −0.54), indicating that nearly half of the brain areas had reduced c-Fos expression compared to the control group. Cluster 2 was overall moderately activated, with significant activity in the top 10% of regions including the anterior hypothalamic (ARH) and paraventricular (PVH) nuclei—key for hypothalamic functions—and cortical areas such as the infralimbic (ILA), dorsal peduncular (DP), and temporal (TT) cortices, which are involved in emotional and cognitive processing. Striatal and pallidal regions, particularly the olfactory tubercle (OT) and nucleus accumbens (ACB), as well as midbrain and hindbrain structures like the area postrema (AP) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), showed the most pronounced activation. In the hierarchical clustering analysis of KET exposure, Cluster 2 with a mean Z-score of −0.01 was similar to the control group in terms of activation, while the other four clusters showed increased activation. Cluster 5, showing the most significant activation, is composed mainly of cortical regions critical for sensory processing, spatial memory, navigation, emotional regulation, and cognitive functions. It also includes cerebral nuclei involved in motor control and reward pathways, alongside essential thalamic and hindbrain areas for memory and sensory transmission. This composition, with a predominant focus on cortical regions, suggests that KET chiefly modulates higher-order brain functions, while also affecting basic neurological processes through its influence on cerebral nuclei, the thalamus, and the hindbrain. In conclusion, while ISO’s activation of specific areas like SO, VLPO, TU, and CeA in cluster 3 indicates a targeted influence, KET’s extensive engagement with cortical areas in cluster 5, along with its effects on striatal and thalamic regions, underscores its profound and widespread modulation of both higher-order and fundamental neural functions.</p>

<title>Identification of brain regions activated by KET</title>
<p>We further employed quantitative methods to identify the brain regions activated by KET across the entire brain. Our findings concur with previous studies: numerous cortical regions associated with somatosensory, auditory, visual, and movement were activated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A and C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>—source data 1). Additionally, we identified several innovative observations that enrich the current understanding in this field. To provide a clearer overview of our findings, we categorized the activated brain areas into different functional groups: (1) Arousal and REM sleep regulation: Several nuclei associated with arousal were activated, including the prelimbic area (PL), infralimbic cortex (ILA), paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), dorsal raphe (DR), and sublaterodorsal nucleus (SLD). Prior evidence indicates that the PL/ILA and PVT regions play a role in regulating arousal in both cortical and subcortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mashour et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, dopaminergic neurons within the DR have been identified as vital components of wake-promoting pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). In the context of REM sleep, the sublaterodorsal nucleus (SLD) stands out for its role in stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Feng et al., 2020</xref>). (2) Pain modulation: KET significantly activated pain-related areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bliss et al., 2016</xref>), the anterior pretectal nucleus (APN) in the thalamus, which is known to be involved in managing chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Villarreal et al., 2003</xref>), and the anterior periaqueductal gray (PAG) region and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), both part of the endogenous pain inhibitory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cheriyan and Sheets, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yeung et al., 1977</xref>). Additionally, the activation of the locus coeruleus (LC) in the midbrain may contribute to KET’s analgesic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Llorca-Torralba et al., 2021</xref>). (3) Neuroendocrine regulation: The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH) and supraoptic nucleus (SO), which are neuroendocrine-related regions, were also activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jiang-Xie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Duncan et al., 1998</xref>). (4) Movement: Subcortical nuclei associated with movement, such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and nucleus incertus (NI), were prominently activated by KET administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Musacchio et al., 2017</xref>). (5) Connectivity: We observed significant activation of the nucleus reuniens (Re) located in the thalamus, which receives substantial afferent input from limbic structures and serves as a connector linking the hippocampus to the medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hauer et al., 2021</xref>). While our functional categorization offers a simplified overview, it’s worth noting that each activated brain region may have multifaceted roles beyond this classification. In summary, our study identified extensive activation of cortical and subcortical nuclei during KET anesthesia, encompassing regions related to arousal, pain modulation, neuroendocrine regulation, movement, and connectivity.</p>

<title>Identification of brain regions activated by ISO</title>
<p>To identify brain regions activated by ISO and compare these with those activated by KET. We began by summarizing previously reported ISO activated nuclei, including PIR, LSd/LSv, CeA in the cortex and striatum, and VLPO, MnPO, EW, NTS, LC, ventral group of the dorsal thalamus (VeN), and area postrema (AP) in the hypothalamus and midbrain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>—source data 1). We subsequently conducted a comprehensive MATLAB-based analysis of c-Fos expression throughout the entire brain, uncovering previously undetected activated nuclei (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Newly identified activated nuclei in the CTX and the CNU included PL/ILA and ENT, aPVT in the thalamus, TU, ARH, PVi, and PVH in the hypothalamus, and PB in the hindbrain. All nuclei activated by ISO in this study were functionally classified and depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>. Our results confirmed the activation of several brain regions involved in arousal-related nuclei, such as the prelimbic area (PL) and infralimbic areas (ILA), and the paraventricular nucleus (PVT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mashour et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, we observed activation in previously reported analgesia-related nuclei, including CeA and LC, as well as the parabrachial nucleus (PB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jiang-Xie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Llorca-Torralba et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng et al., 2020</xref>). We also found activation in neuroendocrine function-related nuclei of the hypothalamus, such as TU, PVi, ARH, PVH, and SO. Moreover, we identified activations related to ISO induced side effects, such as in the piriform cortex (PIR) and ENT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bekkers and Suzuki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Xu and Wilson, 2012</xref>), which may be stimulated by ISO odor, and the solitary tract nucleus (NTS), potentially responsible for ISO induced vomiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>). The only activated nucleus in the midbrain was the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW). Recent research has found that sevoflurane activates EW and is involved in sleep induction and maintenance of anesthesia, suggesting its crucial role in general anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yi et al., 2023</xref>). By comparing the ISO and KET induced c-Fos expression, we summarized the brain regions activated by both anesthetics in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>. Despite variations in molecular targets, the coactivation of regions such as PL/ILA, aPVT, CeA, PVH, SO, EW, PB, LC, and NTS by both ISO and KET suggests an overlapping neuronal circuitry that influences sleep-wake regulation, analgesia, and neuroendocrine functions. This shared neural circuitry may potentially offer a common mechanism across the two anesthetics for the maintenance of general anesthesia.</p>

<title>Network generation and Hub identification</title>
<p>Previous research has established that general anesthesia is mediated by various brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gelegen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hua et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jiang-Xie et al., 2019</xref>). C-Fos expression serves as an indicator of neuronal activity, providing a single index of activation per region per animal. By examining the covariance of c-Fos expression across animals within each group, we can infer interactions between brain regions and identify functional networks engaged during general anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wheeler et al., 2013</xref>). We initially incorporated a total of 63 brain regions, including nuclei that were significantly activated by ISO and KET (as indicated by positive findings in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and those previously reported to be associated with the mechanisms of general anesthesia and sleep-wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Leung et al., 2014</xref>). We first calculated a comprehensive set of interregional correlations for four groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Correlation analysis revealed similar network connectivity and densities between the ISO and home cage groups (mean interregional correlations: Fisher Z = −0.018, P = 0.98; network densities: 0.10 vs. 0.09). In contrast, KET significantly increased network density (0.46 vs. 0.06) and mean interregional correlations compared to the saline group (Fisher Z = 3.54, P &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating enhanced interregional correlation with KET administration. Additionally, we segmented the functional network into modules based on the hierarchical clustering of correlation coefficients (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We chose to cut the tree at a value of 0.7 for the relatively high value of Silhouette scores, resulting in two modules for the home cage and KET groups, and four for the saline and ISO groups (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref> and C).

<caption><title>The possible framework for KET and ISO-induced unconsciousness.</title><p>The distinct pathways of KET and ISO-induced unconsciousness can be explained by two contrasting mechanisms. The ‘top-down’ process attributes KET’s effect to widespread cortical activation (represented in yellow), with the temporal association areas (TEa) acting as the central node in the functional network (depicted in blue). Conversely, the ‘bottom-up’ approach suggests that isoflurane-induced unconsciousness stems from the activation of certain hypothalamic regions (highlighted in yellow), with the locus coeruleus (LC) acting as the hub node within the isoflurane-induced functional network.

<p>Hubs are nodes that occupy critical central positions within the network, enabling the network to function properly. Due to the singular module structure of the KET network and the sparsity of intermodular connections in the home cage and saline networks, the assessment of network hub nodes did not employ within-module degree Z-score and participation coefficients, as these measures predominantly underscore the importance of connections within and between modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kimbrough et al., 2020</xref>). The analysis evaluated nodal importance using degree (number of direct connections), betweenness centrality (proportion of shortest network paths passing through a node), and eigenvector centrality (influence based on the centrality of connected nodes), identifying brain regions that scored highly in all three as hub nodes (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The locus coeruleus (LC), characterized by its high degree and eigenvector centrality, as well as its notably higher betweenness centrality, underscores its pivotal role in propagating and integrating neural signals within the ISO-influenced network. In the KET group, the temporal association areas (TEa) serve as a hub, emphasizing their integrative function in the manifestation of ketamine-induced dissociative anesthesia. Meanwhile, the PAG and the lateral septal nucleus, rostral part (LSr), function as central hubs in the home cage and saline groups, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, a comparative analysis was conducted on the effects of two general anesthetics, ISO and KET, on c-Fos expression throughout the brain. Hierarchical cluster analysis enabled a detailed examination of individual brain region responses to each anesthetic. We found that KET primarily activates the cerebral cortex, indicative of a top-down mechanism, whereas ISO chiefly stimulates subcortical areas, particularly the hypothalamus, aligning with a bottom-up approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mashour, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mashour and Hudetz, 2017</xref>). Further analysis based on c-Fos expression revealed the TEa as a key hub in the KET-induced network and the LC in the ISO network, underscoring their significant roles in mediating the effects of KET and ISO, respectively.</p>
<p>Our hierarchical clustering method effectively identified brain regions impacted by ISO and KET, aligning with multiple comparison results as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. This approach facilitated the efficient grouping of regions with similar expression patterns, enabling a comprehensive analysis of brain-wide c-Fos expression differences. Notably, certain brain regions such as SO, VLPO, TU, and CeA were prominent under ISO treatment, with SO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jiang-Xie et al., 2019</xref>), VLPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Moore et al., 2012</xref>), and CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hua et al., 2020</xref>) previously reported to be involved in mechanisms of general anesthesia. The LC was identified as a highly connected hub, underscoring its critical role in the brainstem during ISO-induced general anesthesia. The LC is known for its diverse functions, including arousal, pain modulation, attention, stress response, and neuroprotection. Studies indicate that chemical activation of the LC enhances whole-brain functional connectivity, largely due to its role as the primary source of norepinephrine (NE) and its extensive influence throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zerbi et al., 2019</xref>). The significant activation of the LC and its pivotal position in the functional network underlying ISO-induced unconsciousness indicate its crucial role in maintaining and integrating the network. This finding highlights the LC’s involvement in the bottom-up paradigm of ISO-induced unconsciousness.</p>
<p>KET induces extensive activation across the brain, with a notable impact on cortical and cerebral nuclei, as indicated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. This observation aligns with the proposal by Mashour et al. that anesthesia-induced unconsciousness includes both the modulation of bottom-up and top-down neural processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mashour, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mashour and Hudetz, 2017</xref>). In this framework, anesthetics like KET diminish consciousness by interfering with cortical and thalamocortical circuits, which are crucial for neural information integration. Our study found that KET administration significantly activates cortical and subcortical arousal-promoting nuclei. Graph theoretical analysis identified the TEa as a central hub in the KET-induced functional network. Given TEa’s critical role in integrating multisensory information, particularly auditory signals, and its involvement in complex behaviors such as maternal responses as evidenced by its role in processing pup ultrasonic vocalizations, our findings suggest that KET may influence the connectivity of TEa with other brain regions, thus potentially altering the overall dynamics of the functional brain network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tasaka et al., 2020</xref>). This further supports the significance of cortical areas during KET anesthesia.</p>
<p>Identifying shared neural features between KET and ISO is crucial for understanding anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. The coactivation of brain regions, such as PL/ILA and aPVT, alongside analgesia-related nuclei like CeA, PB, and LC, suggests a shared mechanism for thalamocortical regulation and common pathways for pain relief. This observation provides valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms of anesthesia-induced hypnosis and analgesia. Additionally, the coactivation of neuroendocrine-related nuclei, particularly PVH and SO in the hypothalamus, raises questions about the potential influence of anesthetics on hormonal release and homeostatic regulation. Further investigation is warranted for other coactivated nuclei, such as EW and NTS, to understand their roles in anesthesia. The coactivated nuclei suggest a potential shared neuronal circuitry for general anesthesia, encompassing common features like unconsciousness, analgesia, and autonomic regulation. Future research could focus on examining coactivated brain regions by the two anesthetics or manipulating identified hub nodes to delve deeper into the mechanisms of general anesthesia.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that c-Fos expression in the KET group is significantly elevated compared to the ISO group, and the saline group exhibits notably higher c-Fos expression than the home cage group, as seen in <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Intraperitoneal saline injections in the saline group, despite pre-experiment acclimation with handling and injections for four days, may still evoke pain and stress responses in mice. Subtle yet measurable variations in brain states between the home cage and saline groups were observed, characterized by changes in normalized EEG delta/theta power (home cage: 0.05±0.09; saline: −0.03±0.11) and EMG power (home cage: −0.37±0.34; saline: 0.04±0.13), as shown in <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. These changes suggest a relative increase in overall brain activity in the saline group compared to the home cage group, potentially contributing to the higher c-Fos expression. Although the difference in EEG power between the ISO group and the home cage control was not significant, the increase in EEG power observed in the ISO group was similar to that of KET (0.47 ± 0.07 vs 0.59 ± 0.10), suggesting that both agents may induce loss of consciousness in mice. Regarding EMG power, ISO showed a significant decrease in EMG power compared to its control group. In contrast, the KET group showed a lesser reduction in EMG power (ISO: −1.815± 0.10; KET: −0.96 ± 0.21), which may partly explain the higher overall c-Fos expression levels in the KET group. This is consistent with previous studies where ketamine doses up to 150 mg/kg increase delta power while eliciting a wakefulness-like pattern of c-Fos expression across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lu et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the observed differences in c-Fos expression may arise in part from the dosages, routes of administration, and their distinct pharmacokinetic profiles. This variation is compounded by the lack of detailed physiological monitoring, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration, affecting our ability to precisely assess anesthesia depth. Future studies incorporating comprehensive physiological monitoring and controlled dosing regimens are essential to further elucidate these relationships and refine our understanding of the effects of anesthetics on brain activity.</p>

We adapted mice to handling and the anesthesia chamber (10×15×15 cm) for four days to minimize experimental confound-induced c-Fos induction. For KET administration, adult male mice were handled for 10 minutes per day, and normal saline (NS) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for four consecutive days at 13:00. On day five, a randomly chosen mouse received an injection of ketamine (Gutian Medicine, H35020148) (n=6), and the control groups (n=8) received the same volume of saline. ISO group (n=6) mice were handled and inhaled 1.5% isoflurane (RWD Life Science, 1903715) at 13:00 on day four in the chamber. Meanwhile, the control groups (n=6) were left undisturbed in their home cages prior to sampling. We confirmed the loss of righting reflex at 5 min after anesthetics exposure. For 90 min after KET injection or ISO inhalation, mice were deeply anesthetized with 5% ISO and transcardially perfused with 35 ml 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 35 ml 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were then removed and postfixed overnight with 4% PFA. Following fixation, the brains were dehydrated for 48 hours with 30% sucrose (wt/vol) in PBS.

<title>Anesthesia depth measurement</title>
<p>EEG and EMG recordings were conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Luo et al., 2023</xref>). Specifically, a stainless steel electrode was positioned over the frontal cortex for EEG measurements, while an insulated EMG electrode was inserted into the neck muscles. Additionally, a reference electrode was placed above the cerebellum. The EEG/EMG data were captured using TDT system-3 amplifiers, specifically RZ5 + RA16PA and RZ2 + PZ5 configurations. To measure the depth of anesthesia using EEG/EMG signals, a fast Fourier transform spectral analysis was employed, featuring a frequency resolution of 0.18 Hz. Data was noted every 5 seconds through a MATLAB tool and subsequently verified manually by experts. The assessment was based on EMG power and the ratio of EEG’s δ power (0.5-4Hz) to θ power (6-10Hz). EEG and EMG power values within 30 minutes post-administration were normalized to a 5-minute pre-administration baseline.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>One out of every three brain slices (100 µm intervals) of each whole brain was washed three times with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min and permeabilized for 30 minutes at room temperature with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST). Slices were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with 2% normal donkey serum (Sigma, G6767) in PBS overnight at 4°C with c-Fos primary antibodies (226003, Synaptic Systems; 1:500) diluted in PBS with 1% donkey serum. After three washes with PBST, slices were incubated with the Cy3 donkey anti-rabbit (711165152, Jackson; 1:200) secondary antibody for 2 hours at room temperature. Immunostained slices were mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI and then scanned under a fluorescent microscope equipped with a 10× objective (VS120, Olympus) or a confocal microscope with a 20× objective (FV300, Olympus). Due to the limited scope of a single field of view, either 2 or 4 adjacent fields of view were stitched together to offer a comprehensive representation of specific brain regions, including the PL, ILA, LSc, LSr, SS, and VISC.</p>

<title>Quantification of c-Fos positive cells</title>
<p>The procedures used for c-Fos analysis were based on previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). A custom-written software package was employed for cellular quantification within brain images. The software consists of three components: atlas rotation, image registration, and signal detection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3g">
<title>Atlas rotation module</title>
<p>Utilizing the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, this module allows rotations in both horizontal and vertical dimensions to align with mouse brain samples. To determine the appropriate rotation angles, we manually pinpointed anatomical landmarks corresponding to the samples. For the left-right axis rotation, we chose points from the CA3 pyramidal layer in both hemispheres and the posterior slice of the dentate gyrus, specifically the granule cell layer. For the dorsal-ventral axis rotation, we identified key anatomical landmarks. These include the initial connections of the anterior commissure and corpus callosum between the hemispheres, as well as ventral regions like the interpeduncular nucleus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. After determining these rotation angles, we adjusted the reference atlas to match our samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3h">
<title>Image registration module</title>
<p>This module uses a tool that aligns brain slice images with a reference atlas, facilitating the alignment of overall brain region distribution. Registration starts by matching the coronal plane of the sample sections to the atlas. After defining the external boundaries of the brain section, the system performs geometric transformations on the section to optimize its fit with the atlas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3i">
<title>Signal detection module</title>
<p>The detection module is designed to automatically label c-Fos+ cells. Post detection, a manual verification was performed on each digitized brain section image to ensure the accuracy and precision of the c-Fos+ cell markings.</p>

<sec id="s3j">
<title>Hierarchical clustering</title>
<p>Prior to hierarchical clustering in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, we calculated the relative c-Fos densities by dividing the c-Fos densities of each brain region in the experimental groups by their respective controls and then performed a log transformation on these values to obtain the log relative c-Fos densities. These log ratios, which normalize the data and reduce variance, indicate differential expression with a value of zero denoting no change compared to control. After normalizing the data, we performed hierarchical clustering by first computing the pairwise Euclidean distances among brain regions. Regions with the smallest distances, indicating high similarity, were grouped iteratively. Cluster boundaries were defined using complete linkage, ensuring homogeneity within clusters by considering the largest distance between members. In <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, hierarchical clustering was performed within each of the CTX, CNU, TH, HY, MB, and HB regions based on the log-transformed c-Fos density correlations. In <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, hierarchical clustering was performed based on the interregional log c-Fos density correlations to identify modules of coactivation within each treatment group, revealing underlying functional connectivity networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kimbrough et al., 2020</xref>). To determine the statistical significance of c-Fos expression differences, we computed the Z-score for each treatment condition—ISO and KET—by dividing the log relative c-Fos density by the standard error. Positive z-scores indicate higher values than control, and negative z-scores indicate lower values than control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3k">
<title>Network generation</title>
<p>To evaluate how functional connectivity changed under general anesthetics in WT mice, we extracted 63 brain regions from major brain subdivisions (cerebral cortex, cerebral nuclei, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, and hindbrain) listed in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>. Correlation matrices were generated by computing Pearson correlation coefficients from interregional c-Fos expression in the 63 regions. Mean correlations were calculated to assess changes in functional connectivity between these major subdivisions of the brain. Weighted undirected networks were constructed by considering correlations with Pearson’s r ≥0.82, corresponding to a one-tailed significance level of P&lt;0.05 (uncorrected). The nodes in the networks represent brain regions, and the correlations that survived thresholding were considered connections. Theoretical graph analysis was performed using Brain Connectivity Toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/">https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/</ext-link>, version 2019-03-03) in MATLAB R2021 (The MathWorks Inc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rubinov and Sporns, 2010</xref>). Network visualization was performed using Cytoscape (version 3.2.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Hub identification</title>
<p>Network centrality was evaluated using degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality measures to identify potential hub regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Guimera and Nunes Amaral, 2005</xref>). Degree counts the number of edges connected to a node, signifying its immediate influence. Betweenness centrality is gauged by the number of shortest paths passing through a node, indicating its role as a connector or ‘bridge’ within the network. Eigenvector centrality measures a node’s influence by the centrality of its connections, valuing nodes linked to well-connected neighbors. High eigenvector centrality indicates significant influence through these high-quality connections within the network.</p>

<sec id="s3m">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Sample size was determined based on prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yatziv et al., 2020</xref>). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, independent t-tests evaluating differences in c-Fos expression for KET and ISO treatments were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli method, with a 5% false discovery rate (Q) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Pearson correlation coefficients (R) were transformed into Z-scores using Fisher’s Z transformation before computing group means and making statistical comparisons in <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>. All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, USA) and MATLAB R2021 (Mathworks Inc.).</p>

<p>This potentially <bold>important</bold> study used single-cell whole-brain imaging of the immediate early gene Fos to identify the brain areas recruited by two anesthetics, ketamine and isoflurane. The utilization of a custom software package to align and analyze brain images for c-Fos positive cells stands out as an impressive component of the approach. The results suggest these anesthetics might induce anesthesia via different brain regions and pathways, and raw fos showed shared and distinct activation patterns after ketamine- v. isoflurane-based anesthesia. However, the support for the primary conclusions is <bold>incomplete</bold> owing largely to concerns with the data transformation. The results could also be influenced by differences in route of administration between the drugs. This paper may be of interest to preclinical and clinical scientists working with anesthetic and dissociative drugs.</p>

<p>Summary: In the revised manuscript, the authors aim to investigate brain-wide activation patterns following administration of the anesthetics ketamine and isoflurane, and conduct comparative analysis of these patterns to understand shared and distinct mechanisms of these two anesthetics. To this end, they perform Fos immunohistochemistry in perfused brain sections to label active nuclei, use a custom pipeline to register images to the ABA framework and quantify Fos+ nuclei, and perform multiple complementary analyses to compare activation patterns across groups.</p>
<p>In the latest revision, the authors have made some changes in response to our previous comments on how to fix the analyses. However, the revised analyses were not changed correctly and remain flawed in several fundamental ways.</p>
<p>Critical problems:</p>
<p>(1) Before one can perform higher level analyses such as hiearchal cluster or network hub (or PC) analysis, it is fundamental to validate that you have significant differences of the raw Fos expression values in the first place. First of all, this means showing figures with the raw data (Fos expression levels) in some form in Figures 2 and 3 before showing the higher level analyses in Figures 4 and 5; this is currently switched around. Second and most importantly, when you have a large number of brain areas with large differences in mean values and variance, you need to account for this in a meaningful way. Changing to log values is a step in the right direction for mean values but does not account well for differences in variance. Indeed, considering the large variances in brain areas with high mean values and variance, it is a little difficult to believe that all brain regions, especially brain areas with low mean values, passed corrections for multiple comparisons test. We suggested Z-scores relative to control values for each brain region; this would have accounted for wide differences in mean values and variance, but this was not done. Overall, validation of anesthesia-induced differences in Fos expression levels is not yet shown.</p>
<p>(2) Let's assume for a moment that the raw Fos expression analyses indicate significant differences. They used hierarchal cluster analyses as a rationale for examining 53 brain areas in all subsequent analyses of Fos expression following isoflurane versus home cage or ketamine versus saline. Instead, the authors changed to 201 brain areas with no validated rationale other than effectively saying 'we wanted to look at more brain areas'. And then later, when they examined raw Fos expression values in Figures 4 and 5, they assess 43 brain areas for ketamine and 20 brain areas for isoflurane, without any rationale for why choosing these numbers of brain areas. This is a particularly big problem when they are trying to compare effects of isoflurane versus ketamine on Fos expression in these brain areas - they did not compare the same brain areas.</p>
<p>Less critical comments:</p>
<p>(3) The explanation of hierarchical level's in lines 90-95 did not make sense.</p>
<p>(4) I am still perplexed by why the authors consider the prelimbic and infralimbic cortex 'neuroendocrine' brain areas in the abstract. In contrast, the prelimbic and infralimbic were described better in the introduction as &quot;associated information processing&quot; areas.</p>
<p>5- It looks like overall Fos levels in the control group Home (ISO) are a magnitude (~10-fold) lower than those in the control group Saline (KET) across all regions shown. This large difference seems unlikely to be due to a biologically driven effect and seems more likely to be due to a technical issue, such as differences in staining or imaging between experiments. The authors discuss this issue but did not answer whether the Homecage-ISO experiment or at least the Fos labeling and imaging performed at the same time as for the Saline-Ketamine experiment?</p>

<p>The present study presents a comprehensive exploration of the distinct impacts of Isoflurane and Ketamine on c-Fos expression throughout the brain. To understand the varying responses across individual brain regions to each anesthetic, the researchers employ principal component analysis (PCA) and c-Fos-based functional network analysis. The methodology employed in this research is both methodical and expansive. Notably, the utilization of a custom software package to align and analyze brain images for c-Fos positive cells stands out as an impressive addition to their approach. This innovative technique enables effective quantification of neural activity and enhances our understanding of how anesthetic drugs influence brain networks as a whole.</p>
<p>The primary novelty of this paper lies in the comparative analysis of two anesthetics, Ketamine and Isoflurane, and their respective impacts on brain-wide c-Fos expression. The study reveals the distinct pathways through which these anesthetics induce loss of consciousness. Ketamine primarily influences the cerebral cortex, while Isoflurane targets subcortical brain regions. This finding highlights the differing mechanisms of action employed by these two anesthetics-a top-down approach for Ketamine and a bottom-up mechanism for Isoflurane. Furthermore, this study uncovers commonly activated brain regions under both anesthetics, advancing our knowledge about the mechanisms underlying general anesthesia.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewers for their insightful feedback, which has substantially improved our manuscript. Following the suggestions of the reviewers, we have undertaken the following major revisions:</p>
<p>a.  Concerning data transformation, we have adjusted the methodology in Figures 2 and 3. Instead of normalizing c-Fos density to the whole brain c-Fos density as initially described, we now normalize to the c-Fos density of the corresponding brain region in the control group.
b.  We have substituted the PCA approach with hierarchical clustering in Figures 2 and 3.</p>
<p>c.  In the discussion section, we added a subsection on study limitations, focusing on the variations in drug administration routes and anesthesia depth.</p>
<p>Enclosed are our detailed responses to each of the reviewer's comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>1a. The addition of the EEG/EMG is useful, however, this information is not discussed. For instance, there are differences in EEG/EMG between the two groups (only Ket significantly increased delta/theta power, and only ISO decreased EMG power). These results should be discussed as well as the limitation of not having physiological measures of anesthesia to control for the anesthesia depth.</p>
<p>1b. The possibility that the differences in fos observed may be due to the doses used should be discussed.</p>
<p>1c. The possibility that the differences in fos observed may be due kinetic of
anesthetic used should be discussed.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestions. We have now discussed EEG/EMG result, limitation of not having physiological measures of anesthesia to control for the anesthesia depth, The possibility that the differences in fos observed may be due to the doses, The possibility that the differences in Fos observed may be due kinetic of anesthetic in the revised manuscript (Lines 308-331, also shown below).</p>
<p>Lines 308-331: &quot;...Our findings indicate that c-Fos expression in the KET group is significantly elevated compared to the ISO group, and the saline group exhibits notably higher c-Fos expression than the home cage group, as seen in Supplementary Figures 2 and 3. Intraperitoneal saline injections in the saline group, despite pre-experiment acclimation with handling and injections for four days, may still evoke pain and stress responses in mice. Subtle yet measurable variations in brain states between the home cage and saline groups were observed, characterized by changes in normalized EEG delta/theta power (home cage: 0.05±0.09; saline: -0.03±0.11) and EMG power (home cage: -0.37±0.34; saline: 0.04±0.13), as shown in Supplementary Figure 1. These changes suggest a relative increase in overall brain activity in the saline group compared to the home cage group, potentially contributing to the higher c-Fos expression. Although the difference in EEG power between the ISO group and the home cage control was not significant, the increase in EEG power observed in the ISO group was similar to that of KET (0.47 ± 0.07 vs 0.59 ± 0.10), suggesting that both agents may induce loss of consciousness in mice. Regarding EMG power, ISO showed a significant decrease in EMG power compared to its control group. In contrast, the KET group showed a lesser reduction in EMG power (ISO: -1.815± 0.10; KET: -0.96 ± 0.21), which may partly explain the higher overall c-Fos expression levels in the KET group. This is consistent with previous studies where ketamine doses up to 150 mg/kg increase delta power while eliciting a wakefulness-like pattern of c-Fos expression across the brain [1]. Furthermore, the observed differences in c-Fos expression may arise in part from the dosages, routes of administration, and their distinct pharmacokinetic profiles. This variation is compounded by the lack of detailed physiological monitoring, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration, affecting our ability to precisely assess anesthesia depth. Future studies incorporating comprehensive physiological monitoring and controlled dosing regimens are essential to further elucidate these relationships and refine our understanding of the effects of anesthetics on brain activity&quot;</p>

<p>2b. I am confused because Fig 2C seems to show significant decrease in %fos in the hypothalamus, midbrain and cerebellum after KET, while the author responded that &quot; in our analysis, we did not detect regions with significant downregulation when comparing anesthetized mice with controls.&quot; Moreover the new figure in the rebuttal in response to reviewer 2 suggests that Ket increases Fos in almost every single region (green vs blue) which is not the conclusion of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Your concern regarding the apparent discrepancy is well-founded. The inconsistency arose due to an inappropriate data transformation, which affected the interpretation. We have now rectified this by adjusting the data transformation in Figures 2 and 3. Specifically, we have recalculated the log relative c-Fos density values relative to the control group for each brain region. This revision has resolved the issue, confirming that our analysis did not detect any regions with significant downregulation in the anesthetized mice compared to controls. We have also updated the results, discussion, and methods sections of Figures 2 and 3 to accurately reflect these changes and ensure consistency with our findings.</p>

<p>1. There are still critical misinterpretations of the PCA analysis. For instance, it is mentioned that &quot; KET is associated with the activation of cortical regions (as evidenced by positive PC1 coefficients in MOB, AON, MO, ACA, and ORB) and the inhibition of subcortical areas (indicated by negative coefficients) &quot; as well as &quot; KET displays cortical activation and subcortical inhibition, whereas ISO shows a contrasting preference, activating the cerebral nucleus (CNU) and the hypothalamus while inhibiting cortical areas. To reduce inter-individual variability.&quot; These interpretations are in complete contradiction with the answer 2b above that there was no region that had decreased Fos by either anesthetic.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. In response to your concerns, we have made significant revisions to our data analysis. We have updated our input data to incorporate log-transformed relative c-Fos density values, normalized against the control group for each brain region, as illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. Instead of PCA, we have applied this updated data to hierarchical clustering analysis. The results of these analyses are consistent with our original observation that neither anesthetic led to a decrease in Fos expression in any region.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. I still do not understand the rationale for the use of that metric. The use of a % of total Fos makes the data for each region dependent on the data of the other regions which wrongly leads to the conclusion that some regions are inhibited while they are not when looking at the raw data. Moreover, the interdependence of the variable (relative density) may affect the covariance structure which the PCA relies upon. Why not using the PCA on the logarithm of the raw data or on a relative density compared to the control group on a region-per-region basis instead of the whole brain?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful suggestion. Following your advice, we have revised our approach and now utilize the logarithm of the relative density compared to the control group on a region-by-region basis. We attempted PCA analyses using the logarithm of the raw data, the logarithm of the Z-score, and the logarithm of the relative density compared to control, but none yielded distinct clusters.</p>

<p>As a result, we employed hierarchical cluster analysis. We then examined the Z-scores of the log-transformed relative c-Fos densities (Figures 2E and 3E) to assess expression levels across clusters. Our analysis revealed that neither ISO nor KET treatments led to a significant suppression of c-Fos expression in the 53 brain regions examined. In the ISO group alone, there were 10 regions that demonstrated relative suppression (Z-score &lt; -2, indicated by white boxes) as shown in Figure 3.</p>

<p>Fig. 2B: it's unclear to me why the regions are connected by a line. Such representation is normally used for time series/within-subject series. What is the rationale for the order of the regions and the use of the line? The line connecting randomly organized regions is meaningless and confusing.</p>

<p>Fig 6A. The correlation matrices are difficult to interpret because of the low resolution and arbitrary order of brain regions. I recommend using hierarchical clustering and/or a combination of hierarchical clustering and anatomical organization (e.g. PMID: 31937658). While it is difficult to add the name of the regions on the graph I recommend providing supplementary figures with large high-resolution figures with the name of each brain region so the reader can actually identify the correlation between specific brain regions and the whole brain, Rationale for Metric Choice: Note that I do not dispute the choice of the log which is appropriate, it is the choice of using the relative density that I am questioning.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your constructive feedback. In line with your suggestion, we have implemented hierarchical clustering combined with anatomical organization as per the referenced literature. Additionally, we have updated the vector diagrams in Figure 6A to present them with greater clarity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have revised our network modular division method based on cited literature recommendations. We used hierarchical clustering with correlation coefficients to segment the network into modules, illustrated in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. Due to the singular module structure of the KET network and the sparsity of intermodular connections in the home cage and saline networks, the assessment of network hub nodes did not employ within-module degree Z-score and participation coefficients, as these measures predominantly underscore the importance of connections within and between modules. Instead, we used degree, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality to detect the hub nodes, as detailed in Figure 6—figure supplement 2. With this new approach, the hub node for the KET condition changed from SS to TeA. Corresponding updates have been made to the results section for Figure 6, as well as to the related discussions and the abstract of our paper.</p>

<p>1. Aside from issues with their data transformation (see below), (a) I think they have some interesting Fos counts data in Figures 4B and 5B that indicate shared and distinct activation patterns after KET vs. ISO based anesthesia. These data are far closer to the raw data than PC analyses and need to be described and analyzed in the first figures long before figures with the more abstracted PC analyses. In other words, you need to show the concrete raw data before describing the highly transformed and abstracted PC analyses. (b) This gets to the main point that when selecting brain areas for follow up analyses, these should be chosen based on the concrete Fos counts data, not the highly transformed and abstracted PC analyses.</p>

<p>1. Now, the choice of data transformation for Fos counts is the most significant problem. First, the authors show in the response letter that not using this transformation (region density/brain density) leads to no clustering. However, they also showed the region-densities without transformation (which we appreciate) and it looks like overall Fos levels in the control group Home (ISO) are a magnitude (~10-fold) higher than those in the control group Saline (KET) across all regions shown. This large difference seems unlikely to be due to a biologically driven effect and seems more likely to be due to a technical issue, such as differences in staining or imaging between experiments. Was the Homecage-ISO experiment or at least the Fos labeling and imaging performed at the same time as for the Saline-Ketamine experiment? Please state the answer to this question in the Results section one way or the other.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>a.  “Home (ISO) are a magnitude (~10-fold) higher than those in the control group saline (KET) across all regions shown.” We believe you might be indicating that compared to the home cage group (gray), the saline group (blue) shows a 10-fold higher expression (Supplementary Figure 2/3). Indeed, we observed that the total number of c-Fos cells in the home cage group is significantly lower than in the saline group. This difference may be due to reduced sleep during the light-on period (ZT 6- ZT 7.5) in the saline mice or the pain and stress response caused by intraperitoneal injection of saline. We have explained this discrepancy in the discussion section.Line 308-317（also see below）</p>
<p>“…Our findings indicate that c-Fos expression in the KET group is significantly elevated compared to the ISO group, and the saline group exhibits notably higher c-Fos expression than the home cage group, as seen in Supplementary Figures 2 and 3. Intraperitoneal saline injections in the saline group, despite pre-experiment acclimation with handling and injections for four days, may still evoke pain and stress responses in mice. Subtle yet measurable variations in brain states between the home cage and saline groups were observed, characterized by changes in normalized EEG delta/theta power (home cage: 0.05±0.09; saline: -0.03±0.11) and EMG power (home cage: -0.37±0.34; saline: 0.04±0.13), as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. These changes suggest a relative increase in overall brain activity in the saline group compared to the home cage group, potentially contributing to the higher c-Fos expression…”</p>
<p>b.  Drug administration and tissue collection for both Homecage-ISO and Saline-Ketamine groups were consistently scheduled at 13:00 and 14:30, respectively. Four mice were administered drugs and had tissues collected each day, with two from the experimental group and two from the control group, to ensure consistent sampling. The 4% PFA fixation time, sucrose dehydration time, primary and secondary antibody concentrations and incubation times, staining, and imaging parameters and equipment (exposure time for VS120 imaging was fixed at 100ms) were all conducted according to a unified protocol.</p>
<p>We have included the following statement in the results section: Line 81-83, “Sample collection for all mice was uniformly conducted at 14:30 (ZT7.5), and the c-Fos labeling and imaging were performed using consistent parameters throughout all experiments. ”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Second, they need to deal with this large difference in overall staining or imaging for these two (Home/ISO and Saline/KET) experiments more directly; their current normalization choice does not really account for the large overall differences in mean values and variability in Fos counts (e.g. due to labeling and imaging differences).</p>
<p>3a. I think one option (not perfect but I think better than the current normalization choice) could be z-scoring each treatment to its respective control. They can analyze these z-scored data first, and then in later figures show PC analyses of these data and assess whether the two treatments separate on PC1/2. And if they don't separate, then they don't separate, and you have to go with these results.</p>
<p>3b. Alternatively, they need to figure out the overall intensity distributions from the different runs (if that the main reason of markedly different counts) and adjust their thresholds for Fos-positive cell detection based on this. I would expect that the saline and HC groups should have similar levels of activation, so they could use these as the 'control' group to determine a Fos-positive intensity threshold that gets applied to the corresponding 'treatment' group.</p>
<p>3c.  If neither 3a nor 3b is an option then they need to show the outcomes of their analysis when using the untransformed data in the main figures (the untransformed data plots in their responses to reviewer are currently not in the main or supplementary figs) and discuss these as well.</p>

<p>a.  Thank you very much for your valuable suggestion. We conducted PCA analysis on the ISO and KET data after Z-scoring them with their respective control groups and did not find any significant separation.</p>

<p>As mentioned in our response to reviewer #1, we have reprocessed the raw data. Firstly, we divided the ISO and KET data by their respective control brain regions and then performed a logarithmic transformation to obtain the log relative c-Fos density. The purpose of this is to eliminate the impact of baseline differences and reduce variability. We then performed hierarchical clustering, and finally, we Z-scored the log relative c-Fos density data. The aim is to facilitate comparison of ISO and KET on the same data dimension (Figure 2 and 3).</p>
<p>b.  We appreciate your concerns regarding the detection thresholds for Fos-positive cells. The enclosed images, extracted from supplementary figures for Figures 4 and 5, demonstrate notable differences in c-Fos expression between saline and home cage groups in specific brain regions. These regions exhibit a discernible difference in staining intensity, with the saline group showing enhanced c-Fos expression in the PVH and PVT regions compared to the home cage group. An examination of supplementary figures for Figures 4 and 5 shows that c-Fos expression in the home cage group is consistently lower than in the saline group. This comparative analysis confirms that the discrepancies in c-Fos levels are not due to varying detection thresholds.</p>

<p>b. We have added the corresponding original data graphs to Supplementary Figures 2 and 3, and discussed the potential reasons for the significant differences between these groups in the discussion section (also shown below).</p>
<p>Lines 308-317: &quot;...Our findings indicate that c-Fos expression in the KET group is significantly elevated compared to the ISO group, and the saline group exhibits notably higher c-Fos expression than the home cage group, as seen in Supplementary Figures 2 and 3. Intraperitoneal saline injections in the saline group, despite pre-experiment acclimation with handling and injections for four days, may still evoke pain and stress responses in mice. Subtle yet measurable variations in brain states between the home cage and saline groups were observed, characterized by changes in normalized EEG delta/theta power (home cage: 0.05±0.09; saline: -0.03±0.11) and EMG power (home cage: -0.37±0.34; saline: 0.04±0.13), as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. These changes suggest a relative increase in overall brain activity in the saline group compared to the home cage group, potentially contributing to the higher c-Fos expression.…”</p>
