<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a disorder characterized by the inability of the collecting duct system to secrete acids during metabolic acidosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In addition to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, patients with this disease can present with hypokalemia, kidney stones, urinary sodium waste and difficulty to thrive. Expression of pathogenic variants in the <italic>ATP6V0A4</italic>, <italic>ATP6V1B1</italic>, <italic>FOXI1</italic>, <italic>WDR72</italic> and <italic>SLC4A1</italic> genes are the usual genetic aetiologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The <italic>SLC4A1</italic> gene encodes the anion exchanger 1 (AE1) protein, which is an electroneutral chloride/bicarbonate exchanger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. It exists in two forms: a 911 amino acid erythroid isoform known to interact with erythroid cytoskeletal proteins and participate in red cell respiration and integrity, and a 65 amino acid (NH2-terminal) truncated isoform primarily found in the basolateral membrane of renal type A intercalated cells (A-IC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and podocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. This isoform participates in bicarbonate reabsorption and through its physical and functional interaction with the cytosolic carbonic anhydrase II and apical H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, it supports apical proton export and urine acidification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Pathogenic variants in the <italic>SLC4A1</italic> gene can result in either red cell defects (such as Southeast Asian ovalocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> and hereditary spherocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>), renal cell defects (dRTA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>) or both in patients with homozygous (Band 3 Coimbra and Band 3 Courcouronnes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>) or compound heterozygous variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Renal <italic>SLC4A1</italic> disease-causing variants have only been found in the transmembrane domain - where it could impact protein structure and its transport function- or in the short carboxyl domain – where it possibly affects protein-protein interactions. The pathophysiology of dominant or recessive <italic>SLC4A1</italic> related dRTA (hereafter named dRTA) has originally been linked with the mis-trafficking defect of mutant kAE1 protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. However, recent <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in mice and humans have revealed a complex pathophysiology where a loss of kAE1-expressing intercalated cells, the intracellular relocation of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and accumulation of autophagy marker p62 and ubiquitin-positive material in the remaining type-A intercalated cells was suggested to be the principal cause of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The highly active transport properties of collecting duct cells require the maintenance of cellular energy and homeostasis. The autophagy-mediated turnover of damaged organelles is necessary for protecting collecting duct cells as in most renal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. The chloride/bicarbonate exchange function of kAE1 in A-ICs confers a pivotal role in pH homeostasis and thus is a major contributor to cellular homeostasis. kAE1 protein interacts with several proteins such as integrin-like kinase (ILK), adaptor-related protein complex 1, 3 &amp; 4 (AP-1, AP-3 &amp; AP-4 mu1A), transmembrane protein 139 (TMEM139), kinesin family member 3B (KIF3B), and clathrin among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> that support protein stability and trafficking. It also interacts with homeostatic proteins including the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and the antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX 6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, which play major roles in cellular energy metabolism and oxidative stress response, respectively.</p>
<p>In this study, we report the characterization of newly identified dRTA variations and provide evidence of abnormal autophagy and degradative pathways in cells and kidneys from mice expressing dRTA mutant kAE1 proteins.</p>

<title>Newly identified <italic>SLC4A1</italic> variations from dRTA patients</title>
<p>The patient carrying the R295H mutation was a boy carrying the variation in the homozygous state, whose genetic diagnosis was made at the age of 5, following growth retardation of -2 SD for both weight and height, with bicarbonate at 18 mmol/L, potassium at 2.8 mmol/L, chloridemia at 94 mmol/L, calcemia at 2.55 mmol/L, and a urinary pH of 7.5. He also had a history of a pyeloureteral junction syndrome that was surgically managed at the age of 3. The R295H dRTA variation is a nonsense homozygous substitution characterized by a replacement of guanine (G) on position 884 by adenine (A) in the coding sequence. It has an allelic frequency of 0.14 % in the European population.</p>
<p>For the Y413H variant, the patient was a female diagnosed at 1 month old, with an urinary pH of 7.5, evidence of nephrocalcinosis and failure to thrive. The S525F variant has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, but in brief, the patient was a 13 year old female with plasma pH of 7.25, plasma bicarbonate at 15.3 mmol/L who also presented with polyurethral junction syndrome, nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis since childhood. The Y413H and S525F dRTA variations are nonsense heterozygous substitutions characterized by a replacement of thymine (T) at position 1237 by cytosine (C) and a replacement of cytosine (C) at position 1574 by thymine (T), respectively. The R589H dRTA variation has been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. No follow up data were available for all patients.</p>

<sec id="s3a">
<title>The dRTA kAE1 variants traffic to the basolateral membrane but have reduced transport activity in mIMCD3 cells</title>
<p>We first characterized three newly identified dRTA mutations and compared them with kAE1 WT or previously characterized kAE1 R589H mutant. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> depicts the alpha fold predicted structure of kAE1 showing amino acids mutated in each kAE1 mutant. kAE1 R295H is a recessively inherited substitution in the N-terminal cytosolic domain of the protein. kAE1 Y413H is a dominantly inherited substitution in transmembrane domain (TM) 1 of the core domain. In the gate domain, S525F and R589H substitutions occur in TM 5 and TM 6, respectively. We generated the newly identified dRTA variant cDNAs and expressed them or kAE1 WT in mIMCD3 cells to assess protein abundance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), localization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref>), transport activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) and lifespan (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). As seen on <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, both kAE1 R295H and S525F variants display 2 typical bands similar to kAE1 WT. The top band encompasses kAE1 proteins carrying a complex oligosaccharide that have reached the Golgi and beyond, while the bottom band corresponds to high mannose-carrying kAE1 proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, kAE1 Y413H mutant bands intensity was overall weaker than WT and displayed a predominant single band aligned with high mannose-carrying kAE1 proteins. These results indicate that the 3 newly described dRTA mutants are expressed in mIMCD3 cells. We next localized these mutants by immunofluorescence in mIMCD3 cells. While kAE1 WT is targeted to the plasma membrane, the kAE1 R295H, Y413H and S525F variants partially colocalize with endoplasmic reticulum marker calnexin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Yet, both kAE1 WT and mutants appropriately co-localized with basolateral membrane marker beta-catenin in polarized mIMCD3 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). However, when the transport function was assayed on confluent cells, both kAE1 Y413H and S525F had significantly lower transport activity than WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) and were not significantly different from un-induced WT-Dox cells (not shown on the graph). Finally, we observed that degradation of the kAE1 Y413H mutant begins 6 hours post-synthesis while kAE1 WT abundance remained stable for 24 hours (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Given this premature degradation, we did not perform further assays on cells expressing the Y413H protein. Overall, these results indicate that except for kAE1 Y413H mutant, the other mutants are expressed and traffic to the basolateral membrane of polarized mIMCD3 cells, similar to the previously published kAE1 R589H mutant.</p>

<title>Expression of the kAE1 R295H, S525F and R589H dRTA mutants alter autophagy processes in mIMCD3 cells and whole kidney lysates</title>
<p>In mice expressing kAE1 R607H, a striking reduction in type-A intercalated cells was noted and in the remaining cells, autophagy marker p62 and ubiquitin accumulated in these abnormally enlarged cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We therefore investigated the autophagy machinery in dRTA mutant mIMCD3 cells and in R607H knockin (KI) mice. We first examined the ratio of autophagosome marker LC3BII protein relative to the total intensities of LC3BI and LC3BII as well as p62 levels. These experiments were performed at steady state, upon autophagy induction by starvation, or after autophagy inhibition by Bafilomycin (Baf) A1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A – I</xref> show a consistent increase in the ratio of LC3B II to total LC3B (I + II) in the mutant cells at steady state (<bold>panel D</bold>), with starvation (<bold>panel F</bold>) and with Baf A1 (<bold>panel H</bold>) except for the kAE1 R295H mutant which was not significantly different from WT at steady state only. This suggests an altered autophagy process in the mutant cells, in agreement with preliminary findings from Mumtaz and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. There was no significant difference in p62 abundance in mutant cells compared to WT at steady state and with starvation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-G</xref>). However, with Baf A1, R589H mutant cells had significantly lower p62 abundance compared to WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). To confirm these findings, we next assessed the abundance of these markers in whole kidney lysates from the kAE1 R607H KI mice. We observed that the total LC3B abundance was significantly higher in homozygous KI mice (KI/KI) compared to WT, with no difference in p62 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J-L</xref>). Overall, these results suggest an abnormal autophagy in mutant mIMCD3 cells and in kidneys of R607H KI mice.</p>

<title>dRTA kAE1 mutant expressing cells have more alkaline intracellular pH than WT and altered autophagy flux</title>
<p>Given these preliminary findings of abnormal autophagy in the dRTA mutant cells, we next assessed the efficiency of the autophagy machinery in WT or dRTA mutant-expressing cells using the eGFP-RFP-LC3 construct (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The green fluorescent protein fused to LC3 is quenched in the acidic environment of the autolysosome, while both eGFP and RFP fluoresce in vesicles in the neutral lumen of the autophagosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Focusing on cells expressing either kAE1 S525F or R589H, we quantified the number of eGFP+ (green), RFP+ (red) and double eGFP+/RFP+ (yellow) vesicles in the kAE1 mutant or WT transfected live cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-D</xref>). kAE1 S525F mutant cells have significantly more autophagosomes (yellow) than WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), and both kAE1 S525F and R589H have significantly more autolysosomes (red) than WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> shows that both mutants, particularly the kAE1 S525F mutant cells had significantly more autophagosomes than autolysosomes. This finding suggests an upregulation of autophagy and inhibition in the downstream steps of autophagy that involves the fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. As autolysosomes require luminal v-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase -dependent acidification to efficiently clear cell debris <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and as kAE1 is a base transporter whose function is linked to the v-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, we next wondered whether the steady-state cytosolic pH of mIMCD3 cells expressing kAE1 WT or mutant was different. Using BCECF-AM, we observed that the steady state intracellular pH (pHi) of kAE1 mutant cells was more alkaline than WT cells (except for kAE1 R295H cell pHi which has a similar trend but is not significantly different from WT) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), in agreement with transport activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Given the lack of difference in phenotype between the kAE1 R295H and kAE1 WT mIMCD3 cells, we focused the subsequent experiments on kAE1 S525F and R589H mutant cells. As a higher intracellular pH could contribute to alterations in the autophagy machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, we chemically acidified the cytosolic pH of cells expressing kAE1 mutant or WT and examined autophagy and lysosomal markers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 F-H</xref>). We first determined that incubation of mIMCD3 cells in 0.033 μM nigericin for 2 hours acidified cytosolic pH to 6.9 without causing cell death (Supplementary Figure 1). We observed that chemically reducing pHi to 6.9 in mutant expressing cells reduced the ratio of LC3B II to total LC3B (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>) and the abundance of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in R589H cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 J</xref>) to levels similar to WT cells at steady state. These findings suggest that abnormal autophagy in the mutant cells may be caused by their alkaline pHi, resulting from a reduced anion exchange activity of the mutant kAE1 protein.</p>

<title>mIMCD3 cells expressing dRTA kAE1 mutants and R607H KI kidney tissues have abnormal lysosome number and size</title>
<p>The accumulation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes as seen above may suggest one or a combination of the following: an inability of autophagosomes to fuse with lysosomes and/ or a defect in lysosomal degradative activity in the mutant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We first examined the lysosomal degradative activity by assessing lysosomal protease Cathepsin B activity using Magic Red staining (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>). In agreement with increased RFP+ vesicles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), the kAE1 S525F mutant cells had a significantly higher number of Magic Red positive vesicles than WT whereas the kAE1 R589H mutant cells had significantly larger Magic Red positive vesicles, suggesting an accumulation of undigested material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. To validate this finding, we performed immunostaining and quantified LAMP1 positive staining in ß1 ATPase positive cells (a marker of ICs) in WT and R607H KI mouse kidney sections. The KI mice showed significantly more and larger LAMP1 positive vesicles compared to WT mice in both cortex and medulla (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 C-F</xref>). We probed further into the lysosomal activity by quantifying lysosomal protease Cathepsin D (immature, intermediate and mature) protein abundance by immunoblot in isolated primary murine A-ICs. Although the abundance of immature and intermediate cathepsin D did not differ between genotypes, the KI mice showed a significantly decreased abundance of mature cathepsin D (Supplementary Figure 2). Thus, in line with <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, A-IC from homozygous R607H KI mice display relatively more and larger lysosomes with reduced active protease abundance than WT littermates, suggesting a lysosomal defect in the dRTA kAE1 mutant cells.</p>

<title>dRTA kAE1 mutant cells have lower ATP production rate and abnormal mitochondrial content</title>
<p>Lysosomal degradation is highly dependent on a low luminal pH generated in part by the vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> whose activity depends on ATP hydrolysis. We therefore analysed the ATP production rate in mIMCD3 cells, specifically glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. We measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in empty vector transfected, kAE1 WT or mutant cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we characterized three newly identified dRTA-causing kAE1 variations. Combining <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, we demonstrated that reduced transport activity of the kAE1 mutants correlated with increased cytosolic pH, reduced ATP synthesis, attenuated downstream autophagic pathways and lysosomal dysfunction, pertaining to the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes and/ or lysosomal degradative activity.</p>
<p>In line with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, the kAE1 R295H, Y413H and S525F mutants were intracellularly retained in non-polarised mIMCD3 cells but properly localized to the basolateral membrane after polarization. When expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, other dRTA-causing kAE1 mutants such as dRTA R602H, G701D, V488M, deltaV850 variants also exhibited a plasma membrane trafficking defect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In contrast, the kAE1 R589H mutant was correctly targeted to the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Functionally, cells expressing the Y413H and S525F mutants exhibit about 40 % reduction in chloride/bicarbonate exchange activity compared to kAE1 WT, similar to the previously characterized recessive G701D mutant but unlike the R295H mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, the mechanism causing dRTA remains unclear in the case of the newly identified R295H variant. These findings add to the growing list of <italic>SLC4A1</italic> gene variations causing dRTA.</p>
<p>We next investigated the roots of the altered autophagy briefly reported in R607H KI mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> using mIMCD3 cells and whole kidney lysates. In kidneys of the KI mice, a decrease in A-IC, accumulation of p62 and ubiquitin and enlarged remaining A-ICs, prompted us to investigate autophagy pathways in dRTA mutant cells and in homozygous R607H KI mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. During the autophagy process, LC3B I (a marker for autophagosomes) is converted to lipidated LC3B II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and p62 aggregates to facilitate the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins within the autophagosome complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In mIMCD3 cells, LC3B lipidation was increased in the kAE1 R295H, S525F and R589H mutant cells compared to WT, an increase that persisted with both Baf A1 treatment and starvation. Although opposite effects were expected under inhibition or induction of autophagy, such similar effect has been previously described. In the proximal tubule of obese mice, LC3B accumulation indicating a stagnated autophagy flux, was observed with both chloroquine treatment and 24 hour starvation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Similarly, in NRK-52E cells, a disruption of the autophagy machinery by LC3B II accumulation in high cadmium-stressed cells occurred under either Baf A1 or rapamycin (an autophagy inducer) treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Although LC3B II is elevated during both increased autophagy flux and disrupted autophagy, we did not observe significant accumulation of p62 in mIMCD3 cells expressing dRTA mutants. p62 is specifically a marker of autophagy-mediated protein clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Therefore, p62 accumulation in R607H KI mouse kidney sections strongly suggests a compromised autophagy-mediated clearance while the increased LC3B lipidation without significant changes in p62 in mIMCD3 cells points towards either an increased autophagic flux and/or a disrupted autophagy.</p>
<p>To obtain a clearer picture of the precise autophagic pathway altered in the dRTA mutants, we probed further into the different stages of autophagy and autophagy flux. We noted an accumulation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in the S525F and R589H mutant cells. This was recapitulated in the R607H KI mice which showed significantly more and bigger LAMP 1 positive vesicles in both kidney cortex and medulla, suggesting a blockage in autophagy flux in both dRTA mutant cells and KI mice. Such blockage has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several diseases. In lysosomal storage disease, lysosome accumulation in proximal tubule cells is a key component in the pathways mediating epithelial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In this study, restoring autophagy flux attenuated disease progression. Another study in SK-N-SH, RT4-D6P2T and HeLa cells implicated autophagosome and lysosome accumulation in cellular toxicity associated with neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In agreement with altered lysosomal function, we also noted a greater abundance and size of active cathepsin B lysosomal protease vesicles in mIMCD3 cells. Increased cathepsin B activity affects lysosomal biogenesis, autophagy initiation and cellular homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. In the renal context, cathepsin B knockout mice demonstrated a higher resistance and quicker recovery from glomerular damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, suggesting that cathepsin B accumulation may be detrimental to the cells. Increased cathepsin B abundance in the dRTA mutant cells also correlates with the accumulation of lysosomes. Overall, these findings suggest that the pathogenesis of dRTA in our models involves an inhibition of autophagy flux at the downstream steps involving autophagosome-lysosome fusion and lysosomal protein clearance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The question remained as to how these dRTA variants altered autophagy. The <italic>SLC4A1-3</italic> gene family that includes AE1 are regulators of intracellular pH in different cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. The reduced anion exchange activity in mIMCD3 cells expressing the R589H and S525F variants expectedly correlated with an increased pHi compared to WT counterparts. We wondered whether this was the mechanism explaining blockade in autophagy flux since pHi variations impact autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Previous studies reported more perinuclear localization of lysosomes and autophagosome-lysosome fusion in cells with an increased pHi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Although not examined in our study, an increase in intracellular pH due to starvation decreased the levels of lysosomal kinesin superfamily member KIF2 and ADP-ribosylation factor-like 8B (ARL8), which are responsible for redistributing lysosomes to the cell periphery. This reduction subsequently inhibited mTORC1, resulting in increased autophagosome synthesis and autophagosome-lysosome fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While an alkaline cytosolic pH partially explains the impairment in autophagy flux, a close relationship also exists between intracellular pH and cellular energy dynamics and metabolic stress, all of which are key regulators of autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Therefore, it was plausible that kAE1 variant-induced autophagy dysregulation occurs through a signalling pathway akin to that of energy deprivation-induced autophagy. This hypothesis is supported by our findings of reduced ATP production rate in dRTA kAE1 S525F and R589H mutant cells compared to kAE1 WT cells. We also found that both kAE1 S525F and R589H mutant cells have higher mitochondrial content compared to kAE1 WT cells. The increased mitochondrial content coupled with low ATP point towards improper mitochondrial function in dRTA variant cells. Low ATP levels as seen in dRTA mutant cells may impair autophagy as was shown in human RPE cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. ATP reduction in RPE cells led to complex mitochondrial changes such as structural disorganization, enzyme activity decline, and oxidative damage to mitochondrial components and DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Similarly, in pancreatic islet cells, an alkaline pHi led to increased uptake of phosphate by mitochondria, accelerating the production of superoxide, promoting mitochondrial permeability transition, and inducing translational attenuation due to endoplasmic reticulum stress, ultimately impairing insulin secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Overall, our data support that expression of the kAE1 variants increases pHi which alters mitochondrial function and leads to reduced cellular energy levels that eventually attenuates energy-dependent autophagic pathways including autophagosome-lysosome fusion and lysosomal protein clearance.</p>
<p>In light of these observations, we postulated that correcting the alkaline pHi of dRTA mutant-expressing mIMCD3 cells will alleviate this blockage in autophagy flux. We observed that a chemically engineered pHi of 6.9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> reduced LC3B II accumulation and LAMP1 abundance in mIMCD3 mutant cells to expression levels similar to that of WT cells at baseline. This suggests that a chemically reduced pHi facilitated protein clearance in the two dRTA mutant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> as noted in other studies. In one such study, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with FCCP and nigericin also acidified intracellular pH and triggered autophagy and mitophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Similarly, acid loading in proximal tubular cells under chronic metabolic acidosis showed increased autophagic flux and mitophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. These findings are in line with our results and establish a link between altered autophagy flux and the alkaline pHi of dRTA variant cells.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study established a strong relationship between the expression of defective kAE1 proteins, reduced mitochondrial activity, decreased autophagy and impaired protein degradative flux. Whether this abnormal degradative pathway explains the premature loss of A-IC will need to be elucidated in further studies.</p>

<p>This work characterizes the function and localization of SLC4A1 variants associated with distal renal tubular acidosis in human patients. Cell culture and limited animal studies provide partial but <bold>incomplete</bold> support to the authors' claim that the variants disrupt normal protein degradative flux by alkalinizing the intracellular pH. The study is <bold>valuable</bold> in providing preliminary evidence for future exploration of the link between intracellular pH regulation by SLC4A1 and kidney cell function in vivo.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study is an evaluation of patient variants in the kidney isoform of AE1 linked to distal renal tubular acidosis. Drawing on observations in the mouse kidney, this study extends findings to autophagy pathways in a kidney epithelial cell line.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Experimental data are convincing and nicely done.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some data are lacking or not explained clearly. Mutations are not consistently evaluated throughout the study, which makes it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions.</p>

<p>Context and significance:</p>
<p>Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) can be caused by mutations in a Cl-/HCO3- exchanger (kAE1) encoded by the SLC4A1 gene. The precise mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the disease due to these mutations are unclear, but it is thought that loss of the renal intercalated cells (ICs) that express kAE1 and/or aberrant autophagy pathway function in the remaining ICs may contribute to the disease. Understanding how mutations in SLC4A1 affect cell physiology and cells within the kidney, a major goal of this study, is an important first step to unraveling the pathophysiology of this complex heritable kidney disease.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors identify a number of new mutations in the SLC4A1 gene in patients with diagnosed dRTA that they use for heterologous experiments in vitro. They also use a dRTA mouse model with a different SLC4A1 mutation for experiments in mouse kidneys. Contrary to previous work that speculated dRTA was caused mainly by trafficking defects of kAE1, the authors observe that their new mutants (with the exception of Y413H, which they only use in Figure 1) traffic and localize at least partly to the basolateral membrane of polarized heterologous mIMCD3 cells, an immortalized murine collecting duct cell line. They go on to show that the remaining mutants induce abnormalities in the expression of autophagy markers and increased numbers of autophagosomes, along with an alkalinized intracellular pH. They also reported that cells expressing the mutated kAE1 had increased mitochondrial content coupled with lower rates of ATP synthesis. The authors also observed a partial rescue of the effects of kAE1 variants through artificially acidifying the intracellular pH. Taken together, this suggests a mechanism for dRTA independent of impaired kAE1 trafficking and dependent on intracellular pH changes that future studies should explore.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors corroborate their findings in cell culture with a well-characterized dRTA KI mouse and provide convincing quantification of their images from the in vitro and mouse experiments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data largely support the claims as stated, with some minor suggestions for improving the clarity of the work. Some of the mutants induce different strengths of effects on autophagy and the various assays than others, and it is not clear why this is from the present manuscript, given that they propose pHi and the unifying mechanism.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have identified novel dRTA causing SLC4A1 mutations and studied the resulting kAE1 proteins to determine how they cause dRTA. Based on a previous study on mice expressing the dRTA kAE1 R607H variant, the authors hypothesize that kAE1 variants cause an increase in intracellular pH, which disrupts autophagic and degradative flux pathways. The authors clone these new kAE1 variants and study their transport function and subcellular localization in mIMCD cells. The authors show increased abundance of LC3B II in mIMCD cells expressing some of the kAE1 variants, as well as reduced autophagic flux using eGFP-RFP-LC3. These data, as well as the abundance of autophagosomes, serve as the key evidence that these kAE1 mutants disrupt autophagy. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that decreasing the intracellular pH abrogates the expression of LC3B II in mIMCD cells expressing mutant SLC4A1. Lastly, the authors argue that mitochondrial function, and specifically ATP synthesis, is suppressed in mIMCD cells expressing dRTA variants and that mitochondria are less abundant in AICs from the kidney of R607H kAE1 mice. While the manuscript does reveal some interesting new results about novel dRTA causing kAE1 mutations, the quality of the data to support the hypothesis that these mutations cause a reduction in autophagic flux can be improved. In particular, the precise method of how the western blots and the immunofluorescence data were quantified, with included controls, would enhance the quality of the data and offer more supportive evidence of the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors cloned novel dRTA causing kAE1 mutants into expression vectors to study the subcellular localization and transport properties of the variants. The immunofluorescence images are generally of high quality, and the authors do well to include multiple samples for all of their western blots.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Inconsistent results are reported for some of the variants. For example, R295H causes intracellular alkalinization but also has no effect on intracellular pH when measured by BCECF. The authors also appear to have performed these in vitro studies on mIMCD cells that were not polarized, and therefore, the localization of kAE1 to the basolateral membrane seems unlikely, based upon images included in the manuscript. Additionally, there is no in vivo work to demonstrate that these kAE1 variants alter intracellular pH, including the R607H mouse, which is available to the authors. The western blots are of varying quality, and it is often unclear which of the bands are being quantified. For example, LAMP1 is reported at 100kDa, the authors show three bands, and it is unclear which one(s) are used to quantify protein abundance. Strikingly, the authors report a nonsensical value for their quantification of LCRB II in Figure 2, where the ratio of LCRB II to total LCRB (I + II) is greater than one. The control experiments with starvation and bafilomyocin are not supportive and significantly reduce enthusiasm for the authors' findings regarding autophagy. There are labeling errors between the manuscript and the figures, which suggest a lack of vigilance in the drafting process.</p>
