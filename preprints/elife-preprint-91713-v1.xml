<title>Abstract</title><p>The establishment of tissue axes is fundamental during embryonic development. In the Drosophila wing, the anterior/posterior (AP) and the dorsal/ventral (DV) compartment boundaries provide the basic coordinates around which the tissue develops. These boundaries arise as a result of two lineage decisions, the acquisition of posterior fate by the selector gene <italic>engrailed</italic> (<italic>en)</italic> and of dorsal fate by the selector gene <italic>apterous</italic> (<italic>ap</italic>). While <italic>en</italic> expression domain is set up during embryogenesis, <italic>ap</italic> expression only starts during early wing development. Thus, the correct establishment of <italic>ap</italic> expression pattern with respect to <italic>en</italic> must be tightly controlled. Here we have functionally investigated the transcriptional inputs integrated by the “early” <italic>ap</italic> enhancer (apE) and their requirement for correct boundary positioning. Detailed mutational analyses using CRISPR/Cas revealed a role of apE in positioning the DV boundary with respect to the AP boundary, with apE mutants often displaying mirror-image anterior wing duplications. We then accomplished tissue-specific enhancer disruption via dCas9 expression. This approach allowed us to dissect the spatio-temporal requirement of apE function, challenging the mechanism by which apE miss-regulation leads to AP defects. Base-pair resolution analyses of apE uncovered a single HOX binding site essential for wing development, which, when mutated, led to wingless flies. Along these lines, we found that the HOX gene Antennapedia (Antp) is fundamental for <italic>ap</italic> expression. In addition, we demonstrated that the transcription factors Pointed (Pnt), Homothorax (Hth) and Grain (Grn) are necessary for apE function. Together, our results provide a comprehensive molecular basis of early <italic>ap</italic> activation and the developmental consequences of its miss-regulation, shedding light on how compartmental boundaries are be set up during development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During development, cells segregate into different populations, often in a lineage-restricted manner. Between these populations, developmental boundaries arise as essential organizing centers, providing the mechanical and chemical cues required for tissue patterning and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Irvine &amp; Rauskolb, 2001</xref>). The Drosophila imaginal wing disc has served as a discovery platform for the study of developmental boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tripathi &amp; Irvine, 2022</xref>). This tissue is subdivided by two lineage decisions. During embryogenesis, roughly half the cells of the future wing disc express the selector gene <italic>engrailed</italic> (<italic>en</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Morata &amp; Lawrence, 1975</xref>). <italic>en</italic> expressing cells will acquire posterior (P) fate, while cells without <italic>en</italic> will adopt anterior (A) fate. These two populations will thereafter be segregated via the establishment of the Antero-Posterior (AP) compartment boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">1976</xref>). The AP boundary is essential for medio-lateral patterning of the wing, via the action of the morphogens Hedgehog (Hh) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Basler &amp; Struhl, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Capdevila &amp; Guerrero, 1994</xref>). The second lineage subdivision occurs during early wing disc development, when the gene <italic>apterous</italic> (<italic>ap</italic>) starts to be transcribed in a population of cells of the proximal wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cohen et al., 1992</xref>). <italic>ap</italic> encodes a LIM-type homeodomain transcription factor that, together with its cofactor CHIP, is responsible for instructing dorsal (D) identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blair et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Diaz-Benjumea &amp; Cohen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fernández-Fúnez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Milán &amp; Cohen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">van Meyel et al., 1999</xref>). Cells lacking <italic>ap</italic> expression will become ventral (V). The DV boundary instructs proximo-distal patterning via the morphogen Wingless (Wg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Couso et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Neumann &amp; Cohen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zecca et al., 1996</xref>). At the boundary intersection, the secreted signaling molecules expressed at the DV (Wg) and the AP (Dpp) boundaries synergistically promote specification and growth of the wing pouch, the larval precursor of the wing blade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Couso et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kim et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Williams et al., 1994</xref>). The two boundaries thereby provide the coordinate system according to which the four segregated quadrants of the developing wing (anterior-dorsal, AD; anterior-ventral, AV; posterior-dorsal, PD; and posterior-ventral, PV) develop.</p>
<p>The downstream effectors of <italic>ap</italic> during wing development are well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blair et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Klein et al., 1998</xref>). However, little is known about how the expression pattern of <italic>ap</italic> is set up with respect that of <italic>en.</italic> In other words, how is the DV boundary positioned with respect to the AP boundary?</p>
<p>Interestingly, <italic>ap<sup>blot</sup></italic>, a mutation within the <italic>ap</italic> cis-regulatory landscape has been shown to produce mirror image transformations of the P compartment into the A compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Whittle, 1979</xref>). How such interaction between <italic>ap</italic> and the AP specification program arises is unknown. Previously, we have found that <italic>ap<sup>blot</sup></italic>maps to the <italic>ap</italic> Early enhancer (apE), the regulatory module responsible for <italic>ap</italic> early transcription (Bieli, Kanca, Gohl, et al., 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bieli, Kanca, Requena, et al., 2015</xref>). In later stages, at least in the wing pouch, <italic>ap</italic> positively regulates itself via the enhancer apDV (Supplementary figure 1, (Bieli, Kanca, Requena, et al., 2015)). This regulatory feedback is likely to maintain the expression pattern established earlier by apE.</p>
<p>The only upstream factor known to regulate apE is the EGFR pathway. EGFR signaling has been shown to be both required and sufficient for <italic>ap</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zecca &amp; Struhl, 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, this requirement was only observed during early stages of wing development. Manipulation of EGFR signaling had no effect on <italic>ap</italic> transcription in later stages. This temporal dependency indicates that the regulation of apE is more complex and presumably controlled by additional factors.</p>
<p>In this study, we have taken a bottom-up approach, from the sequence of the enhancer to the development of the tissue. We have genetically dissected apE using CRISPR gene editing and found that apE is required for correct DV positioning. apE hypomorphic mutants displayed problems in the growth of the posterior-dorsal compartment and subsequent mirror image duplications of the A compartment. The EGFR core transcription factor (TF) Pointed (Pnt) and the TF Homothorax (Hth) are responsible for early <italic>ap</italic> expression via apE. The loss of these factors in the posterior compartment resulted in mirror image duplications of the wing. Base pair-resolution mutation analysis of apE subregions uncovered a novel HOX-GATA complex fundamental for wing formation, of which we identify Grain (Grn) as the GATA TF and propose Antennapedia (Antp) as the HOX. Finally, in order to dissect the spatio-temporal requirement of apE, we have developed a novel methodology, solely based on the recruitment of catalytic-dead Cas9 (dCas9) to the enhancer. Using this tool, we validated the results of our mutational analysis and dissected the spatial requirement of apE function.</p>

<title>Precise manipulation of endogenous apE enhancer</title>
<p>The 27 Kb intergenic spacer upstream of the <italic>ap</italic> transcription start site (TSS) contains five conserved regions, named C1 to C5 (Bieli, Kanca, Requena, et al., 2015). We have previously replaced this entire intergenic sequence by an <italic>attP</italic> site, thereby generating a “landing site” in the locus. Subsequently, different attP-containing fragments were re-integrated via φ C31-mediated transgenesis. This approach revealed three distinct modules required during wing development: the apE enhancer, within C2, required for early <italic>ap</italic> expression; the DV enhancer, within C5, responsible for robust <italic>ap</italic> expression along the DV boundary; and a Polycomb response element (PRE), immediately upstream to the TSS, required for maintenance of the transcriptional state of <italic>ap</italic> (Bieli, Kanca, Requena, et al., 2015). While useful to study the overall cis-regulatory architecture, reintegration into this landing site resulted in changes in the relative distance of these individual regulatory modules with respect to the TSS and entailed large genomic deletions. In order to study apE in its endogenous context, we decided to construct a new landing site.</p>
<p>The minimal enhancer region contained in apE encompasses 463 bp in the proximal area of C2, hereafter named OR463 (Supplementary Figure 2). We have previously shown that reintegration of OR463 alone is sufficient to rescue the wing phenotype produced by the loss of C2 (Bieli, Kanca, Requena, et al., 2015). Based on these results, we decided to substitute OR463 by an <italic>attP</italic> site using CRISPR/Cas9 editing (Supplementary Figure 3 and Materials and Methods). We have previously shown that crosstalk between apE and <italic>dad</italic> enhancers is responsible for the dominant <italic>Xasta</italic> (<italic>Xa</italic>) phenotype (Bieli, Kanca, Gohl, et al., 2015). Thus, in order to positively select for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR, the Dad13 enhancer was inserted, flanked by FRTs, alongside the <italic>attP</italic> site (Supplementary Figure 3A, B). As predicted, heterozygous insertion events of the <italic>attP</italic> coupled to Dad13 were easily identified by their characteristic wing phenotypes (Supplementary Figure 3A’). Flippase was subsequently used to excise Dad13 (Supplementary Figure 3B). The resulting substitution of OR463 by the <italic>attP</italic> site resulted in fully penetrant loss of wings in homozygosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, Supplementary Figure 3B’). The <italic>attP</italic> site was then used to re-integrate the different OR463 fragments via φ C31-mediated insertion, along with the <italic>mini-yellow</italic> marker, which was later removed using the FRT/Flippase system (Supplementary figure 3C, D).</p>

<p>Reintegration of OR463 sequence into this landing site resulted in 100% of normal wings in homozygosis (Supplementary Figure 3D’) and 95% normal wings when in a hemizygous background (over the <italic>ap<sup>DG3</sup></italic> deletion, which encompasses the whole intergenic spacer (Bieli, Kanca, Requena, et al., 2015)). This approach was used to generate all the mutants described in this study.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>OR463 contains two highly conserved domains required for wing development</title>
<p>Bioinformatic analysis of OR463 uncovered four main modules based on sequence conservation among related insects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We further refined those modules by analyzing the conservation of TF binding sites using MotEvo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arnold et al., 2011</xref>). This analysis permitted us to subdivide OR463 into four regions of high conservation (m1 to m4) and six less well-conserved inter-regions (N1 to N6) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the functional requirement of each region, we generated fly strains bearing precise deletions of each of them. Homozygous and hemizygous animals of all the mutants reached adulthood, displaying altered mutant phenotypes only within the wing and haltere. Scoring of wing phenotypes revealed two genomic regions which, when deleted, resulted in higher penetrance of mutant phenotypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The first area was centered in m3, whose deletion resulted in fully penetrant loss of wings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Deletion of the neighboring region N4 also yielded a very high number of defective wings. The second sensitive area was located around conserved region m1 (N1, m1, N2), with both <italic>Δm1</italic> and <italic>ΔN2</italic> deletions yielding similarly penetrant phenotypes. The penetrance of the phenotypes was exacerbated when the aforementioned mutant alleles were scored in hemizygous background (over <italic>ap<sup>DG3</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Excluding the <italic>Δm3</italic> deletion, although varying in quantity and quality, the other mutants displayed similar phenotypes. Interestingly, many of these wings presented a posterior compartment outgrowth, in which the vein pattern was reminiscent to that of the anterior wing, and anterior margin bristles were found in its posterior edge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). In those wings, the anterior compartment was largely unaffected.</p>
<p>In some of the most penetrant alleles and specially when the mutants where in hemizygosis, wings did not present an outgrowth, but rather partial mirror image transformations of the margin bristles of the P compartment into A compartment identity accompanied by unusual vein trajectories in the P compartment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). This wing phenotype was often associated with a reduction in P compartment size. In some of these cases, the P compartment was hardly detectable and the overall wing size was severely reduced, resulting in roundish wings in which only A and tip margin bristles were present (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>’). Some of these phenotypes are reminiscent of those reported for <italic>ap<sup>Blot</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Whittle, 1979</xref>) and point towards a yet undescribed crosstalk between <italic>ap</italic> early expression and the AP specification program.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>OR463 disruption results in misplacement of DV boundary with respect to the AP boundary</title>
<p>In order to dissect how these mirror image duplications arise, we analyzed the expression pattern of Ap in third-larval stage (L3) wing imaginal discs. In control discs (wild-type OR463 reintegrated into the landing site), the Ap expression domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) mimicked that seen in wild-type discs (Bieli, Kanca, Requena, et al., 2015). Wg was detected in its characteristic stripe along the DV boundary and in the two concentric rings of the hinge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In Δ<italic>m1</italic> homozygous mutants, disruption of the Ap expression pattern was most evident in the P compartment, where the DV boundary was curved towards the hinge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>’). This deformation of the DV boundary was also revealed by Wg immunostaining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>’). In these cases, Wg expression in the P hinge also seemed altered. The deformation of DV compartmentalization was also observed in other alleles carrying deletions within the OR463 region (Supplementary Figure 4). As described for adult wings, the severity of the wing disc phenotype was exacerbated in hemizygous background, with wing discs that presented a more obvious deformation of Ap pattern in the P side of the wing and overall reduced size (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>’’). In all cases, intensity of anti-Ap staining was comparable among the wild-type and the different mutants, suggesting a role of apE in setting <italic>ap</italic> expression domain rather than its expression level.</p>
<p>P to A mirror image duplication of the wing has been described upon different genetic perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baonza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brower, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Guillén et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hidalgo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Recasens-Alvarez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Uemura et al., 1993</xref>). A paradigmatic case is the loss of <italic>en</italic> expression. <italic>en</italic> mutant clones in the P compartment lead to loss of P identity and the formation of a new AP boundary around the clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brower, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tabata et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, we analyzed En expression in wing discs of <italic>Δap<sup>E</sup></italic> hemizygous mutants (Supplementary Figure 5). While wing disc size is severely affected compared to control, En localization, as revealed by immunostaining, presented little change in its expression pattern. To account for the possibility that <italic>en</italic> expression would be lost in some cells during development, thereby leading to the duplications, we analyzed the lineage of <italic>en</italic> positive cells in both control and Δ<italic>m1</italic> hemizygous background. To that end, we made use of gTRACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Evans et al., 2009</xref>), a genetic tool that uses the expression of a Gal4 line of interest to both immortalize a fluorescent reporter (via Flp mediated excision of a FRT cassette, leading to the constitutive expression of a <italic>tub</italic>-GFP reporter) and at the same time reveal current Gal4 levels (via an <italic>UAS</italic>-RFP transgene). In both control and Δ<italic>m1</italic> hemizygous background, <italic>en</italic>-Gal4 revealed highly overlapping patterns of lineage and current expression (Supplementary Figure 5B, C). Thus, these experiments discard the loss of <italic>en</italic> expression as a driver for the duplications observed in <italic>ap</italic> mutants. In addition, the experiment revealed that in Δ<italic>m1</italic> mutants, the P compartment is severely reduced and that the position of the AP boundary along the pouch was also distorted (Supplementary Figure 5C).</p>
<p>Motivated by this finding, we measured the relative size of the P wing disc compartment in several of the OR463 mutants, revealing a reduction in all of them (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), in agreement with the results of the gTRACE experiment and the phenotypes of adult wings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). The relative position of the DV and AP boundaries was then studied by co-immunostaining of Ap and Ptc proteins. In control discs, DV and AP form perpendicular axes, with a single intersection in the middle of the wing pouch, dividing the disc in four quadrants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In Δ<italic>m1</italic> hemizygous discs, PD quadrant size was strongly reduced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>’,). This resulted in two intersection points and long stretches where both the DV and the AP coincide. In cases where the size of PD was less compromised, as in Δ<italic>N1</italic> hemizygous mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>’’), these two intersections were located further apart. Quantification of PD quadrant size revealed a great decrease of relative area in different OR463 mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>’).</p>

<title>A model to explain the adult patterning defects of OR463 mutants</title>
<p>Intersection of AP and DV boundaries is crucial for wing specification, patterning and growth both via Dpp and Wg signals. Wild-type wings present a single intersection of the AP and DV boundaries around which the four wing quadrants (DA, DP, VA and VP) grow coordinately. During morphogenesis, the disc evaginates along the DV boundary to form the adult wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aldaz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fristrom &amp; Fristrom, 1975</xref>) (Supplementary Figure 6A). Our results indicate that OR463 is fundamental for setting up the <italic>ap</italic> expression pattern, and that the P compartment is the most sensitive to its mutation. Thus, we tried to explain the diversity of adult phenotypes, considering changes in the <italic>ap</italic> expression domain within the P compartment. We hypothesized that the number of intersections of DV and AP boundaries as well as the distance between them could explain the diversity of adult phenotypes observed in the different OR463 mutants.
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In the cases in which the size of PD is affected but still occupies a significant area (as in N1/DG3 animals, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), the wing disc presents two intersections that are located far from each other. In these cases, two wing pouches would be specified and an outgrowth formed (Supplementary Figure 6B). In the wing margin of this outgrowth, both AP and DV boundaries coincides. We predict that, in this outgrowth, the D side will present A fate while the V side will have P fate, causing only A mirror-image duplication of the D side. This is in accordance with the results presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, where most of the adult wings analyzed presented only partial transformation of the wing margin. Also, it explains why the venation pattern is often disrupted, since during apposition, dorsal and ventral epithelia will present different venation patterns.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We also expect that, when PD is very small or absent, no outgrowth would be observed, as there is only one intersection point, or two intersections that are very close to each other. In these cases, both AP and DV boundaries will largely overlap (Supplementary Figure 6C). Since the D side of the epithelium presents A identity, the wing will present partial mirror image duplication (as is the case of the outgrowth described in Supplementary Figure 6B).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Finally, in the cases in which <italic>ap</italic> expression is depleted from P and also affected in the A compartment, AP and DV boundaries do not intersect. However, if the boundaries are close enough, they would induce slight wing pouch growth (Supplementary Figure 6D). In these wing discs, the DV boundary will be fully embedded in the A compartment, and thus, all the wing margin will present A identity. Indeed, the wings showing the most drastic size defects among the different OR463 mutants only present A and tip margin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>’).</p>
<p>This model predicts that in both the P outgrowths (Supplementary Figure 6B) and the P to A mirror-image duplications (Supplementary Figure 6C), the D compartment presents AD identity. Consistent with our model, in Δ<italic>m1</italic> homozygous mutant wings (Supplementary Figure 6E) as well as in other OR463 mutants (data not shown), we could identify campaniform sensillae, a specialized sensory organ only present in the AD compartment of the wing blade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dinges et al., 2021</xref>).</p></list-item>

<title>Posterior hinge is severely affected in OR463 mutants</title>
<p>The wing pouch grows surrounded by (and at the expense of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zecca &amp; Struhl, 2007</xref>)) the presumptive wing hinge. The hinge does not have a passive role in wing disc growth, but also provides growth factors required for cell division. In particular, JAK/STAT ligands (Unpaired 1-3) derived from the hinge have been found to promote posterior growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Recasens-Alvarez et al., 2017</xref>). Loss of JAK/STAT signaling in P cells results in mirror image duplications that highly resemble those seen in OR463 mutants. <italic>ap</italic> expression is indispensable for hinge development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Metz, 1914</xref>). Indeed apE mutants totally lack this structure (Bieli, Kanca, Requena, et al., 2015). Thus, we analyzed the morphology of the hinge in OR463 mutants. We labeled the hinge by immunodetection of the hinge-specific TF Homothorax (Hth). Compared to control discs, in which the P proximal hinge is present (Supplementary Figure 7A), hemizygous Δ<italic>m1</italic> mutants completely lacked this region (Supplementary Figure 7A’).</p>
<p>We then assessed the expression of the JAK/STAT ligand Unpaired 1 (Upd1). <italic>upd-1</italic> is expressed in five areas in third instar wing imaginal discs, in three main spots in the dorsal hinge and in two weaker regions in the ventral body wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Johnstone et al., 2013</xref>). This pattern was faithfully captured via a <italic>upd</italic>-Gal4 line driving the expression of <italic>UAS</italic>-CD8:GFP (Supplementary Figure 7B). As expected given the strong hinge phenotypes of OR463 mutants, <italic>upd</italic>-Gal4&gt;<italic>UAS</italic>-CD8:GFP did not display any P signal in the proximal area of the wing when OR463 was deleted (Supplementary Figure 7B’).</p>
<p>These results demonstrate that the main P source of JAK/STAT signaling in the disc is absent in OR463 mutants, suggesting that the similar phenotypes produced by defective JAK/STAT signaling and by mutations in OR463 might be related.</p>

<title>Spatio-temporal analysis of apE via dCas9</title>
<p>The functional dissection of regulatory regions has classically relied on the generation of mutants. Classical mutant analysis, however, does not offer any spatio-temporal information of enhancer function. Instead, reporters are normally employed as indirect readouts. Recently, expression of catalytically-dead Cas9 (dCas9) has been proposed as a means to inhibit TF-DNA binding in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shariati et al., 2019</xref>). Given the high sensitivity of OR463 to perturbations, we speculated that localized expression of dCas9 could result in steric hindrance, preventing the activity of the enhancer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To achieve spatio-temporal control over dCas9 expression, we constructed a fly line in which dCas9 was placed under the control of <italic>UAS</italic> enhancer sequences. Expression of dCas9 by the posterior driver <italic>en</italic>-Gal4 did not result in major phenotypes at 23° nor 25° degrees when combined with a control gRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, see Materials and Methods), indicating that dCas9 does not dramatically alter the cell’s physiology. To target dCas9 to the OR463 locus, we also generated a transgene encoding four ubiquitously expressed gRNAs (<italic>U6-</italic> OR463.gRNAx4). Three of these gRNAs targeted the vicinity of m3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), the region that displayed the strongest phenotypes in the deletion analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Our mutation analysis suggests that loss of OR463 activity in the P compartment is responsible of the mirror image duplications observed in OR463 mutants (Supplementary Figure 6). We directly tested this assumption by expressing dCas9 using <italic>en</italic>-Gal4 in the presence of OR463 gRNAs. This manipulation yielded wings with posterior defects (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), highly similar to those shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Interestingly, the phenotype most often detected at 23° degrees was the presence of P outgrowths (with some A bristles). Higher expression of dCas9 (at 25° degree) yielded a majority of wings in which the posterior edge was partially transformed into A identity. The wing discs obtained from these experiments (at 23° degree) revealed a reduction of PD quadrant size, with the concomitant mispositioning of the DV and AP compartmental boundaries, which intersected twice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">F</xref>). These experiments independently confirm the crucial role of OR463 in positioning the DV boundary and demonstrate that it is the loss of apE in the posterior compartment which is driving the AP mirror-image duplications. In order to confirm the spatial specificity of enhancer inhibition, dCas9 was also expressed using <italic>ptc</italic>-Gal4 in the presence of OR463 gRNAs. In this case, <italic>ap</italic> expression domain was divided in two, with no expression along the central pouch (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). This broad repression band coincides with the expression pattern of <italic>ptc</italic> in early wing discs. This result confirms that dCas9 is able to inhibit enhancer function with high spatial resolution <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Pnt and Hth are required for m1-m4 activity</title>
<p>Having established the requirement of OR463 activity during wing development and boundary positioning, we analyzed TF factors responsible for its activity pattern. m1 bioinformatic analysis identified two main TF binding sites, predicted to be recognized by Hth and an TF from the E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The m4 region was also predicted to be recognized by ETS TFs, however, its deletion had minor effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In order to accentuate the possible phenotypes caused by deletions within apE, all subsequent m1 deletions were generated in a background which lacked m4. We generated small deletions encompassing each of the putative binding sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Scoring of the phenotypic penetrance in homozygosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) and hemizygosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>’) revealed that both sites were important for wing development, the ETS binding site having the biggest effect when deleted. Analysis of DV and AP boundary position based on immunostaining revealed that deletion of the different binding sites in hemizygosis resulted in reduced size of the PD quadrant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Adult wings of the different mutants resembled the loss of m1, amid a reduction in the penetrance of the phenotypes (data not shown).</p>

<p>We then knocked-down the expression of the TFs predicted to bind m1, Pnt and Hth, via RNAi expression in the posterior compartment using <italic>en-</italic>Gal4. Affected cells were labeled using <italic>UAS</italic>-CD8:GFP. Strikingly, when compared to control wing discs, <italic>hth</italic>RNAi expression resulted in drastic reduction of the PD quadrant, mimicking the loss of m1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Unfortunately, adult phenotypes could not be studied, since these animals did not reach adulthood.</p>
<p>We have previously demonstrated that the ETS factor Pnt is able to bind apE (Bieli, Kanca, Requena, et al., 2015), making it an ideal putative m1 input. In addition, deletion of most conserved Pnt binding sites in an apE reporter reduced its activity (Bieli, Kanca, Requena, et al., 2015). Expression of <italic>pnt</italic>RNAi resulted in a reduction of the PD quadrant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In this case, a posterior outgrowth was formed, mimicking that of the phenotypes caused by the loss of the ETS binding site in m1. <italic>en</italic>Gal4&gt;<italic>pnt</italic>RNAi animals reached adulthood, displaying outgrowths in the P compartment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), confirming previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baonza et al., 2000</xref>). As it is the case for some of the different OR463 mutants, these outgrowths presented partial P to A transformation. In addition, campaniform sensillae were identified in the transformed compartment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>To address the role of these TFs in apE activation, we tested the effect of the <italic>pnt</italic> and <italic>hth</italic> knockdown on the expression of an apE-LacZ reporter fusion. apE is mainly expressed during early larval stages. Thus, we choose mid L2 wing discs for this comparison. As before, <italic>UAS</italic>-CD8:GFP was used to label the manipulated cells. In these early discs, both Ap staining and apE-LacZ reporter were strongly reduced upon <italic>pnt</italic>RNAi expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). In the case of <italic>hth</italic>RNAi, we observed a total abrogation of both (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).

<title>High-resolution m3 analysis suggests a novel HOX-GATA complex required for wing development</title>
<p>Our mutation analysis revealed that the most sensitive region of OR463 is m3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

Enhancer activity was then tested using apE-LacZ reporters. Despite apE-LacZ being expressed mainly during early larvae development (Bieli, Kanca, Requena, et al., 2015), LacZ is highly stable within cells, which permits, upon long exposure to X-Gal, the rough evaluation of enhancer activity in L3 wing discs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).

</fig>
<p>Bioinformatic analysis of m3 revealed two highly conserved DNA regions, recognized by putative GATA and HOX TFs. To avoid possible artifacts derived from the sequence rearrangement that deletions produce, we generated a library of fly strains bearing precise nucleotide substitutions in pairs (G⇾T, A⇾C, T⇾C and C⇾A), allowing the evaluation of the functional dependency of each base-pair within the region in the endogenous setting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Phenotypic scoring revealed that the sequences associated with both the putative GATA and HOX binding sites were required for normal wing development (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Mutations within the GATA binding site resulted in phenotypes resembling those described for other OR463 mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>’). Mutations affecting the HOX binding site were comparatively stronger and more penetrant (Figure E’’’). Four of the lines carrying mutations within the predicted HOX binding site yielded no wings (Figure E’’), indicating a strong requirement of this putative binding site for wing development. The same results were obtained when the binding sites were deleted individually (Supplementary Figure 8A, B). Deletion of the predicted HOX binding site resulted in the same Ap distribution as the complete deletion of m3 (Supplementary Figure 8C).</p>
<p>The very high conservation of the two site suggests that both factors may interact during enhancer activation. In order to genetically test this hypothesis, we designed a series of mutants in which we modified the distance between these binding sites. The normal spacing was either expanded to 6bp or contracted to 2bp (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 F</xref>, Supplementary Figure 9A). When spacing was increased, all wings presented defects and, in 28% of the cases, wings were totally missing (n=110) (Supplementary Figure 9B). Reduction of the spacer sequence resulted in comparatively milder phenotypes, yielding 30% of normal wings and most of the other having a posterior compartment outgrowth (n=155) (Supplementary figure 9C). These results suggest that the distance between these transcription factors is important for the correct functioning of the enhancer, likely implicating a yet unknown GATA-HOX complex involved in wing development.</p>
<p>m3 bears a strong sequence identity with m2. In fact, both regions are predicted to contain one GATA and one HOX binding sites. In contrast to the 5bp separation between these sites in the m3 region, the m2 binding sites are separated by 11bp. As an independent test for the requirement of correct spacing, we evaluated whether reducing the distance of m2 binding sites could rescue the lack of m3, whose deletion results in fully penetrant loss of wings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, Supplementary Figure 9E). Interestingly, reducing the spacing of m2 in <italic>Δm3</italic> mutants reduced to 69% the loss of wings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>. The most frequent phenotype among the remaining 31% were tube-like wings (Supplementary Figure 9F’). In rare cases, more normal wings were observed (Supplementary Figure 9F’’). This small but significant rescue further supports the hypothesis that the interaction between a GATA and a HOX factor upon DNA binding is important for OR463 activity.</p>

Among the phenotypes, we observed loss of the wing or the notum and wings with anterior image duplications, as well as others displaying reduced P compartment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The other <italic>grn</italic>RNAi stock (BL27658), when expressed with the same driver line, lead to developmental arrest in white pupae. This line was used to study the effect of <italic>grn</italic> depletion in the wing imaginal discs. This experiment revealed a dramatic defect in P growth compared to control discs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). In all cases, P cells did not show any Ap expression. As a result, the P compartment did not remain associated with the DA cells, positioning them randomly within the rest of the disc. This “floating” nature of P compartment is likely to explain the diversity of adult phenotypes ovserved with the <italic>grn</italic>RNAi<sup>BL34014</sup> transgene. In some cases, the P compartment was located close to the DV boundary, promoting some degree of pouch growth but leading to partial or total notum loss (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>’). In other cases, P cells ended up in the notum region, leading to somewhat proper patterning of this region but resulting in dramatic defects of the hinge and pouch (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>’’).</p>

In these cases, the P compartment was totally depleted in mid L3 wing discs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), supporting the results obtained with RNAi.

<title>Antennapedia is indispensable wing development and <italic>ap</italic> expression</title>
<p>Our results demonstrated that there is a single putative Homeodomain-DNA interaction in OR463 that is indispensable for wing development (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>’’). However, the homeodomain-containing protein binding to this site remains to be characterized. The fly genome contain 103 genes that encode proteins with homeobox domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bürglin &amp; Affolter, 2016</xref>). Among those, a plausible candidate, Antennapedia (Antp), is responsible for the embryonic identity of the segment T2, from which the wing discs derive. Supporting an instructive role in wing formation, <italic>Antp</italic> overexpression specifies ectopic wings in the head under certain genetic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kurata et al., 2000</xref>; Prince et al., 2008). Recent reports demonstrated that <italic>Antp</italic> is required during larval stages for wing disc morphogenesis and wing margin development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Paul et al., 2021</xref>). However, these wings presented mild phenotypes compared to the total loss of wing in <italic>Δm3</italic> mutants. We thus speculated that, if anything, <italic>Antp</italic> would play a role in the early activation of the enhancer. Such an early role of Antp in wing disc development could have been easily missed in previous studies, which only depleted <italic>Antp</italic> during larval stages. Supporting an early role of Antp in wing development, early <italic>Antp</italic> MARCM clones generated during the first 24h of development were never retrieved in larval stages in the disc proper, and only very rarely in the peripodial membrane (Supplementary Figure 11A). Interestingly, clones generated at 48h in development did not affect anti-Ap levels (Supplementary Figure 11B), indicating that <italic>Antp</italic> is dispensable for <italic>ap</italic> expression in mid-late larval stages.</p>
<p>To deplete <italic>Antp</italic> during embryonic development, tissue-specific CRISPR/Cas9 was employed. First, we designed flies expressing ubiquitously-expressed gRNAs targeting both the first protein-coding exon of <italic>Antp</italic> and its third protein-coding exon (which encodes the homeodomain) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Second, to target the wing as early as the disc is determined, we employed the driver <italic>sna</italic>1.7-Gal4, specifically expressed in the embryonic primordia of the wing and haltere from stage 12 onwards (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Requena et al., 2017</xref>). Control wing disc showed robust Antp immunoreactivity in the wing disc, with its highest levels in the hinge and A compartment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Levine et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Paul et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, when Cas9 was expressed via <italic>sna</italic>1.7-Gal4 in the presence of <italic>Antp</italic> gRNAs, Antp immunoreactivity was severely affected, yet, only totally depleted in some of the discs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Interestingly, some of these discs presented dramatic changes in Ap pattern, presenting only isolated Ap-expressing clones (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>’). anti-Ap intensity in these clones was comparable to controls, suggesting problems in <italic>ap</italic> early pattern establishment rather than later maintenance of <italic>ap</italic> expression. Finally, in those discs without Antp immunoreactivity, no Ap was detected (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>’’). These discs presented severe malformations and did not exhibit the normal notum-hinge-pouch structure of wild type wing discs. Many of these individuals died during pupal stages, with survivors presenting severe problems in wing extension and notum closure (data not shown). Among those flies that hatched, some of the most severely affected flies lacked most wing disc derivatives, including the wings and parts of the notum (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Halteres were always normal (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>), suggesting that the malformations arise due to the specific loss of <italic>Antp</italic> and not due Cas9 expression.</p>

<title>Boundary position in the wing imaginal disc</title>
<p>Boundary positioning is fundamental for proper development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dahmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Irvine &amp; Rauskolb, 2001</xref>). Mispositioning of developmental boundaries leads to severe developmental defects. In the wing imaginal disc, the intersection between two developmental boundaries is responsible for the specification of the wing pouch and the establishment of the coordinates which regulate tissue patterning. In this study, we have analyzed the role of the apE enhancer in the correct establishment of the DV boundary. In previous studies, it had been shown that the EGFR pathway is a key input required for early <italic>ap</italic> transcription (Bieli, Kanca, Requena, et al., 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zecca &amp; Struhl, 2002</xref>). However, the expression pattern of the EGFR ligand <italic>vn</italic> is highly dynamic during the onset of <italic>ap</italic> expression: in L1 and L2 larvae, <italic>vn</italic> is expressed in a proximodistal stripe, both in future ventral and dorsal cells, which only later is confined to the proximal end of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Paul et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, <italic>ap</italic> is first expressed in the center of the wing disc, acquiring its characteristic pattern during the second instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nienhaus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Paul et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these patterns suggest a more complex regulatory scenario. In this study, we provide evidence that both Hth and Grn are required for apE activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Interestingly, these two factors are expressed early in the presumptive hinge region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brown &amp; Castelli-Gair Hombria, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wu &amp; Cohen, 2002</xref>) (See <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> for a working model on <italic>ap</italic> regulatory inputs). In particular, Grn is enriched in the areas in which the transverse connective trachea is in contact with the wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Guha et al., 2009</xref>). This extra layer of apE regulation might explain why the early expression of <italic>ap</italic> is initially confined to the central part of the wing, and why the first cells expressing <italic>ap</italic> are often located close to the trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nienhaus et al., 2012</xref>). Remarkably, both Hth and Grn are also expressed in the ventral hinge, which implies that either these factors are not sufficient to activate <italic>ap</italic> expression or that their activity is actively repressed in this territory. Along these lines, the TF Optomotor-blind (Omb) has recently been proposed to repress <italic>ap</italic> expression in the distal wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Working model for OR463 regulatory inputs.</title>
<p>During late embryonic or early larval stages, the HOX input in m3, possibly Antp, would be responsible of OR463 activation. During this early phase the enhancer is not yet functional and the HOX could be priming the enhancer, permitting the later action of the other factors. Grain would participate in this process but its requirement is less critical than that of the HOX. Pnt and Hth would then, during L2 larval stage, activate apE first in the proximal area of the wing disc. Grn could also play a role in this early activity, confining the activity of <italic>ap</italic> to the dorsal hinge.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Loss of EGFR signaling has also been associated with mirror image duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baonza et al., 2000</xref>). However, the mechanism proposed was that EGFR maintains <italic>en</italic> expression in P cells. Interestingly, many of the duplications reported in this study mimicked those presented here (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Given the fact that EGFR pathway activates apE (Bieli, Kanca, Requena, et al., 2015) and that the deletion of Pnt binding sites within apE also result in mirror image duplications (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), we propose that the previously identified phenotypes arise due to apE miss regulation and not due to loss of <italic>en</italic> maintenance. To confirm whether this is the case, the lineage of <italic>en-</italic>expressing cells should be analyzed upon EGFR loss.</p>
<p>Downregulation of JAK-STAT signaling has also been shown to produce mirror image duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Recasens-Alvarez et al., 2017</xref>). The OR463 phenotypes described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> also mimic those of JAK-STAT defects. <italic>ap</italic> is fundamental for the development of the hinge, where Upd-1, the ligand of the JAK-STAT pathway, is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Johnstone et al., 2013</xref>), the ligand of the JAK-STAT pathway. Hence, it is possible that <italic>ap</italic> expression indirectly disrupts JAK-STAT signaling by interrupting the production of its ligand. Alternatively, JAK-STAT mirror image duplications could arise from the direct regulation of apE. Interestingly, some STAT92E binding sites are predicted in N1 and N2 (data not shown). It is also possible that direct apE regulation via JAK_STAT signaling could result in duplications.</p>

<title>A HOX-GATA complex involved in wing development</title>
<p>The genetic control of wing specification is well studied and many of the factors involved have being characterized. With the exception of the JAK-STAT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Recasens-Alvarez et al., 2017</xref>), most of the factors required for wing specification were identified more than two decades ago. Here, our bottom-up approach permitted us to describe the requirement of two additional factors for the development of the wing imaginal disc. Our data suggests that the GATA TF Grn is fundamental for wing development. <italic>grn</italic> was originally described as a gene involved in epithelial morphogenesis in the embryo and the legs. Here, we report that loss of <italic>grn</italic> also causes extreme phenotypes in the wing disc (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, we found that <italic>grn</italic> is not only important for activation of <italic>ap</italic>, but also for the growth and survival of the whole tissue. P compartments lacking <italic>grn</italic> were of very small size or totally lacking (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). However, their elimination occurred over a long period, during which the mutant cells were still able to instruct patterning and growth to their surroundings. Previously, mutant clones of <italic>grn</italic> covering the wing blade were reported not to produce any developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brown &amp; Castelli-Gair Hombria, 2000</xref>). This apparent difference between results is likely to emerge from the different approaches used to eliminate <italic>grn</italic> function. While the previous study performed a clonal analysis using the minute technique, here we knocked down <italic>grn</italic> using RNAi or knocked it out using a tissue-specific CRISPR. These approaches resulted in a homogeneous loss of <italic>grn</italic> function in all posterior cells already in early embryonic stages, which is not the case for Minute clones. It is likely that this temporal difference is the main reason for these discrepancies, as we have also observed that <italic>grn</italic> clones generated late in development do not affect <italic>ap</italic> expression (data not shown), suggesting that Grn is only be required during very early stages of wing development.</p>
<p>Most point mutations or short deletions in enhancer regions have little effect on gene expression. This robustness emerges, in part, from the collective action of TFs, whose binding sites are often clustered in groups. In addition, the deletion of enhancers which were thought to have central roles in development has often been found to have minor phenotypes due to existence of redundant sequences located in the vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lopez-Rivera et al., 2020</xref>). Even in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, examples of mutant phenotypes derived from point mutations in enhancers are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shimell et al., 1994</xref>). In this study, we have identified an area of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome with exceptional sensitivity to mutation. In particular, four of our two-base-pair substitutions within the HOX binding site of m3 could give rise to total loss of wings. In this study we propose that Antp is the HOX TF that binds m3. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrated that early loss of <italic>Antp</italic> in the embryonic wing primordium results in defects in <italic>ap</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>’), in severe cases leading to a total loss of Ap (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>’’). Until recently, the second thoracic segment was assumed to develop independently from any HOX input. However, several groups have now reported that this segment, from which the wing is derived, requires the input of the HOX gene <italic>Antennapedia</italic> (<italic>Antp</italic>) for its development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Paul et al., 2021</xref>). These studies uncover a role of Antp during larval wing morphogenesis and wing margin formation. Given the severity of the phenotypes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C’’, E</xref>), our experiments, describe a much earlier role of this gene, most likely during wing disc specification. While we demonstrate the requirement of Antp for <italic>ap</italic> expression, whether this effect is direct and occurs through m3 binding site still lacks biochemical evidence. Hox TFs have been proposed to function as pioneer TF in some contexts, changing the enhancer’s chromatin accessibility and enabling the binding of other TFs to the enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bulajić et al., 2020</xref>). Such pioneer Antp activity could explain the severity of the mutations in apE. However, biochemical characterization of the locus in early wing imaginal discs precursor cells would be required to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The current working model for the functioning of OR463 includes two steps. First, Grn and a HOX TF, possibly Antp, would act on the enhancer, permitting its later activity. Then, during L1 and L2 stages, Pnt and Hth, probably together with other TFs, would confer the spatial clues that result in the early Ap activity. The mechanism of action of each factor in the enhancer still remain to be investigated.</p>

<title>New method to manipulate enhancers</title>
<p>In the past decades, the functional analysis of enhancers depended on the generation and analysis of lesions in the respective DNA fragment. These mutants where often studied with reporter transgenes, in which the mutated enhancer was fused to a minimal promoter driving the expression of a reporter gene (LacZ, GFP, etc.). Such analyses provided an idea of the spatio-temporal changes in enhancer function when the enhancer was mutated. Minimal reporter fusions have been fundamental to characterize enhancers; however, follow up studies of such mutation analyses using endogenous gene editing often demonstrates minor effect for many mutations when analyzed in their endogenous genetic environment. Moreover, this approach does not permit to manipulate and characterize the requirement of a particular binding site in time and space. In recent years, the advance of techniques based on catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) has opened the door for the precise somatic disruption of enhancers. Enhancer repression has been mainly accomplished by dCas9-mediated recruitment of epigenetic repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). However, the precision of this approach is hard to measure and depends on the repressive element to which dCas9 is fused. dCas9 binding to specific sites has also been shown to be sufficient to disrupt TF-DNA binding in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shariati et al., 2019</xref>), opening the door to a more precise manipulation of selected DNA regions or sites. Here, we adapted the latter approach for its use in <italic>in vivo</italic> settings. We demonstrate that the sole expression of dCas9 together with gRNAs binding OR463 is sufficient to mimic the phenotypes caused by endogenous enhancer mutants. Moreover, the localized expression of dCas9 permitted us to show that the mirror image duplications arise due to the early defects in the activity of the enhancer in the P compartment.</p>
<p>This approach has broad applicability and might be useful to investigate the importance of regulatory sequences across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. The ease by which gRNA expressing stocks are generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Port &amp; Bullock, 2016</xref>) and the possibility to encode many gRNAs in a single transcript will further simplifies the functional characterization of enhancer regions.</p>

<title>Generation of OR463 landing site</title>
<p>Easy genetic screening of successful CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR-genome editing events is possible if an appropriate dominant selectable marker is available. Towards that end, we have adapted a feature of the dominant <italic>apterous</italic> allele <italic>ap<sup>Xasta</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">D. Bieli et al., 2015</xref>a). This allele is caused by a reciprocal translocation between the chromosome arms 2R and 3R that brings together the <italic>ap</italic> regulatory region and the <italic>dad</italic> (<italic>daughters against dpp</italic>) locus. <italic>dad</italic> is expressed in the wing disc in response to <italic>dpp</italic> signalling (Weiss et al., 2009). Due to the translocation, the wing-specific <italic>dad</italic> enhancers DadInt52 and Dad4 are located close to the <italic>ap</italic> promoter. This leads to ectopic <italic>ap</italic> expression in the ventral wing disc compartment that elicits the typical <italic>Xasta</italic> wing phenotype. Heterozygous flies show a dominant phenotype where the distal part of the wing is lost and a mitten shaped wing is formed. We have shown that when engineered into the <italic>ap</italic> locus, <italic>dad</italic> enhancers DadInt52 and Dad4 are sufficient to induce the dominant Xa-phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bieli et al., 2015</xref>a). Based on these observations, it was decided to clone a sub-fragment of Dad4, Dad13, into the donor plasmid used for CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination (HDR). Dad13 is only 517 bp long and has been shown to contain all necessary sequences for <italic>dpp</italic>-dependent activation (Weiss et al., 2009). Consequently, it was expected that introduction of the Dad13 fragment into the <italic>apterous</italic> locus would induce a dominant wing phenotype. Thus, flies displaying this phenotype could be expected to contain successful homologous recombination events.</p>
<p>To generate the donor plasmid used as a template for HDR repair, a fragment containing the homology arms (each 536 bp long), an attP site (55 bp), two FRTs (34 bp each) flanking restriction sites AvrII and EcoRI and gRNA targets for linearization, was synthesized by Genewiz and cloned into pUC57-Kan. This plasmid is named pDB350. Subsequently, the 517 bp Dad13 enhancer was amplified from plasmid pDB45 using the primers 5’-CCCC<underline>CCTAGG</underline>CCTCAACCTTAAATTGTTG-3’ and 5’-CCCC<underline>GAATTC</underline>CGAACGGGAGAGCGCCGC-3’ and cloned by restriction ligation into the aforementioned plasmid using the sites AvrII and EcoRI (underlined). The final donor plasmid is called pMS358. In addition, two plasmids encoding gRNAs targeting OR463 were generated (pA359 and pA360). The following primers were annealed and cloned into pU6-BbsI-chiRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gratz et al., 2013</xref>) that was digested with BbsI: 5’-CTTCGCAGGCTCTGCCGAAGGTTCA-3’ together with 5’-AAACTGAACCTTCGGCAGAGCCTGC-3’ and 5’-CTTCGTCAGAACGGTCAGCTACCTG-3’ together with 5’-AAACCAGGTAGCTGACCGTTCTGAC-3’. gRNA targets were identified using CHOPCHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Labun et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>After injection of the three plasmids into <italic>y w vas-Cas9; +</italic> embryos, surviving adults were individually crossed with <italic>y w</italic> flies. From these, 67 fertile F1 crosses could be screened for flies with wing defects. Successful HDR events could be isolated from four of the 67 G0 crosses (6%): c25, c77, c94 and c102. Alignment of the sequencing data with the <italic>in silico</italic> designed genomic sequence showed that candidates from all four crosses contained the expected changes down to the last base pair: the attP-FRT-Dad13 enhancer-FRT fragment is inserted in place of the 463 bp OR463 enhancer fragment. The sequence immediately flanking the inserted cassette (indicated by -[]-) is: CCCCTCGAATCGATTCAAAT-[]-TATAATTTGACCGCAATTTT. On the distal side, the break coincides with the <italic>ap<sup>Xa</sup></italic> break point.</p>
<p>As a result of the insertion of the Dad13 enhancer, it was expected that successful HDR-events would show an easy to spot phenotype similar to that in <italic>ap</italic><sup>Xasta</sup>/+ flies. This was the case for some candidates isolated from cross c94. Although the phenotype is somewhat less pronounced, the tip of all wings always shows an obvious indentation (Supplementary Figure 3A’). The dominant phenotype is much more subtle and less penetrant in other c94/+ candidate wings (Supplementary Figure 3A’). In these and in candidates from the other three crosses, only a tiny spike of wing tissue emerges near the tip from the ventral side of the wing. We have previously observed a very similar phenotype in dpp-Gal4&gt;UAS-dad flies (Bieli, Kanca, Gohl, et al., 2015). We have no explanation why insertion of the Dad13 enhancer gives rise to these different wing phenotypes.</p>
<p>From several of the candidates, the Dad13 enhancer was removed by Flp treatment. In all cases, homozygous ΔDad13 derivatives were viable and fertile. Importantly, they also had no wings and halters, indicating that the designed deletion is a perfect starting point for our <italic>in-situ</italic> analysis of the apE wing enhancer. HDR-event c94.19 was chosen as landing site for mutated OR463 fragments and a <italic>y w vas-integrase; c94.19<sup>ΔDad13</sup>/CyO</italic> stock was established. In this study, this landing site is referred to as <italic>ap<sup>R2</sup></italic>.</p>

<title>Generation of OR463 rescue fragments</title>
<p>Most of the small deletions were engineered according to the method described by(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pérez-Pinera et al., 2006</xref>). A pBlueScript plasmid containing OR463 (pDB51) served as a template for the creation of these deletions. All primers used for this purpose are listed in Supplementary Table 2. OR463 fragments containing more than one deletion (<italic>Δm1m4</italic> and <italic>Δm1m2m4</italic>) were generated step by step. At the end, all mutated OR463 fragments were amplified using the primers: 5’-TC<underline>AAGCTT</underline>TCCAGCTCTGAATCTCACTCCC-3’ and 5’-GT<underline>ACTAGT</underline>GGAGGCCAGCTCTAAAATCG-3’. Subsequently, amplified fragments were cloned into the re-entry plasmid pDB345 using the restriction sites HindIII and SpeI (underlined). All plasmids destined for transgenesis were verified by Sanger sequencing. Several OR463 derivatives including the m3.1 substitution library were synthesized and cloned by Genewiz (see Supplementary Table 1).</p>
<p>One of the deletions was obtained as a NHEJ-byproduct when generating the <italic>ap<sup>R2</sup></italic> landing site. It is <italic>ap<sup>N5</sup></italic> (isolation number c102.1). It contains a 19 bp deletion created at the site of the distal gRNA cutting site. The sequence flanking the deletion (indicated by -[]-) is as follows: TTTCGTGTGATTTCGGGACC-[]-GTTCTGATCTCGGCTACAAA. Note that this allele is not associated with flanking attL and FRT sites.</p>
<p>Re-entry plasmid pDB345 consists of the following parts. The backbone is pUC57-KanR. In contains an attB site (54 bp) and a 35 bp polylinker consisting of the following unique restriction sites: HindIII_PacI_NheI_XhoI_MluI_SpeI. A 48 bp extended FRT site precedes <italic>mini-yellow</italic>, which serves as selectable marker. It is a 2650 bp KpnI/ClaI fragment mainly consisting of a yellow cDNA devoid of all known <italic>yellow</italic> enhancers. When inserted in the <italic>apterous</italic> locus, <italic>mini-yellow</italic> is expressed mainly in the wings of transgenic flies. However, its presence interferes with apterous function. In hemizygous <italic>ap<sup>R2-WT[y+]</sup>/ap<sup>DG3</sup></italic>flies, 94% of the wings showed a phenotype, which was usually restricted to the posterior wing compartment. Frequently, an enlargement of the posterior compartment could be observed (see Supplementary figure 3C’). This phenotype is reminiscent of <italic>ap<sup>blot</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Whittle, 1979</xref>)This allele carries a <italic>blood</italic> retrotransposon 140 bp proximal to the distal end of OR463 (Bieli, Kanca, Gohl, et al., 2015). It is conceivable that the presence of <italic>blood</italic> or the <italic>mini-yellow</italic> marker (including the pDB345 backbone) within 55 bp or 195 bp, respectively, of the crucial m3 region is responsible for the phenotypic effect. Thus, the <italic>mini-yellow</italic> marker was removed by Flp-treatment from all <italic>ap<sup>R2</sup></italic> transgenic inserts presented in this study. At the end of this procedure, the foreign DNA flanking OR463 fragments are the 56 bp attL on the proximal and the 34 bp FRT on the distal side. Importantly, removal of the foreign DNA led to a dramatic increase in hemizygous <italic>ap<sup>R2-WT</sup>/ap<sup>DG3</sup></italic> flies with normal wings. Most homozygous <italic>ap<sup>R2-WT</sup></italic> flies developed normal wings. Few of them can have weak phenotypes like small notches and other weak margin defects or blisters (see arrow in supplementary Figure 3D’). In hemizygous <italic>ap<sup>R2-WT</sup></italic>/<italic>ap<sup>DG3</sup></italic> flies, 95% wings are normal. The remaining wings can also show the enlarged posterior compartment phenotype seen in hemizygous <italic>ap<sup>R2-</sup> <sup>WT(y+)</sup></italic> flies. It is possible that the remaining attL and FRT sites impede with complete rescue of the wing phenotype. Nevertheless, wing phenotypes of <italic>ap<sup>R2</sup></italic>and <italic>ap<sup>R2-WT</sup></italic> warrant a faithful dissection of the OR463 enhancer.</p>
<p>From a practical point of few, it might be of interest with what efficiency all the m3.1 substitution library transgenes were obtained. The library contains 22 different plasmids (1 wild-type and 21 mutants; synthesis and cloning by Genewiz)). After injection of the plasmid mix into <italic>y w vas-integrase; ap<sup>R2</sup>/CyO</italic> embryos, survivors were reared to adulthood and individually crossed with y w partners. From 34/141 fertile G0 crosses, 248 y<sup>+</sup> transformants were selected. These were individually crossed with <italic>y w ; ap<sup>DG3</sup>/CyO, Dfd-YFP</italic> partners. After a few days, the y<sup>+</sup> candidates were sacrificed and screened by PCR and sequencing. PCR primers were A185 (5’-CACCTGACTCAATAGCAAGACT-3’) and m2 (5’-CAGTGTTCGGGTAATCAGGTG-3’). The resulting 1227 bp product was sequenced with primer P41 (5’-CTAATGCAATCGACAAACCCC-3’). After screening 104 randomly chosen candidates, all 22 possible alleles were represented by at least one candidate.</p>

Only the cubic cells of the peripodial membrane seem to express <italic>grn</italic>. Arrowheads indicate the intersection between trachea and the disc proper. Scalebars: 50μm</p>
<p><bold>Supplementary figure 11. <italic>Antp</italic> is required for clone survival in early stages and does not affect <italic>ap</italic> expression at later stages. A.</bold> Example of wing disc in which <italic>Antp</italic> MARCM clones were generated during embryonic stages (0-24h) (See materials and methods for full genotype). In this case, many clones could be retrieved in other tissues (data not shown), but never in the disc proper of the wing disc. Clones, marked by the presence of GFP, could only be retrieved in the peripodial membrane (detail of the peripodial membrane in the right panel). In magenta, anti-Ap immunostaining reveals normal Ap pattern (left panel). <bold>B.</bold> Example of a wing disc of the same genotype as in A in which the clones were generated at 48h in development. In this case, small <italic>Antp</italic> clones (GFP positive) could be detected in the disc proper. Anti-Ap immunostaining revealed no change in the levels inside the clone (arrowheads).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The Drosophila wing disc is an epithelial tissue, the study of which has provided many insights into the genetic regulation of organ patterning and growth. One fundamental aspect of wing development is the positioning of the wing primordia, which occurs at the confluence of two developmental boundaries, the anterior-posterior and the dorsal-ventral. The dorsal-ventral boundary is determined by the domain of expression of the gene apterous, which is set early in the development of the wing disc. For this reason, the regulation of apterous expression is a fundamental aspect of wing formation.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors used state-of-the-art genomic engineering and a bottom-up approach to analyze the contribution of a 463 base pair fragment of apterous regulatory DNA. They find compelling evidence about the inner structure of this regulatory DNA and the upstream transcription factors that likely bind to this DNA to regulate apterous early expression in the Drosophila wing disc.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This manuscript has several strengths concerning both the experimental techniques used to address the problem of gene regulation and the relevance of the subject. To identify the mode of operation of the 463 bp enhancer, the authors use a balanced combination of different experimental approaches. First, they use bioinformatic analysis (sequence conservation and identification of transcription factors binding sites) to identify individual modules within the 463 bp enhancer. Second, they identify the functional modules through genetic analysis by generating Drosophila strains with individual deletions. Each deletion is characterized by looking at the resulting adult phenotype and also by monitoring apterous expression in the mutant wing discs. They then use a clever method to interfere in a more dynamic manner with the function of the enhancer, by directing the expression of catalytically inactive Cas9 to specific regions of this DNA. Finally, they recur to a more classical genetic approach to uncover the relevance of candidate transcription factors, some of them previously known and others suggested by the bioinformatic analysis of the 463 bp sequence. This workflow is clearly reflected in the manuscript, and constitutes a great example of how to proceed experimentally in the analysis of regulatory DNA.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are several caveats with the data that might be constructed as weaknesses, some of them are intrinsic to this detailed analysis or to the experimental difficulties of dealing with the wing disc in its earliest stages, and others are more conceptual and are offered here in case the authors may wish to consider them.</p>
<p>1. The primordium of the wing region of the wing imaginal disc is defined by the expression of the gen vestigial, which is regulated by inputs coming from the dorsal-ventral boundary (Notch and wg) and from the anterior-posterior boundary (Dpp). Having such a principal role in wing primordium specification and expansion, I am surprised that this manuscript does not mention this gene in the main text and only contains indirect references to it. I consider that the manuscript would have benefited a lot by including vestigial in the analysis, at least as a marker of early wing primordium. This might allow us to visualize directly the positioning of the primordium in the apterous mutants generated in this study, adding more verisimilitude to the interpretations that place this domain based on indirect evidence.</p>
<p>2. The authors place some emphasis on the idea that their work addresses possible coordination between setting the D/V boundary and the A/P boundary:</p>
<p>Abstract: &quot;Thus, the correct establishment of ap expression pattern with respect to en must be tightly controlled&quot;, &quot;...challenging the mechanism by which apE miss-regulation leads to AP defects.&quot; &quot;Detailed mutational analyses using CRISPR/Cas revealed a role of apE in positioning the DV boundary with respect to the AP boundary&quot;</p>
<p>
Introduction: &quot;However, little is known about how the expression pattern of ap is set up with respect that of en. In other words, how is the DV boundary positioned with respect to the AP boundary?&quot;</p>
<p>
&quot;How such interaction between ap and the AP specification program arises is unknown.&quot;</p>
<p>
Results: &quot;Some of these phenotypes are reminiscent of those reported for apBlot (Whittle, 1979) and point towards a yet undescribed crosstalk between ap early expression and the AP specification program.&quot;</p>
<p>At the same time, they express the notion, with which this reviewer agrees, that all defects observed in A/P patterning arising as a result of apterous miss-regulation are due to the fact that in their mutants, apterous expression is lost mainly in the posterior dorsal compartment, bringing novel confrontations between the A/P and the D/V boundaries.</p>
<p>To me, the key point is why the expression of apterous in different mutants of the OR463 enhancer affects only the posterior compartment. This should be discussed because it is far from obvious that apterous expression has different regulatory requirements in the anterior and posterior compartments.</p>
<p>1. The description of gene expression in the wing disc of novel apterous mutants is only carried out in late third instar discs (Figs. 2, 3, 5, and 7). This is understandable given the technical difficulties of dealing with early discs, as those shown in the analysis of candidate apterous regulatory transcription factors (Fig. 4F, Fig. 6 C-D). However, because the effects of the mutants on apterous expression are expected to occur much earlier than the time of expression analysis, this fact should be discussed.</p>

<p>In their manuscript, &quot;Transcriptional control of compartmental boundary positioning during Drosophila wing development,&quot; Aguilar and colleagues do an exceptional job of exploring how tissue axes are established across Drosophila development. The authors perform a series of functional perturbations using mutational analyses at the native locus of apterous (ap), and perform tissue-specific enhancer disruption via dCas9 expression. This innovative approach allowed them to explore the spatio-temporal requirements of an apterous enhancer. Combining these techniques allowed the authors to explore the molecular basis of apterous expression, connecting the genotypes to the phenotypical effects of enhancer perturbations. To me, this paper was a beautiful example of what can be done using modern drosophila genetics to understand classic questions in developmental biology and transcriptional regulation.</p>
<p>In sum, this was a rigorous paper bridging scales from the molecular to phenotypes, with new insight into how enhancers control compartmental boundary positioning during Drosophila wing development.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, authors use the Drosophila wing as a model system and combine state-of-the-art genetic engineering to identify and validate the molecular players mediating the activity of one of the cis-regulatory enhancers of the apterous gene involved in the regulation of its expression domain in the dorsal compartment of the wing primordium during larval development.</p>
<p>(1) The authors raise two very important questions in the Introduction: (1) who is locating the relative position of the AP and DV boundaries in the developing wing, and (2) who is responsible for the maintenance of the apterous expression domain late in larval development. None of these two questions have been responded to and, indeed, the summary of the work (as stated in the conclusions of the last paragraph of the Introduction) does not resolve any of these questions.</p>
<p>(2) The authors have identified two different regions whose deletions give very interesting phenotypes in the adult wing (AP identify change &amp; outgrowths, and loss of wing), and have bioinformatically identified and functionally verified 4 TFs that mediate the activity of these regions by their capacity to phenocopy the wing phenotype. While identification of the 2 TFs acting on the m1 is incremental with respect to previous work on the identification of the enhancer responsible for the early expression of Ap, identification of Antp and Grn does not explain the loss of function phenotype of the m3 enhancer. Does any of these results shed any light on the first two Qs? Do these results explain the compartment boundary position in the wing as stated in the title? Expression of lacZ reporter assays is fundamental to demonstrate their model of Figure 8. The reduction of the PD compartment is difficult to understand by the sole reduction in ap expression in this region (which has not been demonstrated).</p>
<p>(3) The authors state in one of the sections &quot;Spatio-temporal analysis of apE via dCas9 &quot;. No temporal manipulation of gene activity is shown. The authors should combine GAL4/UAs with the Gal80ts to demonstrate the temporal requirements of Antp/Grn and Pnt/Hth as depicted in their model of Figure 8.</p>
<p>(4) The authors have not managed to explain the AP phenotype. Thus, this work opens many unresolved questions and does not resolve the title, which is a big overstatement. Thus, strengths (technically excellent), weakness (there is not much to learn about wing development and apterous regulation from these results besides the incremental identification of 4 additional TFs mediating the regulation of ap expression by their ability to phenocopy regulatory mutations of the apterous gene).</p>
