<title>Abstract</title><p>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) stands at the intersection of pyruvate metabolism. While it is believed that inhibition of LDH redirects pyruvate to mitochondrial metabolism, suppressing glycolysis and boosting oxidative phosphorylation, the mechanism remains largely unexplored. We found that individual LDH A or B knockouts had minimal impact on glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAC), or oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). However, combining LDH knockout with LDH inhibitor GNE-140 significantly suppressed these processes. Inhibition of LDH led to an increase in free NADH concentration and a decrease in free NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration, the reduced free NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration inhibited GAPDH, disrupting the balance of glycolytic intermediates, which were linked with thermodynamic shift of the Gibbs free energy of reactions between phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) and phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) in the glycolytic pathway, favoring their reverse direction. This disrupted glycolysis led to impaired TCAC and mitochondrial respiration due to reduced pyruvate and glutamine carbon influx into TCAC. Under hypoxia, LDH inhibition had a stronger effect, inducing energy crisis, redox imbalance, and cancer cell death. Our study reveals LDH’s intricate control over glycolysis, TCAC, and mitochondrial respiration, highlighting the interplay of enzyme kinetics and thermodynamics in metabolic pathways—a crucial aspect for understanding metabolic regulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A prominent metabolic feature of most cancer cells is Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis, characterized by high glycolytic rates accompanied with excessive production of lactate even with ample oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Liberti &amp; Locasale, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Vander Heiden, Cantley, &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Warburg, 1956</xref>). LDH catalyzes the final step of the glycolytic pathway, converting NADH (generated at the step of GAPDH) and pyruvate (generated at the step of pyruvate kinase step) into lactate and NAD<sup>+</sup>. In cancer cells, the actual change in the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the LDH-catalyzed reaction ranges between -3 to -7 kJ/mol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jin, Zhu, Wu, Wang, &amp; Hu, 2020</xref>; X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhu, Jin, Pan, &amp; Hu, 2021</xref>), favoring lactate accumulation. Consistently, lactic acidosis (high lactate concentration and acidic pH) is common in the microenvironment of most solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dantas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gatenby &amp; Gillies, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Peppicelli, Bianchini, &amp; Calorini, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Perez-Tomas &amp; Perez-Guillen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Raghunand, Gatenby, &amp; Gillies, 2003</xref>). Lactic acidosis plays multiple roles in tumor progression, including but not limited to immune suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Choi, Collins, Gout, &amp; Wang, 2013</xref>), promotion of angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fukumura et al., 2001</xref>), enhancement of metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Walenta et al., 2000</xref>), regulation of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Clinically, lactic acidosis and high LDH expression are associated with poor prognosis of cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Augoff, Hryniewicz-Jankowska, &amp; Tabola, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">McCleland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Petrelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Walenta et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, inhibiting LDH is a potential way to treat cancer and numerous LDH inhibitors have been developed for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boudreau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Le et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Maftouh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Manerba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rai et al., 2017</xref>; Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhao, Han, Yang, Wu, &amp; Zhan, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>LDH is located at a critical point in pyruvate metabolism, where it regulates pyruvate flow to lactate and to mitochondrial respiration. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of LDH leads to suppression of glycolysis while enhancement of mitochondrial respiration in cancer cells, and it is believed that inhibition of LDH directs pyruvate towards mitochondrial metabolism. Fantin et al. demonstrated that knockdown of LDH-A using short hairpin RNAs reduced LDH activity, decreased lactate production, and stimulated mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fantin, St-Pierre, &amp; Leder, 2006</xref>). Le et al. reported that inhibition of LDH-A activity by siRNA knockdown and LDH inhibitor FX-11 were accompanied by enhanced mitochondrial oxygen consumption and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Le et al., 2010</xref>). LDH inhibition-induced oxidative stress further led to cancer cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Le et al., 2010</xref>). Zdralevic et al. showed that genetic disruption of both LDHA and LDHB or inhibition of LDH by GNE-140, a potent LDH inhibitor, shifted cancer cells from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zdralevic et al., 2018</xref>). These studies suggest that LDH acts as a critical regulator balancing ATP production between glycolysis and OXPHOS: when LDH activity is high, pyruvate generated from glycolysis is mainly converted to lactate, resulting in low mitochondrial respiration; when LDH activity is low, pyruvate generated from glycolysis is directed towards mitochondrial metabolism, increasing mitochondrial respiration.</p>
<p>Despite the progress made in understanding the potential role of LDH as described above, there exists an unresolved critical issue: the exact biochemical mechanism behind how it affects glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration isn’t fully understood. If LDH is inhibited at the LDH step, as suggested in previous reports, this could explain enhanced mitochondrial respiration by directing pyruvate towards mitochondrial metabolism. However, this explanation conflicts with other facts. Notably, the glycolytic rate is far higher than the mitochondrial respiration rate (2). According to the glycolytic rate and OXPHOS rate in different cancer cells (27), we estimate that the ratios of glycolytic rate over oxidative phosphorylation rate are 10.53 to 47.11. Thus, mitochondria can only consume a minor fraction of pyruvate generated from glycolysis, this cannot explain the markedly reduced lactate generation rate. Moreover, the activity of LDH in cancer cells is far higher than that of hexokinase (HK), the first rate-limiting enzyme in the glycolytic pathway (4, 5, 28). According to calculation of our published works (4, 5, 28), even if LDH activity is inhibited by 90%, the remaining LDH activity is still significantly higher than that of HK and would be sufficient to convert pyruvate generated from glycolysis to lactate. Therefore, inhibition at the LDH step may not account for the significant decrease in overall lactate production. We previously reported that glycolysis rate was regulated by both enzyme kinetics and chemical thermodynamics within the glycolytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jin et al., 2020</xref>; X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). Based on the above reasoning, we propose the following hypothesis: upon LDH inhibition, via not yet deciphered mechanisms involving enzyme kinetics and chemical thermodynamics in the glycolytic pathway, the rate at the upstream segment of the glycolytic pathway is suppressed, leading to reduced rates of glycolysis. Moreover, with the overall rate of pyruvate production reduced and the remaining LDH activity sufficient to convert pyruvate to lactate, there would be a decrease in pyruvate flux to mitochondrial respiration, leading to a suppression of mitochondrial respiration. If this hypothesis holds true, it would provide a more complete understanding of how LDH inhibition impacts cancer cell metabolism and could provide new clues for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>The effect of LDHA or LDHB knockout on glycolysis</title>
<p>The first question to address is if LDHA or LDHB knockout would significantly affect the glycolytic rate. We determined the relationship between LDH activity and glycolysis rate in HeLa-LDHAKO (LDHA knockout), HeLa-LDHBKO (LDHB knockout), and HeLa-Ctrl cells. The relative LDH activities of HeLa-LDHAKO and HeLa-LDHBKO cells were about 30% and 70% of the control, indicating LDHA and LDHB accounted for about 70% and 30% of the total LDH activity, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1A</xref>). Despite significant differences in LDH activity, the glucose consumption rate and lactate production rate were comparable between 3 groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1B</xref>). We repeated the above experiments using the mouse breast cancer cell 4T1 model and obtained similar results, i.e., knockout of LDHA or LDHB did not significantly affect glucose consumption and lactate production (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A &amp; B</xref>). The reason may be that the activity of LDH in HeLa cells is very high, which is 81(HeLa-LDHAKO) -297 (HeLa-Ctrl) times higher than that of the first rate-limiting enzyme HK in the glycolytic pathway (Table supplement 1). This enzyme activity ratio is common in other tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jin et al., 2020</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Xie, Dai, &amp; Hu, 2016</xref>; X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<p>The above results demonstrated that neither LDHAKO nor LDHBKO significantly affected glucose conversion to lactate in HeLa cells, and the results were different from previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arseneault et al., 2013</xref>; Q. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen, Liu, Kang, Gnanaprakasam, &amp; Wang, 2023</xref>; H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xie et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to glycolytic rate, we sought to investigate the effect of LDHAKO or LDHBKO on the glycolytic pathway in the following four aspects:</p>
<p>We used [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glc to trace glucose conversion to pyruvate and lactate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). This approach could rule out interference from lactate production by other metabolic pathways, e.g., glutaminolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">DeBerardinis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Perez-Escuredo et al., 2016</xref>). The results showed that the isotopologues percentages of pyruvate and lactate were comparable between 3 groups, both in culture medium and in cells (despite being statistically significant, the difference in terms of m3 isotopologues% of pyruvate in medium was very small, 1.81%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The isotope tracing results in line with the quantification of lactate confirmed that glucose conversion to pyruvate and lactate through glycolysis was not significantly affected.</p>
<p>We traced glucose carbon to subsidiary branches of glycolysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Pyruvate can be converted to alanine through alanine aminotransferase. The isotopologues of alanine (m0 and m3) were similar between 3 groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that the inhibition of LDH did not significantly affect the proportion of glucose-derived pyruvate converting to alanine. We traced [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glc-derived serine, which was produced from 3PG, a glycolytic intermediate. The m0 serine species was provided by the culture medium, and the m3 serine isotopologue was generated from [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glc through 3PG via serine synthesis pathway. Serine can be converted to glycine by serine hydroxymethyl transferase. There were statistically significant yet moderately decreases of m3 serine% and m2 glycine% in HeLa-LDHAKO and HeLa-LDHBKO cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating LDHAKO or LDHBKO moderately reduced 3PG to serine synthesis pathway.</p>
<p>Then, we measured the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates in the three groups of cells. The concentrations of these intermediates did not change significantly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), neither the ΔGs of the reactions in the glycolytic pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), indicating that LDHAKO or LDHBKO did not significantly alter the thermodynamic state in the glycolytic pathway.</p>
<p>Because LDHAKO or LDHBKO markedly reduced the total LDH activity, in theory, it would lead to an increase in its substrate concentration. As pyruvate concentrations were comparable between 3 groups of cells, NADH concentration may increase significantly in HeLa-LDHAKO and HeLa-LDHBKO cells. NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH in cells exist in 2 forms, bound and free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Xiao, Wang, Handy, &amp; Loscalzo, 2018</xref>; X. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhu, Lu, Lee, Ugurbil, &amp; Chen, 2015</xref>). Although LDHAKO or LDHBKO exerted no significant effect on total concentrations of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), we speculated that there would be an effect on free NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH. We measured the intracellular free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup>, represented by the ratiometric fluorescent SoNar probe (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>), which showed an increase of free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). The increase of free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> was more significant in HeLa-LDHAKO cells, as expected. The results suggested that the loss of total LDH concentration was compensated by an increase of free NADH concentration, because the actual activity of LDH is determined by not only the concentration of LDH but also the concentrations of its substrates.</p>
<p>Similarly, LDHA or LDHB KO did not significantly affect the concentrations of intermediates in the glycolytic pathway in 4T1 cells (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, table supplement 2), nor did it significantly change ΔGs in the glycolytic pathway (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1— figure supplement 1D</xref>, table supplement 3), but it significantly affected free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, LDHAKO or LDHBKO did not significantly affect glycolysis, including glucose conversion to lactate, the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates, and the thermodynamic state of glycolytic pathway (the delta Gs of the reactions in the glycolytic pathway). However, LDHAKO or LDHBKO significantly increased the cytosolic free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> and significantly decreased glycolytic intermediates shuttling to serine synthesis pathway.</p>

<title>The effect of LHDAKO or LDHBKO on contribution of glucose carbon to TCAC and on mitochondrial respiration</title>
<p>Because LDHAKO or LDHBKO did not significantly affect the rate of glycolysis, nor it altered the proportion of pyruvate to lactate, we speculated they would not significantly affect glucose-derived pyruvate entering into TCAC. To confirm it, we used [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glc to trace glucose carbon entering into TCAC. The labeling percentage of the TCAC intermediates (citrate, α-KG, succinate, fumarate, malate) by glucose carbon, in general, were comparable between HeLa-Ctrl, HeLa-LDHAKO, and HeLa-LDHBKO (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). Further, we measured mitochondrial respiration of these cells, which showed no significant difference (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>). Similarly, another set of cells (4T1-Ctrl, 4T1-LDHAKO, and 4T1-LDHBKO) also showed similar level of mitochondrial respiration (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 — figure supplement 2</xref>). Collectively, genetic disruption of LDHA or LDHB did not or marginally significantly affect glucose-derived pyruvate entering into TCAC, neither significantly affect mitochondrial respiration, as opposed to the current point of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fantin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Le et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Oshima et al., 2020</xref>; H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xie et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>The effect of LDHBKO and GNE-140 on glycolysis - the kinetic and thermodynamic insight into the regulation of glycolysis by LDH</title>
<p>The above results demonstrated that LDHAKO or LDHBKO were insufficient to achieve a significant inhibition of the overall rate of glycolysis, suggesting that further LDH inhibition was required. We then used GNE-140, a potent pharmacological inhibitor of LDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boudreau et al., 2016</xref>). The Ki of GNE-140 on LDHA in HeLa-LDHBKO cell lysate and LDHB in HeLa-LDHAKO cell lysate were 0.88 and 9.58 μM, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> &amp; B), indicating that the inhibitory potency of GNE-140 toward LDHA was far greater than that toward LDHB. Consistently, GNE-140 inhibited glycolysis in HeLa-LDHBKO cells significantly stronger than HeLa-LDHAKO and HeLa-Ctrl (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). There was no significant difference between HeLa-LDHAKO and HeLa-Ctrl in response to GNE-140 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), and this was supported by the inhibition curve of GNE-140 on LDH activity, which was generated based on the Ki values of GNE-140 on LDHA and LDHB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). We checked the effects of GNE-140 on other glycolytic enzymes and found no significant inhibition nor activation of GNE-140 on other glycolytic enzymes, this excluded the inhibitory effect of GNE-140 on glycolysis via acting on other glycolytic enzymes (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Unlike the HeLa cell model, the Ki values of LDHA and LDHB to GNE-140 in 4T1 cells were comparable to each other (3.37 and 3.51 μM, respectively) (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 — figure supplement 2A &amp; B</xref>). Consistently, the inhibitory effect of GNE-140 on cellular glucose consumption and lactate production was solely associated with the total activity of LDH (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This lack of differential effect of GNE-140 on LDHA and LDHB resulted in a distinct inhibitory pattern induced by GNE-140 in the 4T1 model compared to the HeLa model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>The results in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref> demonstrated that LDHAKO or LDHBKO could affect free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> in cells to varying degrees, suggesting that free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> was inversely proportional to the total activity of LDH. Since LDHA was far more sensitive to GNE-140 than LDHB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-D</xref>), treatment of HeLa-LDHBKO cells (which only express LDHA) with GNE-140 could better reflect the relationship between free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> and total LDH activity. The results showed that there was indeed a positive relationship between GNE-140 concentrations and free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In line with the data in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, LDH-inhibition-induced rate decrease of glucose consumption and lactate generation were correlated with free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>We hypothesized that the pool of free NAD<sup>+</sup> and free NADH in cells was a constant, and hence an increase in free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> implied that the concentration of free NADH increased while the concentration of free NAD<sup>+</sup> decreased. The decrease of free NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration might inhibit the activity of GAPDH in the upstream of the glycolytic pathway. If so, we would observe that, with the increase in free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> or with the increase in GNE-140 concentration, the concentration of intermediates including GA3P, DHAP, and FBP upstream of GAPDH would increase accordingly. Indeed, the concentrations of GA3P, DHAP, and FBP increased with the increase of GNE-140 concentration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The results supported that LDH inhibition-induced rate decrease of glycolysis was at least partly mediated through the regulation of free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup>, which modulated the activity of GAPDH.</p>
<p>The significant changes in the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates (FBP, DHAP, GA3P, and 3PG) were accompanied with a significant change of the ΔGs of the reactions catalyzed by PFK1, aldolase, TPI, and PGAM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), i.e., the PFK1-catalyzed reaction became less exergonic, aldolase-catalyzed reaction switched from exergonic to endergonic, the reactions catalyzed by TPI and PGAM were more endergonic. In essence, the changes of these ΔGs indicated more favorable for the reverse direction of the reactions, thus contributing to rate decrease of glycolysis. Supporting this, Park et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Park et al., 2019</xref>) reported that the changes of the free energy in the glycolytic pathway, especially the reactions at the near-equilibrium state shifting to more exergonic direction, could significantly increase the rate of glycolysis, or conversely, the reactions at the near-equilibrium state shifting to more endogonic direction would significantly decrease the rate of glycolysis.</p>
<p>The above results suggested that the inhibition of glycolysis by GNE-140 converged in the segment between PFK1 and PGAM in the glycolytic pathway. To further confirm it, we used [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glc to trace serine synthesis through 3PG in the glycolytic pathway. If the decreased rate of glycolysis was mainly at the upstream of the pathway, the rate of 3PG production would decrease, so would the rate from 3PG to serine and glycine. The results showed that intracellular m0 serine% increases, while m3 serine% decreases with the increase of GNE-140 concentration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The change of m0 glycine% and m2 glycine% were the same as those of serine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, if LDH inhibition leads to glycolysis suppression at the LDH step, we would see a positive correlation between m3 pyruvate% and GNE-140 concentration, whereas m3 lactate% would decrease with the increasing concentration of GNE-140, as previous reported (H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yeung et al., 2019</xref>). In medium, m3-pyruvate% did not change significantly until GNE-140 concentration increased to 30 μM, where m3-lactate % did not change significantly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). In cells, m3-pyruvate% and m3-lactate% both decreased with the increase of GNE-140 concentration, but the magnitude of decrease was more pronounced in m3-lactate% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). However, as medium lactate constitutes the major part, the m3-lactate% in total lactate pool (medium lactate + cellular lactate) remained not significantly changed with or without GNE-140 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Glucose-derived pyruvate can also convert to alanine. Intracellular and extracellular m3 alanine% remained nearly constant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Taken together, the results indicated that</p>
<p>LDH inhibition did not markedly change the proportion of pyruvate flux to lactate nor alanine.</p>
<p>We also traced serine, glycine, pyruvate, lactate, and alanine in HeLa-Ctrl and HeLa-LDHAKO cells by using [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glc and obtained similar results (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, table supplement 4).</p>
<p>Altogether, the above results pointed to that GNE-140-mediated glycolytic suppression converged at the upstream segment of the glycolytic pathway between PFK1 and PGAM.</p>
<p>Under hypoxia, since oxygen is deprived, cells rely more on glycolysis for ATP production. Glycolytic rate increased significantly as compared with that under normoxia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), and, consistently, GNE-140 was more effective with respect to inhibition of glycolysis under hypoxia than under normoxia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). If GNE-140-mediated glycolytic suppression was through the free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup>, perturbation of GAPDH, and the Gibbs free energy of the reactions by the PFK1, aldolase, TPI, and PGAM, we should see a more significant change of these parameters. Unfortunately, we were not able to measure free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> under hypoxia due to the technical limitations, because we could not maintain the hypoxia level under the assay condition for observing free NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup>. We measured the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates. There was a large change of concentrations in FBP, DHAP and GA3P (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), more pronounced than that under normoxia condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that GAPDH was inhibited. With the increase of GNE-140 concentrations, the ΔG of the reaction catalyzed by PFK1 changed from -12.68 kJ/mol to -2.56 kJ/mole, indicating that the very exergonic reaction was approaching to a near equilibrium state (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The ΔGs of the reactions catalyzed by aldolase, TPI, and PGAM were changing to the more endergonic state, in response to increasing concentration of GNE-140 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>Collectively, the results offer mechanistic insights into how LDH regulates glycolysis, involving dynamic interactions between kinetics and thermodynamics. Inhibition of LDH triggers an increase in free NADH concentration while decreasing free NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration, consequently perturbing GAPDH. This perturbation of GAPDH further increases concentrations of GA3P, DHAP, FBP, and decreases the concentration of 3PG, which are linked to the thermodynamic state of reactions catalyzed by PFK1, aldolase, TPI, and PGAM, favoring the reverse direction of these reactions. These sequential events contribute to the inhibition of glycolysis.</p>

<title>The effect of LDHB KO and GNE-140 on the contribution of glucose carbon to TCAC and on OXPHOS</title>
<p>In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and corresponding text, we demonstrated the sensitivity of glycolysis in HeLa-LDHBKO cells to GNE-140. We observed that GNE-140 predominantly inhibited upper segment of the glycolytic pathway, leading to a decrease in overall pyruvate production. Additionally, the proportions of glucose-derived pyruvate converting to lactate remained similar regardless of GNE-140 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>), indicating comparable proportion of the glucose-derived pyruvate reaching the mitochondria regardless of GNE-140 treatment. These results suggested that inhibition of LDH would decrease rather than increase glucose-derived pyruvate to mitochondrial metabolism. To further investigate this, we used [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose to trace its carbon into TCAC. Surprisingly, the total <sup>13</sup>C labeling of the TCAC intermediates increased with higher concentrations of GNE-140 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-E</xref>). However, upon closer analysis, we reached an alternative interpretation of the data. When [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose -derived pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, it condenses with OAA to form citrate, generating the m2 isotopologue of citrate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Citrate is the first intermediate in the TCAC and can be used to measure the efficiency of glucose carbon into TCAC. m2 citrate % decreased with the increase of the concentration of GNE-140 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). As m2-citrate arose from the initial incorporation of the labeled pyruvate into the TCAC, a decrease in the percentage of m2-citrate indicated a decrease in the direct incorporation of glucose-derived acetyl-CoA into the TCAC. On the other hand, other citrate isotopologues% (m1, m3, m4, m5, and m6) increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). These isotopologues represented the progressive incorporation of labeled carbons from glucose-derived acetyl-CoA into the intermediates of the TCAC through repeated cycle, hence an increase in the percentages of these isotopologues indicated an increase in the cycling of TCAC intermediates or a decrease in the flux of intermediates leaving the TCAC. However, the percentage of m2 isotopologues of other TCAC intermediates (α-KG, succinate, fumarate, and malate) increased with the increased concentration of GNE-140 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H-K</xref>). Thus, the pattern of glucose carbon labeling of citrate was different from that of other TCAC intermediates.</p>

<p>To resolve the contradictory results, we traced [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine into TCAC. Glutamine is a major source for replenishing TCAC intermediates through two deamination reactions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L</xref>). When cells were incubated with GNE-140, the percentage of m5 α-KG decreased with increasing concentrations of GNE-140, while isotopologues% (m1, m2, m3, m4) significantly increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5M</xref> &amp; R). This decrease in m5 α-KG indicated reduced direct influx of labeled glutamine into the TCAC, while the increase in other α-KG isotopologues% suggested enhanced cycling of TCAC intermediates or reduced flux of intermediates leaving the TCAC. Moreover, m4 succinate, m4 fumarate, and m4 malate, directly derived from m5 α-KG, showed a significant decrease in cells incubated with GNE-140, while the percentage of other isotopologues (m1, m2, m3) remained unchanged (succinate and malate) or moderately decreased (fumarate) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5N-P, S-U</xref>). For citrate isotopologues, m4-citrate was directly from α-KG in the forward direction, while m5-citrate was likely generated through reductive carboxylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Corbet &amp; Feron, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Leonardi, Subramanian, Jackowski, &amp; Rock, 2012</xref>). In the presence of GNE-140, the percentages of m4-citrate and m5-citrate decreased significantly, while the percentage of other isotopologues (m1, m2, m3, and m6) remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Q</xref> &amp; V). Tracing glutamine carbon into TCAC supported that GNE-140 reduced both glutamine carbon entrance into TCAC and leaving TCAC.</p>
<p>Combining the tracing data of [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose and [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine, we could interpret why in [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose tracing, the m2 α-KG increased with the increased concentration of GNE-140. It was because glutamine-carbon entrance into TCAC decreased with the increased concentration of GNE-140, consequently, the percentage of m2 α-KG increased with the increased concentration of GNE-140. This interpretation could be extended to glucose carbon labeling pattern of other TCAC intermediates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-E</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, tracing glucose and glutamine carbon into TCAC supports that LDH inhibition causes reduced flux of glucose-derived acetyl CoA into TCAC, coupling with a reduced flux of glutamine-derived α-KG into TCAC, and a decrease in the flux of intermediates leaving TCAC. The results are compatible with theoretical prediction. Under any circumstance, the reactions by which TCAC intermediates distribute to other pathways and those by which they are replenished must be balanced. In GNE-140 group, glutamine carbon entering into TCAC was reduced, glucose carbon (acetyl CoA) entering into TCAC should be also reduced, or vice versa.</p>
<p>We then measured mitochondrial respiration in these cells. The mitochondrial oxygen consumption of HeLa-LDHBKO in the absence of GNE-140 was significantly higher than that in the presence of GNE-140 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5W</xref>). Notably, with GNE-140 treatment, the basal respiration, ATP associated oxygen consumption, and maximal respiration all decreased, indicating a reduced electron flux rate through ETC. Because mitochondrial respiration depends on the electron generated from TCAC, the reduced mitochondrial respiration also meant the reduced TCAC activity. By combining all the data of glucose tracing, glutamine tracing, and oxygen consumption measurement, we conclude that LDH inhibition leads to reduced TCAC and impaired OXPHOS.</p>
<p>We repeated the above experiments on HeLa-Ctrl and HeLa-LDHAKO cells, including isotope tracing of TCAC intermediates using [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>)and [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>] glutamine (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), oxygen consumption rate (<xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The results showed that GNE-140 inhibited both TCAC and OXPHOS. The effect of GNE-140 on the labeling pattern of TCAC intermediates by [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose and [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine in HeLa-Ctrl and HeLa-LDHAKO were similar to that in HeLa-LDHBKO cells. The inhibition extent of mitochonidrial respiration by GNE-140 from high to low was HeLa-LDHBKO, HeLa-LDHAKO, and HeLa-Ctrl, which was agreeable with the inhibition extent of LDH in these cells, the residual LDH activity from low to high in the presence of GNE-140 was HeLa-LDHBKO, HeLa-LDHAKO, and HeLa-Ctrl (<xref rid="fig5s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). It was noted that GNE-140 did not significantly inhibit OXPHOS in HeLa-Ctrl, the possible reason was explained in the section of Discussion. LDHA KO combined with GNE-140 also inhibited the mitochondrial respiration. GNE-140 could also inhibit the mitochondrial respiration of 4T1-LDHAKO cells (<xref rid="fig5s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p>

<title>The effect of GNE-140 on energy production, redox state, and cell survival</title>
<p>We observed that GNE-140 under normoxia significantly inhibited both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in HeLa-LDHBKO cells, and this agent under hypoxia was more efficacious in suppressing glycolysis, causing a marked reduction in the concentrations of ATP (Table supplement 9 &amp; 10).

<p>We calculated the ATP production rate of the cells according to the glycolytic rate and mitochondrial respiration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Under normoxia (21% oxygen), GNE-140 (30 μM) simultaneously inhibited glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, resulting in a 58% decrease of total ATP output. Under hypoxia (1% oxygen), assuming OXPHOS rate was negligible, GNE-140 inhibited glycolysis-derived ATP (which was approximately to total ATP output) by 88%. Under normoxia, in the presence of GNE-140, ATP concentration reduced by 56%, ADP concentration remained unchanged, AMP concentration increased by 157%, and the pool size of AMP + ADP + ATP decreased by 50% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).

Together, GNE-140 not only markedly inhibited the ATP generation rate but also significantly reduced the pooled concentration of ATP + ADP + AMP.</p>

Under normoxia, after GNE-140 treatment, the concentration of NAD<sup>+</sup> decreased and the concentration of NADH increased, resulting in an increased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup>, but the pooled concentrations (NAD<sup>+</sup> + NADH) did not change significantly (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Under hypoxia and with or without GNE-140, NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations were 2.26 mM and 0.72 mM, respectively, while NADH concentrations were 0.36 mM and 0.59 mM, respectively, and as a result, NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> increased by 4.5 folds but the pooled concentration (NADH + NAD<sup>+</sup>) decreased by 50 % (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Since NADP<sup>+</sup> is derived from NAD<sup>+</sup> via phosphorylation by NAD<sup>+</sup> kinase, we speculated that the decrease in the total concentration (NADH + NAD<sup>+</sup>) could affect NADP<sup>+</sup> and NADPH, which were intermediate acceptors that transfer electrons in cellular anabolism. Under normoxia or hypoxia, GNE-140 induced a decrease in the concentrations of NADP<sup>+</sup> and NADPH (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>GSH is the most abundant anti-oxidant in cells. Oxidation of GSH converts to GSSG, which is recycled back to GSH via glutathione reductase using NADPH as the electron donor. It is well documented that a change in the concentration of NADPH or NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> is directly associated with the concentration of GSH, GSSG, and/or GSH/GSSG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ghosh, Levault, &amp; Brewer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Xiao &amp; Loscalzo, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Treatment of cells with GNE-140 under normoxia or hypoxia did not significantly affect GSH/GSSG, but did reduce the concentrations of both GSH and GSSG (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>The above results demonstrated that GNE-140 through inhibition of LDH could significantly alter the energy metabolism and redox state in cells, and that the inhibition was more efficacious under hypoxia than under normoxia. This differential inhibition under 2 conditions may lead to different effect on cell growth and survival. Indeed, GNE-140 (30 μM) under normoxia inhibited the growth of HeLa-LDHBKO cells but only exhibited marginally significant cytotoxicity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). In contrast, GNE-140 (30 μM) effectively killed HeLa-LDHBKO cells under hypoxia (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike HeLa-LDHBKO cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref> &amp; G), 30 μM GNE-140 moderately inhibited the growth of HeLa-Ctrl or HeLa-LDHAKO cells, but did not induce cell death (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was consistent with the potency of GNE-140, which was a much stronger inhibitor to LDHA than to LDHB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> &amp; B).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In contrast to prior findings suggesting that LDH inhibition results in the suppression of glycolysis while enhancing mitochondrial respiration, our study demonstrates that LDH inhibition leads to the suppression of not only glycolysis but also the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAC) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Understanding this inconsistency requires a mechanistic explanation. It is worth noting that previous publications have largely left the biochemical mechanism by which LDH regulates glycolysis, TCAC, and OXPHOS unexplored. Here, we provide a detailed examination of the kinetic and thermodynamic insights into how LDH regulates these biochemical processes, as discussed further below.</p>
<p>The regulation of the glycolytic pathway by LDH involves a dynamic interplay between enzyme kinetics and thermodynamic potentials within the pathway. Inhibition of LDH initiates a cascade of sequential kinetic and thermodynamic changes within glycolysis. Initially, the loss of LDH activity leads to an accumulation of free NADH and a depletion of free NAD<sup>+</sup>. The decrease in the free NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration perturbs the activity of GAPDH, disrupting the balance in the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates, characterized by significant increases in the concentrations of GA3P, DHAP, FBP, and significant decrease in the concentration of 3PG. This disruption of glycolytic intermediates further changes the thermodynamic state of the reactions catalyzed by PFK1, aldolase, TPI, and PGAM, rendering these reactions significantly more favorable in the reverse direction. The combined kinetic and thermodynamic changes induced by inhibition of LDH contribute to the suppression of glycolysis. Based on our findings, the suppression of glycolysis through LDH inhibition primarily affects the segment encompassing PFK1, aldolase, TPI, GAPDH, PGK1, and PGAM.</p>
<p>The elucidation of the mechanistic insight into regulation of glycolysis by LDH has a broader significance in metabolic regulation. In literature and biochemistry textbooks, metabolic regulation is understood through two fundamental principles: chemical thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics. Chemical thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics each serve distinct roles: while the thermodynamics dictates the energetic favorability of a reaction or a metabolic pathway, the enzyme kinetics controls the rate. The glycolytic pathway, the most thoroughly studied metabolic pathway, serves as a prototypical model for metabolic regulation. The rate regulation of glycolysis is emphasized by the enzyme kinetics, including feedback regulation, feedforward activation, allosteric regulation, expression of enzymes, posttranslation modification of enzymes, etc, while the thermodynamic part focuses on Gibbs free energy, that determines the directionality and energy transfer in the pathway. However, the interaction between enzyme kinetics and the thermodynamic properties of the glycolytic pathway is often overlooked in the glycolytic regulation. In this study, we propose a model suggesting that glycolysis regulation occurs through the interaction between enzyme kinetics and the thermodynamic properties of the pathway. Therefore, our findings have implications that could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of metabolic regulation in general.</p>
<p>It is essential to distinguish the roles of enzyme kinetics and the thermodynamic properties in isolated reactions from those in a metabolic pathway composed of multiple sequential reactions. Our study offers a model for this distinction. At steady state, the velocity of LDH is determined by the total activity of LDH and its substrate concentration. When the substrate concentration is fixed, the rate is proportional to the total activity, while the direction of the reaction is determined by the Gibbs free energy. However, in steady-state glycolysis, the rate of the LDH-catalyzed reaction is not directly proportional to its total activity. Inhibition of LDH induces serial kinetic and thermodynamic changes in the upper segment of the glycolytic pathway beyond the LDH step alone, ultimately influencing the glycolytic rate.</p>
<p>As shown in the result section, the inhibition of LDH decreases the rates of pyruvate production via glycolysis without significantly augmenting the proportion of pyruvate entering the mitochondria. Consequently, the flux of glycolysis-derived pyruvate to mitochondrial metabolism is diminished. This challenges the prior perception that LDH inhibition redirects pyruvate flux toward mitochondrial metabolism.</p>
<p>While LDH inhibition decreases the flux of glucose and glutamine carbon into TCAC, it also coincides with a reduction in the flux of intermediates exiting TCAC. As such, the extent of OXPHOS inhibition can vary depending on the ratios of these two flux rates, as observed in HeLa-LDHBKO, HeLa-LDHAKO, and HeLa-Ctrl cells.</p>
<p>The elucidated mechanism above explains why LDH inhibition results in the suppression of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAC), and mitochondrial respiration. This relationship is vividly illustrated in the schematic diagram (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Schematic diagrams to demonstrate the impact on glycolysis, TCAC, and OXPHOS via regulation of LDH.</title>
<p>(A) Tumor cells consume glucose through glycolysis. A significant portion of the pyruvate generated during glycolysis is converted into lactate, while a fraction enters the TCAC. This metabolic pathway aids in the production of electron donors such as NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>, subsequently participating in OXPHOS. (B) When LDH is inhibited, it triggers a series of biochemical changes in the glycolytic pathway, resulting in the inhibition of glycolysis: the concentration of free NADH increases while the concentration of free NAD<sup>+</sup> decreases; the decreased concentration of free NAD<sup>+</sup> perturbs the activity of GAPDH, disrupting the balance of glycolytic intermediates, causing a marked increase of the concentrations in FBP, DHAP, GA3P, and significant decrease of the concentration in 3PG, leading to significant changes of ΔGs of the reactions catalyzed by PFK1, aldolase, TPI, and PGAM in the glycolytic pathway, favoring the reverse direction of these reactions. As the overall rate of pyruvate production decreases without significant proportion of pyruvate redirecting to mitochondrial metabolism, the flux of glucose carbon into the TCAC decreases, and the anaplerosis of glutamine to TCAC intermediates also decreases. Consequently, the TCAC and OXPHOS are inhibited. (C) Inhibiting LDH causes energy crisis and redox imbalance, particularly accentuated under hypoxia versus normoxia. As a result, inhibition of LDH activity inhibits growth under normoxia while kills cancer cells under hypoxia.</p></caption>

<p>We observed that LDH activity correlated with the pooled concentrations of key variables (ATP + ADP + AMP, NAD<sup>+</sup> + NADH, NADP<sup>+</sup> + NADPH, GSH + GSSG) in cells. Deletion of LDH isoforms (LDHAKO or LDHBKO) did not significantly alter the concentrations of these variables. However, treatment of HeLa-LDHBKO cells with GNE-140 resulted in decreased concentrations of these variables. Considering the central roles of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAC), and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in cellular metabolism, which bridge catabolism and anabolism, changes in the synthesis and breakdown of these variables could be anticipated. Further investigation is required to elucidate how LDH influences the balance between the synthesis and breakdown of these variables by regulating glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration.</p>
<p>Inhibition of LDH induces energy crises and redox imbalances in cancer cells, with a much more profound impact under hypoxia than under normoxia condition. This difference is linked to distinct effects on cancer cell growth and death: LDH inhibition impairs cancer cell growth but does not induce cell death under normoxia, whereas it effectively kills cancer cells under hypoxia. As inhibition of LDH may effectively kill cancer cells under hypoxia, it may have potential for cancer treatment in the future, given that hypoxia confers cancer cells with resistance to radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Moeller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mukherjee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Telarovic, Wenger, &amp; Pruschy, 2021</xref>), immune checkpoint inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chouaib, Noman, Kosmatopoulos, &amp; Curran, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ding et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Semenza, 2012</xref>), as well as numerous chemotherapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Skarsgard, Vinczan, Skwarchuk, &amp; Chaplin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wilson, Keng, &amp; Sutherland, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yokoi &amp; Fidler, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Isotope tracing is a common method applied in metabolic analysis across all fields of biology. The percentage of TCAC intermediates labeled by [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose is often interpreted as the efficiency of glucose carbon entering the TCAC. A higher percentage suggests higher efficiency, and vice versa. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting isotope tracing data. In this study, treatment of cells with GNE-140 led to an increase labeling percentage of TCAC intermediates by [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-E</xref>).</p>
<p>However, this does not necessarily imply an increase in glucose carbon flux into TCAC; rather, it indicates a reduction in both the flux of glucose carbon into TCAC and the flux of intermediates leaving TCAC. When interpreting the data, multiple factors must be considered, including the carbon-13 labeling pattern of the intermediates (m1, m2, m3, ---) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G-K</xref>), replenishment of intermediates by glutamine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5M-V</xref>), and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5W</xref>). All these factors should be taken into account to derive a proper interpretation of the data.</p>

<p>The sample was derivatized according to the previous study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Salazar, Armenta, &amp; Shulaev, 2012</xref>). Briefly, 10 μL sample (intracellular extract/medium) was added to 100 μL borate buffer (0.2 M borate buffer, pH 8.8), and mixed thoroughly. Then, 30 μL AQC (3 mg/mL) was added and vortexed immediately. The mixture was incubated at 60°C for 20 minutes. An ACCQ-TAG ULTRA C18 column attached to Waters ACQUITY UPLC system was used to perform liquid chromatography. Solvent A is composed of 1% acetonitrile, 99% water, 1.5 mM ammonia formate, pH 3.05, and solvent B is composed of 100% acetonitrile. The solvent gradient program is: 0 min, 80% solvent A; 6 min, 40% solvent A; 6.01 min, 0% solvent A; 7 min, 0% solvent A; 8 min, 80% solvent A; 10 min, 80% solvent A. 1 μL sample or standard solution was injected to perform the analysis with a flow rate at 0.7 mL/min. During the performance, the column was kept at 55 ℃.</p>
<p>Isotopologues were analyzed by the mass spectrometer (X500 QTOF, Sciex). The MRM transitions (m/z), declustering potential, collision energy, and entrance potential were optimized for each metabolite (Table supplement 11 &amp; 12).</p>

<title>Measurement of mitochondrial respiration rate</title>
<p>Measurement of mitochondrial respiration rate was described by us previously (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ying, Jin, Zeng, Chao, &amp; Hu, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zeng &amp; Hu, 2023</xref>). Briefly, cells were plated in density of about 1×10<sup>6</sup>∼2×10<sup>6</sup>/dish in 6cm-dishes overnight. After replacing with fresh culture medium for 6 hours (treated with different culture conditions, with/without GNE-140), about 1×10<sup>6</sup>∼2×10<sup>6</sup> cells were added to each O2K chamber (O2k-FluoRespirometer, ORBOROS), and the culture conditions in the chamber were the same as before (with/without GNE-140). Oligomycin (an inhibitor of ATP synthase, 2μg/mL), FCCP (an uncoupler of the electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, 0.15-0.3μM, depending on different cells), rotenone (an inhibitor of respiratory complex I, 0.5μM), and antimycin A (an inhibitor of respiratory complex III, 2.5μM) were sequentially injected into chamber. OCR was calculated according to the following equations:</p>
<p>OCR<sub>mitochondrial basal</sub> = OCR<sub>cellular basal</sub> - OCR<sub>rot+aa</sub>; (OCR<sub>cellular basal</sub> is the oxygen consumption rate without the above mentioned inhibitors and uncoupler; OCR<sub>rot+aa</sub> is the oxygen consumption rate after adding rotenone and antimycin A)</p>
<p>OCR<sub>oligomycin-sensitive</sub> = OCR<sub>cellular basal</sub> - OCR<sub>oli</sub>; (OCR<sub>oli</sub> is the oxygen consumption rate after adding oligomycin)</p>
<p>Proton leak = OCR<sub>oli</sub> - OCR<sub>rot+aa</sub>;</p>
<p>OCR<sub>max</sub> =OCR<sub>FCCP</sub> - OCR<sub>rot+aa</sub>; (OCR<sub>FCCP</sub> is the oxygen consumption rate after adding FCCP)</p>
<p>OCR<sub>non-mitochondrial</sub> = OCR<sub>rot+aa</sub>.</p>

<title>Calculation of ATP generation rate</title>
<p>The ATP generation rate was calculated as described by us previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zeng &amp; Hu, 2023</xref>). Briefly, the rate was calculated according to the equations as follows:</p>
<p>J<sub>ATP-glycolysis</sub> = J<sub>lactate</sub>; (J<sub>lactate</sub> is the lactate production rate of glycolysis)</p>
<p>J<sub>ATP-OXPHOS</sub> = J<sub>O-oligomycin</sub> × 2.509; (J<sub>O-oligomycin</sub> = OCR<sub>oligomycin-sensitive</sub> × 2)</p>
<p>J<sub>substrate-level phosphorylation –TCAC</sub> = J<sub>O-oligomycin</sub> ÷ 5;</p>
<p>J<sub>ATP</sub> = J<sub>ATP-glycolysis</sub> + J<sub>ATP-OXPHOS</sub> + J<sub>substrate-level phosphorylation –TCAC</sub>.</p>

<title>Cell growth</title>
<p>Cell growth curves were obtained as described previously(C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ying et al., 2022</xref>). Cells were plated in density of about 4×10<sup>3</sup>/well in 96-well plate overnight, and treated with different culture conditions (with GNE0140/without GNE-140/normoxia/hypoxia). Then, cells were counted at 0, 24, and 48 hours using a cell counter (BioTech, Countstar).</p>

<title>Flow cytometric analysis</title>
<p>Flow cytometry was analyzed according to the methods described previously(C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ying et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zeng &amp; Hu, 2023</xref>). Cells were plated in density of about 3×10<sup>4</sup>/well, respectively, in 24-well plate overnight, and treated with different culture conditions (with GNE-140/without GNE-140/normoxia/hypoxia). After 48 hours, cells were collected, washed with PBS, stained with Annexin V-FITC (AV) and Propidium iodide (PI) solution (Beyotime, cat. no. C1062L) at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes, and then the samples were analyzed by a flow cytometer (DxFLEX, Beckman Coulter).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zeng et al. have investigated the impact of inhibiting lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) on glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. LDH is the terminal enzyme of aerobic glycolysis or fermentation that converts pyruvate and NADH to lactate and NAD+ and is essential for the fermentation pathway as it recycles NAD+ needed by upstream glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. As the authors point out in the introduction, multiple published reports have shown that inhibition of LDH in cancer cells typically leads to a switch from fermentative ATP production to respiratory ATP production (i.e., glucose uptake and lactate secretion are decreased, and oxygen consumption is increased). The presumed logic of this metabolic rearrangement is that when glycolytic ATP production is inhibited due to LDH inhibition, the cell switches to producing more ATP using respiration. This observation is similar to the well-established Crabtree and Pasteur effects, where cells switch between fermentation and respiration due to the availability of glucose and oxygen. Unexpectedly, the authors observed that inhibition of LDH led to inhibition of respiration and not activation as previously observed. The authors perform rigorous measurements of glycolysis and TCA cycle activity, demonstrating that under their experimental conditions, respiration is indeed inhibited. Given the large body of work reporting the opposite result, it is difficult to reconcile the reasons for the discrepancy. In this reviewer's opinion, a reason for the discrepancy may be that the authors performed their measurements 6 hours after inhibiting LDH. Six hours is a very long time for assessing the direct impact of a perturbation on metabolic pathway activity, which is regulated on a timescale of seconds to minutes. The observed effects are likely the result of a combination of many downstream responses that happen within 6 hours of inhibiting LDH that causes a large decrease in ATP production, inhibition of cell proliferation, and likely a range of stress responses, including gene expression changes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The regulation of metabolic pathways is incompletely understood, and more research is needed, such as the one conducted here. The authors performed an impressive set of measurements of metabolite levels in response to inhibition of LDH using a combination of rigorous approaches.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Glycolysis, TCA cycle, and respiration are regulated on a timescale of seconds to minutes. The main weakness of this study is the long drug treatment time of 6 hours, which was chosen for all the experiments. In this reviewer's opinion, if the goal was to investigate the direct impact of LDH inhibition on glycolysis and the TCA cycle, most of the experiments should have been performed immediately after or within minutes of LDH inhibition. After 6 hours of inhibiting LDH and ATP production, cells undergo a whole range of responses, and most of the observed effects are likely indirect due to the many downstream effects of LDH and ATP production inhibition, such as decreased cell proliferation, decreased energy demand, activation of stress response pathways, etc.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zeng et al. investigated the role of LDH in determining the metabolic fate of pyruvate in HeLa and 4T1 cells. To do this, three broad perturbations were applied: knockout of two LDH isoforms (LDH-A and LDH-B), titration with a non-competitive LDH inhibitor (GNE-140), and exposure to either normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. They show that knockout of either LDH isoform alone, though reducing both protein level and enzyme activity, has virtually no effect on either the incorporation of a stable 13C-label from a 13C6-glucose into any glycolytic or TCA cycle intermediate, nor on the measured intracellular concentrations of any glycolytic intermediate (Figure 2). The only apparent exception to this was the NADH/NAD+ ratio, measured as the ratio of F420/F480 emitted from a fluorescent tag (SoNar).</p>
<p>The addition of a chemical inhibitor, on the other hand, did lead to changes in glycolytic flux, the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates, and in the NADH/NAD+ ratio (Figure 3). Notably, this was most evident in the LDH-B-knockout, in agreement with the increased sensitivity of LDH-A to GNE-140 (Figure 2). In the LDH-B-knockout, increasing concentrations of GNE-140 increased the NADH/NAD+ ratio, reduced glucose uptake, and lactate production, and led to an accumulation of glycolytic intermediates immediately upstream of GAPDH (GA3P, DHAP, and FBP) and a decrease in the product of GAPDH (3PG). They continue to show that this effect is even stronger in cells exposed to hypoxic conditions (Figure 4). They propose that a shift to thermodynamic unfavourability, initiated by an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio inhibiting GAPDH explains the cascade, calculating ΔG values that become progressively more endergonic at increasing inhibitor concentrations.</p>
<p>Then - in two separate experiments - the authors track the incorporation of 13C into the intermediates of the TCA cycle from a 13C6-glucose and a 13C5-glutamine. They use the proportion of labelled intermediates as a proxy for how much pyruvate enters the TCA cycle (Figure 5). They conclude that the inhibition of LDH decreases fermentation, but also the TCA cycle and OXPHOS flux - and hence the flux of pyruvate to all of those pathways. Finally, they characterise the production of ATP from respiratory or fermentative routes, the concentration of a number of cofactors (ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD(P)H, NAD(P)+, and GSH/GSSG), the cell count, and cell viability under four conditions: with and without the highest inhibitor concentration, and at norm- and hypoxia. From this, they conclude that the inhibition of LDH inhibits the glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and OXPHOS simultaneously (Figure 7).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present an impressively detailed set of measurements under a variety of conditions. It is clear that a huge effort was made to characterise the steady-state properties (metabolite concentrations, fluxes) as well as the partitioning of pyruvate between fermentation as opposed to the TCA cycle and OXPHOS.</p>
<p>A couple of intermediary conclusions are well supported, with the hypothesis underlying the next measurement clearly following. For instance, the authors refer to literature reports that LDH activity is highly redundant in cancer cells (lines 108 - 144). They prove this point convincingly in Figure 1, showing that both the A- and B-isoforms of LDH can be knocked out without any noticeable changes in specific glucose consumption or lactate production flux, or, for that matter, in the rate at which any of the pathway intermediates are produced. Pyruvate incorporation into the TCA cycle and the oxygen consumption rate are also shown to be unaffected.</p>
<p>They checked the specificity of the inhibitor and found good agreement between the inhibitory capacity of GNE-140 on the two isoforms of LDH and the glycolytic flux (lines 229 - 243). The authors also provide a logical interpretation of the first couple of consequences following LDH inhibition: an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio leading to the inhibition of GAPDH, causing upstream accumulations and downstream metabolite decreases (lines 348 - 355).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite the inarguable comprehensiveness of the data set, a number of conceptual shortcomings afflict the manuscript. First and foremost, reasoning is often not pursued to a logical conclusion. For instance, the accumulation of intermediates upstream of GAPDH is proffered as an explanation for the decreased flux through glycolysis. However, in Figure 3C it is clear that there is no accumulation of the intermediates upstream of PFK. It is unclear, therefore, how this traffic jam is propagated back to a decrease in glucose uptake. A possible explanation might lie with hexokinase and the decrease in ATP (and constant ADP) demonstrated in Figure 6B, but this link is not made.</p>
<p>The obvious link between the NADH/NAD+ ratio and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is also never addressed, a mechanism that might explain how the pyruvate incorporation into the TCA cycle is impaired by the inhibition of LDH (the observation with which they start their discussion, lines 511 - 514).</p>
<p>It was furthermore puzzling how the ΔG, calculated with intracellular metabolite concentrations (Figures 3 and 4) could be endergonic (positive) for PGAM at all conditions (also normoxic and without inhibitor). This would mean that under the conditions assayed, glycolysis would never flow completely forward. How any lactate or pyruvate is produced from glucose, is then unexplained.</p>
<p>Finally, the interpretation of the label incorporation data is rather unconvincing. The authors observe an increasing labelled fraction of TCA cycle intermediates as a function of increasing inhibitor concentration. Strangely, they conclude that less labelled pyruvate enters the TCA cycle while simultaneously less labelled intermediates exit the TCA cycle pool, leading to increased labelling of this pool. The reasoning that they present for this (decreased m2 fraction as a function of DHE-140 concentration) is by no means a consistent or striking feature of their titration data and comes across as rather unconvincing. Yet they treat this anomaly as resolved in the discussion that follows.</p>

<p>Hu et al in their manuscript attempt to interrogate the interplay between glycolysis, TCA activity, and OXPHOS using LDHA/B knockouts as well as LDH-specific inhibitors. Before I discuss the specifics, I have a few issues with the overall manuscript. First of all, based on numerous previous studies it is well established that glycolysis inhibition or forcing pyruvate into the TCA cycle (studies with PDKs inhibitors) leads to upregulation of TCA cycle activity, and OXPHOS, activation of glutaminolysis, etc (in this work authors claim that lowered glycolysis leads to lower levels of TCA activity/OXPHOS). The authors in the current work completely ignore recent studies that suggest that lactate itself is an important signaling metabolite that can modulate metabolism (actual mechanistic insights were recently presented by at least two groups (Thompson, Chouchani labs). In addition, extensive effort was dedicated to understanding the crosstalk between glycolysis/TCA cycle/OXPHOS using metabolic models (Titov, Rabinowitz labs). I have several comments on how experiments were performed. In the Methods section, it is stated that both HeLa and 4T1 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium with regular serum - but under these conditions, pyruvate is certainly present in the medium - this can easily complicate/invalidate some findings presented in this manuscript. In LDH enzymatic assays as described with cell homogenates controls were not explained or presented (a lot of enzymes in the homogenate can react with NADH!). One of the major issues I have is that glycolytic intermediates were measured in multiple enzyme-coupled assays. Although one might think it is a good approach to have quantitative numbers for each metabolite, the way it was done is that cell homogenates (potentially with still traces of activity of multiple glycolytic enzymes) were incubated with various combinations of the SAME enzymes and substrates they were supposed to measure as a part of the enzyme-based cycling reaction. I would prefer to see a comparison between numbers obtained in enzyme-based assays with GC-MS/LC-MS experiments (using calibration curves for respective metabolites, of course). Correct measurements of these metabolites are crucial especially when thermodynamic parameters for respective reactions are calculated. Concentrations of multiple graphs (Figure 1g etc.) are in &quot;mM&quot;, I do not think that this is correct.</p>

<p>We sincerely thank the reviewers for their thoughtful, critical, and constructive comments, which will help us in further exploring the mechanisms by which LDH regulates glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation future studies. The following is our responses to the reviewers' comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zeng et al. have investigated the impact of inhibiting lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) on glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. LDH is the terminal enzyme of aerobic glycolysis or fermentation that converts pyruvate and NADH to lactate and NAD+ and is essential for the fermentation pathway as it recycles NAD+ needed by upstream glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. As the authors point out in the introduction, multiple published reports have shown that inhibition of LDH in cancer cells typically leads to a switch from fermentative ATP production to respiratory ATP production (i.e., glucose uptake and lactate secretion are decreased, and oxygen consumption is increased). The presumed logic of this metabolic rearrangement is that when glycolytic ATP production is inhibited due to LDH inhibition, the cell switches to producing more ATP using respiration. This observation is similar to the well-established Crabtree and Pasteur effects, where cells switch between fermentation and respiration due to the availability of glucose and oxygen. Unexpectedly, the authors observed that inhibition of LDH led to inhibition of respiration and not activation as previously observed. The authors perform rigorous measurements of glycolysis and TCA cycle activity, demonstrating that under their experimental conditions, respiration is indeed inhibited. Given the large body of work reporting the opposite result, it is difficult to reconcile the reasons for the discrepancy. In this reviewer's opinion, a reason for the discrepancy may be that the authors performed their measurements 6 hours after inhibiting LDH. Six hours is a very long time for assessing the direct impact of a perturbation on metabolic pathway activity, which is regulated on a timescale of seconds to minutes. The observed effects are likely the result of a combination of many downstream responses that happen within 6 hours of inhibiting LDH that causes a large decrease in ATP production, inhibition of cell proliferation, and likely a range of stress responses, including gene expression changes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The regulation of metabolic pathways is incompletely understood, and more research is needed, such as the one conducted here. The authors performed an impressive set of measurements of metabolite levels in response to inhibition of LDH using a combination of rigorous approaches.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Glycolysis, TCA cycle, and respiration are regulated on a timescale of seconds to minutes. The main weakness of this study is the long drug treatment time of 6 hours, which was chosen for all the experiments. In this reviewer's opinion, if the goal was to investigate the direct impact of LDH inhibition on glycolysis and the TCA cycle, most of the experiments should have been performed immediately after or within minutes of LDH inhibition. After 6 hours of inhibiting LDH and ATP production, cells undergo a whole range of responses, and most of the observed effects are likely indirect due to the many downstream effects of LDH and ATP production inhibition, such as decreased cell proliferation, decreased energy demand, activation of stress response pathways, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s critical comments. The main argument is whether the inhibition of LDH induces a temporal perturbation in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and OXPHOS, or if it leads to a shift to a new steady state. We argue that this shift represents a transition between two steady states; specifically, GNE-140 treatment drives metabolism from one steady state to another.</p>
<p>Before conducting the experiment, we performed a time course experiment, measuring glucose consumption and lactate production in cells treated with GNE-140. The results demonstrated a very good linearity, indicating that the glycolytic rate remained constant—thus confirming that glycolysis was at steady state. Given the tight coupling between glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and OXPHOS, we infer that the TCA cycle and OXPHOS were also at steady state. However, this ‘infer’ requires further confirmation.</p>
<p>Multiple published reports have shown that LDH inhibition in cancer cells causes a shift from fermentative ATP production to respiratory ATP production. This notion persists because it is often compared to the well-established Crabtree and Pasteur effects, where cells toggle between fermentation and respiration based on glucose and oxygen availability. However, in the Pasteur or Crabtree effects, the deprivation of oxygen—the terminal electron acceptor—drives the switch, which is fundamentally different from LDH inhibition.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zeng et al. investigated the role of LDH in determining the metabolic fate of pyruvate in HeLa and 4T1 cells. To do this, three broad perturbations were applied: knockout of two LDH isoforms (LDH-A and LDH-B), titration with a non-competitive LDH inhibitor (GNE-140), and exposure to either normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. They show that knockout of either LDH isoform alone, though reducing both protein level and enzyme activity, has virtually no effect on either the incorporation of a stable 13C-label from a 13C6-glucose into any glycolytic or TCA cycle intermediate, nor on the measured intracellular concentrations of any glycolytic intermediate (Figure 2). The only apparent exception to this was the NADH/NAD+ ratio, measured as the ratio of F420/F480 emitted from a fluorescent tag (SoNar).</p>
<p>The addition of a chemical inhibitor, on the other hand, did lead to changes in glycolytic flux, the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates, and in the NADH/NAD+ ratio (Figure 3). Notably, this was most evident in the LDH-B-knockout, in agreement with the increased sensitivity of LDH-A to GNE-140 (Figure 2). In the LDH-B-knockout, increasing concentrations of GNE-140 increased the NADH/NAD+ ratio, reduced glucose uptake, and lactate production, and led to an accumulation of glycolytic intermediates immediately upstream of GAPDH (GA3P, DHAP, and FBP) and a decrease in the product of GAPDH (3PG). They continue to show that this effect is even stronger in cells exposed to hypoxic conditions (Figure 4). They propose that a shift to thermodynamic unfavourability, initiated by an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio inhibiting GAPDH explains the cascade, calculating ΔG values that become progressively more endergonic at increasing inhibitor concentrations.</p>
<p>Then - in two separate experiments - the authors track the incorporation of 13C into the intermediates of the TCA cycle from a 13C6-glucose and a 13C5-glutamine. They use the proportion of labelled intermediates as a proxy for how much pyruvate enters the TCA cycle (Figure 5). They conclude that the inhibition of LDH decreases fermentation, but also the TCA cycle and OXPHOS flux - and hence the flux of pyruvate to all of those pathways. Finally, they characterise the production of ATP from respiratory or fermentative routes, the concentration of a number of cofactors (ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD(P)H, NAD(P)+, and GSH/GSSG), the cell count, and cell viability under four conditions: with and without the highest inhibitor concentration, and at norm- and hypoxia. From this, they conclude that the inhibition of LDH inhibits the glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and OXPHOS simultaneously (Figure 7).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present an impressively detailed set of measurements under a variety of conditions. It is clear that a huge effort was made to characterise the steady-state properties (metabolite concentrations, fluxes) as well as the partitioning of pyruvate between fermentation as opposed to the TCA cycle and OXPHOS.</p>
<p>A couple of intermediary conclusions are well supported, with the hypothesis underlying the next measurement clearly following. For instance, the authors refer to literature reports that LDH activity is highly redundant in cancer cells (lines 108 - 144). They prove this point convincingly in Figure 1, showing that both the A- and B-isoforms of LDH can be knocked out without any noticeable changes in specific glucose consumption or lactate production flux, or, for that matter, in the rate at which any of the pathway intermediates are produced. Pyruvate incorporation into the TCA cycle and the oxygen consumption rate are also shown to be unaffected.</p>
<p>They checked the specificity of the inhibitor and found good agreement between the inhibitory capacity of GNE-140 on the two isoforms of LDH and the glycolytic flux (lines 229 - 243). The authors also provide a logical interpretation of the first couple of consequences following LDH inhibition: an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio leading to the inhibition of GAPDH, causing upstream accumulations and downstream metabolite decreases (lines 348 - 355).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite the inarguable comprehensiveness of the data set, a number of conceptual shortcomings afflict the manuscript. First and foremost, reasoning is often not pursued to a logical conclusion. For instance, the accumulation of intermediates upstream of GAPDH is proffered as an explanation for the decreased flux through glycolysis. However, in Figure 3C it is clear that there is no accumulation of the intermediates upstream of PFK. It is unclear, therefore, how this traffic jam is propagated back to a decrease in glucose uptake. A possible explanation might lie with hexokinase and the decrease in ATP (and constant ADP) demonstrated in Figure 6B, but this link is not made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's critical comment. In Figure 3C, there is no accumulation of F6P or G6P, which are upstream of PFK1. This is because the PFK1-catalyzed reaction sets a significant thermodynamic barrier. Even with treatment using 30 μM GNE-140, the ∆GPFK1 (Gibbs free energy of the PFK1-catalyzed reaction) remains -9.455 kJ/mol (Figure 3D), indicating that the reaction is still far from thermodynamic equilibrium, thereby preventing the accumulation of F6P and G6P.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that hexokinase inhibition may play a role, this requires further investigation.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. In this study, we did not explore how the inhibition of LDH affects pyruvate incorporation into the TCA cycle. As this mechanism was not investigated, we have titled the study: <italic>&quot;Elucidating the Kinetic and Thermodynamic Insights into the Regulation of Glycolysis by Lactate Dehydrogenase and Its Impact on the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle and Oxidative Phosphorylation in Cancer Cells.&quot;</italic></p>

</disp-quote>
<p>This issue also concerned me during the study. However, given the high reproducibility of the data, we consider it is true, but requires explanation.</p>
<p>The PGAM-catalyzed reaction is tightly linked to both upstream and downstream reactions in the glycolytic pathway. In glycolysis, three key reactions catalyzed by HK2, PFK1, and PK are highly exergonic, providing the driving force for the conversion of glucose to pyruvate. The other reactions, including the one catalyzed by PGAM, operate near thermodynamic equilibrium and primarily serve to equilibrate glycolytic intermediates rather than control the overall direction of glycolysis, as previously described by us (J Biol Chem. 2024 Aug 8;300(9):107648).</p>
<p>The endergonic nature of the PGAM-catalyzed reaction does not prevent it from proceeding in the forward direction. Instead, the directionality of the pathway is dictated by the exergonic reaction of PFK1 upstream, which pushes the flux forward, and by PK downstream, which pulls the flux through the pathway. The combined effects of PFK1 and PK may account for the observed endergonic state of the PGAM reaction.</p>
<p>However, if the PGAM-catalyzed reaction were isolated from the glycolytic pathway, it would tend toward equilibrium and never surpass it, as there would be no driving force to move the reaction forward.</p>

<p>GNE-140 treatment increased the labeling of TCA cycle intermediates by [13C6]glucose but decreased the OXPHOS rate, we consider the conflicting results as an 'anomaly' that warrants further explanation. To address this, we analyzed the labeling pattern of TCA cycle intermediates using both [13C6]glucose and  [13C5]glutamine. Tracing the incorporation of glucose- and glutamine-derived carbons into the TCA cycle suggests that LDH inhibition leads to a reduced flux of glucose-derived acetyl-CoA into the TCA cycle, coupled with a decreased flux of glutamine-derived α-KG, and a reduction in the efflux of intermediates from the cycle. These results align with theoretical predictions. Under any condition, the reactions that distribute TCA cycle intermediates to other pathways must be balanced by those that replenish them. In the GNE-140 treatment group, the entry of glutamine-derived carbon into the TCA cycle was reduced, implying that glucose-derived carbon (as acetyl-CoA) entering the TCA cycle must also be reduced, or vice versa.</p>
<p>This step-by-step investigation is detailed under the subheading &quot;The Effect of LDHB KO and GNE-140 on the Contribution of Glucose Carbon to the TCA Cycle and OXPHOS&quot; in the Results section in the manuscript.</p>
<p>In the Discussion, we emphasize that caution should be exercised when interpreting isotope tracing data. In this study, treatment of cells with GNE-140 led to an increase labeling percentage of TCAC intermediates by [13C6]glucose (Figure 5A-E). However, this does not necessarily imply an increase in glucose carbon flux into TCAC; rather, it indicates a reduction in both the flux of glucose carbon into TCAC and the flux of intermediates leaving TCAC. When interpreting the data, multiple factors must be considered, including the carbon-13 labeling pattern of the intermediates (m1, m2, m3, ---) (Figure 5G-K), replenishment of intermediates by glutamine (Figure 5M-V), and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (Figure 5W). All these factors should be taken into account to derive a proper interpretation of the data.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>While the roles of lactate as a signaling metabolite and metabolic models are important areas of research, our work focuses on different aspects.</p>
<p>It is true that cell homogenates contain many enzymes that use NAD as a hydride acceptor or NADH as a hydride donor. However, in our assay system, the substrates are pyruvate and NADH, meaning only enzymes that catalyze the conversion of pyruvate + NADH to NAD + lactate can utilize NADH. Other enzymes do not interfere with this reaction. Although some enzymes may also catalyze this reaction, their catalytic efficiency is markedly lower than that of LDH, ensuring the validity of this assay.</p>
<p>Similarly, the assays for glycolytic intermediates are validated by the substrate specificity.</p>
<p>We have developed an LC-MS methodology for some glycolytic intermediates, but the accuracy of quantification remains unsatisfactory due to inherent limitations of this methodology.</p>
