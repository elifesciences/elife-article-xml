<title>Abstract</title><p>Pesticide-induced resurgence, increases in pest insect populations following pesticide application, is a serious threat to the sustainable control of many highly damaging crop pests. Resurgence can result from pesticide-enhanced pest reproduction, however, the molecular mechanisms mediating this process remain unresolved. Here we show that brown planthopper (BPH) resurgence in rice crops following exposure to the pesticide emamectin benzoate (EB) results from the coordinated action of a suite of genes that regulate juvenile hormone (JH) levels, resulting in increased JH titer in adult females and enhanced fecundity. We demonstrate that EB treatment at sublethal levels results in profound changes in female BPH fitness including increased egg maturation and oviposition. This enhanced reproductive fitness results from the EB-mediated upregulation of key genes involved in the regulation of JH, including <italic>JHAMT and Kr-h1</italic> and the downregulation of allatostatin (<italic>AstA</italic>) and allatostatin receptor (<italic>AstAR</italic>) expression. AstA signaling is known to inhibit the production of JH in the corpora allata and hence EB exposure diminishes this inhibitory action. We find that the changes in gene expression following EB exposure are caused by the action of this insecticide on its molecular target, the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl). Collectively, these results provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of negative pesticide-induced responses in insects and reveal the key actors involved in the JH-signaling pathway that underpin pesticide resurgence.</p>

<title>Significance</title>
<p>Pesticides remain a key means of controlling many of the world’s insect pests. However, in some cases, pesticide applications can result in resurgence of pest populations due to pesticide-induced increases in fecundity. In the current study, we show that pesticide resurgence in the brown planthopper (BPH) following exposure to the insecticide emamectin benzoate (EB) results from the transcriptional reprogramming of a diverse suite of positive and negative regulators of juvenile hormone (JH), a critical regulator of insect development and reproduction. This in turn leads to profound increases in female BPH reproductive fitness and enhanced fecundity. Our findings unravel the molecular mechanisms mediating pesticide-induced pest resurgence and inform the development of novel strategies to control highly damaging crop pests.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chemical pesticides remain the primary means of controlling many of the world’s most damaging arthropod crop pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Janssen and van Rijn, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wu et al., 2018a</xref>). However, pesticide applications can result in pest resurgence, increases in pest insect populations that exceed natural, untreated population sizes, following an initial reduction of the pest population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gandara et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guedes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hardin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Two mechanisms have been implicated in pest resurgence - the loss of beneficial insects including natural enemies, and pesticide-enhanced reproduction in the pest insect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). In the case of the latter, several pesticides, such as the insecticides triazophos, deltamethrin and the fungicide jinggangmycin, have been reported to stimulate pest reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Pesticide-enhanced pest reproduction has been linked to changes in physiology and biochemistry of pest organisms after exposure to pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guedes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying enhanced reproduction associated with pest resurgence remain poorly resolved.</p>
<p>The brown planthopper (BPH), <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> (Stål), is a notorious pest of rice crops throughout Asia causing annual losses of ∼300 million dollars across major rice producing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wu et al., 2018a</xref>). BPHs inhibit the growth of rice plants by feeding, and also transmits highly damaging plant viruses including rice grassy stunt virus and rice ragged stunt virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sōgawa, 1982</xref>). Currently, chemical insecticides play an indispensable role in the control of BPH due to their efficiency, rapid effect, and low cost. However, due to the widespread and intensive use of chemical insecticides, BPH has developed resistance to the majority of compounds used for control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Emamectin benzoate (EB) and abamectin are avermectin pesticides, and act as allosteric modulators of insect glutamate gated chloride channels (GluCls), inhibiting muscle contractions that lead to the cessation of insect feeding and subsequent death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ishaaya et al., 2002</xref>). These insecticides exhibit particularly strong activity against Lepidoptera such as the rice leaffolder, <italic>Cnaphalocrocis medinalis</italic> Guénee, an important foliage-feeding insect which attacks rice during the vegetative stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chintalapati et al., 2016</xref>). Both BPH and the rice leaffolder are migratory pests with overlapping migratory paths, however, their occurrence period in the field differs by approximately one month, with leaffolders appearing earlier than BPH. Therefore, the use of EB to control rice leaffolder has the potential to impact BPHs arriving later, via exposure to sublethal concentrations of this compound. In this regard, we have observed that when farmers use EB and abamectin to control leaffolders on rice crops in China, BPH outbreaks frequently occur in the same field. While sublethal doses of certain pesticides have been shown to enhance fecundity in BPHs, including the insecticides triazophos and deltamethrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>) and the fungicides carbendazim and jinggangmycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu et al., 2018b</xref>), whether avermectins trigger resurgence in BPH via insecticide-enhanced reproduction remains unclear.</p>
<p>Reproduction in insects is influenced by external factors such as light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Meiselman et al., 2022</xref>), humidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Roy et al., 2015</xref>) and nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Smykal and Raikhel, 2015</xref>), and endogenous factors such as the juvenile hormone (JH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Santos et al., 2019</xref>), ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hun et al., 2022</xref>), insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ling and Raikhel, 2018</xref>) and target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahmed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Du et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Of these, JH has been particularly implicated in insecticide-induced enhanced fecundity, with triazophos and deltamethrin treatments leading to increased circulating JH III titers in BPH females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). JH is synthesized and secreted by the corpora allata in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Luo et al., 2021</xref>), and can promote reproduction by regulating the synthesis and secretion of vitellogenin (Vg) in the female fat body, and stimulating the absorption of Vg by the developing oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Santos et al., 2019</xref>). However, the regulation of JH is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Santos et al., 2019</xref>) and the key actors involved in JH-mediated pesticide-enhanced reproduction remains an open question. Previous finding reported that the GluCl receptor is involved in JH biosynthesis in cockroach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chiang et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiang et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is still unknown whether insecticides that target the GluCl can increase reproduction in pest insects and how the GluCl receptor regulates JH production.</p>
<p>In this study, we used a range of diverse approaches to investigate the impact of sublethal doses of avermectins on BPH fecundity, and unravel the molecular mechanisms mediating enhanced reproduction following exposure to this insecticide class. We show that avermectin exposure results in profound changes in the expression of a key suite of genes that in combination regulate JH, resulting in increased JH titer in adult females, which promotes fecundity. Interestingly, we found that GluCl channel modulators can inhibit AstA/AstAR expression and thereby promote JH production.</p>

<title>GluCl allosteric modulators (emamectin benzoate and abamectin) stimulate fecundity of female <italic>N. lugens</italic></title>
<p>To investigate whether GluCl modulators affect fecundity in BPH, we first determined the sub-lethal and median lethal doses of emamectin benzoate (EB) on 4<sup>th</sup> instar nymphs, as well as on newly emerged males and females of BPH (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). For this we employed two different bioassay methods, the rice seedling dip bioassay method and topical application bioassay method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yao et al., 2017</xref>), in order to assess both the systemic and contact toxicity of these insecticides (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). We then systemically treated 4<sup>th</sup> instar nymphs of BPH, newly emerged males and females with the estimated LC<sub>15</sub> or LC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of EB and examined the fecundity of BPH after these individuals mated with treated or untreated individuals. We use the term “t” to represent individuals treated with EB and “ck” to indicate control individuals that were treated with insecticide diluent minus insecticide. First, we tested whether treatment of BPH with EB in nymphal stage impairs the fecundity of BPHs at the adult stage. For 4<sup>th</sup> instar nymphs of BPHs, after treatment with the LC<sub>15</sub> and LC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of EB, the number of eggs laid per female of BPHs in ♀t × ♂t crosses increased by 1.48 and 1.40 times compared with control ♀ck × ♂ck crosses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>); the number of eggs laid per female of BPH in ♀t × ♂ck crosses increased by 1.53 and 2.07 times compared with control crosses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>); However, the number of eggs laid by per female of BPH in ♀ck × ♂t crosses did not increase significantly compared to control ♀ck × ♂ck crosses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Exposure of 4<sup>th</sup> instar nymphs to the LC<sub>15</sub> and LC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of EB in contact bioassays also significantly stimulated fecundity. After treatment with the LC<sub>15</sub> and LC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of EB, the number of eggs laid by per female of BPH in ♀t × ♂t crosses increased by 1.18 and 1.26 times compared with the control (♀ck × ♂ck) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>); The number of eggs laid per female of BPH in ♀t × ♂ck crosses increased by 1.27 and 1.56 times compared with the control crosses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>); However, there was no significant difference in number of eggs laid between ♀ck × ♂t crosses and controls (♀ck × ♂ck) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). These results reveal that EB stimulates the fecundity of females following both the systemic and contact routes of exposure.</p>
<p>Next, we examined whether EB treatment of adult BPHs also stimulates reproduction. Indeed, treating newly emerged adults with the LD<sub>15</sub> and LD<sub>50</sub> concentrations of EB significantly stimulated the number of eggs laid per female (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, sub-lethal exposure of 4<sup>th</sup> instar BPH nymphs to another GluCl allosteric modulator, abamectin (LC<sub>15</sub> and LC<sub>50</sub> concentrations) was also found to significantly enhance reproduction (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine if EB also stimulates egg-laying in other insect species we conducted bioassays on the small brown planthopper, <italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic>, the white backed planthopper, <italic>Sogatella furcifera</italic> and fruit flies <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.

In addition, we found that sublethal doses (LC<sub>15</sub>, LC<sub>30</sub> or LC<sub>50</sub>) of EB also inhibit fecundity in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure1-figure supplement 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). These results indicate that the stimulation of reproduction by EB in BPH is species-specific and does not even extend to related insect species.</p>

<p>To better understand the effects of EB on the reproductive fitness of BPH, the duration of the preoviposition period, emergence rate, female ratio, female longevity and female weight were evaluated following exposure using the systemic bioassay. The preoviposition period of females treated with the LC<sub>50</sub> of EB decreased significantly compared with the control (<xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3A</xref>). In contrast no significant effects of EB on emergence rate and female ratio were observed (<xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Female survival analysis showed that exposure of 4<sup>th</sup> instar nymphs to the LC<sub>50</sub> of EB has no impact on female longevity (<xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3D</xref>). Interestingly, occurrence of brachypterism (short-wing phenotype) in females and female weight were significantly increased after EB exposure (<xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). It was reported that short-winged females usually display higher fecundity than long-winged females in BPHs and two different insulin receptors determine the alternative wing morphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). However, whether insulin signaling is involved in the fecundity increase of BPHs in our experiments needs further investigation.</p>

<title>EB promotes ovarian maturation in BPH</title>
<p>To investigate the cause of increased egg-laying following EB exposure we examined if EB influences ovarian maturation in BPH. We dissected and compared the ovaries of females treated with the LC<sub>50</sub> of EB at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after eclosion (DAE) with control females. At 3, 5 and 7 DAE, the number of eggs in the ovary of BPH in the EB treated group were significantly higher than that of controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). We also observed that EB treatment of female adults also increases the number of mature eggs in the ovary (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, we found that EB does not affect normal egg developmental stages. However, our results suggest that EB treatment can promote oogenesis and as a result the insects both produce more eggs in the ovary and more eggs were laid.</p>

<p>Unlike the model insect <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, studies on oogenesis in the BPH are relatively limited. Therefore, we used immunohistochemistry to stain eggs at different stages of BPH development. We captured images with a laser confocal microscope, to document each stage of oogenesis in this species. We found that oogenesis in the BPH differs from that in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and belongs to the telotrophic meroistic type, where the oocyte is connected to nutrient-providing cells in the anterior trophic region of the ovariole through a nutritive cord. Oogenesis in the BPHs occurs in three main compartments (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>):
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Terminal Filament (TF): This region, composed of terminal filament cells, is similar to the terminal filament structure found in Drosophila.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Germarium: This region is where germline stem cells (GSCs) differentiate into oocytes and follicle cells. It typically consists of cap cells adjacent to the terminal filament, germline stem cells, escort cells, and cystoblasts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Egg Chamber: The egg chamber in the BPH primarily contains eggs at six developmental stages. The distinct layering of follicle cells, visible through cytoskeletal staining, is the main feature distinguishing the six different developmental stages listed in the figure legend (see also <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>We next explored whether EB treatment could enhance or impair oogenesis in BPH. However, dissection of various developmental stages revealed that emamectin benzoate treatment has no significant negative effects on developmental stages and morphology of oogenesis in BPH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Considering the number of eggs laid by EB treated females was larger than in control females (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>), our data indicated that EB treatment of BPHs can both promote oogenesis and fecundity (egg-laying) in BPHs.</p>

<p>Stage 1: Connected to the germarium, the egg is trapezoidal. Stage 2: The egg is larger than in Stage 1 and is square to rectangular. Stage 3: The egg begins to elongate toward both poles, taking on an oval shape. Stage 4: The egg continues to enlarge and elongate, becoming spindle-shaped. Due to rapid growth, follicle cells on the egg surface start dividing, indicating nuclear division. Stage 5: The egg further enlarges, and most follicle cells display binucleation, the most notable feature of this stage. Small amounts of lipids start entering the egg. Stage 5 is the final stage before maturation, after which the egg enters the pedicel, a structure primarily formed by muscle fibers. The expanded mature egg stretches the muscle fibers in the pedicel, increasing the spacing between them. Stage 6: This is the mature egg stage, which occurs after the egg passes through the pedicel. During this stage, the egg undergoes rapid growth, continuously absorbing vitellogenin and lipids (Nile red staining confirmed that Stage 6 has the highest lipid content). This absorption causes the egg’s surface color to transition from the transparency seen in Stage 5 to mature eggs’ dark, opaque appearance. Once the egg enters the pedicel and becomes completely opaque, it reaches full maturity. The mature egg then moves into the lateral oviduct for oviposition, completing the egg-laying process.</p>

<title>EB exposure increases circulating sugars and the storage of macromolecules in BPHs</title>
<p>Nutritional status is an important indicator of reproductive fitness. Thus, to investigate whether EB affects intermediary metabolism and energy storage of BPHs, glycogen, triacylglyceride (TAG), total protein content, cholesterol and four circulating carbohydrates were quantified in 4<sup>th</sup> instar BPH nymphs following exposure to the LC<sub>50</sub> of EB.</p>
<p>We found that EB exposure has no impact on glycogen levels (<xref rid="fig2s2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2A</xref>). The amount of TAG in EB-treated BPHs was 27% higher (p &lt; 0.05) than those in controls, but only in BPH of the late fifth instar (5L) stage, with no significant differences observed in subsequent developmental stages (<xref rid="fig2s2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2B</xref>). The amount of total protein content in EB-treated BPH was higher than the control groups in the case of all developmental stages from 5L nymph to 7DAE (<xref rid="fig2s2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2C</xref>). EB exposure also increased cholesterol levels at 4 and 5 DAE (<xref rid="fig2s2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2D</xref>). Compared with the solvent control, EB treatment caused significant increases (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the levels of sucrose, glucose, fructose, and trehalose (<xref rid="fig2s2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2E-H</xref>). Thus, collectively, these data provide evidence that EB exposure leads to energy mobilization and the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids in BPHs.</p>

<title>EB stimulates egg-laying that is mediated by the JH signaling pathway</title>
<p>Given the important role of juvenile hormone (JH) in vitellogenesis and egg development in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jing et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ling and Raikhel, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Luo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Santos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>), we asked whether EB-treatment could influence the titer of JH in BPH. As measured by ELISA, the juvenile hormone titer of BPH nymphs treated with the LC<sub>50</sub> concentration of EB was significantly lower than that of controls in systemic bioassays during the middle and late stages of the 4<sup>th</sup> instar (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). However, at 2, 3 and 4 DAE, the JH titer in the EB treated group was significantly higher than that of the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, the titer of another important insect hormone, the steroid ecdysone, was not significantly different between EB-treated BPH and solvent-treated controls (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>). To independently validate the results of ELISA assays, we employed HPLC-MS/MS to measure JH titer in BPH following EB exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bownes and Rembold, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jing et al., 2021</xref>).

<p>To further investigate the role of JH in EB-enhanced fecundity in BPHs, we treated BPHs with methoprene and pyriproxyfen, JH analogues or biologically active JH mimic respectively, to determine whether they can stimulate fecundity in BPH. Both compounds significantly increased egg-laying in BPHs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together these results reveal that EB stimulates an increase in JH titer and that JH signaling enhances fecundity in BPHs.</p>
<p>Since we found that EB could induce JH synthesis in the BPH, we asked whether EB could influence the expression of genes that are involved in JH biosynthesis or degradation. For this we treated 4<sup>th</sup> instar nymphs or newly emerged female adults of BPHs with the LC<sub>50</sub> concentration of EB using systemic bioassay, and then collected early (5E), middle (5M) and late (5L) stage of 5<sup>th</sup> instar nymph and 1-7 DAE female adults for analysis. Quantitative PCR was then used to examine the expression of key genes previously implicated in the regulation of JH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gospocic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nouzova et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase (FAMeT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), is known as an important enzyme in the JH biosynthetic pathway, catalyzing methylation of farnesoic acid (FA) to methyl farnesoate (MF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nouzova et al., 2018</xref>). We found that this gene was significantly upregulated in 5M instar nymph to 4 DAE after EB-treatment (1.0-fold to 3.0-fold) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase (JHAMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nouzova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shinoda and Itoyama, 2003</xref>), which is involved in the biosynthesis of JH, was also upregulated in EB-treated BPH at 1 to 5 DAE compared to controls (1.5-fold to 3.0-fold) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). We furthermore found that EB treatment in female adults stimulates JHAMT expression (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Methoprene-tolerant (Met), belongs to the basic helix–loop–helix Per/Arnt/Sim (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors and is the intracellular (nuclear) receptor of JH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Riddiford, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). The levels of <italic>met</italic> mRNA increased in EB-treated BPH at the 5M and 5L instar nymph and 1 to 5 DAE adult stages compared to controls (1.7-fold to 2.9-fold) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).</p>
<p>Krüppel homolog 1 (<italic>Kr-h1</italic>), a transcriptional target of JH signaling, is reported to be sensitive to levels of JH and its expression levels are directly correlated with JH titers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gospocic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jindra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>). We found that <italic>Kr-h1</italic> was significantly upregulated in the adults of EB-treated BPH at the 5M, 5L nymph and 4 to 5 DAE stages (4.7-fold to 27.2-fold) when 4<sup>th</sup> instar nymph and female adults were treated with EB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, the expression levels of vitellogenin (Vg), a key downstream component of JH signaling triggering ovarian development in insects including BPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shen et al., 2019</xref>), was markedly increased in females at 2–5 DAE by EB (1.7-fold to 5.5-fold) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). During the maturation process, eggs require uptake of vg, and an increase in vg content can accelerate egg maturation, producing more mature eggs. Our molecular data suggest that EB treatment leads to an upregulation of <italic>vg</italic> expression. Based on these findings, we conclude that the increase in egg-laying caused by EB treatment is due to the upregulation of <italic>vg</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>), which raises Vg content, promoting the uptake of Vg by maturing eggs and resulting in the production of more mature eggs.</p>
<p>Juvenile hormone esterase (JHE) is the primary JH-specific degradation enzyme that plays a key role in regulating JH titers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kamita et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a significant upregulation of JHE mRNA levels in the early and middle 5<sup>th</sup> instar nymph stage followed by downregulation in 5L instar nymphs of EB-treated BPH (1.3-fold to 2.6-fold) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>).</p>
<p>In combination these results reveal that EB has a profound impact on the expression of key genes involved in the biosynthesis of JH or in downstream signaling pathway genes that might promote egg development and female fecundity.</p>
<p>To further understand whether these JH pathway-related genes were involved in egg-laying behavior in BPH, we performed RNAi experiments to downregulate the expression of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2A</xref>). We found that silencing of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> diminished <italic>vg</italic> gene expression (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2B</xref>). Importantly, diminishment of <italic>JHAMT</italic>, <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Kr-h1</italic> genes in female BPHs was also found to suppress egg-laying (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K-M</xref>). However, this phenotype was rescued by EB treatment, which restored egg-laying to normal levels in BPH injected with <italic>JHAMT</italic>, <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Kr-h1</italic> dsRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K-M</xref>). Note that this rescue is possible since knockdown of the genes is incomplete when using dsRNA injection (and residual gene expression allows for EB action). Together these results provide a mechanistic understanding of how EB enhances fecundity in BPH by modulating the expression of key genes involved in JH synthesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N</xref>).</p>

Interestingly, the allatostatic activity of these three types of Ast peptides varies between insect species so that in each species only one type of Ast (for example AstA) controls JH production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nässel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Stay and Tobe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wegener and Chen, 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>Quantitative PCR was then used to examine if EB treatment could influence the expression of the genes encoding these neuropeptides and their receptors.

However, <italic>JHE</italic> was not influenced by AstAR silencing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>).

<p>Finally, we investigated whether injection of mature Ast and AT peptides could influence the number of eggs laid and JH titer in BPH. We synthesized one AT, six AstAs (AstA1 to AstA6), one AstCC and one AstCCC peptide according to their determined sequences (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, we found that injection of AstA1 and AstA6 in female adults reduced the number of eggs laid per female over 48 h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). We also observed that AstA1 injection decreased the JH titer as measured 16h and 48h after injection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>), and AT injection increased the JH titer after 2h, but levels returned to normal 4h after injection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>).

<title>EB-enhanced fecundity in BPHs is dependent on its molecular target protein, the GluCl channel</title>
<p>EB and abamectin, are allosteric modulators, which target glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sparks et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sparks et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, we examined whether EB-stimulated fecundity in BPH is mediated by its molecular target GluCl. The full length <italic>GluCl</italic> coding sequence from BPH was cloned and sequenced (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>) and the impact of EB on <italic>GluCl</italic> gene expression examined using quantitative PCR. Treatment of BPH with the LC<sub>50</sub> concentration of EB significantly downregulated <italic>GluCl</italic> gene expression at the 5E and 5M nymph stages, while upregulating <italic>GluCl</italic> gene expression at 2 DAE and 5 DAE in the adult stage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We also found that EB treatment in female adults also increases the <italic>GluCl</italic> gene expression (<xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 3</xref>). To examine the role of <italic>GluCl</italic> gene in BPH fecundity, RNAi was used to knockdown expression of this gene in female adult BPH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). A significant decrease in the number of eggs laid by per female was observed in <italic>dsGluCl</italic>-injected insects compared with <italic>dsgfp</italic>-injected insects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). However, treatment with EB was found to rescue the decreased egg-laying phenotype induced by <italic>dsGluCl</italic> injection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Note that this rescue is possible since knockdown of the genes is incomplete when using dsRNA injection (and residual gene expression allows for EB action).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pesticide-induced resurgence of pest insects is a serious problem in rice and several other crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanisms underpinning pesticide-enhanced reproduction in insects remain poorly understood. Here we reveal that a suite of molecular actors underlie this trait that, in combination, mediate profound physiological changes in the reproductive fitness of female BPHs. Our data provide fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms by which xenobiotics modify insect reproduction and have applied implications for the control of a highly damaging crop pest. We discuss these topics below.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Sublethal doses of the GluCl modulators, EB and abamectin, stimulates fecundity in BPH</title>
<p>We show that in both contact and systemic assays the avermectins EB and abamectin stimulate reproduction in BPHs. Thus, insecticide-enhanced reproduction is likely a key factor in the BPH resurgence observed when farmers use EB and abamectin to control leaffolders in rice crops in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). Although this is the first report of sublethal doses of avermectins enhancing insect fecundity, our findings are consistent with previous studies, which have shown that certain insecticides, herbicides and fungicides stimulate BPH reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, we show that EB only induces fecundity in female adults and is specific to BPH, with EB exposure failing to enhance reproduction in two related species, the small brown planthopper, <italic>L. striatellus</italic> and the white backed planthopper, <italic>S. furcifera</italic>, or the model insect <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Thus, the mechanisms underpinning this trait appear to act exclusively on female BPHs and may be specific to this species. Nevertheless, our findings are of general interest since they link the molecular EB target, the GluCl channel and juvenile hormone signaling to fecundity.</p>
<p>Pesticides may stimulate insect reproduction through a variety of physiological and molecular mechanisms. Our data reveal that exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of EB results in profound changes to female BPH fitness, leading to increases in female weight, contents of total protein, cholesterol, and sugar, as well as egg production and decreases in duration of the preoviposition period. Some of these findings exhibit parallels with previous studies, which demonstrated that treating third-instar BPH nymphs with either deltamethrin, triazophos, or imidacloprid led to increased soluble sugar levels in the corresponding adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Yin et al., 2014</xref>). Such metabolites provide the energy that drives BPH reproduction and hence resurgence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, together with prior work, our results suggest that pesticides associated with resurgence stimulate nutritional intake in BPH to fuel enhanced energy-intensive reproduction.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>The JH signaling pathway plays an essential role in EB-induced fecundity in BPH</title>
<p>JH is a pleiotropic hormone which plays important roles in development and reproduction in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Riddiford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Santos et al., 2019</xref>). Circulating JH titers are regulated by factors that control JH production in the corpora allata including biosynthetic enzymes and catabolic enzymes that regulate JH levels. Our results show that EB increases circulating JH III titers in BPH females over 2–4 days after eclosion (DAE) and promotes ovarian development. Previous studies have reported that triazophos and deltamethrin treatments also lead to increased circulating JH III titers in BPH females over 1–3 days post emergence. Similarly, jinggangmycin treatments were found to lead to increased JH titers (by approximately 45–50%) in BPH females over two days post emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, our findings, in combination with these previous studies, demonstrate that insecticide treatments can have dramatic effects on the regulation of key insect hormones involved in pest reproduction, which can in turn drive pesticide resurgence.</p>
<p>Although increased JH titers following pesticide exposure have been correlated with reduced levels of active JH esterase during the first three days PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ge et al., 2010</xref>), the type and number of mechanisms mediating the observed increase in hormone titer has remained an open question. Our data reveal that elevated JH titer in EB-exposed BPH is associated with the upregulation of genes that encode biosynthetic enzymes for JH (<italic>JHAMT</italic>) and downstream signaling genes that can induce <italic>vg</italic> gene expression (<italic>kr-h1</italic>). Using RNAi we provide functional evidence of the role of these genes in the regulation of JH III and fecundity of female BPHs, and demonstrate that EB can restore the reduction in egg production resulting from the knockdown of <italic>JHAMT</italic>, <italic>met</italic> and <italic>kr-h1</italic> expression.</p>
<p>JHMAT is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of inactive precursors of JH to active JH in the final stages of JH biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nouzova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shinoda and Itoyama, 2003</xref>). Interestingly, while it has not been previously implicated in pesticide resurgence, treatment of the stored product pest <italic>Sitotroga cerealella</italic> with diallyl trisulfide, an insecticidal compound in garlic essential oil, was found to increase JHAMT mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shah et al., 2022</xref>). Because JHMAT is the key rate-limiting enzyme in regulation of JH titer our results suggest that its enhanced expression is a key molecular mechanism of pesticide resurgence in BPH.</p>
<p>Met is a ligand-activated member of the basic helix–loop–helix Per/Arnt/Sim (bHLH-PAS) transcription factors and is the intracellular receptor for JH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Riddiford, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Kr-h1 is a zinc finger protein that acts downstream of Met and is expressed in response to JH signaling. Although the genes encoding these proteins have not been previously linked to pesticide resurgence, our finding that they are upregulated following EB exposure, and demonstration of their role of in promoting fecundity, is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Santos et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, treatment of BPH with JH III or the insecticidal analogs methoprene or pyriproxifen was found to induce the expression of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jin et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Kr-h1</italic> in BPH brachypterous females was found to result in delayed ovariole maturation and this was significantly more pronounced than the response observed in BPH treated separately with ds<italic>NlMet</italic> or ds<italic>NlKr-h1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). This finding provides evidence of a possible interaction between <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Kr-h1</italic> and, in combination with our data, suggests that <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Kr-h1</italic> may act in concert to mediate EB-enhanced fecundity. However, our results showed that EB treatment can mildly increase (about 2-fold) expression of the <italic>Met</italic> gene in brown planthoppers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Our data furthermore indicated that <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>FAMeT</italic> expression levels were not drastically influenced by EB compared with <italic>kr-h1</italic> and <italic>vg</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). It should be mentioned that JH action does not directly result in the increase of <italic>Met</italic>. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of other factors (indirect effects), induced by EB treatment, increases the mRNA expression level of <italic>Met</italic>. One recent paper reported that downregulation of transcription factor <italic>CncC</italic> will increase <italic>met</italic> expression in beetles (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> in the reference) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jiang et al., 2023</xref>). And many studies have reported that insecticide treatment activates the <italic>CncC</italic> gene signaling pathway, which regulates detoxification gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amezian et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hu et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, it is possible that EB might influence the <italic>CncC</italic> gene pathway, which in turn induces <italic>met</italic> expression. This EB effect on <italic>met</italic> upregulation may be similar to the upregulation of <italic>GluCl</italic> and some other secondary effects (see below).</p>

This transcriptome reprograming is dependent on the action of EB on its molecular target the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) receptor. The resulting increased JH titer promotes vg synthesis and increased fecundity in EB exposed insects. We observe significant cross-talk in the expression of genes that inhibit JH production and those that promote it, with <italic>AstAR</italic> inhibiting the expression of <italic>JHAMT, Met</italic> and <italic>Kr-h1</italic> and <italic>GluCl</italic> activating the expression of <italic>JHAMT</italic> which is responsible for JH synthesis, and the JH signalling downstream genes <italic>Met and Kr-h1</italic>.</p></caption>

<p>It must be mentioned that although we exposed the BPH to EB at 4th instar, we make the insect feed on the EB-treated rice plants for four days. After that, the insect will develop into 5th instar, the final nymphal stage of brown planthopper. Since BPH do not have a pupal stage, this might cause the EB presented to the insects last a longer time even in the adult stage. Besides this, we found that EB treatment will increase the weight of adult females, which indicates that EB might increase food intake in BPHs that might produce more insulin peptide. Hence, insulin might increase the JH synthesis at the adult stage.</p>

These include the allatostatins: FGLamides (FGLa; AstA), the W(X)6Wamides (AstB), and the PISCFs (AstC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nässel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Stay et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Stay and Tobe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wegener and Chen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, our results showed that EB exposure results in a marked downregulation of the expression of the genes encoding allatostatin <italic>AstA</italic> and its receptor <italic>AstAR</italic>. We provide evidence for the functional impact of this on JH synthesis and BPH fecundity by: i) demonstrating that RNAi knockdown of <italic>AstAR</italic> expression results in increased JH titer and enhanced egg production, and, ii) showing that injection of female BPH with synthetic <underline>AstA</underline> peptide reduces JH titer and decreases egg production. Thus, our data provide unequivocal evidence that AstA is a key inhibitor of JH production in BPH. This finding is consistent with previous work which has shown that FGLa/ASTs (AstA) inhibit JH biosynthesis in cockroaches, and termites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Woodhead et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yagi et al., 2005</xref>). To our knowledge, our study is the first report of insecticides down-regulating the expression of the neuropeptide receptor, <italic>AstAR</italic>, and linking this to increases in JH titer and enhanced reproduction in insects.</p>
<p>Interestingly knockdown of <italic>AstAR</italic> resulted in significant increases in the expression of genes involved in JH synthesis/signaling including <italic>JHAMT</italic>, <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Kr-h1</italic>. Related to this finding, previous work has shown that knockdown of the AstA receptor gene, <italic>Dar-2</italic>, in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> results in changes in the expression of genes encoding <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptides (DILPs) and adipokinetic hormone (AKH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hentze et al., 2015</xref>). Together with our findings, this demonstrates that AstA receptors may modulate the expression of numerous downstream genes involves in metabolism, energy store and reproduction. In the case of pesticide resurgence our results imply significant cross-talk in the expression of genes that inhibit JH production and those that promote it.</p>

<title>The GluCl plays an essential role in EB-induced fecundity in BPH</title>
<p>EB and abamectin are allosteric modulators of GluCls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sparks et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sparks et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Our data revealed that EB exposure increases the expression of the GluCl in adult stage of BPH, and knockdown of GluCl expression resulted in a reduction in both JH levels and egg production and egg laying. There are several studies showing that insects treated with insecticides display increases in the expression of target genes. For example, the relative expression level of the ryanodine receptor gene of the rice stem borer, <italic>Chilo suppressalis</italic> was increased 10-fold after treatment with chlorantraniliprole, an insecticide which targets the ryanodine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Peng et al., 2017</xref>). Besides this, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, starvation (and low insulin) elevates the transcription level of the short neuropeptide F and tachykinin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Root et al., 2011</xref>). In BPHs, reduction in mRNA and protein expression of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α8 subunit is associated with resistance to imidacloprid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). RNA interference knockdown of the α8 gene decreased the sensitivity of <italic>N. lugens</italic> to imidacloprid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, expression of receptor genes may be regulated by diverse factors, including insecticide treatment. In our case, we found that EB upregulates its target gene <italic>GluCl</italic>. However, we do not suggest that EB functions as transcriptional activator of <italic>GluCl</italic> and we have no data to suggest a mechanism for how EB treatment changes the expression of <italic>GluCl</italic> in the BPH. Considering that EB exposure in our experiments is lasting several days, it might be an indirect (or secondary) effect caused by other factors downstream GluCl that affect channel expression Possibly the allosteric interaction with GluCl by EB renders the channel dysfunctional and the cellular response is to upregulate the channel/receptor to compensate.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the GluCl has been reported to inhibit the biosynthesis of JH in the cockroach, <italic>Diploptera punctata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). Recent work has also reported that modulation of glutamatergic signals may contribute to the photoperiodic control of reproduction in bean bug, <italic>Riptortus pedestris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hasebe and Shiga, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, work on <italic>D. punctata</italic> has revealed that application of the GluCl channel agonist ivermectin, which like EB belongs to the avermectin family, caused a decline in JH synthesis in the corpus allatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). While the inhibitory effect of ivermectin observed in this previous study differs from the activating effect of EB we observed in our study, it is consistent with our finding of a role for the GluCl channel in the regulation of JH regulation. Interestingly, we found that knockdown of the <italic>GluCl</italic> gene expression results in the down-regulation of <italic>JHAMT</italic>, <italic>Met and Kr-h1</italic>, further revealing significant convergent relationships between genes underpinning pesticide resurgence.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study has revealed that exposure of BPHs to EB affects a diverse suite of genes that act in combination to enhance JH titer and thus increase female fecundity. A schematic of how these factors promote ovarian maturation in the adult stage of <italic>N. lugens</italic> through the AstA and JH signaling pathway is provided in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>. Our findings provide the foundation for further work to understand how these genes interact and the mechanisms by which their expression is activated or repressed by EB. Furthermore, our findings provide fundamental insights into the molecular response in insects to xenobiotic stress and illustrate that pesticides can have unexpected and negative impacts on pest populations. In this regard our findings also have applied implications for the control of a highly damaging crop pest. Previous studies have reported that avermectins such as abamectin are toxic to the wolf spider <italic>Pardosa pseudoannulata</italic>, which is the main predator of BPH in rice crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sogawa, 2015</xref>). Thus, these insecticides both stimulate reproduction in BPH while killing their natural enemies providing a ‘perfect storm’ for inducing damaging BPH outbreaks. Based on these findings, to avoid BPH resurgence, we suggest that the agents, EB and abamectin, should not be (or rarely be) applied to rice plants at growth stages when BPHs are present. On a more optimistic note, our findings have identified numerous genes that play key roles in BPH reproduction and thus represent promising targets for the development of novel controls against this important pest.</p>

<title>Bioassay</title>
<p>Different life stages of insects were used to perform bioassay to investigate the effects of insecticide on nymphs and adults. To test whether treatment of the nymph stage of insects would promote reproduction in female, we used 4<sup>th</sup> instar nymphs of BPH or 3<sup>rd</sup> instar nymph of <italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic> and <italic>Sogatella furcifera</italic> to perform bioassays. To test whether treatment of the adult stage of insects would promote reproduction in female, we used newly emerged male and female BPH.</p>
<sec id="s5c1">
<title>Systemic route</title>
<p>The rice-seeding dipping bioassay method was used to evaluate the susceptibility of BPH, <italic>L. striatellus</italic> and <italic>S. furcifera</italic> to EB. Technical-grade insecticides were dissolved in acetone as stock solution then diluted in a series of six concentrations with water containing 0.1% Triton. Selected rice seedlings at the 6-8 cm growth stage were dipped in insecticide solutions for 30 s and then air-dried at room temperature. The roots of the rice seedlings were wrapped with cotton strips and placed seedlings placed in a plastic cup 5 cm in diameter. Fifteen insects were introduced into each plastic cup for each replicate. The top of the cup was then selaed with gauze to prevent escape. All experiments comprised at least three biological replicates. Control rice seedings were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 water solution only. All treatments were maintained under standard conditions of 27 ± 1 °C and 70–80% relative humidity with a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod. Mortality was assessed after 4 d for <italic>N. lugens</italic> or 2 d for <italic>L. striatellus</italic> and <italic>S. furcifera</italic> after treatment with insecticides. The insects were considered dead if they were unable to move after a gentle prodding with a fine brush.</p>
<p>For <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae bioassay, we adopted a method described previously in our lab with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, twenty third instar larvae were placed in fly vials containing fly food (based on corn powder, brown sugar, yeast and agar) supplemented with EB of different concentrations. Four concentrations (LC<sub>10</sub>, LC<sub>30</sub> and LC<sub>50</sub>) were tested together with a negative (no insecticide) control. For <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult bioassays, we selected virgin females three days after eclosion. Several concentrations were overlaid onto fly food in standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> vials and allowed to dry overnight at room temperature. 15 adult flies (three days after eclosion) were then added to each vial and mortality assessed after 2 d. Four replicates were carried out for each concentration. Control mortality was assessed using vials containing food with solvent minus insecticide.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Gao et al. has demonstrated that the the pesticide emamectin benzoate (EB) treatment of brown plathopper (BPH) leads to increased egg laying in the insect, which is a common agricultural pest. The authors hypothesize that EB upregulates JH titer resulting in increased fecundity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The finding that a class of pesticide increases fecundity of brown planthopper is interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) EB is an allosteric modulator of GluCl. That means it EB physically interacts with GluCl initiating a structural change in the cannel protein. Yet the authors here central hypothesis is about how EB can upregulate the mRNA of GluCl. I do not know whether there is any evidence that an allosteric modulator can function as a transcriptional activator for the same receptor protein. The basic premise of the paper sounds counterintuitive. This is a structural problem and should be addressed by the authors by giving sufficient evidence about such demonstrated mechanisms before.</p>
<p>
(2) I am surprised to see a 4th instar larval application or treatment with EB results in upregulation of JH in the adult stages. Complicating the results further is the observation that a 4th instar EB application results in an immediate decrease in JH titer. There is a high possibility that this late JH titer increase is an indirect effect.</p>
<p>
(3) The writing quality of the paper needs improvement. Particularly with respect to describing processes, and abbreviations. In several instances authors have not adequately described the processes they have introduced, thus confusing the readers.</p>
<p>
(4) In the section 'EB promotes ovarian development' the authors have shown that EB treatment results in increased detention of eggs which contradicts their own results which show that EB promotes egg laying. Again, this is a serious contradiction that nullifies their hypothesis.</p>
<p>
(5) Furthermore, the results suggest that oogenesis is not affected by EB application. The authors should devote a section to discussing how they are observing increased egg numbers in EB-treated insects while not impacting Oogenesis.</p>
<p>
(6) Met is the receptor of JH and to my understanding, remains mostly constant in terms of its mRNA or protein levels throughout various developmental periods in many different insects. Therefore, the presence of JH becomes the major driving factor for physiological events and not the presence of the receptor Met. Here the authors have demonstrated an increase in Met mRNA as a result of EB treatment. Their central hypothesis is that EB increases JH titer to result in enhanced fecundity. JH action will not result in the activation of Met. Although not contradictory to the hypothesis, the increase in mRNA content of Met is contrary to the findings of the JH field thus far.</p>
<p>
(7) As pointed out before, it is hard to rationalize how a 4th instar exposure to EB can result in upregulation of key genes involved in JH synthesis at the adult stage. The authors must consider providing a plausible explanation and discussion in this regard.</p>
<p>
(8) I have strong reservations against such an irrational hypothesis that Met (the receptor for JH) and JH-Met target gene Kr-h1 regulates JH titer (Line 311, Fig 3 supplemental 2D). This would be the first report of such an event on the JH field and therefore must be analysed to depth before it may go to publication. I strongly suggest the authors remove such claims from the manuscript without substantiating it.</p>
<p>
(9) Kr-h1 is JH/Met target gene. The authors demonstrate that silencing of Kr-h1 results in inhibition of FAMeT, which is a gene involved in JH synthesis. The feedback loop in JH synthesis is unreported. Authors must go ahead with a mechanistic detail of Kr-h1 mediated JH upregulation before this can be concluded. Mere qPCR experiments are not sufficient to substantiate a claim that is completely contrary to the current understanding of JH signalling pathway.</p>
<p>
(10) Authors have performed knockdowns of JHAMT, Met and Kr-h1 to demonstrate the effect of these factors on fecundity n BPH. Additionally, they have performed rescue experiments with EB application on these knockdown insects (Figure 3K-M). This I believe is a very flawed experiment. The authors demonstrate EB works through JHAMT in upregulating JH titer. In the absence of JHAMT, EB application is not expected to rescue the phenotype. But authors have reported a complete rescue here. In the absence of Met, the receptor of JH, either EB or JH is not expected to rescue the phenotype. But a complete rescue has been reported. These two experimental results contradict their own hypothesis.</p>
<p>
(11) A significant section of the paper deals with how EB upregulates JH titer. JH is a hormone synthesized in the Corpora Allata. Yet the authors have chosen to use the whole body for all of their experiments. Changes in the whole body for mRNA of those enzymes involved in JH synthesis does may not reflect on the situation in Corpora Allata. Although working with corpora Allata is challenging, discarding the abdomen and thorax region and working with the head and neck region of the insect is easily doable. Results from such sampling is always more convincing when it comes to JH synthesis studies.</p>
<p>
(12) The phenomenon reported was specific for BPH and not found in other insects. This limits the implications of the study.</p>
<p>
(13) Overall, the molecular experiments are very poorly designed and can at best be termed superficial. There are several contradictions within the paper and no discussion or explanation has been provided for that.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>(1) The onus of making the revisions understandable to the reviewers lies with the authors. In its current form, how the authors have approached the review is hard to follow, in my opinion. Although the authors have taken a lot of effort in answering the questions posed by reviewers, parallel changes in the manuscript are not clearly mentioned. In many cases, the authors have acknowledged the criticism in response to the reviewer, but have not changed their narrative, particularly in the results section.</p>
<p>
(2) In the response to reviewers, the authors have mentioned line numbers in the main text where changes were made. But very frequently, those lines do not refer to the changes or mention just a subsection of changes done. The problem is throughout the document making it very difficult to follow the revision and contributing to the point mentioned above.</p>
<p>
(3) The authors need to infer the performed experiments rationally without over interpretation. Currently, many of the claims that the authors are making are unsubstantiated. As a result of the first review process, the authors have acknowledged the discrepancies, but they have failed to alter their interpretations accordingly.</p>
<p>
(4) I would like to point to the fact that there are significant experimental modifications added to the manuscript. The decision from the first cycle of review was given on 8th Nov 2024. The authors re-submitted the manuscript on 20th Nov 2024. It just beats my understanding, how so many experiments can be done in such a short time. The rush in resubmission is evident in the writing quality as well. Which I think is now poorer than the original version.</p>
<p>
(5) The writing quality is still extremely poor.</p>

<p>We greatly appreciate your valuable comments and constructive suggestions for our work. All in all, the manuscript has been carefully edited and improved following your suggestions. We also provide more evidence to support our statements by conducting new experiments. First, we found that also EB treatment of adult females can stimulate egg-laying. Second, EB treatment in female adults increases the number of mature eggs in the ovary and ovarioles. Third, EB treatment in females enhances the expression of the <italic>kr-h1</italic> gene in the whole body of BPH. Finally, EB treatment in female adults increases the JHIII titer, but has no impact on the 20E titer.</p>

<p>Thank you for your question. As the reviewer points out, EB physically interacts with its target protein GluCl and thus affects its downstream signaling pathway. In the manuscript, we reported that EB-treated brown planthoppers display increased expression of GluCl in the adult stage (Fig. 5A). Actually, there are many studies showing that insects treated with insecticides can increase the expression of target genes. For example, the relative expression level of the ryanodine receptor gene of the rice stem borer, <italic>Chilo suppressalis</italic> was increased 10-fold after treatment with chlorantraniliprole, an insecticide which targets the ryanodine receptor (Peng et al., 2017). Besides this, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, starvation (and low insulin) elevates the transcription level of the sNPF and tachykinin receptors (Ko et al., 2015; Root et al., 2011). In brown planthoppers, reduction in mRNA and protein expression of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α8 subunit is associated with resistance to imidacloprid (Zhang et al., 2015). RNA interference knockdown of α8 gene decreased the sensitivity of <italic>N. lugens</italic> to imidacloprid (Zhang et al., 2015). Hence, expression of receptor genes can be regulated by diverse factors including insecticide treatment. In our case, we found that EB can upregulate its target gene <italic>GluCl</italic>. However, we did not claim that EB functions as transcriptional activator for GluCl, and we still do not know why EB treatment changes the expression of GluCl in the brown planthopper. Considering our experiments are lasting several days, it might be an indirect (or secondary) effect caused by other factors, which change the expression of <italic>GluCl</italic> gene upon EB action of the channel. One reason is maybe that the allosteric interaction with GluCl by EB makes it dysfunctional and the cellular response is to upregulate the channel/receptor to compensate. We have inserted text on lines 738 - 757 to explain these possibilities.</p>

<p>Thank you for your question. Treatment with low doses or sublethal doses of insecticides might have a strong and complex impact on insects (Gandara et al., 2024; Gong et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Martelli et al., 2022). We kept the 4th instar of brown planthoppers feeding on EB for four days. They will develop to 5th instar after four days treatment, which is the final nymphal stage of BPH. Since the brown planthopper is a hemimetabolous insect, we cannot rule out the possibility that an indirect effect of treatment with EB results in the upregulation of JH in the adult stages. In this new revised manuscript, we investigated the impact of EB treatment in the adult stage. We found that female adults treated with EB also laid more eggs than controls (Figure 1-figure supplement 1A). The following experiments were performed in adults to address how EB treated stimulates egg-laying in adult brown planthopper.</p>
<p>(1) We found that EB treatment in adults increases the number of mature eggs in ovary (new Figure 2-figure supplement 1). We add this results in lines 234 – 238 and 281-285.</p>
<p>(2) We measured the JH titer after the female adults had been treated with EB. We found that EB can also increase the JH titer but has no impact on the 20E titer in the female adult (Figure 3-S3A and B). We add this results in lines 351 – 356 and 281-285.</p>
<p>(3) EB treatment in adults increases the gene expression of JHAMT and Kr-h1 (Figure 3-S3C and D). We add this results in lines 378 – 379, lines 387-390 and lines 457-462.</p>

<p>(4) In the section 'EB promotes ovarian development' the authors have shown that EB treatment results in increased detention of eggs which contradicts their own results which show that EB promotes egg laying. Again, this is a serious contradiction that nullifies their hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We revised the figure 2B to show number of mature eggs in the ovary. The number of mature eggs in ovaries of females that fed on EB was higher than in control females. We also show that BPH fed with EB laid more eggs than controls. Thus, our results suggest that EB promotes ovary maturation (and egg production) and also increases egg laying (Figure 1 and Table S1). Thus, we found that EB treatment can increase both the production of eggs and increase egg laying. We add this results in lines 234 – 238.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Furthermore, the results suggest that oogenesis is not affected by EB application. The authors should devote a section to discussing how they are observing increased egg numbers in EB-treated insects while not impacting Oogenesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions, and apologies for the lack of clarity in our initial explanation. First, we found that EB treatment led to an increase in the number of eggs laid by female brown planthoppers (Figure 1). Through dissection experiments, we observed that EB-treated females had more mature eggs in their ovaries (Figure 2A and B), indicating that the increased egg-laying was due to a larger production of mature eggs in the ovaries after EB treatment. This is now explained on lines 229-238.</p>
<p>Additionally, since there is no systematic description of oogenesis in the brown planthopper, we were the first to observe the oogenesis process in this species using immunohistochemistry and laser confocal microscopy. Based on the developmental characteristics, we defined the different stages of oogenesis (Figure 2C, Figure 2-figure supplement 2). We did not observe any significant effect of EB treatment on the various stages of oogenesis, indicating that EB treatment does not impair normal egg development (Figure 2D). Instead, the increase in vitellogenin accelerates the production of mature eggs. This is now explained on lines 243-262.</p>
<p>During the maturation process, eggs require uptake of vitellogenin, and an increase in vitellogenin (Vg) content can accelerate egg maturation, producing more mature eggs. Our molecular data suggest that EB treatment leads to an upregulation of <italic>vg</italic> expression. Based on these findings, we conclude that the increase in egg-laying caused by EB treatment is due to the upregulation of <italic>vg</italic> (Figure 3I), which raises vitellogenin content, promoting the uptake of vitellogenin by maturing eggs and resulting in the production of more mature eggs. We have revised the text on lines 389-395 to clarify this point.</p>

<p>(6) Met is the receptor of JH and to my understanding, remains mostly constant in terms of its mRNA or protein levels throughout various developmental periods in many different insects. Therefore, the presence of JH becomes the major driving factor for physiological events and not the presence of the receptor Met. Here the authors have demonstrated an increase in Met mRNA as a result of EB treatment. Their central hypothesis is that EB increases JH titer to result in enhanced fecundity. JH action will not result in the activation of Met. Although not contradictory to the hypothesis, the increase in mRNA content of Met is contrary to the findings of the JH field thus far.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. Our results showed that EB treatment can mildly increase (about 2-fold) expression of the <italic>Met</italic> gene in brown planthoppers (Figure 3G). And our data indicated that <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>FAMeT</italic> expression levels were not influenced so much by EB compared with <italic>kr-h1</italic> and <italic>vg</italic> (Figure 3H and I). We agree that JH action will not result in the increase of <italic>Met</italic>. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of other factors (indirect effects), induced by EB treatment that increase the mRNA expression level of <italic>Met</italic>. One recent paper reported that downregulation of transcription factor <italic>CncC</italic> will increase <italic>met</italic> expression in beetles (see Figure 6A in this reference) (Jiang et al., 2023). Many studies have reported that insecticide treatment will activate the CncC gene signaling pathway, which regulates detoxification gene expression (Amezian et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2021). Hence, it is possible that EB might influence the <italic>CncC</italic> gene pathway which then induces <italic>met</italic> expression. This EB effect on met upregulation may be similar to the upregulation of GluCl and some other secondary effects. We have discussed this on lines 725-738.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) As pointed out before, it is hard to rationalize how a 4th instar exposure to EB can result in the upregulation of key genes involved in JH synthesis at the adult stage. The authors must consider providing a plausible explanation and discussion in this regard.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. It must be mentioned that although we exposed the BPH to EB at 4th instar, we make the insect feed on the EB-treated rice plants for four days. After that, the insect will develop into 5<sup>th</sup> instar, the final nymphal stage of brown planthopper. Since brown planthoppers do not have a pupal stage, this might cause the EB presented to the insects last a longer time even in the adult stage. Besides this, we found that EB treatment will increase the weight of adult females (Figure 1-figure supplement 3E and F), which indicates that EB might increase food intake in BPHs that might produce more insulin peptide. Insulin might increase the JH synthesis at the adult stage. In our revised study we also investigate EB impairment in adult BPHs. We found that, similar to the nymphal stage, EB treatment in adult BPHs also increases the egg laying. Furthermore, the JH titer was increased after treatment of BPH with EB in adults. Besides this, <italic>GluCl</italic> and <italic>kr-h1</italic> genes were also up-regulated after EB treatment in the adult stage. We have discussed this on lines 739-746.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) I have strong reservations against such an irrational hypothesis that Met (the receptor for JH) and JH-Met target gene Kr-h1 regulate JH titer (Line 311, Fig 3 supplemental 2D). This would be the first report of such an event on the JH field and therefore must be analysed in depth. I strongly suggest the authors remove such claims from the manuscript without substantiating it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions and comments. We have changed our claims in this revised MS. We found that EB treatment can enhance <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression. We have no evidence to support that JH can induce <italic>met</italic> expression. We have rewritten the manuscript to avoid confusion (see text on lines 725-735).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Kr-h1 is JH/Met target gene. The authors demonstrate that silencing of Kr-h1 results in inhibition of FAMeT, which is a gene involved in JH synthesis. A feedback loop in JH synthesis is unreported. It is the view of this reviewer that the authors must go ahead with a mechanistic detail of Kr-h1 mediated JH upregulation before this can be concluded. Mere qPCR experiments are not sufficient to substantiate a claim that is completely contrary to the current understanding of the JH signalling pathway.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions and comments. We agree that only qPCR experiments are not enough to provide this kind of claim. More evidences need to be provided to support this. We have revised the MS to avoid confusion (see text on lines 725-735).</p>

<p>(10) The authors have performed knockdowns of JHAMT, Met, and Kr-h1 to demonstrate the effect of these factors on fecundity in BPH. Additionally, they have performed rescue experiments with EB application on these knockdown insects (Figure 3K-M). This, I believe, is a very flawed experiment. The authors demonstrate EB works through JHAMT in upregulating JH titer. In the absence of JHAMT, EB application is not expected to rescue the phenotype. But the authors have reported a complete rescue here. In the absence of Met, the receptor of JH, either EB or JH is not expected to rescue the phenotype. But a complete rescue has been reported. These two experimental results contradict their own hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. We thought that this rescue is possible since knockdown of the genes is incomplete when using dsRNA injection (and residual gene expression allows for EB action). It is not a total knockout and actually, these genes still have a low level of expression in the dsRNA-injected insects. Since EB can upregulate the expression of JHAMT, Met, and Kr-h1, it is reasonable that EB treatment can rescue the down-regulation effects of these three genes and make fecundity completely rescued. We have clarified this on lines 411-413).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) A significant section of the paper deals with how EB upregulates JH titer. JH is a hormone synthesized in the Corpora Allata. Yet the authors have chosen to use the whole body for all of their experiment. Changes in the whole body for mRNA of those enzymes involved in JH synthesis may not reflect the situation in Corpora Allata. Although working with Corpora Allata is challenging, discarding the abdomen and thorax region and working with the head and neck region of the insect is easily doable. Results from such sampling are always more convincing when it comes to JH synthesis studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions. Because the head is very difficult to separate from the thorax region in brown planthoppers as you can see in Author response image 1. We are now trying to answer how EB regulates JH synthesis using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model.</p>

<p>(12) The phenomenon reported was specific to BPH and not found in other insects. This limits the implications of the study.</p>

<p>Thank you for your comments. The brown planthopper is a serious insect pest on rice in Asia. Our findings can guide the use of this insecticide in the field. Besides this, our findings indicated that EB, which targets GluCl can impair the JH titer. Our findings added new implications for how a neuronal system influences the JH signaling pathway.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The brown plant hopper (BPH) is a notorious crop pest and pesticides are the most widespread means of controlling its population. This manuscript shows that in response to sublethal doses of the pesticide (EB), BPH females show enhanced fecundity. This is in keeping with field reports of population resurgence post-pesticide treatment. The authors work out the mechanism behind this increase in fecundity. They show that in response to EB exposure, the expression of its target receptor, GluCl, increases. This, they show, results in an increase in the expression of genes that regulate the synthesis of juvenile hormone (JH) and JH itself, which, in turn, results in enhanced egg-production and egg-laying. Interestingly, these effects of EB exposure are species-specific, as the authors report that other species of plant hoppers either don't show enhanced fecundity or show reduced fecundity. As the authors point out, it is unclear how an increase in GluCl levels could result in increased JH regulatory genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate your valuable comments and constructive suggestion to our work. We will try to figure out how EB interacts with its molecular target GluCl and then increases JH regulatory genes in the future work using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as models.</p>

<p>It would help the reader to have more schematics along with the figures. The final figure is helpful, but knowing the JH pathway, and where it acts would help with the interpretations as one reads the manuscript and the figures. The pathways represented in 4N or 5J are helpful but could be improved upon for better presentation.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have some discussion on how the authors think EB exposure results in an increase in GluCl expression, and how that in turn affects the expression of so many genes.</p>
