<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The intuitive manipulation of specific amino acids to alter the activity or specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 has been a topic of great interest. As a large multi-domain RNA-guided endonuclease, the intricate molecular crosstalk within the Cas9 protein hinges on its conformational dynamics, but a comprehensive understanding of the extent and timescale of the motions that drive its allosteric function and association with nucleic acids remains elusive. Here, we investigated the structure and multi-timescale molecular motions of the recognition (Rec) lobe of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, a thermophilic Cas9 from <italic>Geobacillus stearothermophilus.</italic> Our results provide new atomic details about the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec subdomains (<italic>Geo</italic>Rec1, <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2) and the full-length domain in solution. Two single-point mutants, K267E and R332A, enhanced and redistributed micro-millisecond flexibility throughout <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, and NMR studies of the interaction between <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and its guide RNA showed that mutations reduced this affinity and the stability of the ribonucleoprotein complex. Despite measured biophysical differences due to the mutations, DNA cleavage assays reveal only modest functional differences in on-target activity, and similar specificity. These data highlight how guide RNA interactions can be tuned in the absence of major functional losses, but also raise questions about the underlying mechanism of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, since analogous single-point mutations have significantly impacted on- and off-target DNA editing in mesophilic <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> Cas9. A K267E/R332A double mutant did modestly enhance <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity, highlighting the robust evolutionary tolerance of Cas9 and species-dependent complexity. Ultimately, this work provides an avenue by which to modulate the structure, motion, and nucleic acid interactions at the level of the Rec lobe of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, setting the stage for future studies of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 variants and their effect on its allosteric mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The vast majority of Cas systems explored as genome editors originate from mesophilic hosts. The emergence of the thermophilic <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, with DNA cleavage function up to 85 °C, can expand CRISPR technology to higher temperature regimes and stabilities, but similarities and differences in its mechanism relative to other Cas9s must be established. The widely-studied <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9, as well as <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, are Type-II CRISPR systems, though only the Type II-C class to which <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 belongs has been rigorously validated for mammalian genome editing, reinforcing the need to better understand this CRISPR class.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> The similar domain arrangements of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 led us to initially speculate that these could share atomic level mechanistic similarities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 utilizes a guide RNA (gRNA) to recognize, unwind, and cleave a double-stranded DNA target after recognition of its 5’NNNNCRAA-3’ protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and both of the <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 nuclease active sites are spatially distinct from the PAM recognition site, necessitating structural and dynamic changes that allosterically propagate DNA binding information to these subdomains. Our prior work revealed a divergence in the timescales of allosteric motions in the <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 and <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 HNH domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and it is also possible that docking of the gRNA with <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, and therefore its interaction with the RNA:DNA hybrid, may differ from the <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 system, as <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 contains a truncated recognition (Rec) lobe with only two of the three major subdomains.</p>
<p>The high thermal stability and more compact size of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (it is 281 residues shorter than <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9) can be especially important for <italic>in vivo</italic> delivery applications, since promising viral vectors (<italic>i.e.</italic> adeno-associated virus, AAV) have cargo capacities of ∼4.7kb,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> which prevents <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9-gRNA packaging into a single AAV vector but permits “all-in-one” delivery of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9-gRNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Despite this potential, little is known about specific residues that influence <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 structure, nucleic acid binding, or function. Our recent NMR work with <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 uncovered pathways of micro-millisecond timescale motions that propagate chemical information related to allostery and specificity through <italic>Sp</italic>Rec and its RNA:DNA hybrid,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> prompting us to investigate this phenomenon in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec.</p>
<p>The structural basis for specificity in protein-nucleic acid complexes is also poorly understood and difficult to quantify. Although dynamic ensembles in DNA repair enzymes have provided some context,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> many efforts to improve Cas9 specificity and reduce off-target activity have relied on large mutational screens or error-prone PCR,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> which are less intuitive. Inter-subunit allosteric communication between the catalytic HNH domain and the Rec lobe is critical to Cas9 specificity, as the binding of off-target DNA sequences at Rec alter HNH dynamics to affect DNA cleavage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> To further probe the fundamental role of protein motions in the function and specificity of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, as well as the effect of protein-nucleic acid interactions on its structural signatures, we engineered two mutations in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (K267E and R332A, housed within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2). We hypothesized that these variants could enhance <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity (<italic>i.e.</italic> limit its off-target cleavage) for two reasons. First, the chosen mutation sites are homologous to those of specificity-enhancing variants of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Second, altered Cas9-gRNA interactions have been shown to be a consequence of specificity-enhancement and these charged residues appear to directly interact with the gRNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> Balancing these two points is the fact that Type-II Cas systems generally have conserved nuclease domains, but are delineated by highly varied Rec domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> This implies that the structural and dynamic properties of Rec may play an outsized role in differentiating the functions of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 and <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, which may not be identical. Nevertheless, our work provides new insight into the biophysical, biochemical, and functional role of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe and how mutations modulate the domain itself and its interaction with gRNA in full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9.</p>

<title>The structural similarity of GeoRec1, GeoRec2, and GeoRec facilitates NMR analysis of protein dynamics and nucleic acid affinity</title>
<p><italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 is a 1087 amino acid polypeptide, thus we employed a “divide and conquer” approach for NMR studies, which we previously showed to be useful for quantifying allosteric structure and motion in <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> The <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe is comprised of subdomains <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, which likely work together to recognize nucleic acids. We engineered constructs of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 (136 residues, 16 kDa) and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 (212 residues, 25 kDa) subdomains and solved the X-ray crystal structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 at 1.49 Å, which aligns remarkably well with the structure of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 domain within the AlphaFold model of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (RMSD 1.025 Å, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We were neither able to crystallize <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 nor full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, nonetheless <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 in isolation represents the structure of the subdomain within full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 very well. Our previous studies of <italic>Geo</italic>HNH also show identical superpositions of X-ray crystal structures with full-length Cas complexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> In addition to the individual subdomains, we also generated a construct of the intact <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe (370 residues, 43 kDa).</p>

<p>Despite only 22% sequence identity <bold>(Figure S1A)</bold>, the structure of <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 are highly similar (RMSD 2.00 Å, <bold>Figure S1B)</bold>. The structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1, in contrast, does not align perfectly with <italic>Sp</italic>Rec1, instead, it partially aligns with both <italic>Sp</italic>Rec1 and <italic>Sp</italic>Rec2 <bold>(Figure S1C)</bold>. Thus, the nearly identical <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 architectures and their intrinsic dynamics may be a common thread among Type II Cas9s of different size and PAM preference. To capture atomic-level signatures of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, we obtained well-resolved <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N NMR fingerprint spectra for all three protein constructs, and assigned the amide backbones (<bold>Figure S2)</bold>. <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N amide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref><bold>, S2</bold>) and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> Ile, Leu, and Val (ILV)-methyl NMR spectra (<bold>Figure S3</bold>) of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec overlay very well with those of its individual subdomains, suggesting that the linkage of subdomains within the full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Rec polypeptide does not alter their isolated folds. Consistent with this observation, circular dichroism (CD) thermal unfolding profiles of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> ∼ 34 °C) and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 61.50 °C) are distinct, and occur as separate events in the unfolding profile of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (<bold>Figure S4</bold>). The dumbbell shape of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe, where the two globular subdomains are connected by a linker is a likely contributor to these biophysical properties.</p>
<p>The Rec lobe of Cas9 is responsible for orienting the RNA:DNA hybrid, as well as the adjacent nuclease domains, into their active conformations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> Thus, the structure, motions, and nucleic acid interactions of Rec represent a critical piece of the Cas9 signaling machinery. Previous studies of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 revealed that gRNA binding (<italic>i.e.</italic> ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) formation) induces a global structural rearrangement of the protein that positions the adjacent HNH into its “proofreading” state,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> after which target DNA binding positions the nucleases into active conformations for cleavage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> We wondered if the atomistic details of the apo <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9-to-RNP transition could be captured by NMR using the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec construct and a 101-nucleotide (nt) gRNA derived from the full 141-nt guide containing a 23-nt spacer followed by an 8-nt repeat (PAM complement) and 110-nt guide sequence intrinsic to <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. An overlay of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR spectra of apo <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec-RNP at a 1:1 molar ratio shows extensive line broadening (<bold>Figure S5A</bold>), likely due to the large size of the complex (75.5 kDa). To mitigate this issue, we created a second 39-nt RNA construct maintaining the spacer sequence that is known to bind to the Rec lobe of other Cas9s. When bound to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, this complex is 55.6 kDa and more amenable to NMR studies. A <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N NMR spectral overlay of apo <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec in complex with 39-nt gRNA at a 1:1 molar ratio shows clear, resolved resonances with significant chemical shift perturbations and line broadening (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref><bold>, S5B</bold>). Importantly, many resonances are also minimally impacted. The results of gRNA titration experiments were quantified in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and mapped onto the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec structure in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>. The strongest chemical shift perturbations are localized to the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 subdomain that interfaces with the RNA:DNA hybrid at the PAM distal end. Previous studies of specificity-enhancing variants of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 identified structural perturbations to <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3, affecting RNA:DNA hybrid binding at the PAM distal end.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> These data suggest that in the analogous <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, residues located near the PAM distal end of the nucleic acids play a similarly critical role in binding. Modulation of binding affinity within this region, as in <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9, may lead to predictable functional changes in <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. In addition, line broadening is evident in both <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, primarily localized to the RNA:DNA hybrid interface. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments quantified the affinity of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec for gRNA, producing a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 2.95 ± 0.53 µM that is consistent with the strong NMR chemical shift perturbations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>GeoRec2 mutants do not substantially impact the GeoRec structure</title>
<p>To understand how the structure and gRNA interactions of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 can be modulated at the level of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, we engineered two charge-altering point mutants in the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 subdomain, K267E and R332A. Based on the AlphaFold2 model of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, both of these residues are &lt; 5Å from the bound RNA:DNA hybrid and are predicted to interface with the nucleic acids directly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Of course, we must note that due to the lack of an experimental structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, the interactions between K267 and R332 and the gRNA may be different than predicted. The rationale for our designed mutations was that removal of positive charge would weaken the interactions between <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and the gRNA, affecting <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> via the electrostatics or dynamics of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe. Studies of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 revealed that interactions of <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 (analogous to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2) with its RNA:DNA hybrid triggers conformational rearrangements that allow the catalytic HNH domain to sample its active conformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Thus, <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 acts as an allosteric effector that recognizes the RNA:DNA hybrid to activate HNH. Nucleotide mismatches (<italic>i.e.</italic> off-target DNA sequences) in the target DNA generally prevent <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 from undergoing the full extent of its required conformational rearrangements to allosterically activate HNH, leaving HNH in a “proofreading” state with its catalytic residues too far from the DNA cleavage site. Off-target DNA cleavage by Cas9 remains an area of intense study and substantial effort from various groups has gone into mitigating such effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Indeed, many high-specificity <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 variants contain mutations within <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 that increase the threshold for its conformational activation, reducing the propensity for HNH to sample its active state in the presence of off-target DNA sequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Studies of flexibility within Rec itself, as well as its gRNA interactions in the presence of mutations, are therefore essential for connecting biophysical properties to function and specificity in related Cas9s.</p>

<title>Mutations enhance and redistribute protein dynamics within GeoRec2</title>
<p>Due to the high molecular weight of the intact <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe, decays in NMR signal associated with spin relaxation experiments were significant and hampered data quality. Thus, we focused on quantifying the molecular motions of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 subdomain, where the K267E and R332A mutations reside and the chemical shift perturbations are most apparent. To obtain high-quality per-residue information representative of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, we measured longitudinal (<italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>) and transverse (<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>) relaxation rates and heteronuclear <sup>1</sup>H-[<sup>15</sup>N] NOEs, then used these data in a Model-free analysis of per-residue order parameters (<italic>S</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Previous measurements of <italic>S</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> across the adjacent <italic>Geo</italic>HNH nuclease revealed substantial ps-ns timescale flexibility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> leading us to wonder whether a similar observation would be made for <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, which abuts <italic>Geo</italic>HNH.

However, unlike <italic>Geo</italic>HNH, <italic>S</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> values for <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 are generally elevated, suggesting that the ps-ns motions of this subdomain arise primarily from global tumbling of the protein in solution. We therefore carried out Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion NMR experiments to assess the μs-ms flexibility of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, which has been linked to chemical information transfer in the well-studied <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> Evidence of μs-ms motions (<italic>i.e.</italic> curved relaxation dispersion profiles) is observed in 17 residues within the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 core, spanning its interfaces to Rec1 and HNH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,C</xref>).

<p>Since <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 have similar structures and μs-ms flexibility, we speculated that charge-altering mutations would modulate the biophysical properties of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and the function of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, as observed for <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9. We investigated K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 with NMR spin relaxation, as described for WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 (<italic>vide supra</italic>). An analysis of chemical exchange rates, <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub>, derived from dual-field CPMG relaxation dispersion show a global <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> for WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 of 147 ± 41 s<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The K267E mutation shifts the globally fitted <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> to 376 ± 89 s<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, while the R332A variant maintains a <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> similar to that of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 (142 ± 28 s<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>). The global fit of the K267E variant is based on CPMG profiles of 33 residues, while that of R332A is derived from 18 residues (<bold>Table S1</bold>). Interestingly, the sites participating in global motions of both variants are distinct from those of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, demonstrating that residue-specific flexibility is redistributed throughout <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, affecting intradomain molecular crosstalk within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec. Indeed, perturbation to NMR-detectable motions in <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 rewired its allosteric signaling and enzymatic function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> A similar dynamic modulation of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 may fine-tune its DNA cleavage, which has been demonstrated within the <italic>Geo</italic>HNH nuclease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and wedge (WED) domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> We also assessed the ps-ns fluctuations of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 variants (a negligible contribution to the WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 dynamic profile) and calculated order parameters from <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> and <sup>1</sup>H-[<sup>15</sup>N] NOE relaxation measurements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref><bold>, S8</bold>).

<p>To understand how the K267E and R332A mutants impact gRNA binding to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, we conducted gRNA titration experiments via NMR and observed that gRNA-induced chemical shift perturbations were attenuated in both variants, relative to WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec. Despite this muted structural effect, the impact from gRNA-induced line broadening remains substantial in the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 subdomain. Our NMR data reveal that a three-fold greater concentration of gRNA is required to induce the maximal structural and dynamic effects in the variants than is required for WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>), suggesting that the variants have a reduced gRNA affinity. MST experiments showed modest reductions in gRNA affinity for the K267E and R332A constructs, relative to WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 2.95 ± 0.53 µM), where K267E <italic>Geo</italic>Rec produced a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 6.67 ± 2.0 µM and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec produced a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 4.02 ± 1.34 µM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Collectively, these data reveal that mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec only subtly alter its structure, but more significantly impact protein dynamics and in turn, the gRNA interaction. NMR experiments also demonstrate that the presence of gRNA impacts both subdomains of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, providing an avenue for additional molecular tuning.</p>

<p>To more completely understand the mechanism of gRNA binding to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, we carefully examined the NMR data to identify any residues critical for gRNA binding. When overlaying the gRNA-induced chemical shift perturbations (Δδ) of WT and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec variants (<bold>Figure S9A</bold>), it became clearer that the effect of gRNA binding to both variants was muted and that even at saturating concentrations, the chemical shift perturbations of identical resonances in the K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 spectra were weaker than those site in the WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec spectrum. Plots of the change in Δδ (WT - mutant) indicate site-specifically that residues in the variants are less structurally affected by gRNA binding, noted as positive values in <bold>Figure S9B</bold>. Negative values in the same plot highlight residues in the variants that experience greater structural changes than WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec during gRNA binding. Residues with comparative change in Δδ exceeding one standard deviation above the 10% trimmed mean of all data were identified to represent key residues influencing gRNA affinity. These sites were mapped onto the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec structure (<bold>Figure S9C</bold>) and considered to be allosteric hotspots, as many are distal to the gRNA binding interface. Notably, residues critical for the tight association of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and gRNA (positive change in Δδ) largely overlap when comparing WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec to either variant. These sites include F170, R192, H264, R269, L270, L279, H300, D301, D376, E368, D403, E405, E408, and I429. Mutations of these residues in future work will confirm their role as hotspots for precisely tuning the affinity of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec for gRNA.</p>
<p>Having observed a weakened affinity of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec variants for gRNA by NMR and MST, we next quantified the impact of the K267E and R332A mutations on RNP formation and stability in full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. The thermal unfolding midpoint of full-length WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 determined by CD is ∼60 °C and the K267E and R332A mutations do not change the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of the apo protein (<bold>Figure S10</bold>). Upon formation of an RNP, the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 increases to 73 °C, but the K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 variants form less stable RNPs with <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values of 70 °C and 61 °C, respectively. The trend of these data is consistent with NMR and MST, which highlight that although K267E and R332A mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec have somewhat muted structural effects, these changes alter protein dynamics and the interaction with gRNA.</p>

<title>DNA cleavage assays suggest GeoCas9 is resistant to K267E- or R332A-induced functional changes</title>
<p>The dynamic impact of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec mutations and their altered gRNA interactions at the biophysical level led us to speculate that when either mutation was incorporated into full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, they would also alter DNA cleavage function, especially at elevated temperatures where WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 is most active. Temperature-dependent functional alterations were previously observed for single-point mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>HNH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Although the K267E and R332A mutations slightly diminished on-target DNA cleavage by <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, the effect was subtle and these overall cleavage activities followed the temperature dependence of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 quite closely (<bold>Figure S11</bold>).</p>
<p>To assess the impact of these mutations on <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity, we assayed the propensity for off-target cleavage using DNA substrates with mismatches 5-6 or 19-20 base pairs from the PAM seed site (<bold>Figure S12A, Table S2</bold>).

As expected, WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 was increasingly sensitive to mismatched target sequences closer to the seed site, which has been demonstrated with <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 and other Cas systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> No significant differences in activity were observed with digestion durations ranging from 1-60 minutes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> implying that a 1-minute digestion is sufficient for <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 with the target DNA template.

Novel constructs of subdomains <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, as well as intact <italic>Geo</italic>Rec show a high structural similarity to the domains in full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, facilitating solution NMR experiments that captured the intrinsic allosteric motions across <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2.

<p>Based on homology to specificity-enhancing variants of the better studied <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9, the biophysical and biochemical consequences of two mutations were tested in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, the larger <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe, and full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. We speculated that removing positively charged residues with potential to interact with negatively charged nucleic acids could disrupt <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9-gRNA complex formation, stability, and subsequent function by altering the protein or nucleic acid motions. Indeed, CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments revealed that mutations enhanced and reorganized the μs-ms flexibility of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2. Further, NMR titrations showed the affinity of K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec for gRNA to be weaker than that of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, consistent with MST-derived <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values. The mutations also diminished the stability of the full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 RNP complex.</p>
<p>The collective changes to protein dynamics, gRNA binding, and RNP thermostability suggested that mutations could modulate <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 function, as observed in similar studies of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 reporting that gRNA dynamics, affecting the potential for the RNA:DNA hybrid to dissociate, have affected function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> Yet, the functional impact of the single-point mutations in this work was relatively modest, suggesting that multiple additive (or synergistic) mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec are required to fine-tune activity or specificity to a large degree. Although homologous K-to-E and R-to-A single point mutations enhance specificity of the mesophilic <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9, their impact in the thermophilic <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 system may be muted due to its evolutionary resilience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> Further, the biophysical impact of the mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec may be tempered by the unusually stable neighboring domains in the context of full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the effects of these and other <italic>Geo</italic>Rec mutations may vary <italic>in vivo</italic> or with alternative target cleavage sites and cell types. Such studies will be the subject of future work, as will biochemical assays of homologous mutations across diverse Cas9s, which have contributed to the wide use of CRISPR technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> We also note that despite the homology between <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 and <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 and the latter’s role in evo- and HiFi-<italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 variants that guided our K267E and R332A mutations, the maximally enhanced <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 variants contain four mutations each. Presumably, the individual substitutions all play some role modulating specificity. However, there is no consistent pattern that discerns whether multiple mutations will have additive or synergistic impacts on Cas9 function. NMR and MD studies of high-specificity <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 variants (HF-1, Hypa, and Evo, each with distinct mutations in the <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 subdomain) reveal universal structural and dynamic variations in regions of <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 that interface with the RNA;DNA hybrid. Notably, a recently published variant, i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> demonstrated enhanced genome-editing capabilities in HEK293T cells with eight mutations, though none in the Rec2 subdomain.

<p>This study marks the first phase of mapping allosteric motions and pathways of information flow in the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe with solution NMR experiments.

The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, and 1 mM PMSF at pH 7.4, lysed by ultrasonication, and purified by Ni−NTA affinity chromatography. Following TEV proteolysis of the terminal His-tag, the samples were further purified on a Superdex75 size exclusion column. NMR samples were dialyzed into a buffer containing 20 mM NaPi, 80 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA at pH 7.4.</p>
<p>The full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 plasmid was acquired from Addgene (#87700), expressed in LB media and purified as described above.

<title>DNA cleavage assays</title>
<p><italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 gRNA templates containing 21-nt, 23-nt, or 25-nt spacers targeting the mouse <italic>Tnnt2</italic> gene locus were introduced into EcoRI and BamHI sites in pUC57 (Genscript). The plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (New England BioLabs) and subsequent restriction digest of the plasmid DNA was carried out using the BamHI restriction enzyme (New England BioLabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Linearized plasmid DNA was immediately purified using the DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA transcription was performed <italic>in vitro</italic> with the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England BioLabs). DNA substrates containing the target cleavage site (479 base pairs, <bold>Table S2, S3</bold>) were produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using mouse genomic DNA as a template and primer pairs 5’CAAAGAGCTCCTCGTCCAGT3’ and 5’ ATGGACTCCAGGACCCAAGA3’ followed by a column purification using the NucleoSpinⓇ Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (Macherey-Nagel). For the <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage assay, RNP formation was achieved by incubating 3 µM <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (WT, K267E, R332A, or K267E/R332A variant) and 3 µM gRNA at either 37 °C, 60 °C, 75 °C, or 85 °C for 30 minutes in a reaction buffer of 20 mM Tris, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol at pH 7.5. The 10 µL cleavage reactions were set up by mixing RNP at varying concentrations with 149 nanograms of PCR products on ice followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 minutes. The reaction was quenched by adding 1 µL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and subsequent incubation at 56 °C for 10 minutes. Two microliters of 6x DNA loading buffer were added to each reaction and 10 µL of the mixture per lane was loaded onto an 1% agarose gel. DNA band intensity measurements on a gel image were carried out with ImageJ.</p>
<p>For <italic>in vitro</italic> off-target cleavage assays, RNP formation was achieved by incubating 10 µM <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (WT, K267E, R332A, or K267E/R332A variant) and 10 µM gRNA at 37 °C for 30 minutes in the reaction buffer described above. The 10 µL cleavage reactions were set up by mixing 1 µM RNP with 150 nanograms of PCR products (off-target DNA sequences listed in <bold>Table S2</bold>) on ice followed by incubation at 37 °C for varying time points. The reaction was quenched and visualized as described above. WT and HiFi <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 control proteins were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, cat.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study from Belato, Knight, and co-workers, the authors investigated the Rec domain of a thermophilic Cas9 from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GeoCas9). The authors investigated three constructs, two individual subdomains of Rec (Rec1 and Rec2) and the full Rec domain. This domain is involved in binding to the guide RNA of Cas9, as well as the RNA-DNA duplex that is formed upon target binding. The authors performed RNA binding and relaxation experiments using NMR for the wild-type domain as well as two-point mutants. They observed differences in RNA binding activities as well as the flexibility of the domain. The authors also performed experiments on full-length GeoCas9 to determine whether these biophysical differences affect the RNA binding or cleavage activity. Although the authors observed some changes in the thermal stability of the mutant GeoCas9-gRNA complex, they did not observe substantial differences in the cleavage activities of the mutant GeoCas9 variants.</p>
<p>Overall, this manuscript provides a detailed biophysical analysis of the GeoCas9 Rec domain. The NMR assignments for this construct should prove very useful, and the results may provide the grounds for future engineering of higher fidelity variants of GeoCas9. While the NMR results are generally well presented, it is unclear how the results on the isolated Rec domain related to the overall function of full-length GeoCas9. In addition, some conclusions are overstated and not fully supported by the evidence provided. The following major points should be addressed by the authors.</p>
<p>(1) Many of the results rely on the backbone resonance assignments of the three constructs that were used, and the authors have done an excellent job of assigning the Rec1 and Rec2 constructs. However, it is unclear from the descriptions in the text how the full-length Rec construct was assigned. Were these assignments made based on assignments for the individual domains? The authors state that the spectra of individual domains and RecFL overlay very well, but there appear to be many resonances that have chemical shift differences or are only present in one construct. As it stands, it is unclear how the resonances were assigned for residues whose chemical shifts were perturbed, making it difficult to interpret many of the results.</p>
<p>(2) The minimal gRNA that was used for the Rec-gRNA binding experiments is unlikely to be a good mimic for the full-length gRNA, as it lacks any of the secondary structure that is most specifically recognized by the REC lobe and the rest of the Cas9 protein. The majority of this RNA is a &quot;spacer&quot; sequence, but spacers are variable, so this sequence is arbitrary. Thus, the interactions that the authors are observing most likely represent non-specific interactions between the Rec domains and RNA. The authors also map chemical shift perturbations and line broadening on structural models with an RNA-DNA duplex bound, but this is not an accurate model for how the Rec domain binds to a single-stranded RNA (for which there is no structural model). Thus, many of the conclusions regarding the RNA binding interface are overstated.</p>
<p>(3) The authors include microscale thermophoresis (MST) data for the Rec constructs binding to the minimal gRNA. These data suggest that all three Rec variants have very similar Kd's for the RNA. Given these similarities, it is unclear why the RNA titration experiments by NMR yielded such different results. Moreover, in the Discussion, the authors state that the NMR titration data are consistent with the MST-derived Kd values. This conclusion appears to be overstated given the very small differences in affinities measured by MST.</p>
<p>(4) While the authors have performed some experiments to help place their findings on the isolated Rec domain in the context of the full-length protein, these experiments do not fully support the conclusions that the authors draw about the meaning of their NMR results. The two Cas9 variants that were explored via NMR have no effect on Cas9 cleavage activity, and it is unclear from the data provided whether they have any effect on GeoCas9 binding to the full sgRNA. This makes it difficult to determine whether the observed differences in RNA binding and dynamics of the isolated Rec domain have any consequence in the context of the full protein.</p>
<p>(5) The authors state in multiple places that the K267E/R332A mutant enhanced GeoCas9 specificity. Improved specificity refers to a situation in which the efficiency of cleavage of a perfectly matched target improves in comparison to a mismatched target. This is not what the authors observed for the double mutant. Instead, the cleavage of the perfect target was drastically reduced, in some cases to a larger degree than for the mismatched target. The double mutant does not appear to have improved specificity, it has simply decreased cleavage efficiency of the enzyme.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript from Belato et al. used advanced NMR approaches and a mutagenesis campaign to probe the conformational dynamics of the recognition lobe (Rec) of the CRISPR Cas9 enzyme from G. stearothermophilus (GeoCas9). Using truncated and full-length constructs they assess the impacts of two different point mutations have on the redistribution and timescale of these motions and assess gRNA recognition and specificity. Single point mutations in the Rec domain in a Cas9 from a related species had profound impacts on- and off-target DNA editing, therefore the authors reasoned analogous mutations in GeoCas9 would have similar effects. However, despite a redistribution of local motions and changes in global stability, their chosen mutations had little impact on DNA editing in the context of the full-length enzyme. Their studies highlight the species-specific complexity of interdomain communication and allosteric mechanisms used by these multi-domain endonucleases. Despite these negative results, their study is highly rigorous, and their approach will broadly support understanding how the activity and specificity of these enzymes can be engineered to tune activity and limit off-target cleavage by these enzymes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Atomistic investigation of the conformational dynamics of the GeoCas9 gRNA recognition lobe (GeoRec), probing dynamics on a broad range of timescales from ps to ms using advanced NMR approaches will be broadly interesting to both the structural biology and CRISPR engineering communities.</p>
<p>(2) Highly rigorous biophysical studies that push the boundaries of current techniques, provide insight into local dynamics of the GeoRec domain that serve to propagate allosteric information and potentially regulate enzymatic activity.</p>
<p>(3) The study highlights the complexities of understanding interdomain communication in Cas9 enzymes since analogous mutations in different species have different effects on target recognition and cleavage.</p>
<p>(4) The type of structural and dynamic insights derived from this study design could serve as foundational information to guide a rational design strategy aimed at improving the selectivity and reducing the off-target effects of Cas9 enzymes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Despite the rigor of the experiments, the mutations chosen by the authors do not have a profound effect on the overall substrate affinity or activity of GeoCas9 rendering little mechanistic insight into allosteric communication in this particular Cas9. However, the double mutant K267E/R332A has a more pronounced effect on the cleavage of WT and mismatched (at nucleotides 19 and 20) DNA substrates while minimally affecting the cleavage of mismatched (at nucleotides 5 and 6), suggesting more could be learned about the allosteric mechanism from the detailed characterization of this mutant.</p>
<p>(2) Follow-up experiments with other residues that were identified as being highly dynamic might affect substrate recognition and cleavage activity in different ways providing additional insight.</p>
<p>(3) Details regarding the authors' experimental approach are incomplete such as a description of the model used to fit the CD data, a detailed explanation of the global fitting of the relaxation dispersion data describing how the best-fit model was selected, and the description of the ModelFree fitting of fast timescale dynamics is incomplete.</p>

<p>The authors explore the role of Rec domains in a thermophilic Cas9 enzyme. They report on the crystal structure of part of the recognition lobe, its dynamics from NMR spin relaxation and relaxation-dispersion data, its interaction mode with guide RNA, and the effect of two single-point mutations hypothesised to enhance specificity. They find that mutations have small effects on Rec domain structure and stability but lead to significant rearrangement of micro- to milli-second dynamics which does not translate into major changes in guide RNA affinity or DNA cleavage specificity, illustrating the inherent tolerance of GeoCas9. The work can be considered as a first step towards understanding motions in GeoCas9 recognition lobe, although no clear hotspots were discovered with potential for future rational design of enhanced Cas9 variants.</p>
