<title>Abstract</title><p>While many 3D structures of cation-coupled transporters have been determined, the mechanistic details governing the obligatory coupling and functional regulations still remain elusive. The bacterial melibiose transporter (MelB) is a prototype of the Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled major facilitator superfamily transporters. With a conformational nanobody (Nb), we determined an inward-facing Na<sup>+</sup>-bound, low-sugar affinity cryoEM structure. It is the first structure of a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter with experimentally determined cation binding, and also a structure mimicking the physiological regulatory state of MelB under the global regulator EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> of the glucose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate:phosphotransferase system. Collectively with the available outward-facing sugar-bound structures and a large body of functional analysis, we identified that only inner barrier that exists in the outward-facing conformation contributes to the sugar selectivity pocket. When the inner barrier is broken as shown in the inward-facing conformation, the sugar selectivity pocket is also broken, resulting in a decreased sugar-binding affinity by greater than 30-fold, which can facilitate the substrate release and accumulation intracellularly. The inner/outer barrier shifting directly regulates the sugar-binding affinity, with no effect on the cation binding as also suggested by molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, the use of the inward-facing conformation-specific Nb in combination with the hydron/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry allowed us to identify dynamic regions linked to the inner barrier-specific charged network and critical for the barrier switching mechanisms. The complementary results provided structural, dynamic, and regulatory insights into the mobile barrier mechanism for cation-coupled symport.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cation-coupled transporters play critical roles in many aspects of cell physiology and pharmacokinetics and are involved in many serious diseases including cancers, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, etc. Their specific locations and functions make them viable drug targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Following decades of effort, the structures of many transporters have been determined by x-ray crystallography and, more recently, by cryoEM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, we still do not have a deep understanding of the structural basis for substrate accumulation to high concentrations, the mechanisms for the obligatorily coupled transport, as well as the cellular regulation of transporters’ activities to meet metabolic needs.</p>
<p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium melibiose permease (MelB<sub>St</sub>) is the prototype Na<sup>+</sup>/solute transporter of the major facilitator superfamilies (MFS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. It catalyzes the stoichiometric symport of galactopyranoside with Na<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, or Li<sup>+25</sup>. Crystal structures of sugar-bound states have been determined, which reveals the sugar recognition mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In all solved x-ray crystal structures, MelB<sub>St</sub> is in an outward-facing conformation; the observed physical barrier of the sugar translocation, named the inner barrier, prevents the substrate from moving into the cytoplasm directly (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). It is well-known that transporters change their conformation to allow the substrate translocation from one side of the membrane to the other and conformational dynamics is the intrinsic feature necessary for their functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To understand how the substrate dictates transporter function, we have established thermodynamic binding cycles in MelB<sub>St</sub> using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements and identified that the positive cooperativity of the binding of cation and melibiose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>; furthermore, the binding of the second substrate changes the thermodynamic feature of heat capacity change from positive to negative, suggesting primary dehydration processes when both substrates concurrently occupy the transporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. While the structural origins have not yet been completely determined yet, they may be related to forming an occluded intermediate conformation, a necessary state for a global conformational transition.</p>
<p>To determine structurally unresolved states of MelB<sub>St</sub>, nanobodies (Nbs) were raised against the wild-type MelB<sub>St</sub>. One group of Nbs (Nb714, Nb725, and Nb733) has been identified to interact with the cytoplasmic side of MelB<sub>St</sub> and their binding completely inhibits MelB<sub>St</sub> transport activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. MelB<sub>St</sub> bound with Nb725 or Nb733 retained its binding to Na<sup>+</sup>, but its affinity for melibiose is inhibited. The MelB<sub>St</sub>/Nb733 complex also retained the affinity to its physiological regulator dephosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> of the glucose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate:phosphotransferase system (PTS). EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>, the central metabolite regulator in bacterial catabolic repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, greatly inhibited the galactoside binding to non-PTS permeases MelB <sup>33</sup>and the H<sup>+</sup>-coupled lactose permease (LacY)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, but still retained the binding of Na<sup>+</sup> to MelB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, the functional modulation of the two Nbs on MelB mimics the binding of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>. The crystal structure of dephosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binding to the maltose permease MalFGK<sub>2</sub>, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, has been determined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, but there is no structural information on EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binding to the MFS transporters. Determination of the structures of MelB<sub>St</sub> in complex with this group of Nbs is important and will reveal critical information to understand the manner by which EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> regulates the large group of MFS sugar transporters.</p>
<p>In the current study, we applied cryoEM single-particle analysis (cryoEM-SPA) and determined the near-atomic resolution structure of MelB<sub>St</sub> complexed with a Nb725_4, a modified Nb725 with a designed scaffold which enables NabFab binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. The use of the Nb provided a Na<sup>+</sup>-bound lower sugar-affinity inward-facing conformation of MelB<sub>St</sub>. Furthermor, our studies using this conformation-selective Nb in combination with hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) demonstrate a powerful approach for characterizing protein conformational flexibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, and also provides critical dynamic information to understand how the substrate binding drives the conformational transition necessary for the substrate translocation in MelB<sub>St</sub>.</p>

<title>CDR grafting to generate a hybrid Nb and its functional characterization</title>
<p>To facilitate structure determination of MelB<sub>St</sub> complexed with the conformation selective Nb by cryoEM-SPA, a novel universal tool based on a NabFab was applied to increase the effective mass of small particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, since MelB<sub>St</sub> (mass, 53.5 kDa) has limited extramembrane mass. A hybrid Nb725_4 was created by CDR grafting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> to transfer the binding specificity of MelB<sub>St</sub> Nb725 to the TC-Nb4 recognized by the NabFab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> (<bold>sFig. 1</bold>). Extensive <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> functional characterization revealed that the hybrid Nb725_4 possesses the binding properties of its parents Nbs (Nb725 and TC-Nb41) with slightly compromised affinities to MelB<sub>St</sub>.</p>
<p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> cell-based cAMP-dependent two-hybrid T18/T25 assay showed that the two hybrids of Nb725 4:T18 and T25:MelB<sub>St</sub> reconstituted adenylyl cyclase activities (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>), which behaved similarly to the parent fusion Nb725:T18<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The co-expression of either of the Nbs with MelB<sub>St</sub> inhibited MelB-mediated melibiose fermentation and transport (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b&amp;c</xref></bold>). The data confirmed the cytoplasmic interaction of both Nbs in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. <italic>In vitro</italic> ITC measurements showed that Nb725_4 slightly reduced affinity to MelB<sub>St</sub> at an equilibrium dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of 3.64 ± 0.62 µM, compared to 1.58 ± 0.42 µM for Nb725 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). The parent Nb725 had a poor binding to the NabFab (<bold>sFig. 1b</bold>), but Nb725_4 exhibited greatly increased affinity to NabFab at a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of 52.53 ± 13.03 nM (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). The anti-Fab Nb binding to NabFab was two-fold poorer than Nb725_4 at a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of 0.11 ± 0.16 µM (<bold>sFig. 1d; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). The complex containing all four proteins including MelB<sub>St</sub>, Nb725_4, NabFab, and anti-Fab Nb showed shift peak-shift in the gel-filtration chromatography (<bold>sFig. 1e</bold>).</p>

The test was performed in <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5<italic>α cyaA</italic> cells on the maltose-containing MacConkey agar plate as described in Methods. When the T18 and T25 fragments encoded by two compatible plasmids were expressed separately, or only one fusion of either T25:MelB<sub>St</sub> or Nbs:T18, no cAMP was produced, so no maltose fermentation was observed as shown in yellow colonies. The interaction of two hybrid proteins of T25:MelB<sub>St</sub> and Nbs:T18 restored adenylate cyclase activities and cAMP production, which resulted in sugar fermentation. The irregular red colonies are typical of a positive two-hybrid test. <bold>(b)</bold> Nb inhibition of melibiose fermentation.

The cells transformed with the two empty plasmids without MelB or Nb were the negative control. <bold>Inset</bold>, Western blot.

Exothermic thermograms were obtained by titrating Nbs (0.3 mM) into the MelB<sub>St</sub>-free buffer (gray) or MelB<sub>St</sub> (35 mM)-containing buffer (black) in the Sample Cell and plotted using bottom/left (x/y) axes. The binding isotherm and fitting of the mole ratio (Nb/MelB<sub>St</sub>) vs. the total heat change (Δ<italic>Q</italic>) using one-site independent-binding model were presented by top/right (x/y) axes.

<p>Nb275_4 binding properties were further analyzed in the presence of the MelB ligands. As expected, the presence of melibiose yielded 6- and 3-fold inhibition, and α-NPG afforded 8- and 4-fold inhibition, on the binding of Nb725 and Nb725_4, respectively (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; sFig. 2</bold>). The physiological regulatory protein EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; sFig. 2)</bold> showed no inhibition on the binding affinity of both Nbs.</p>
<p>Various ligands binding to the Nb/MelB<sub>St</sub> complex in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> were also examined with ITC. As published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, the melibiose binding was not detectable in the presence of Nb725 (s<bold>Fig. 3a</bold>). To characterize the sugar effect quantitatively, the α-NPG binding was carried out. Interestingly, the exothermic binding observed in the absence of the Nb changed to endothermic binding reactions in the Nb-bound states. Also, affinity affinities decreased by 21∼32- for both Nbs (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>; <bold>sFig. 3b</bold>). Inhibitions of galactosides have been observed in the case of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>/MelB<sub>St</sub> complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Collectively, galactosides binding to MelB<sub>St</sub> were mutually exclusive with Nbs (Nb725, Nb725_4, or Nb733) or EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>, and the negative cooperativity implied that MelB<sub>St</sub> conformations favored by galactosides and those binders differ. This conclusion was further supported by the Na<sup>+</sup> or EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binding to the MelB<sub>St</sub>/Nb complexes (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; sFig. 3c-d)</bold>, which showed no inhibition for Na<sup>+</sup> affinity and even slightly better binding for EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>. Therefore, MelB<sub>St</sub> complexed with Nb725_4 retains its physiological functions, and its conformation is expected to be similar when trapped by either of those binders but is different from the sugar-bound outward-facing structure [PDB ID 7L17]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Inward-facing MelB<sub>St</sub> trapped by Nb725_4</title>
<p>CryoEM-SPA was used to image the complex consisting of MelB<sub>St</sub> in nanodiscs, Nb725_4, NabFab, and anti-Fab Nb. The data collection, processing, and evaluation followed the standard protocols <bold>(sFigs. 4-5)</bold>. From a total number of 296,925 selected particles, structures of MelB<sub>St</sub>, Nb725_4, and NabFab were determined to a golden standard Fourier shell correlation (GSFSC) resolution of 3.29 Å at 0.143 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>) [PDB ID 8T60]. The map for anti-Fab Nb were relatively poor and excluded from particle reconstruction. The quality of the Coulomb potential map allowed for unambiguous docking of available coordinates of NabFab [PDB ID 7PHP], a predicted model for Nb725_4 by Alpha-Fold 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and the N-terminal helix bundle from the outward-facing crystal structure of D59C MelB<sub>St</sub> [PDB ID 7L17]. The C-terminal helix bundle of MelB<sub>St</sub> and the ion Na<sup>+</sup> were manually built. The final model contains 417 MelB<sub>St</sub> residues (positions 2-210, 219-355, and 364-432), with 6 unassigned side-chains at the C-terminal domain (Leu293, Tyr355, Arg363, Tyr369, Tyr396, and Met410) due to the map disorder, 122 of Nb725_4 residues 2-123, and 229 of NabFab H-chain residues 1-214, and 210 of NabFab L-chain residues 4-213, respectively. The local resolution estimate showed that the cores of NabFab, Nb725_4, and the N-terminal helix bundle of MelB<sub>St</sub> exhibit better resolutions up to 2.84 Å and most regions in the C-terminal helix bundle of MelB<sub>St</sub> have resolutions between 3.2 to 3.6 Å (<bold>sFig. 6a</bold>). The N-terminal helix bundle has a completely connected density; however, the map corresponding to three cytoplasmic loops at positions 211-218 in the middle loop<sub>6-7</sub>, positions 356-361 in loop<sub>10-11</sub>, or the entire C-terminal tail after Tyr432, is missing.

<p>The NabFab structure in this complex is virtually identical to that in the NorM complex [PDB ID 7PHP]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> with rmsd of all atoms of 1.334 Å (<bold>sFig. 7a-c</bold>). When the alignment focused on the NabFab H-chain, the two NabFab/Nb binary complexes in both complexes were organized similarly (<bold>sFig. 7d)</bold>, and the binding of Nbs with their corresponding transporters varied.</p>
<p>The structure shows that the Nb725_4 is bound to the cytoplasmic side of MelB<sub>St</sub> at an inward-open conformation (<bold>sFig. 8a&amp;b)</bold>, which supports the functional analyses and reveals the MelB<sub>St</sub> conformation for the Nb binding. The contact surfaces match in shape and surface potential with a contact area of 435 A<sup>2</sup>. CDR-1 (Arg30, Asp31, Asn32, and Ala33) and CDR-2 (Tyr52, Asp53, Lue54, Tyr56, Thr57, and Ala58) form interactions with two cytoplasmic regions of MelB<sub>St</sub>, the tip between helices IV and V, i.e., loop<sub>4-5</sub>, (Pro132, Thr133, Asp137, Lys138, and Arg141) and the beginning region of the middle loop<sub>6-7</sub> (Tyr205, Ser206, and Ser207) (<bold>sFig. 8c</bold>). The Nb binding was stabilized by salt-bridge and hydrogen-bonding interactions at both corners of this stretch of inter-protein contacts. In the published outward-open conformation of MelB<sub>St</sub>, such a binding surface for recognizing Nb725_4 does not exist. Most regions of the middle loop, the C-terminal helix bundle, and the C-terminal tail helix must be displaced to permit the binding, and some of those regions are completely disordered in this inward-facing structure. All data supported that Nb725_4 only binds to MelB<sub>St</sub> at an inward-open state. Since this Nb, its parent Nb725, and another Nb733<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> behave similarly, and all inhibit the sugar binding and transport, we conclude that all three binders are the inward-facing conformation-specific negative modulators of MelB<sub>St</sub>. Further, ITC measurements (<bold>sFig. 2</bold>) also showed that MelB<sub>St</sub> binds to either of three Nbs in the absence or presence of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> or binds to EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> in the absence or presence of either of the three Nbs. The data lead to this conclusion that the Nb and EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> recognize two spatially distinct epitopes of MelB<sub>St</sub>, so it is highly like that the inward-open conformation mimics the conformation of MelB<sub>St</sub> under the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> regulation.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of D59C MelB<sub>St</sub> [PDB ID 7L17], with an intact sugar-binding and translocation pathway, show that the sugar-binding pocket is formed by both N- and C-terminal bundles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Eight N-terminal residues (Lys18, Asp19, Ile22, Tyr26, Tyr120, Asp124, Trp128, and Arg149), especially the four charged residues, form the multiple polar interactions with one surface of the galactopyranosyl moiety. Five C-terminal residues (Trp342, Gln372, Thr373, Val376, and Lys377) form a non-specific barrier without a strong polar interaction <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>)</bold>. Due to the D59 mutation, the cation-binding pocket is loosely packed and Asp55 forms a salt-bridge interaction with Lys377 in this uniport mutant, but it is in close proximity to the sugar-specificity determinant pocket as shown in the surface representation. When overlaying the inward-facing structure upon the outward-facing structures, little variation of the positioning of the N-terminal sugar-binding residues is observed except for Arg149, but all C-terminal residues show greater displacements <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, sticks in black</bold>). In the inward-facing structure, Lys377 is closer to Asp124, and Asp55 is liganded with Na<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<p>The loosely arranged sugar-binding residues observed in the Nb725_4-bound conformation provide the structural foundation for measured lower sugar affinities (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>), so this structure represents an intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>-bound sugar-releasing conformation. Since the positioning of the key residues for galactoside specificity (Lys18, Asp19, and Asp124) exhibits virtually no change, it is conceivable that this conformation retains the initial recognition of sugar for reversal reactions, a common feature for carrier transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Conformational changes between inward- and outward-facing states</title>
<p>The outward-facing structure [PDB ID 7L17] was trimmed to match the residues resolved in the inward structure [PDB ID 8T60]. The superposition of the outward- and inward-facing MelB<sub>St</sub> exhibited rmsd of all atoms of 5.035 Å (<bold>sFig. 10a)</bold>, and the major displacement exists at both ends of transmembrane helices. The alignment based on the N-terminal positions 2-200 or the C-terminal positions 231-432 exhibits a clear difference in the angle of the domain packing (<bold>sFig. 10b&amp;c)</bold>. The focused alignment of positions 2-200 or 231-432 exhibits greatly reduced rmsd values (<bold>sFig. 10d&amp;e</bold>). The N-terminal domains at both conformations are virtually the same, especially for the helices-I, -II, and -IV that host the sugar- and cation-specificity determinant pockets (<bold>sFig. 10f</bold>). Some structural rearrangements within 3-5 Å exist in the C-terminal bundle, especially on both ends of cavity-lining helices (VII, VIII, X, and XI) and their link or extended loop (<bold>sFig. 10g&amp;h</bold>). Thus, the conformational changes between the outward- and inward-facing states can be adequately described by a rocker-switch-like movement with some structural rearrangements in the C-terminal bundle as indicated in <bold>sFig.11</bold>.</p>

<p>The two structures clearly reveal the two essential barriers critical for substrate translocation, the thicker inner barrier in the outward structure and the thinner outer barrier in the inward structure (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a&amp;c</xref></bold>). The core of the inner barrier is formed by three-helix pairs from both domains (V/VIII, IV/X, and back II/XI), and stabilized by an extensive charged network (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. The N-terminal Arg141 (helix-V) forms salt-bridge interactions with the C-terminal Asp351 and Asp354 (helix-X), and this core interaction links with four other charged residues to stabilize the cytoplasmic closure by forming an inner barrier. In addition, the inner barrier is also stabilized by two peripheral amphiphilic helices at the cytoplasmic side (in the middle loop and the C-terminal tail) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>). The entire middle loop<sub>6-7</sub> across the two domains interact with broader areas (the N-terminal loop<sub>2-3</sub>, loop<sub>4-5</sub>, and helices-II &amp; -IV, as well as the C-terminal loop<sub>10-11</sub>, helices-X &amp; - XI, and the C-terminal tail).

<p>The core of the outer barrier in the inward-facing structure also is also formed by three-helical pairs from both domains (V/VIII, I/VII, and II/XI) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref></bold>). The longest loop<sub>11-12</sub> at the periplasmic side moves into the middle area and forms contacts with helices-I and -VII, sealing the periplasmic opening. Notably, helical pair I/VII or IV/X is only involved in the outer or inner barrier, respectively, and the other two cavity-lining helical pairs (V/VIII and II/XI) are engaged in both barriers (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 bc&amp;ef</xref></bold>). The contact area between the two bundles at the periplasmic side of 1435 Å<sup>2</sup> is much smaller. These structural features further supported that the outward-facing state is more stable than the inward-facing MelB<sub>St</sub>. In the inward-facing conformation, all of the salt-bridge interactions are broken (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b&amp;e</xref></bold>), and the Arg141 and Lys138 engage in the binding of Nb725_4 (<bold>sFig. 8c</bold>). Therefore, this cytoplasmic-side charged network is the inner barrier-specific.</p>
<p>Assessed by the sugar-bound structure (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref></bold>), the substrate-binding pocket is outlined by Trp128 and Trp 342 on the inner barrier and Tyr26 on the outer barrier (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>; sFig. 10f</bold>), part of both barriers. Notably, the major binding residues that involve the multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions with the galactosyl moiety are only part of the inner barrier. In the inward-facing state, the inner barrier is broken, which exposes the binding site to the cytoplasm and also results in the interruption of the sugar-binding pocket (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>)</bold>. The C-terminal binding residues moved away due to the displacement of the backbone of helices-X/XI, and the sugar-binding residues become loosely organized with a low sugar-binding affinity. The structural features indicated that the molecular mechanisms for the sugar translocation simply result from the barrier switch generating a low sugar-affinity inward state of MelB. The outer barrier does not contain residues essential for galactoside binding, so the break of the outer barrier has a much less profound effect on the sugar-binding affinity.</p>

Most Nb725_4 binding residues are not covered except for Lys138 and Arg141 on a corner of the binding stretch. Depending upon the exchange rate and response to the binding of Nb725_4, the MelB<sub>St</sub> HDX can be categorized into four groups.</p>
<p><underline>Group-I</underline> peptides show low-level HDX exchange rates and Nb725_4 afforded complete inhibition for up to at least 50 min (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, blue</bold>). These peptides are located in transmembrane helices, middle-loop helix, and C-terminal periplasmic loops across both domains and most are clustered at the cavity-lining helices. <underline>Group II</underline> peptides show faster deuterium uptake over time (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, deep olive</bold>). The Nb725_4 binding affords small to moderate protections. The group-II peptides are spotted at three cytoplasmic regions; interestingly, all surround the helix-X, which plays a critical role in the stability of the inner barrier. At the inward-facing structure, most of those residues are either missing or poorly resolved. The deuterium uptakes in the Nb725_4-bound MelB<sub>St</sub> complex likely result from structural flexibility.</p>
<p><underline>Group-III</underline> peptides show higher-level HDX exchange rates of greater than 60% for both bound and free states even at 30 sec (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, yellow drawing</bold>). Nb725_4 only affords short-time, weak protections. They are located in the C-terminal tail unstructured region, and most of them are structurally unresolved due to severe disorders. <underline>Group-VI</underline> peptide only contains the short N-terminal tail showing a medium-level uptake (40-50%) across all labeling times, and Nb725_4 affords a slight deprotection due to allosteric changes upon the Nb725_4 binding (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, red</bold>). The results show that Group III and IV peptides covering both tails are solvent-accessible dynamic regions, which is consistent with the notion that they play little role in transport-critical conformational transitions.</p>
<p>The HDX data of the first two groups were further analyzed. Among the five group-I and four group-II members with faster exchanges as judged by the shortest reaction time of 30 sec (<bold>sFig. 11b)</bold>, except for the two periplasmic loop<sub>7-8</sub> (peptide 261-271) and loop<sub>9-10</sub> (peptide 317-326), others are clustered on the cytoplasmic side. In the outward-facing structure (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>)</bold>, the spotted peptides pack against one another: helix-V (peptide 137-150) with helix-VIII (peptide 284-289), and the middle-loop helix (peptide 220-233) with helix-X (peptide 364-368). All surround the conformation-dependent charged network. Notably, this short peptide 137-150 links the sugar-binding residue Arg149 to the charged network by residues Lys138, Arg141, and Glu142 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref></bold>). In the inward-facing structure (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>)</bold>, these packed helices were moved against one another. Therefore, these higher dynamic regions may play important roles in responding to the ligand binding and initiating the global conformational transition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Formation and stabilization of a high-energy inward-facing conformation of MelB<sub>St</sub> in a form suitable for structure determination by cryoEM-SPA was a technically-challenging sample preparation problem, which we solved by the formation of a complex of MelB<sub>St</sub> with a conformation-selective binder and fiducial NabFab. The resulting structure, a high-energy inward-facing, low sugar-affinity state of MelB<sub>St</sub> with a bound Na<sup>+</sup>, represents the intracellular sugar-releasing/rebinding state in the stepped-binding model for the mechanism of coupled transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>(<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref></bold>). Our previous results on the cooperativity of binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> supported the contention that Na<sup>+</sup> binding increases the melibiose affinity to allow melibiose uptake at lower available concentrations, a critical evolved mechanism for cation-coupled transporters. The new Na<sup>+</sup>-bound sugar-releasing inward-facing cryoEM structure provides a structural basis to support the model based on a sequential process in which the sugar binds first and releases second (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>The alternating-access movement has been widely used to describe the conformational change of transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. This description focuses on how the substrates access their binding site or leave the protein. The core symport mechanism for coupled substrate translocations is the mobile barrier involving the inner and outer barriers as proposed originally by Peter Mitchell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a&amp;d</xref></bold>). Our binding thermodynamic cycle study on the determination of heat capacity change (Δ<italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub>) showed positive values with the binding of one substrate (suggesting the dominance of hydrations and opening of the transporter), and negative values with the second substrate binding (suggesting dehydration and transition to the occluded intermediate state at step-3) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref></bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The data fit well with a barrier mechanism that both prevents a single substrate molecule from crossing the protein and favors obligatory co-translocation. When this inner barrier breaks as a result of the conformational switch induced by the binding of two substrates, the sugar-binding specific pocket which is part of this inner barrier also breaks (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref></bold>), creating the intracellular sugar low-affinity state and the sugar-releasing path. Collectively, based on structural and thermodynamical analyses, all show that cooperative binding is integral to barrier switching in the core symport mechanism.</p>
<p>For substrate translocation, historically, a two-binding-site model was proposed: a high-affinity site at the outer surface and a low-affinity site at the inner surface. In this functional and structural paradigm, a substrate molecule moves across the protein from its high-affinity binding site to a low-affinity site for subsequent release. This canonical model has been challenged in LacY as the same binding affinity was measured at both the inner and outer surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, and a single substrate-binding site was also observed in its 3D structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup><sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, a single-binding site in the middle of the protein has been the current canonical model. As described, there are two binding affinities detected, dependent upon the co-transported cation, in MelB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. One of the major challenges in measuring the substrate binding in membrane transporters is the intrinsic dynamic feature of the transport proteins, which makes it difficult to attribute the outcome to a specific state.</p>
<p>As substrate binding affinity measured in a bulk sample is an average of binding affinities from all of the individual molecules in a distribution, it is challenging to establish a correlation between measured binding affinities and experimentally-determined structures. We approached this problem by using the conformation-specific binding protein Nb725_4 to decouple the binding and conformational dynamics shifting conformers to a single state or a narrowed cluster, i.e., through experimental modulation of the distribution. The complementary results of the structure and binding affinities permitted the extension of the current single substrate-binding site (and single affinity) model to a more refined model of one site possessing conformation-dependent higher-affinity and lower-affinity states. Identification of the critical inward-open lower-affinity state of the sugar-binding site is significant for understanding the molecular basis of higher intracellular substrate accumulation.</p>
<p>The shared cation site for Na<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, or H<sup>+</sup>, which is hosted only by the N-terminal two helices (II and IV), is in close proximity but not part of the mobile barrier at either outward- and inward- facing state. Consistently, the simulated Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site at both conformations is virtually identical (<bold>sFig. 9</bold>), which is in stark contrast to the conformation-dependent sugar binding in MelB<sub>St</sub>, and this observation could suggest a mechanism for ensuring the reversible reaction by adapting to the <italic>E. coli</italic> intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis maintained to 3-5 mM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. The measured Na<sup>+</sup> binding affinity to the Nb-trapped MelB<sub>St</sub> is slightly better than the apo state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, which may be modulated by the Nb binding.</p>
<p>To interrogate the structural dynamics of MelB<sub>St</sub> and conformational switch mechanisms, an HDX-MS comparability study in the absence or presence of the conformational Nb725_4 was performed. This powerful approach for characterizing protein conformational flexibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> has recently been applied to membrane transport proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Under experimental conditions, two major parameters (solvent accessibility and hydrogen protonation) contribute to the H/D exchange rate. The residual plot clearly indicates that the major effects of Nb725_4 binding are to restrain the conformational dynamics of MelB<sub>St</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>). Stronger protections are observed at both transmembrane helix bundles, especially both ends of the cavity-lining helices (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, blue</bold>), which marks the most conformationally dynamic regions that correlate to the conformational transition in MelB<sub>St</sub>. Notably, the Nb-free Na<sup>+</sup>-bound WT MelB<sub>St</sub> exists in both outward- and inward-facing conformations with a bias towards the outward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and the MelB<sub>St</sub> in the Nb725_4 complex exists only as an inward-facing conformational ensemble. Therefore, differences observed by HDX-MS between the two samples in the absence and presence of Nb725_4 likely encode both MelB<sub>St</sub> conformational motions and conformational transitions.</p>
<p>While the resolution of HDX is at a peptide level, the data showed marked effects on two well-conserved cytoplasmic helices of MFS transporters (the middle loop and C-terminal tail). Those peripheral amphiphilic helices are likely to play important roles in the stability of the inner barrier necessary. Consistently, a recent atomic force microscopy study has shown that the middle loop becomes loosely packed in the presence of both sugar and cation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As described, the peptide 137-150 of helix-V contains a sugar-binding residue Arg149 and three conformation-critical residues Lys138, Arg141, and Glu142 in the inner barrier-specific charged network (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). Extensive site-directed mutagenesis and second-site suppression showed that this charged network play important role in the conformational changes and the mutations at all three Arg at positions 141, 295 and 363 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>) can be substantially rescued by a single mutation D35E (helix-I) located at the other side of the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Arg141 and Glu142 of <italic>E. coli</italic> MelB have been shown to participate in the conformational transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Pro148 has been identified by second-site mutation to reduce the transport <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of a <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> elevated mutant by modulating the rate of conformational change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Thus, the helix-V dynamic region (peptide 137-150) could link the sugar-binding pocket with the inner barrier-specific salt-bridge network. Together with the interactions with the dynamic regions (residues 284-289) of helix-VIII, the substrate binding occupancy could be propagated, via an allosteric mechanism, from the sugar-binding pocket to the cytoplasmic peripheral helices as a pre-transition for the opening of the transporter to the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>All of the conformation-selective nanobodies (Nb725, Nb733, and the hybrid Nb725_4) are expected to bind MelB<sub>St</sub> similarly and trap it at the high-energy state, which is consistent with the observation of very low-frequency occurrence during Nbs selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Extensive analyses and comparisons with the regulatory protein EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binding to MelB<sub>St</sub> revealed that these Nbs binding mimics the regulatory effect imposed by EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Further, the Nbs and EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> can concurrently interact with MelB<sub>St</sub>, so there are two spatially discrete binding sites for the two types of binders at the inward-facing conformation. Therefore, the inward-facing structure determined by cryoEM-SPA mimics the regulatory state of MelB during the catabolite repression mechanism, a mechanism that allows the bacteria to selectively utilize favored glucose among a mixture of different carbon sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that the mobile barrier mechanism plays a central role in substate translocation, the barrier dynamics are modulated by the cooperative binding of substrates, and the inner/outer barrier shifting directly regulates the sugar-binding affinity, with no effect on the cation-binding site. Further, we also proposed that the functional inhibition of this MFS transporter by the central regulatory protein EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is achieved by trapping MelB<sub>St</sub> in a low-sugar affinity inward-facing state. Overall, our studies provide substantial information to explain the obligatorily coupled transport of Na<sup>+</sup> and sugar substrate in structural and dynamic terms collectively.</p>

All samples were buffer-matched by simultaneously dialyzed in the same buffer, or diluting the concentrated small molecule ligands to corresponding dialysis buffers as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. The titrand (MelB<sub>St</sub>) placed in the ITC Sample Cell was titrated with the specified titrant (placed in the Syringe) by an incremental injection of 1.5 <bold>-</bold> 2 μL aliquots at an interval of 300 sec at a constant stirring rate of 250 rpm. All samples were degassed by a TA Instruments Degassing Station (model 6326) for 15 min prior to the titration. Heat changes were collected at 25 °C, and data processing was performed with the NanoAnalyze (v. 3.7.5 software) provided with the instrument. The normalized heat changes were subtracted from the heat of dilution elicited by the last few injections, where no further binding occurred, and the corrected heat changes were plotted against the mole ratio of titrant versus titrand. The values for the binding association constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>) were obtained by fitting the data using the one-site independent-binding model included in the NanoAnalyze software (version 3.7.5), and the dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) = 1/<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>. In most cases, the binding stoichiometry (<italic>N</italic>) number was fixed to 1.</p>

<title>Protein complex preparation for grid vitrification</title>
<p>Proteins NabFab, Nb725_4, anti-Fab Nb were mixed at a mole ratio of 1:1.1:1.15. The final complex was obtained by adding WT MelB<sub>St</sub> in nanodiscs based on a mole ratio of 1:1.6 of MelB<sub>St</sub>:NabFab complex. The sample was expected to contain 6 μM MelB<sub>St</sub>, 12 μM MPS1E3D1, 9.5 μM NabFab complex in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl (∼1.5 mg/mL). The complex was also analyzed by gel-filtration chromatography using GE Superdex 200 column on a BioRad NGC Chromatography System. Peak fractions were examined by SDS-15% PAGE stained by silver nitrate.</p>

<title>Grids vitrification and single-particle cryoEM data acquisition</title>
<p>Grids preparation and data collection were carried out in S<sup>2</sup>C<sup>2</sup> (Menlo Park, CA). The WT MelB<sub>St</sub>/Nb725_4/NabFab/anti-NabFab Nb complex was thawed out from −80 °C storage. Aliquots of 3 μL of samples at 0.75 mg/ml or 1.5 mg/ml protein concentration were placed on 300-mesh Cu holey carbon grids (Quantifoil, R1.2/1.3) after glow-discharge (PELCO easiGlow™) at 15 mA for 30 sec, and blotted on two sides for 3 sec at 4 °C and 100% humidity before vitrified in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher). The grids were subsequently transferred to a Titan Krios (G3i) electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) operating at 300 kV and equipped with K3 direct electron detector (Gatan) and BioQuantum energy filter. The best grids were found from the sample at 1.5 mg/ml concentration.</p>
<p>A total of 14,094 and 8715 movies were automatically collected using the EPU Data Acquisition Software (Thermo Fisher) for non-tilted and 30-degree tilted collections, respectively. Both datasets were collected at a 0.86 Å pixel size and a dose of 50 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>−2</sup> across 40 frames (0.0535 or 0.07025 sec per frame for the non-tilted and tilted data collection, respectively) at a dose rate of approximately 23.36 or 17.8 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively. A set of defocus values was applied ranging from −0.8, −1.0, −1.2, −1.4, or −1.8 μm with an energy filter slit width of 20 eV and a 100 μm objective aperture.</p>

<title>Single-particle data processing</title>
<p>All cryoEM single-particle data processing was performed using CryoSPARC program (v. 2 – 4.01) (<bold>sFig. 4</bold>). All imported movies were aligned using defaulted Patch Motion Correction and followed with defaulted Patch contrast transfer function (CTF) Estimation. Micrographs were then curated based on CFT Estimation, astigmatism, and ice thickness, which resulted in 13,649 and 7,129 micrographs for the non-tilted and 30-degree tilted datasets, respectively.</p>
<p>Initially, particle picking from the 2000 micrographs was performed using Blob Picker using 120 and 160 Å for the minimal and maximal particle diameters, respectively, in the CryoSPARC program (<bold>sFig. 4a)</bold>. A total of 1,087,124 particles were selected and extracted with a box size of 256 pixels. After 2 runs of 2D Classification, five classes were selected as imputing templates in Template Picker. A total of resultant 9,103,229 particles from 13,649 micrographs were extracted with a box size of 384 pixels bin 92 pixels and subjected to iterative rounds of 2D Classification. The yielded 1,245,734 particles were re-extracted at a box size of 416 pixels. After further sorting using 2D Classification, the highly selected 338,883 particles, which clearly contained nanodisc-surrounding MelB<sub>St</sub> bound with Nb725_4/NabFab/anti-NabFab Nb, were used for Ab-Initio 3D Reconstruction. One out of 5 Ab-Initio classes contained the expected super-complex from a total of 93,693 particles, which allowed for a 3.80 Å volume to be reconstructed using Non-uniform Refinement. The 93,693 particles were then further sorted using heterogeneous refinement with input volumes created by multiclass Ab-initio to a subset of 41,264 particles, which allowed a 3.49 Å volume to be reconstructed using Non-uniform Refinement with a static mask prepared from one of the volumes. This map was successfully used to build the initial model of all four proteins; however, this map was anisotropic and lacked some orientations in angular space. To improve the map quality, two strategies were applied including reprocessing this dataset and performing tilted data collection. The hand of the 3.49 Å volume was changed and used to generate 50 templates.</p>
<p>Template Pick using the 50 templated was applied to the 13,649 micrographs, which generated 7,632,727 particles (<bold>sFig. 4b)</bold>. After extraction at a box size of 384 pixels bin 92 pixels and iterative rounds of 2D Classification and Heterogeneous Refinement, 370,941 particles were selected and re-extract at a box size of 384 pixels. This 370,941-particle set was combined with the previously identified 41,264-particle set after extraction at a box size of 384 pixels and removed duplicate, the subset of 188,566 particles exhibited slightly improved directional distribution. To further explore the first data collection, the previously rejected 2D classes were analyzed and 214,522 particles were selected based on orientation. After combined and iterative rounds of 2D Classification, Heterogeneous Refinement, and Local Refinement, a subset of the 196,254-particle set supported a 3.39 Å volume to be reconstructed using local refinement, and the directional distribution of the map is further improved.</p>
<p>A tilted data collection on the same microscopy and parameter settings was performed with a 30-degree tilt (<bold>sFig. 4c)</bold>. A total number of 7,129 micrographs were obtained. The 50-templates were used for particle pick, which yielded 2,887,147 particles after curation. The particles were extracted using a box size of 384 bin 96 pixels. After 3-run 2D Classification and followed 3-run Heterogeneous Refinement using the 3.39 Å volumes and the other two Ab-initio volumes, a subset of 544,531 particles were re-extracted using a box size of 384 pixels. After further iterative rounds of 2D Classification, Heterogeneous Refinement, and Local Refinement, 182,101 particles were obtained for the tilted collection, which could support a 4.01 Å volume using Local Refinement and directional distribution focused on the missing angles in the first dataset.</p>
<p>A total number of 378,355 polished particles from both non-tilted and 30-degree tilted data acquisition were used to reconstruct a 3.40 Å volume using Local Refinement, and the 30-degree tilted data filled the missing particle orientations but the resolution was not improved. The particles were subjected to 3D Classifications using a target resolution of 3.3 Å and 10 classes and the highest resolution classes were collected. The final collected 296,925-particle set supported a 3.37 Å volume to be reconstructed using Local Refinement and a static mask covering MelB<sub>St</sub>, Nb725_4, and NabFab. The reporting GSFSC resolution of 3.29 Å was calculated by Validation (FSC) using the two half maps, and the particle distribution was calculated by ThereDFSC (<bold>sFig. 5</bold>).</p>
<p>The initial mask for Non-uniformed Refinement was created in UCSF ChimeraX using the volume generated from Ab-Initio 3D Reconstruction which covered the full complex. The refinement masks for final-stage Local Refinement only covered MelB<sub>St</sub>, Nb725_4, and NabFab and filtered at a low pass to 10 Å and soft padding width of 10. The 3D Classification used the full-covered mask as the solvent mask and the refinement masks in the Local Refinement as the focus mask.</p>
<p>Local Refinement set the initial low pass resolution of 8 Å, use of pose/shift Gaussian prior during alignment, Rotation search extent of 9 °, and Shift search extent of 6 Å. The final 3.29 Å volume was sharpened in Phenex auto_sharpen program<sup>71</sup>default setting for model refinement.</p>

<title>Model building and structure refinement</title>
<p>The initial model building was carried out based on the 3.45 Å reconstruction map obtained from the first dataset. The coordinates of MelB<sub>St</sub> D59C (PDB ID 7L17), NabFab and anti-NabFab Nb (PDB ID 7PHP), and a sequence-based 3-D model generated by AlphaFold 2 were fitted into the map in UCSF ChimeraX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. The N-terminal helices of MelB<sub>St</sub> fit well and the C-terminal helices were manually fitted into the initial map. The sequence of MelB<sub>St</sub> D59C was mutated back to wild type in COOT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. All 4 chains were changed to poly-Ala peptides and the side chains of each residue were rebuilt. Structure refinement was performed using phenix.real_space_refine application in PHENIX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> in real space with secondary structure and geometry restraints.</p>
<p>The model was refined against the final map at a resolution of 3.29 Å after sharpening using PHENIX auto_sharpen program default setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. A cation Na<sup>+</sup> was modeled in the density between helices-II and -IV in COOT. After runs of refinement and remodeling, in total, 417 residues of MelB<sub>St</sub> (positions 2-210, 219-355, and 364-432), with 6 unassigned side-chains at the C-terminal domain (Leu293, Tyr355, Arg363, Tyr369, Tyr396, and Met410) due to the map disorder, 122 residues of Nb725_4 (2-123), 229 residues of NabFab H-chain (1-214), and 210 residues of NabFab L-chain (4-213), were modeled, respectively. There are three MelB<sub>St</sub> regions with missing densities including the middle loop righter after the Nb binding site (positions 211-218), loop<sub>10-11</sub> (356-361), and the C-terminal tail after residue Tyr432. In addition, the densities between positions 219-230 and regions close to the missing densities at loop<sub>10-11</sub> are very weak. Statistics of the map reconstruction and model refinement can be found in <bold>sTable 1</bold>. The model-map fitting quality was evaluated by <italic>Q</italic> score program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Pymol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> and UCSF chimera or ChimeraX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> were used to prepare the figures.</p>

<title>All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations</title>
<p>All-atom MD simulations were performed taking the inward-facing CryoEM structure as the starting model. Atom coordinates in the loops missing from the CryoEM structure were filled in using homology modeling with the Modeller software package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Subsequently, the protein was embedded into a lipid bilayer composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), and cardiolipin (CDL), in a molar ratio of 7:2:1 for POPE:POPG:CDL, mimicking the membrane composition of <italic>E. coli.</italic> Each side of the lipid bilayer was then enclosed by a box of water molecules with 25 Å thickness. Sodium chloride ions were introduced among these water molecules to yield a solution with an approximate concentration of 0.16 M. The system setup was performed via the CHARMMGUI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> web interface. The all-atom MD simulations for the outward-facing MelB<sub>St</sub> under the same setup have been reported by constructing through an in-silico mutation, converting the outward-facing crystal structure of the D59C MelB<sub>St</sub> mutant (PDB ID 7L16) back to the WT MelB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. In both the inward and outward-facing configurations, a sodium ion was initially situated in the binding site, while melibiose was notably absent from the system. Each system underwent initial optimization where the heavy atoms of proteins and lipids were harmonically restrained, employing a force constant of 1000 kJ/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>. This was followed by 100 picoseconds (ps) of dynamics at a temperature of 300 K in the constant NVT ensemble. Subsequently, the restraints were gradually reduced during 10 ns of dynamics in the constant NPT ensemble, maintained at a temperature of 300 K and pressure of 1 atm. For equilibration, we carried out an additional 30 ns of dynamics in the NPT ensemble under the same conditions, but without any restraints. After the equilibration stage, 1 μs of dynamics was performed in the constant NPT ensemble, under the same temperature and pressure, to generate the production trajectories. We maintained the temperature using a Langevin thermostat with a friction coefficient of 1 ps<sup>-1</sup>. The trajectory was propagated with a timestep of 2 femtoseconds (fs), and all bonds involving a hydrogen atom were constrained. The CHARMM36 force field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> was utilized to simulate the protein, lipid, and ions throughout all simulations. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method, with a tolerance of 5 x 10<sup>-4</sup>. We set the cutoff for van der Waals interactions at 12 Å. The TIP3P model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> was used to treat water molecules and ions. All classical MD simulations were performed using the OPENMM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> software package.</p>

<title>Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS)</title>
<p>In-solution pairwise HDX-MS experiment was performed to study the structural dynamics of MelB<sub>St</sub>. Labeling, quenching, lipids removal, and online digestion were achieved using a fully automated manner using HDx3 extended parallel system (LEAP Technologies, Morrisville, NC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Working samples of MelB<sub>St</sub> and MelB<sub>St</sub> complexed with Nb725_4 were prepared to a concentration of 50.0 μM for MelB<sub>St</sub> and 100 μM for Nb725_4 in a buffer of 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% DDM in H<sub>2</sub>O. Aliquots of 4 µl of each working sample were diluted by 10-fold into the labeling buffer of 25 mM Tris-HCl, pD 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% DDM in D<sub>2</sub>O. The reactions were incubated in D<sub>2</sub>O buffer at 20 °C for multiple time points (30 sec, 300 sec, and 3000 sec) in triplicates and non-deuterated controls were prepared in a similar manner except H<sub>2</sub>O buffer was used in the labeling step. The pH of the labeling buffer was measured with a pH meter mounted with a glass electrode and then corrected to pD (pD = pH + 0.4).</p>
<p>The reactions were quenched at given time points by adding the same volume of ice-cold 6 M urea, 100 mM citric acid, pH, 2.3 in water for 180 seconds at 0 °C and immediately subjected to a lipid filtration module containing ZrO<sub>2</sub> available on the LEAP PAL system. After incubation of 60 sec, the LEAP X-Press then compressed the filter assembly to separate proteins from the ZrO2 particles-bound phospholipids and detergents. The filtered protein sample was injected into a cool box for online digestion and separation.</p>
<p>LC/MS bottom-up HDX was performed using a Thermo Scientific™ Ultimate™ 3000 UHPLC system and Thermo Scientific<sup>TM</sup> Orbitrap Eclipse<sup>TM</sup> Tribrid<sup>TM</sup> mass spectrometer. Samples were digested with a Nepenthesin-2 (Affipro, Czech Republic) column at 8 °C for 180 sec and then trapped in a 1.0 mm x 5.0 mm, 5.0 µm trap cartridge for desalting. Peptides were then separated on a Thermo Scientific™ Hypersil Gold<sup>TM</sup>, 50 x1 mm, 1.9 µm, C18 column with a gradient of 10 % to 40 % gradient (A: water, 0.1 % formic acid; B: acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid) gradient for 15 minutes at a flow rate of 40 µL/min. To limit carry-over issues, a pepsin wash was added in between runs. To limit the back-exchange of hydrogen, all of the quenching, trapping, and separation steps were performed at near 0 °C.</p>
<p>For data analysis, a nonspecific digested peptide database was created for MelB<sub>St</sub> with separate tandem mass spectrometry measurements of non-deuterated samples. Digested peptides from undeuterated MelB<sub>St</sub> protein were identified on the orbitrap mass spectrometer using the same LC gradient as the HDX-MS experiment with a combination of data-dependent and targeted HCD-MS2 acquisition. Using the Thermo BioPharma Finder software (v 5.1), MS2 spectra were matched to the MelB<sub>St</sub> sequence with fixed modifications. Altogether 153 peptide assignments (confident HDX data cross all labeling times) were confirmed for MelB <sub>St</sub> samples giving 86% sequence coverage. MS data files were processed using the Sierra Analytics HDExaminer software with the MelB<sub>St</sub> peptide database. Following the automated HDX-MS analysis, manual curation was performed. Upon the completion of the data review, a single charge state with high-quality spectra for all replicates across all HDX labeling times was chosen to represent HDX for each peptide. Differential HDX data were tested for statistical significance using the hybrid significance testing criteria method with an in-house MATLAB script, where the HDX differences at different protein states were calculated (ΔD = D<sub>Nb725_4-bound</sub> – D<sub>Nb-free</sub>). D denotes deuteration, defined as the mass increase above the average mass of the undeuterated peptide. Mean HDX differences from the three replicates were assigned as significant according to the hybrid criteria based on the pooled standard deviation and Welch’s t-test with P &lt; 0.01. The statistically significant differences observed at each residue (ie., ΔD ≥ 0.3184 for this study) were used to map HDX consensus effects based on overlapping peptides onto the structure models. Residue-level data analysis was performed using a built-in function in BioPharma Finder software. The parameters included the number of simulations of 200, recorded solutions of 20, Chi2 increase by the larger of smooth absolute of 0, smother relative of 2, differential absolute of 0, and differential relative of 2.</p>

<p>Summary:
The current study reports a cryo-EM structure of MFS transporter MelB trapped in an inward-facing state by a conformationally selective nanobody. The authors compare this structure to previously-resolved crystal structures of outward-facing MelB. Additionally, the authors report H/D exchange/ mass spec experiments that identify accessible residues in the protein.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors overcame very significant technical challenges to solve the first inward-facing structure of the small, model MFS transporter MelB by cryo-EM. The use of conformation-trapping nanobodies (which had been reported previously by this group) is particularly nice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Maps and coordinates were not provided by the authors, which presents a gap in this assessment.</p>
<p>The authors highlight the use of HDX experiments as a measurement of protein conformational dynamics. However, this experiment does not measure the conformational dynamics of the transporter, since in these experiments exchange is not initiated by ligand addition or another trigger. The experiment instead measures the accessibility of different residues, and of course, a freely-exchanging sodium bound transporter would have more exchangeable positions than when a conformation-trapping nanobody is bound. It is not clear what new mechanistic information this provides, since this property of the nanobody has already been established.</p>
<p>Based on the evidence presented, it is somewhat speculative that the structure represents the EIIa-bound regulatory state.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Hariharan and colleagues present an elegant study regarding the mechanistic basis of sugar transport by the prototypical Na+-coupled transporter MelB. The authors identified a nanobody (Nb 725) that reduces melibiose binding but not Na+ binding. In vitro (ITC) experiments suggest that the conformation targeted by this nanobody is different from the published outward-open structures. They go on to solve the structure of this other conformational by cryo-EM using the Nanobody grafted with a fiducial marker and enhancer and, as predicted, capture a new conformation of MelB, namely the inward-open conformation. Through MD simulations and ITC measurements, they demonstrate that such state has a reduced affinity for sugar but that Na+ binding is mostly unaffected. A detailed observation and comparison between previously published structures in the outward-open conformation and this new conformational intermediate allows to strengthen and develop the mobile barrier hypothesis underpinning sugar transport. The conformational transition to the inward-facing state leads to the formation of a barrier on the extracellular side that directly affects the amino acid arrangement of the sugar binding site, leading to a decreased affinity that drives the direction of transport. In contrast, the Na+ binding remains the same. This structural data is complemented with dynamic insights from HDX-MS experiments conducted in the presence and absence of the Nb. These measurements highlight the overall protective effect of nanobody binding, consistent with the stabilization of one conformational intermediate.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experimental strategy to isolate this elusive conformational intermediate is smart and well-executed. The biochemical and biophysical data were obtained in a lipid system (nanodiscs), which allows dismissing questions about detergent induced artefacts. The new conformation observed is of great interest and allows to have a better mechanistic understanding of ion-coupled sugar transport. The comparison between the two structures and the mobile barrier mechanism hypothesis is convincingly depicted and tested.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This is excellent experimental work. My recommendations stem mostly from concerns regarding the interpretation of the observed results. In particular, I am somewhat puzzled by the important role the authors give to the regulatory protein EIIa with little structural or biophysical data to back up their claims. The hypothesis that the conformation captured by the Nb is physiologically and functionally equivalent to that caused by EIIa binding is definitely a worthy hypothesis, but it is not an experimental result.</p>
<p>Evidence in support could include a structure with EIIa bound. Since it does not bind at the same location as the Nb, it seems feasible. Or, the authors could have performed HDX-MS in the presence of EIIa to determine if the effect is similar to that of Nb_725 binding. In the absence of these experiments, discussion about EIIa should be limited. Along the same lines, I find it misleading to put in the abstract a sentence such as &quot;It is the first structure of a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter with experimentally determined cation binding, and also a structure mimicking the physiological regulatory state of MelB under the global regulator EIIAGlc of the glucose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate:phosphotransferase system.&quot; None of this is supported by the experimental work presented in this article: the Na+ is modelled (with great confidence, but still) and whether this structure mimics the physiological state of MelB bound to EIIa is not known. The results of the paper are strong and interesting enough per se, and there is no need to inflate them with hypothesis that belongs to the discussion section.</p>
<p>I also note that the HDX-MS experiments do not distinguish between two conformational states, but rather an ensemble of states vs one state.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript authored by Lan Guan and colleagues reveals the structure of the cytosol-facing conformation of the MelB sodium/Li coupled permease using the nab-Fab approach and cryoEM for structure determination. The study reveals the conformational transitions in the melB transport cycle and allows understanding the role of sugar and ion specificities within this transporter.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study employs a very exciting strategy of transferring the CDRS of a conformation specific nano body to the nab-fab system to determine the inward-open structure of MelB. The resolution of the structure is reasonable enough to support the major conclusions of the study. This is overall a well-executed study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors seem to have mixed up the exothermic and endothermic aspects of ITC binding in their description. Positive heats correspond to endothermic heat changes in ITC and negative heat changes correspond to exothermic heats. The authors seem to suggest the opposite. This is consistently observed throughout the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary: The current study reports a cryo-EM structure of MFS transporter MelB trapped in an inward-facing state by a conformationally selective nanobody. The authors compare this structure to previously-resolved crystal structures of outward-facing MelB. Additionally, the authors report H/D exchange/ mass spec experiments that identify accessible residues in the protein.</p>
<p>Strengths: The authors overcame very significant technical challenges to solve the first inward-facing structure of the small, model MFS transporter MelB by cryo-EM. The use of conformation-trapping nanobodies (which had been reported previously by this group) is particularly nice.</p>

<p>We appreciate reviewer #1’s positive comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses: Maps and coordinates were not provided by the authors, which presents a gap in this assessment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We didn’t know specific requests for maps &amp; coordinates during the initial submission but will provide them per request.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors highlight the use of HDX experiments as a measurement of protein conformational dynamics. However, this experiment does not measure the conformational dynamics of the transporter, since in these experiments exchange is not initiated by ligand addition or another trigger. The experiment instead measures the accessibility of different residues, and of course, a freely-exchanging sodium bound transporter would have more exchangeable positions than when a conformation-trapping nanobody is bound. It is not clear what new mechanistic information this provides, since this property of the nanobody has already been established.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for your comment. We will address your and reviewer 2’s similar questions later.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Based on the evidence presented, it is somewhat speculative that the structure represents the EIIa-bound regulatory state.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that have presented convincing evidence obtained by ITC and gel-filtration chromatography to support this statement.  The effects of Nb725 or EIIAGlc on MelB functions are similar: little change in Na+ binding, little change in Nb725 or EIIAGlc binding in the absence or presence of the EIIAGlc or Nb725, but a great reduction in sugar-binding affinity (sFigs. 2&amp;3; tables 1&amp;2; published two papers in J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 33012-33019 and 2023; 299:104967). To make it clear, we will add the related data from the two JBC papers into the table 2. Nb725 and EIIAGlc can concurrently bind to MelBSt (sFigs. 2&amp;3; tables 1&amp;2). Further, we will provide a new figure to show that a complex composed of all three proteins can be isolated by gel-filtration chromatography. We have also established this finding with another Nb733 from the same family (JBC, 2023; 299:104967). However, given the EIIAGlc-bound structure has not been resolved yet, we will tune down the related argument.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:
In this manuscript, Hariharan and colleagues present an elegant study regarding the mechanistic basis of sugar transport by the prototypical Na+-coupled transporter MelB. The authors identified a nanobody (Nb 725) that reduces melibiose binding but not Na+ binding. In vitro (ITC) experiments suggest that the conformation targeted by this nanobody is different from the published outward-open structures. They go on to solve the structure of this other conformational by cryo-EM using the Nanobody grafted with a fiducial marker and enhancer and, as predicted, capture a new conformation of MelB, namely the inward-open conformation. Through MD simulations and ITC measurements, they demonstrate that such state has a reduced affinity for sugar but that Na+ binding is mostly unaffected. A detailed observation and comparison between previously published structures in the outward-open conformation and this new conformational intermediate allows to strengthen and develop the mobile barrier hypothesis underpinning sugar transport. The conformational transition to the inward-facing state leads to the formation of a barrier on the extracellular side that directly affects the amino acid arrangement of the sugar binding site, leading to a decreased affinity that drives the direction of transport. In contrast, the Na+ binding remains the same. This structural data is complemented with dynamic insights from HDX-MS experiments conducted in the presence and absence of the Nb. These measurements highlight the overall protective effect of nanobody binding, consistent with the stabilization of one conformational intermediate.</p>
<p>Strengths:
The experimental strategy to isolate this elusive conformational intermediate is smart and well-executed. The biochemical and biophysical data were obtained in a lipid system (nanodiscs), which allows dismissing questions about detergent induced artefacts. The new conformation observed is of great interest and allows to have a better mechanistic understanding of ion-coupled sugar transport. The comparison between the two structures and the mobile barrier mechanism hypothesis is convincingly depicted and tested.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful understanding of our novel findings and the associated explanations on the cation-coupled symport mechanisms.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:
This is excellent experimental work. My recommendations stem mostly from concerns regarding the interpretation of the observed results. In particular, I am somewhat puzzled by the important role the authors give to the regulatory protein EIIa with little structural or biophysical data to back up their claims. The hypothesis that the conformation captured by the Nb is physiologically and functionally equivalent to that caused by EIIa binding is definitely a worthy hypothesis, but it is not an experimental result. Evidence in support could include a structure with EIIa bound. Since it does not bind at the same location as the Nb, it seems feasible. Or, the authors could have performed HDX-MS in the presence of EIIa to determine if the effect is similar to that of Nb_725 binding. In the absence of these experiments, discussion about EIIa should be limited. Along the same lines, I find it misleading to put in the abstract a sentence such as &quot;It is the first structure of a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter with experimentally determined cation binding, and also a structure mimicking the physiological regulatory state of MelB under the global regulator EIIAGlc of the glucose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate:phosphotransferase system.&quot; None of this is supported by the experimental work presented in this article: the Na+ is modelled (with great confidence, but still) and whether this structure mimics the physiological state of MelB bound to EIIa is not known. The results of the paper are strong and interesting enough per se, and there is no need to inflate them with hypothesis that belongs to the discussion section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated in the response to reviewer 1, we believe that we presented strong data to argue for a structure mimicking the physiological regulatory state of MelB. The only missing data is the lack of the structure determination of the EIIA-bound state. We will change the title and tune down the related discussions in a new version.</p>
<p>Regarding our statement in our abstract that “It is the first structure of a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter with experimentally determined cation binding”, we believe that our claim is supported by the resolved Na+ binding in the cryoEM structure. So far, to our knowledge, there was no experimentally determined cation on its canonical binding site reported yet.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I also note that the HDX-MS experiments do not distinguish between two conformational states, but rather an ensemble of states vs one state.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will address both reviewers 1 and 2 together. We agree with your comments and we compared the one (inward) state and ensembles of (predominantly outward) states. A lot of published data have demonstrated that the WT MelBSt predominantly populates outward-facing states, especially in the presence of Na+. The major differences in HDX-MS between the inward-facing state in the presence of the Nb and the outward-facing ensembles in the absence of the Nb should be related to the conformational changes between the inward- and outward-facing states, but not quantitatively. The type of measurements we performed do not contain information on the rates of conformational changes, but this study identified the dynamics regions involved in this conformational switch.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:
The manuscript authored by Lan Guan and colleagues reveals the structure of the cytosol-facing conformation of the MelB sodium/Li coupled permease using the nab-Fab approach and cryoEM for structure determination. The study reveals the conformational transitions in the melB transport cycle and allows understanding the role of sugar and ion specificities within this transporter.</p>
<p>Strengths: The study employs a very exciting strategy of transferring the CDRS of a conformation specific nano body to the nab-fab system to determine the inward-open structure of MelB. The resolution of the structure is reasonable enough to support the major conclusions of the study. This is overall a well-executed study.</p>

<p>Thank you for your positive comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses: The authors seem to have mixed up the exothermic and endothermic aspects of ITC binding in their description. Positive heats correspond to endothermic heat changes in ITC and negative heat changes correspond to exothermic heats. The authors seem to suggest the opposite.</p>
<p>This is consistently observed throughout the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All of our ITC data are correctly presented.  Our data were collected from the NanoITC (TA instruments, Inc), which directly measures the heat release/enthalpic changes and projects exotherm with positive values. This is in contrast to the MicroCal device, which detects heat changes through voltage compensation and exotherm is depicted with negative values. We will further emphasize this in related figure legends.</p>
