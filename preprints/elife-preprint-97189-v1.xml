<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a vital role in insect development and maintaining insect larval status. JH is an acyclic sesquiterpenoid known to enter cells freely via diffusion because of its lipid-soluble character (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Riddiford, 2020</xref></italic>). JH binds its intracellular receptor methoprene-tolerant protein (MET), a basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) family protein (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Charles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jindra et al., 2021</xref></italic>). MET forms a transcription complex with the transcription factor Taiman (TAI, also known as FISC, p160/SRC, and is a steroid receptor coactivator) to initiate gene transcription <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Charles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhu et al., 2003</xref></italic>). An important gene in the JH pathway is Krüppel homologue 1 (Kr-h1), which encodes the zinc-finger transcription factor Kr-h1 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Minakuchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pecasse et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wu et al., 2021</xref></italic>). Kr-h1 acts downstream of MET and is induced rapidly by JH to regulate larval growth and development (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Minakuchi et al., 2009</xref></italic>). Other genes, for example, the early trypsin gene of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<italic>AaEt</italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Noriega et al., 2003</xref></italic>), JH-inducible 21 kDa protein (<italic>Jhp21</italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhang et al., 1996</xref></italic>), JH esterase (<italic>Jhe</italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Feng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wroblewski et al., 1990</xref></italic>), vitellogenin (<italic>Vg</italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Comas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Xu et al., 2014</xref></italic>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> JH-inducible gene 1(<italic>Jhi-1</italic>), and JH-inducible gene 26 (<italic>Jhi-26</italic>) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dubrovsky et al., 2000</xref></italic>) are regulated by JH.</p>
<p>However, some studies suggest that cell membrane receptors also play essential roles in JH signaling (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jindra et al., 2021</xref></italic>). For example, in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are involved in JH-induced rapid increases in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, diacylglycerol, and intracellular calcium, leading to activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to phosphorylation of MET and Tai, resulting in <italic>Kr-h1</italic> gene transcription in response to JH (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liu et al., 2015</xref></italic>). JH III, also via RTKs, leads to rapid calcium release and influx in <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> epidermal cells (HaEpi cells) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al., 2016</xref></italic>). JH induces MET1 phosphorylation, increasing MET interaction with TAI, which enhances Kr-h1 transcription in <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2021</xref></italic>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, JH through RTK and PKC protein kinase C (PKC) induces phosphorylation of ultraspiracle (USP) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gao et al., 2022</xref></italic>). The phenomenon that RTK transmits JH signal has long been predicted (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ojani et al., 2016</xref></italic>); however, the RTKs critical for JH signaling have yet to be identified from numerous RTKs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>RTKs constitute a class of cell surface transmembrane proteins that play important roles in mediating extracellular to intracellular signaling. Humans carry approximately 60 RTKs <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Manning et al., 2002</xref></italic>), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes 21 RTK genes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sopko and Perrimon, 2013</xref></italic>), <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> has 20 RTKs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexandratos et al., 2016</xref></italic>), and the <italic>German cockroach</italic> genome identified 16 RTKs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al., 2022</xref></italic>). <italic>H. armigera</italic> has 20 RTK candidates with gene codes in the <italic>H. armigera</italic> genome by our analysis. The cotton bollworm, is a well-known and worldwide distributing agricultural pest in Lepidoptera, which threatens cotton and many other vegetable crops by rapidly producing resistance to various chemical insecticides and Bt-transgenic cotton. Using <italic>H. armigera</italic> as a model, we focus on identifying the RTKs functioning as the JH receptors and demonstrating the mechanism. We screened 20 RTKs in the <italic>H. armigera</italic> genome and determined that cadherin 96ca (CAD96CA) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) have high affinity to JH III and function as JH cell membrane receptors. These data not only improve our knowledge of JH signaling and open the door to studying insect development, but also present new targets to explore the new growth regulators to control the pest.</p>

<p>To identify the RTKs involved in JH III signaling, 20 RTKs of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> were knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi) in HaEpi cells using JH III-induced <italic>Kr-h1</italic>, <italic>Vg</italic>, <italic>Jhi-1</italic>, and <italic>Jhi-26</italic> gene expression as readouts. When <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Drl</italic> (encoding derailed), <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic> (encoding neurotropic receptor kinase), <italic>Vegfr1</italic> (encoding vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1), and <italic>Wsck</italic> were knocked down, respectively, JH III-upregulated expression of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> was decreased. However, knocking down other <italic>Rtks</italic> did not decrease the <italic>Kr-h1</italic> transcription level. When <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Drl</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic>, <italic>Vegfr1</italic>, <italic>Wsck</italic>, and <italic>Inr</italic> (encoding insulin-like receptor) were knocked down, JH III-upregulated expression of <italic>Vg</italic> was decreased. RNAi of RTKs did not affect JH-induced <italic>Jhi-1</italic> expression. When <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic>, and <italic>Vegfr1</italic> were knocked down, JH III-upregulated expression of <italic>Jhi-26</italic> was decreased (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic>). <italic>Rtks</italic> were confirmed to be knocked down significantly in HaEpi cells (<italic><xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref></italic>). Off–target effects of their knockdown were excluded in genes we detected. Off–target genes were selected based on the identity rate of nucleotide sequences (<italic><xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref></italic>). By the primary screening of RNAi, six RTKs, CAD96CA, DRL, FGFR1, NRK, VEGFR1, and WSCK were chosen for further screening.</p>
<p>The tissue–specific and developmental expression profiles of the six selected RTKs were determined using qRT‒PCR to identify their possible roles in tissues at different developmental stages. The mRNA levels of <italic>Vegfr1</italic>, <italic>Drl</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, and <italic>Nrk</italic> showed no expression specificity in the epidermis, midgut, or fat body. Their transcript levels were high at the sixth instar feeding stage (6th–6 h to 6th–48 h) compared with those at the metamorphic molting stage (6th–72 h to 6th–120 h) and pupal stages (P–0 d to P–8 d). <italic>Fgfr1</italic> was highly expressed in the midgut at these feeding stages. <italic>Wsck</italic> was highly expressed from the 6th–48 h to the pupal stage and showed no tissue specificity (<italic><xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref></italic>). These data suggested that most of the RTKs are distributed in various tissues and highly expressed during larval feeding stages.</p>
<p>We further examined the roles played by these six RTKs in JH III-delayed pupation by injecting double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into the fifth instar 20 h larval haemocoel. Interference of these six RTK genes in larvae led to the expression of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> decreasing significantly. When <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, and <italic>Wsck</italic> were knocked down, the expression of <italic>Br-z7</italic> (encoding broad isoform Z7) was increased (<italic><xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref></italic>). The pupation time was approximately 162 h in 93% of the larvae in the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control group. After injection of JH III, the pupation time was approximately 187 h in 76% of the larvae, which was 25 h later than that of the DMSO control group, suggesting that JH III delayed pupation. In the <italic>dsGFP</italic>+JH III-injected control, larvae pupated at approximately the same time as larvae after JH III treatment. In the <italic>dsVegfr1</italic>+JH III and <italic>dsDrl</italic>+JH III treatment groups, most larvae exhibited delayed pupation; only 9–10% of the larvae did not show delayed pupation, and 28–30% died at the larval or pupal stage. However, 66–68% of the larvae did not show delayed pupation after <italic>dsCad96ca</italic>+JH III, <italic>dsNrk</italic>+JH III, <italic>dsFgfr1</italic>+JH III or <italic>dsWsck</italic>+JH III injection (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, C and <xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref></italic>). These results indicated that VEGFR1 and DRL are essential for survival and that CAD96CA, NRK, FGFR1, and WSCK are involved in JH III-induced delayed pupation.</p>
<p>To address the mechanism involved in the RTK effects on JH signaling, we examined the roles played by the selected RTKs in JH III-induced cellular responses by knocking down RTK gene expression in HaEpi cells. JH III-induced rapid calcium mobilization was repressed after knockdown of <italic>Vegfr1</italic>, <italic>Drl</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic> or <italic>Wsck</italic> compared with that after <italic>dsGFP</italic> knockdown (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic>). The efficacy of RNAi was confirmed (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></italic>). However, only <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic> or <italic>Fgfr1</italic> knocking down decreased the JH III-induced phosphorylation of MET1 and TAI (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></italic>). The results suggested that these aforementioned RTKs are all involved in JH III-induced rapid cellular calcium increase but are differentially involved in JH III-induced MET1 and TAI phosphorylation.</p>

<title>CAD96CA and FGFR1 had high affinity to JH III</title>
<p>The affinity of CAD96CA, FGFR1, NRK, and OTK for JH III was determined using saturable specific–binding curve analysis via microscale thermophoresis (MST). The experiment used full– length sequences of CAD96CA, FGFR, NRK, and OTK. CAD96CA-CopGFP-His, FGFR1-CopGFP-His, NRK-CopGFP-His, and OTK-CopGFP-His were overexpressed in the Sf9 cell line (Sf9 cells expressed the proteins at a higher level than HaEpi cells) and then, the proteins were isolated separately to determine the JH III-binding strength of each. Immunocytochemistry showed that CAD96CA-CopGFP-His, FGFR1-CopGFP-His, NRK-CopGFP-His, and OTK-CopGFP-His located in the plasma membrane (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic>). The purity of the proteins was assessed and confirmed using sodium dodecyl sulfate‒polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‒ PAGE) with Coomassie brilliant blue staining (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></italic>). CAD96CA-CopGFP-His binding to JH III exhibited a dissociation constant (Kd) = 11.96 ± 1.61 nM. Similarly, the saturable specific binding of FGFR1-CopGFP-His to JH III exhibited a Kd = 23.61 ± 0.90 nM, and NRK-CopGFP-His and OTK-CopGFP-His showed no obvious binding (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></italic>). These results suggested that CAD96CA and FGFR1 bind JH III.</p>

<p>The JH intracellular receptor MET has been reported to bind to JH in <italic>Tribolium</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Charles et al., 2011</xref></italic>); therefore, the JH intracellular receptor MET1 in <italic>H. armigera</italic> was used as the positive control in analyses to assess the applicability of the MST method. MET1-CopGFP-His and CopGFP-His were overexpressed in the Sf9 cell line and then isolated to determine the strength of their binding to JH III. Immunocytochemistry showed the nuclear location of MET1 (<italic><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3— figure supplement 1A</xref></italic>). The purities of the isolated CopGFP-His and MET1-CopGFP-His proteins were examined and confirmed using SDS‒PAGE with coomassie brilliant blue staining (<italic><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref></italic>). The saturable specific binding of MET1-CopGFP-His to JH III exhibited a Kd = 6.38 ± 1.41 nM. CopGFP-His showed weaker binding to JH III (<italic><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref></italic>). In comparison with the Kd of <italic>Tribolium</italic> MET to JH III of 2.94 ± 0.68 nM as detected by [<sup>3</sup>H]JH III (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Charles et al., 2011</xref></italic>), the Kd of MET1 binding to JH III was determined to validate that the MST method was a valid approach to detect the JH III binding activity of a protein.</p>
<p>To validate CAD96CA and FGFR1 binding JH III, saturation assays were performed using the analogs of JH, the farnesol, methoprene and farnesoate (MF). Results showed that CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound farnesol with a Kd of 1039.2 ± 0.68 nM. CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound methoprene with a Kd of 553.94 ± 1.11 nM. CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound methyl farnesoate (MF) with a Kd of 446.55 ± 0.80 nM. CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound JH III with a Kd of 12.10 ± 1.4 nM (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></italic>). The results confirmed that CAD96CA has the highest affinity to JH III.</p>
<p>Because methoprene is known as an effective juvenoid (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Konopova and Jindra, 2007</xref></italic>) and competes with JH III in binding to MET (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Charles et al., 2011</xref></italic>), therefore, the compete experiment was performed to confirm CAD96CA bound both JH III. CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound to methoprene plus JH III with a Kd value of 261.43 ± 0.81 nM, whereas, CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound to methoprene with a Kd value of 563.49 ± 0.7 (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></italic>). These suggested that CAD96CA-CopGFP-His has the highest affinity to JH III compared with the analogs.</p>
<p>Similarly, the saturable specific binding of FGFR1-CopGFP-His bound farnesol with a Kd = 23810 ± 0.51 nM; FGFR1-CopGFP-His bound methoprene with a Kd = 529.68 ± 0.60 nM; FGFR1-CopGFP-His to MF exhibited a Kd = 417.20 ± 0.66 nM; and FGFR1-CopGFP-His to JH III exhibited a Kd = 21.45 ± 1.02 (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></italic>), suggesting FGFR1 had the highest affinity to JH III. The compete binding of FGFR1-CopGFP-His to methoprene plus JH III with a Kd value = 349.27 ± 0.58 nM, whereas, FGFR1-CopGFP-His to methoprene with a Kd value = 523.57 ± 0.89 (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref></italic>). These suggested that FGFR1 has the highest affinity to JH III compared with the analogs.</p>
<p>Various mutants of CAD96CA and FGFR1 were further constructed to identify the key motifs in CAD96CA and FGFR1 critical for JH binding. Truncated mutations were performed on extracellular regions of CAD96CA and FGFR1, including CAD96CA-M1(51-615 AA, amino acid), CAD96CA-M2 (101-615 AA), CAD96CA-M3 (151-615 AA), CAD96CA-M4 (201-615 AA), FGFR1-M1 (101-615 AA), FGFR1-M2 (201-615 AA), FGFR1-M3 (301-615 AA) and FGFR1-M4 (401-615 AA). Mutants were overexpressed, and the encoded mutants located in the plasma membrane, as confirmed via immunocytochemistry, and the purity of the proteins was confirmed using SDS‒ PAGE with Coomassie brilliant blue staining (<italic><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-I</xref></italic>). The affinity of CAD96CA-M2, CAD96CA-M3, and CAD96CA-M4 mutants to JH III was significantly reduced compared with wild-type counterparts (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref></italic>). Similarly, the affinity of FGFR1-M2, FGFR1-M3, and FGFR1-M4 mutants to JH III was significantly reduced compared with wild-type counterparts (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref></italic>). These results suggested that the extracellular domain 51-151 AA in CAD96CA and the extracellular domain 101-301 AA in FGFR1 play a vital role in JH binding.</p>
<p>The affinity of CAD96CA, FGFR1, NRK, and OTK for JH III was further determined using saturable specific–binding curve analysis via isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). ITC as an alternative method to further examine the affinity of CAD96CA and FGFR1 to JH III. CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound JH III with a Kd value of 79.6 ± 27.5 nM. Similarly, the saturable specific binding of FGFR1-CopGFP-His to JH III with a Kd value of 88.5 ± 19.4 nM, and NRK-CopGFP-His and OTK-CopGFP-His showed no remarkable binding (<italic><xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref></italic>). These results also suggested that CAD96CA and FGFR1 bind JH III.</p>

<p>When the Cas9-gRNA injected eggs (105 eggs were injected each for, three injections, a total of 315 experimental eggs) had developed into second instar larvae, the survival rates were determined. The survival rate of the Cas9-gRNA-injected eggs (19.4∼20.6%) did not greatly differ from that of the control eggs injected with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (a survival rate of 22.6%), suggesting that the mixture of gRNA and Cas9 protein was nontoxic to the <italic>H. armigera</italic> eggs. In 61 survivors of Cas9 protein and <italic>Cad96ca</italic>-gRNA injection, 30 mutants were identified by the earlier pupation and sequencing (an editing efficiency of 49.2%). Similarly, in 65 survivors of Cas9 protein and <italic>Fgfr1</italic>-gRNA injection, 35 mutants were identified (an editing efficiency of 53.8%) (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></italic>) by sequencing of the mutants and deducing the mutated amino acid and analyzing off–target (<italic><xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref></italic>). CRISPR/Cas9 editing by <italic>Cad96ca-</italic>gRNA or <italic>Fgfr1</italic>-gRNA injection resulted in earlier pupation (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></italic>) for about 23∼24 h by comparison with normal pupation in 46% and 54% of larvae, respectively, at G0 generation (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></italic>), suggesting that CAD96CA and FGFR1 prevented pupation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The low death rate after <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> knockout was because of the chimera of the gene knockout at G0.</p>
<p>To address the mechanism of early pupation caused by knockout of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> or <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, we compared the expression of the genes in the JH and 20E pathways between mutant and wild-type <italic>H. armigera</italic>. Both the mutants <italic>Cad96ca</italic> or <italic>Fgfr1</italic> led to a significant decrease in <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression and an increase in 20E pathway gene expression compared with the wild-type <italic>H. armigera</italic>, respectively (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F and G</xref></italic>), indicating that CAD96CA and FGFR1 prevented pupation by increasing <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression and repressing 20E pathway gene expression.</p>
<p>To confirm the roles played by CAD96CA and FGFR1 in JH signaling, we further examined the response of HaEpi cells to JH III induction after editing of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> by CRISPR/Cas9 in HaEpi cells using the gRNAs inserted in the pIEx-4-BmU6-gRNA-Cas9-GFP-P2A-Puro plasmid (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref></italic>).

<p>JH regulates insect development through intracellular and membrane signaling; however, the cell membrane receptors and the mechanism are unclear.

<p>CAD96CA (also known as Stitcher, Ret-like receptor tyrosine kinase) activates upon epidermal wounding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tsarouhas et al., 2014</xref></italic>) and promotes growth and suppresses autophagy in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial imaginal wing discs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">O’Farrell et al., 2013</xref></italic>).

In the study, we found that chimeric mutants produced by gene knockout of <italic>Fgfr1</italic> exhibit an early pupation phenotype. The role of FGFR1 in preventing pupation and transmitting JH signal was confirmed in our study. FGFR1 has a similar function to CAD96CA, including transmitting JH signal for <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression, larval status maintaining, calcium increase, phosphorylation of transcription factors MET1 and TAI, and high affinity to JH III; however, the <italic>Fgfr1</italic> gene is highly expressed in the midgut, possibly it plays a role major in the midgut. In the study, we proved that CAD96CA and FGFR1 transmit JH III signals in three different insect cell lines. In future studies, knockdown of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> in larvae of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> will be conducted to detect JH III-induced phosphorylation of MET1 or TAI and its effect on pupation timing.</p>
<p>Other RTKs play roles in JH signaling, and their functions and mechanisms in JH pathway need to be addressed in the future study. This study does not exclude the identification of other RTKs for JH signal transduction by the different screening methods. In addition, GPCRs also play a role in JH signaling. JH triggers GPCR, RTK, PLC, IP3R, and PKC to phosphorylate Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-subunit, consequently activating Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase for the induction of patency in <italic>L. migratoria</italic> vitellogenin follicular epithelium (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jing et al., 2018</xref></italic>); JH activates a signaling cascade including GPCR, PLC, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and PKC, which induces vitellogenin receptor (VgR) phosphorylation and promotes vitellogenin (Vg) endocytosis in <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jing et al., 2021</xref></italic>). JH activates a signaling cascade including GPCR, Cdc42, Par6, and aPKC, leading to an enlarged opening of patency for Vg transport (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zheng et al., 2022</xref></italic>). In <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, the dopamine D2-like receptor-mediated JH signaling promotes the accumulation of vitellogenin and increases the level of cAMP in oocytes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai and Palli, 2016</xref></italic>). In <italic>H. armigera</italic>, GPCRs are involved in JH III-induced broad isoform 7 (BRZ7) phosphorylation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cai et al., 2014</xref></italic>). In summary, these published results indicate that RTKs and GPCRs contribute to JH signaling on the cell membrane, however, the GPCR functions as JH receptor needs to be addressed in the future study. We found that the RNAi of RTKs do not affect JH-induced <italic>Jhi-1</italic> expression, which implies other receptors exist, presenting a target for future study of the new JH III receptor.</p>

<title>The affinity of CAD96CA and FGFR1 to JH III</title>
<p>RTKs are high–affinity cell surface receptors for many cytokines, polypeptide growth factors, and peptide hormones (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Trenker and Jura, 2020</xref></italic>). The ligand of FGFR is FGF of <italic>D. melanogaste</italic>r (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kadam et al., 2009</xref></italic>); however, the ligand of CAD96CA is currently unknown.

We determined that CAD96CA and FGFR1 have a high affinity to JH III after they are isolated from the cell membrane by MST and ITC methods.</p>
<p>The [<sup>3</sup>H]JH III detection method is used to determine <italic>Drosophila</italic> MET <italic>in vitro</italic> translation product binding JH III (Kd = 5.3 nM) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Miura et al., 2005</xref></italic>), and <italic>Tribolium</italic> MET binding JH III (Kd = 2.94 nM) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Charles et al., 2011</xref></italic>). However, the commercial production of [<sup>3</sup>H]JH III has ceased, whereas the microscale thermophoresis (MST) method is a widely used method to detect protein binding of small molecules (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Welsch et al., 2017</xref></italic>). Therefore, MST was used in our study as the alternative method to measure the binding strengths of RTKs with JH III. Using the MST method, we determined that the saturable specific binding of <italic>Helicoverpa</italic> MET1 to JH III is Kd of 6.38 nM, which is comparable to that report for <italic>Drosophila</italic> MET and <italic>Tribolium</italic> MET using [<sup>3</sup>H]JH III, confirming MST method can be used to detect protein binding JH III. The CAD96CA exhibited saturable specific binding to JH III with a Kd of 11.96 nM, and FGFR1 showed a Kd of 23.61 nM, which is higher than that of MET1 for JH III, suggesting lower binding affinity of RTKs than the intracellular receptor MET1 for JH III. A similar phenomenon is reported in another study, the binding affinities of steroid membrane receptors are orders of magnitude lower than those of nuclear receptors (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Falkenstein et al., 2000</xref></italic>).

One possible explanation is that NRK has a low affinity to JH III and thus transmits JH signal without binding, or alone NRK is unable to bind JH III and requires the assistance of other proteins. Our study provides new evidence for the binding of lipid hormones by RTK and a new method to study the binding of ligands to receptors.</p>
<p>We also verified the affinity of CAD96CA and FGFR1 with JH III, determining their respective Kd values as 79.6 and 88.5 nanomolar through the ITC method. ITC is a versatile analytical method for the character of molecular interactions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Johnson, 2021</xref></italic>). ITC is applied in the membrane protein family, containing G protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, and transporters <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Draczkowski et al., 2014</xref></italic>). The ITC method requires relatively high ligand and receptor concentrations for better saturation curves (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rajarathnam and Rösgen, 2014</xref></italic>). However, when we prepared a protein solution of 1000 nM, protein aggregation occurred, thus we used a protein solution with a concentration of 700 nM. The Kd value detected by ITC is slightly higher than the result of the MST method; the results are sufficient to confirm the high affinity of CAD96CA and FGFR1 binding to JH III.</p>
<p>Although JH I and JH II are natural hormones for lepidopteran larvae (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Furuta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Schooley et al., 1984</xref></italic>), <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu et al., 2013</xref></italic>) and <italic>B. mori</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kayukawa et al., 2012</xref></italic>) also respond to JH III.

<title>Relationship of cell membrane receptor and intracellular receptor</title>
<p>MET is determined as JH intracellular receptor by its characters binding to JH and regulating <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Charles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jindra et al., 2021</xref></italic>). In our study, cell membrane receptors CAD96CA and FGFR1 are also able to bind JH III and transmit JH III signal to regulate a set of JH III-induced gene expression including <italic>Kr-h1</italic>. Obviously, both intracellular receptor MET and cell membrane receptor CAD96CA and FGFR1 are involved in JH III signaling as receptors. The study in human cell line HEK293 shows that overexpression of <italic>B. mori</italic> JH intracellular receptor MET2 and its cofactor SRC together in HEK293 cells may activate JH specific kJHRE reporter expression in a JH-dependent way (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kayukawa et al., 2012</xref></italic>), suggesting JH can diffuse into cells to initiate kJHRE reporter expression by the overexpressed intracellular receptor MET2 and its cofactor SRC in HEK293. Our study also showed that overexpression of CAD96CA or FGFR1 in HEK-293T cells elicits Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, suggesting CAD96CA or FGFR1 transmit JH III signal in HEK-293T cells. The difference is that JH III via MET induces gene expression, whereas, JH III via CAD96CA or FGFR1 induces rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase. This phenomenon indicates that JH III transmits signal by either cell membrane receptor and intracellular receptor at different stages in the signaling, with cell membrane receptor CAD96CA and FGFR1 inducing rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which regulates the phosphorylation of MET and TAI to enhance the function of MET for gene transcription <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liu et al., 2015</xref></italic>), and intracellular receptor MET regulates gene transcription by partial diffusion into cells based its lipid characteristic.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>CAD96CA and FGFR1 were involved in JH III signaling, including larval status maintaining, JH III-induced rapid calcium increase, gene expression, and phosphorylation of MET and TAI. CAD96CA and FGFR1 had high affinity to JH III and were possible cell membrane receptors of JH III. CAD96CA and FGFR1 had a general role in transmitting the JH III signal for gene expression in various insect cells. JH III transmits signal by either cell membrane receptor and intracellular receptor at different stages in the signaling, with JH III transmitting the signal by cell membrane receptor CAD96CA and FGFR1 to induce rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which regulates the phosphorylation of MET and TAI to enhance the function of MET for gene transcription, and intracellular receptor MET regulates gene transcription by partial diffusion into cells based its lipid characteristic (<italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></italic>). This study presents a platform to identify the agonist or inhibitor of JH cell membrane receptors to develop an environmental friend insect growth regulator.</p>

CAD96CA and FGFR1 have high affinity to JH III. JH III transmits the signal by cell membrane receptor CAD96CA and FGFR1 to induce rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which regulates the phosphorylation of MET and TAI to enhance the function of MET for gene transcription. On the other hand, JH enters cells freely via diffusion to bind its intracellular receptor MET, MET interacts with TAI and then binds to the JH response element (JHRE, containing the E-box core sequence, in the <italic>Kr-h1</italic> promoter region) to promote <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression to keep larval status. Therefore, JH III transmits signal by either cell membrane receptor and intracellular receptor at different stages in the signaling.</p></caption>

To detect the mutagenesis of <italic>H. armigera</italic> induced by CRISPR/Cas9, we used PCR to amplify the targeted genomic region obtained from fresh epidermis samples of larvae moulted from G0 individuals and used primers at approximately 50-200 base pairs upstream and downstream from the expected double strand break site by HiFi DNA Polymerase (Transgen, Beijing, China). The corresponding PCR products were sequenced, and the PCR fragments from the mutant animals were ligated into a pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa, Osaka, Japan) in preparation for sequencing. The mutated sites were identified by comparison with the wild-type sequence. To detect off-target activity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system-created <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutants, we searched the <italic>H. armigera</italic> genome for homologues of the target sequences of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and found that the genes possibly included similar target sequences. PCR amplification and sequencing were performed with these genes.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Cad96ca-</italic> or <italic>Fgfr1</italic>-mutant HaEpi cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system</title>
<p>The target sites were selected according to the CRISPRscan tool (<italic>Supplementary file 2</italic>). Then, two complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized according to the target sequences, and the annealed fragments were cloned into a pUCm-T-U6-gRNA plasmid after forming double chains. Primers gRNAwf-F and gRNAwf-R were used for PCR amplification with the pUCm-T-U6-gRNA plasmid carrying with target gRNA sequence as a template. The obtained fragment was cloned into a pIEx-Cas9-GFP-P2A-Puro plasmid, and pIEx-4-BmU6-gRNA-Cas9-GFP-P2A-Puro was successfully constructed. The pIEx-4-BmU6-Cad96ca-gRNA-Cas9-GFP-P2A-Puro or pIEx-4-BmU6-<italic>Fgfr1</italic>-gRNA-Cas9-GFP-P2A-Puro recombinant vectors were transfected into HaEpi cells with transfection reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). After 48 h of vector transfection (cells can be observed to express green fluorescent protein), fresh medium containing puromycin (Solarbio, Beijing, China) (15 μg/mL) was added to the cells, the medium containing puromycin was replaced every two days until the green fluorescence was gone (about five days), and the medium was replaced. The puromycin-screened cells were used for subsequent experiments. Messy peak figures reporting the results of DNA sequencing showed mutations induced by CRISPR/Cas9 in the HaEpi cells.</p>

<title>Detection of the cellular levels of calcium ions as indicated by protein calcium-sensing GCaMPs</title>
<p>GCaMPs are the most widely used protein calcium sensors (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dana et al., 2019</xref></italic>). The CMV promoter of pCMV-GCaMP5G was replaced with an IE promoter and transformed into pIE-GCaMP5G, which can be expressed in HaEpi cells. pIE-GCaMP5G was transfected into normal HaEpi cells, <italic>Cad96ca-</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic>-mutant HaEpi cells for 48 h and incubated with JH III (1 μM) or JH III (1 μM) plus CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1 mM) for 60 s. First, the cells were photographed in white light and then imaged with a fluorescence microscope.</p>

<title>Calcium levels were detected by Flow-8 AM fluorescence probe</title>
<p>Intracellular calcium levels in Sf9 cells, S2 cells, and HEK-293T cells were determined using the fluorescent probe Fluo-8 AM (MKBio, Shanghai, China). Cells were seeded overnight at 50,000 cells per 100 μL per well in a 96-well black wall/clear bottomed plate. The Fluo-8 dye was diluted to 2 μM with DPBS, while the 20% PluronicF-127 solution was added for a final concentration of 0.02%. Add 100 µl Fluo-8 dye solution to each well. Then the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were washed with DPBS three times. After JH III was added to the cells, fluorescence intensities were measured using an ENSPIE plate reader (PE, New York, USA) with a filter set of Ex/Em = 490/514 nm.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All data were from at least three biologically independent experiments. The western blotting results were quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MA, USA). The fluorescence intensity of each image of calcium detection was analyzed using Image Pro-Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). GraphPad Prism 7 was used for data analysis and results figures (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Multiple sets of data were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The different lowercase letters show significant differences. Two group datasets were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic> test. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the groups (*<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Error bars indicate the standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Juvenile Hormone (JH) plays a key role in insect development and physiology. Although the intracellular receptor for JH was identified long ago, a number of studies have shown that part of JH functions should be fulfilled through binding to an unknown membrane receptor, which was proposed to belong to the RTK family. In this study, the authors screened all RTKs from the H. armigera genome for their ability to mediate responses to JH III treatment both in cultured cells and in developing animals. They also present convincing evidence that CAD96CA and FGFR1 directly bind JH III, and that their role might be conserved in other insect species.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Altogether, the experimental approach is very complete and elegant, providing evidence for the role of CAD96CA and FGFR1 in JH signalling using different techniques and in different contexts. I believe that this work will open new perspectives to study the role of JH and better understand what is the contribution of signalling through membrane receptors for JH-dependent developmental processes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I don't see major weaknesses in this study. However, I think that the manuscript would benefit from further information or discussion regarding the relationship between the two newly identified receptors. Experiments (especially in HEK-293T cells) suggest that CAD96CA and FGFR1 are sufficient on their own to transduce JH signalling. However, they are also necessary since loss-of-function conditions for each of them are sufficient to trigger strong effects (while the other is supposed to be still present).</p>
<p>In addition, despite showing different expression patterns, the two receptors seem to display similar developmental functions according to loss-of-function phenotypes. It is therefore unclear how to draw a model for membrane receptor-mediated JH signalling that includes both CAD96CA and FGFR1.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Juvenile hormone (JH) is a pleiotropic terpenoid hormone in insects that mainly regulates their development and reproduction. In particular, its developmental functions are described as the &quot;status quo&quot; action, as its presence in the hemolymph (the insect blood) prevents metamorphosis-initiating effects of ecdysone, another important hormone in insect development, and maintains the juvenile status of insects.</p>
<p>While such canonical functions of JH are known to be mediated by its intracellular receptor complex composed of Met and Tai, there have been multiple reports suggesting the presence of cell membrane receptor(s) for JH, which mediate non-genomic effects of this terpenoid hormone. In particular, the presence of receptor tyrosine kinase(s) that phosphorylate Met/Tai in response to JH and thus indirectly affect the canonical JH signaling pathway has been strongly suggested. Given the importance of JH in insect physiology and the fact that the JH signaling pathway is a major target of insect growth regulators, elucidating the identification and functions of putative JH membrane receptors is of great significance from both basic and applied perspectives.</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors identified candidate receptors for such cell membrane JH receptors, CAD96CA and FGFR1, in the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Their in vitro analyses are conducted thoroughly using multiple methods, which overall supports their claim that these receptors can bind to JH and mediate their non-genomic effects.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Results of their in vivo experiments, particularly those of their loss-of-function analyses using CRISPR mutants are still preliminary, and the results rather indicate that these membrane receptors do not have any physiologically significant roles in vivo. More specifically, previous studies in lepidopteran species have clearly and repeatedly shown that precocious metamorphosis is the hallmark phenotype for all JH signaling-deficient larvae. In contrast, the present study showed that Cad96ca and Fgfr1 G0 mutants only showed a slight acceleration in their pupation timing, which is not a typical phenotype one would expect from JH signaling deficiency. This is inconsistent with their working model provided in Figure 6, which indicates that these cell membrane JH receptors promote the canonical JH signaling by phosphorylating Met/Tai.</p>
<p>If the authors argue that this slight acceleration of pupation is indeed a major JH signaling-deficient phenotype in Helicoverpa, they need to provide more data to support their claim by analyzing CRISPR mutants of other genes involved in JH signaling, such as Jhamt and Met. An alternative explanation is that there is functional redundancy between CAD96CA and FGFR1 in mediating phosphorylation of Met/Tai. This possibility can be tested by analyzing double knockouts of these two receptors.</p>
<p>Currently, the validity of their calcium imaging analysis in Figure 5 is also questionable. When performing calcium imaging in cultured cells, it is critically important to treat all the cells at the end of each experiment with a hormone or other chemical reagents that universally induce calcium increase in each particular cell line. Without such positive control, the validity of calcium imaging data remains unknown, and readers cannot properly evaluate their results.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Li et al. identified CAD96CA and FGF1 among 20 receptor tyrosine kinase receptors as mediators of JH signaling. By performing a screen in HaEpi cells with overactivated JH signaling, the authors pinpointed two main RTKs that contribute to the transduction of JH. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate mutants, the authors confirmed that these RTKs are required for normal JH activation, as precocious pupariation was observed in their absence. Additionally, the authors demonstrated that both CAD96CA and FGF1 exhibit a high affinity for JH, and their activation is necessary for the proper phosphorylation of Tai and Met, transcription factors that promote the transcriptional response. Finally, the authors provided evidence suggesting that the function of CAD96CA and FGF1 as JH receptors is conserved across insects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data provided by the authors are convincing and support the main conclusions of the study, providing ample evidence to demonstrate that phosphorylation of the transducers Met and Tai mainly depends on the activity of two RTKs. Additionally, the binding assays conducted by the authors support the function of CAD96CA and FGF1 as membrane receptors of JH. The study's results validate, at least in H. amigera, the predicted existence of membrane receptors for JH.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study has several weaknesses that need to be addressed. Firstly, it is not clear what criteria were used by the authors to discard several other RTKs that were identified as repressors of JH signaling. For example, while NRK and Wsck may not fulfill all the requirements to become JH receptors, other evidence, such as depletion analysis and target gene expression, suggests they are involved in proper JH signaling activation.</p>
<p>Secondly, the expression of the six RTKs, which, when knocked down, were able to revert JH signaling activation, was mainly detected in the last larval stage of H. amigera. However, since JH signaling is active throughout larval development, it is unclear whether these RTKs are completely required for pathway activation or only needed for high activation levels at the last larval stage.</p>
<p>
Additionally, the mechanism by which different RTKs exert their functions in a specific manner is not clear. According to the expression profile of the different RTKs, one might expect some redundant role of those receptors. In fact the no reversion of phosphorilation of tai and met upon depletion of Wsck in cells with overactivated JH signalling seems to support this idea.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, and despite the overlapping expression of the different receptors, all RTKs seem to be required for proper pathway activation, even in the case of FGF1 which seems to be only expressed in the midgut. This is an intriguing point unresolved in the study.</p>
<p>Finally, the study does not explain how RTKs with known ligands could also bind JH and contribute to JH signaling activation. in Drosophila, FGF1 is activated by pyramus and thisbe for mesoderm development, while CAD96CA is activated by collagen during wound healing. Now the authors claim that in addition to these ligands, the receptors also bind to JH. However, it is unclear whether these RTKs are activated by JH independently of their known ligands, suggesting a specific binding site for JH, or if they are only induced by JH activation when those ligands are present in a synergistic manner. Alternatively, another explanation could be that the RTK pathways by their known ligands activation may induce certain levels of JH transducer phosphorylation, which, in the presence of JH, contributes to the full pathway activation without JH-RTK binding being necessary.</p>
