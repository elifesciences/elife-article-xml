<abstract>
<p>The rise of antibiotic resistance has renewed interest in bacteriophages as therapeutic alternatives. However, co-evolution of phage and bacteria will naturally give rise to phage-resistant pathogens, complicating phage therapy efforts. A critical bottleneck in the production of phage therapeutics is the discovery of virulent phages against resistant pathogens. Conventional methods for discovery are time-consuming, biased, and laborious, limiting the potential for identifying suitable phage candidates.</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, we combined small-volume environmental sampling with 16S rRNA sequencing to identify reservoirs where bacterial hosts co-exist with their phage predators. This strategy, which we term geographical phage mapping (geΦmapping), pinpoints ecological “hotspots” for targeted phage hunting. We further developed a portable phage hunting device (ΦHD) that generates highly enriched phage concentrates directly from these reservoirs. By integrating geΦmapping with high-throughput enrichment, we constructed the RΦ library, a diverse collection of novel phages targeting resistant pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rise of antibiotic resistance has brought global healthcare to the precipice of a post-antibiotic era, driving interest in bacteriophage (phage) therapy as an alternative strategy to combat resistant bacterial infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Unlike antibiotics, phages evolve with their host; both locked in a relentless evolutionary arms race. Bacteria and phage continuously expand their repertoires of resistance and counter-resistance strategies. Among many examples, phages counter bacterial defenses by exposing receptors with enzymes, evading restriction enzymes with DNA base modification and evolving anti-CRISPR proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> In response, bacteria resist phage infection by blocking adsorption and nucleic acid injection and using restriction enzymes and CRISPR-Cas9 to target phage nucleic acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> This dynamic interplay of phage resistance poses a barrier to effective phage therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> TAILΦR is a phage center dedicated to providing lytic phages to physicians to treat patients battling multidrug-resistant infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Approximately 24% of bacterial infections received by TAILΦR remain untreated due to phage resistance, despite an extensive library of over 350 phages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). When no phages in the library can target a pathogen, TAILΦR turns to directed evolution (to expand host range of a given phage) or environmental sampling (to find natural phages). Such approaches often fail to yield a suitable phage and so discovering new, virulent phages that can effectively target these pathogens becomes a critical and rate-limiting step (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). As phage therapy spreads, resistant isolates will inevitably emerge under increased selection pressure, analogous to antibiotic resistance after introduction of penicillin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> This puts the onus onto phage discovery where improvements are critically needed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup></p>

Clinicians and their patients can seek phage therapy for antibiotic-resistant infections when there are no other approved treatments available.

If phages are discovered, they are moved onto the next stage for preparation where phages are ultimately purified and tested for safety and efficacy before being handed to the clinician. When there are no phages for that isolate in the library, TAILΦR searches for phages through environmental sampling. Alternatively, they can train related phages to infect the isolate through directed phage evolution. <bold>C)</bold> Strategies employed in our study: Geographical Phage (Φ) mapping (GeΦmapping), Phage hunting device (ΦHD) sampling, Phage Metagenomics (ΦMICS), resistant phage (Φ) library (RΦ-Library). <bold>D)</bold> Schematic of ΦHD</p></caption>

<p>Phage engineering is one method of constructing phages for improved therapeutic potential. Examples include generating lytic derivatives of lysogenic phages and altering phage tail fibers to adjust their host range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> In contrast, phage-host competition has naturally addressed phage resistance over billions of years of evolution. The challenge lies in isolating these phages from nature. Conventional methods for phage discovery can be time-consuming or introduce bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Phage hunters are limited to sampling small volumes of water, a constraint that typically necessitates the use of enrichment techniques to increase the likelihood of phage detection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Enrichments can favor fast-growing or highly virulent phages, potentially overlooking those that may be therapeutically relevant but less abundant or slower to propagate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> To sample larger volumes, dead-end filtration (limited by low filtration speed) and iron chloride flocculation (limited by phage inactivation) are typically used (Supp. Table 1). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> The speed and phage bias limitations are acceptable for metagenomic approaches but unhelpful for phage therapy, leaving a critical gap for patients that urgently need phages for phage-resistant bacterial infections.</p>
<p>Viral metagenomics involves identification of largely uncultivated viral genomes from the environment. Unfortunately, analysis is hindered by the vast diversity of viruses, lack of consensus sequences, and limited reference genomes available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> Some 70% of all viral genomes are unclassified, often referred to as “viral dark matter.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> Studying unknown viral genomes can advance viral ecology and may contribute useful gene products for research and therapeutics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Viral metagenomics are frequently limited by low biomass, sampling biases, and limitations in sampling remote sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, we sought to improve current methods for phage discovery to tackle phage-resistant pathogens and enhance gene discovery. We used a bioprospecting approach, collecting samples in East Texas, USA, and applied 16S rRNA analysis to identify pathogenic reservoirs and hence their phages. We dubbed this process, “Geographical Phage (Φ) Mapping,” or “GeΦmapping.” After identifying pathogen-rich sources, we deployed a high-throughput phage hunting device, ΦHD, for sample processing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,D</xref>). We used this approach of combining molecular bioprospecting and high-volume sampling to address problematic “extremely phage-resistant organisms” (XΦROs) in clinical cases.</p>

    <p>Phages are found where their hosts thrive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> In marine ecosystems, for example, phage-to-bacterium ratios often reach 10:1, reflecting close associations between bacterial density and phage populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> We identified sites of high pathogen abundance to determine where to hunt for phages. We sampled 15 waterways around Houston and Galveston, Texas, USA thrice and performed 16S rRNA analysis to examine the bacterial constituents (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We performed rarefaction analysis to estimate species richness relative to sampling effort. The resulting curves plateaued, indicating adequate sampling (Supp. Fig. 1A). To further quantify species richness, we compared α-diversity indices (inverse Simpson, Shannon, and Chao) and noticed that White Oak Bayou was the richest (Supp. Fig. 1A,C). To compare the membership of each site’s microbiome, we analyzed β-diversity using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,C</xref>).</p>

<p>Samples of seawater, sewage, and freshwater clustered distinctively while samples from brackish water mingled between freshwater and seawater sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,C</xref>). Interestingly, a freshwater sample from Vince Bayou, where <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> was prominent, clustered with sewage samples suggesting its microbial profile resembled that of sewage. Of note, a contaminated industrial facility, formerly an oil processor and wastewater treatment plant, is situated upstream of this location.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> After heavy storms, toxic wastes have reportedly contaminated the area with reports of hundreds of dead fish.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> During sampling, toxic chemical contamination may have shifted the microbiome to resemble sewage-like communities, causing resilient genera like <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> to dominate.</p>
<p>To focus on pathogens, we extracted the counts of pathogen-related taxa and generated heatmaps normalized by site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and by taxa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Normalizing by site, we determined the microbial composition of each location. We detected <italic>Vibrio</italic> in Gulf of Mexico and West Bay; both expected in marine environments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). We noted <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> was most common in waterways draining rural and suburban areas, while <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> was more common in larger urban waterways (Brays and Buffalo Bayous) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, black rectangles). Again, Vince Bayou was an outlier, highly enriched with <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>. Normalizing by taxa allowed us to find sites of interest for ΦHD sampling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, black rectangles). The data showed predominance of <italic>Vibrio</italic> at marine sites, while <italic>Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> were best represented at Brays Bayou. Vince Bayou remained enriched with <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>. Of the 24% of TAILΦR isolates without a phage, 35% of these were <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). This made Brays Bayou, rich in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, an ideal target for high volume sampling.</p>

<title>Environmental sampling freshwater and seawater with ΦHD</title>
<p>Although phages are abundant in nature, harvesting phages against pathogens can be difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Typically, phage hunters are restricted to small volumes and sometimes rely on enrichment techniques to compensate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> These techniques vary by sample and host but take days with no guaranteed success. After selecting our sampling location, the next challenge was obtaining a highly concentrated sample through high-volume sampling to ensure sufficient phage abundance for effective downstream screening.</p>
<p>We approached this using ΦHD, which was inspired by the various research groups that used tangential flow filtration (TFF) for viral metagenomics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> We designed ΦHD to have a robust filtration train combined with a high-flux concentration component, allowing for low shear fluid path and high portability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). We used a 297 μm hose filter to screen out larger debris, followed by sequential 25 and 5 µm filter cartridges to remove larger microorganisms such as plankton and protists. We then used two hollow fiber TFF units, operating in parallel for concentration with flow rates in the low shear region. The first unit performs ultrafiltration and fills the reservoir with retentate, while the second takes from that reservoir and continuously concentrates the retentate in a closed loop. These are powered by a dual-headed peristaltic pump equipped with a lithium-ion battery and solar panels to allow prolonged operation in the field. During spike-in studies, we spiked pond water (60L) with phage (1×10<sup>3</sup> PFU/mL of ΦJB10) (Supp. Fig. 2A). We found minimal losses of phage and bacteria during passage through the filtration train and obtained an average 20-fold increase in phage concentration (Supp. Fig. 2B). After the spike-in study, we evaluated our cleaning-in-place protocol (Supp. Fig. 2C, Post CIP) for the TFF units and found it effectively removed phages and bacteria, confirming ΦHD is reusable.</p>
<p>In the field, we routinely achieved flow rates of 200L/hr and gathered samples ranging from 400-1200L (Supp. Table 2). Initial testing on-site proved the filtration/concentration train was robust enough to manage the highly polluted water ways of Houston (Supp. Fig. 2D-E, 6A, Santa Ana Capture Site (SACS)). <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> phage concentration increased by 95-fold after first stage processing with ΦHD (Supp. Fig. 2E, right panel). We also sampled the more pristine waters of Pedernales Falls (PF) and Hamilton Pool Preserve (HP), and incorporated a secondary in-lab concentration stage to further increase retentate concentrations (Supp. Fig. 2F). Phage counts from inputs from PF and HP were near zero, but increased to 10<sup>2-3</sup> PFU/mL with secondary processing. Similar treatment of SACS retentates yielded a final average 3,501-fold increase in concentration (Supp. Fig. 2G). This shows ΦHD, with second stage concentration, greatly increased the detection of viable phages from a given site (Supp. Fig. 2G, 2H). Screening with other bacteria showed more phages against other pathogens from polluted SACS water compared to pristine sites (Supp. Fig. 2I).</p>
    <p>To test the combination of geΦmapping and ΦHD, we selected one site that was highlighted by our map as <italic>Pseudomonas-, Enterobacteriaceae-</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus</italic>-rich (Brays Bayou, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) and one low-richness site (Clear Creek). We processed 400L/site and tracked concentration by endogenous anti-<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (PAO1) phages. ΦHD significantly increased phage titers at each site (166-fold at Brays Bayou and 520-fold at Clear Creek, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F,H</xref>). Using second stage concentrates, we screened a panel of patient isolates of different genera to compare hits and found more lytic phages at Brays Bayou (7/12 species) than Clear Creek (3/12 species), phenotypically validating our 16S-based mapping strategy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). We employed an identical filtration train at Galveston Bay sampling the marine, saltwater biome. We tracked concentrations with <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> 17802 and could only identify plaques after second stage concentration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F-right panel</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">J</xref>), showing utility in salt water. To test whether phage concentration increased without host-selection bias, we used transmission electron miscopy (TEM). We observed a wide range of phage morphologies with intact tails in concentrates, while the input was mostly clear of particles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I,K</xref>). This provides further objective evidence of unbiased concentration of intact phages through the ΦHD process.</p>

<p>Pathogens belonging to <italic>Enterococcus</italic> and <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, including <italic>Escherichia</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, are known inhabitants of wastewater, so we reasoned wastewater would be prime choice for finding phages against these pathogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> In a similar fashion to freshwater mapping, we sampled influents of seven different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) twice to generate geΦmaps of the pathogenic landscape of wastewater plants. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> shows the catchment area for each WWTP in Houston.

<p>We normalized by taxa and generated heatmaps to make our wastewater geΦmap (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The Park Ten WWTP influent was rich in <italic>Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter</italic> and <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic>, but it was being decommissioned during our study. West University WWTP had higher levels of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus</italic>, so we selected it for further investigation. The wastewater treatment process alters the microbiome of wastewater, so we compared the pathogenic taxa throughout the process. We sampled raw wastewater filtered only through large steel bars that remove large debris (influent). Similarly, we sampled wastewater mixed with activated sludge (contact tank) and wastewater exposed to activated sludge with air bubbling (aeration tank).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> α-diversity indices showed that microbial diversity was richest in the contact tank and aeration tank of West University WWTP (Supp. Fig. 1C) but the influent tank had the highest abundance of the selected pathogenic taxa (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). We confirmed this 16S genomic data by comparing titers of phages against indicator strains (PAO1 for <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and K-12 for <italic>E. coli</italic>) which showed the majority of these phages were found in the influent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-F</xref>).</p>

<title>Wastewater sampling with ΦHD</title>
<p>We used a modified ΦHD method to process 400L of influent wastewater from West University WWTP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, Supp. Fig. 6B). To avoid pump issues caused by gravity, we lifted the wastewater 1–2 meters onto an elevated deck into large tubs. We allowed this material to settle for 30 minutes to sediment large debris and then we pre-filtered the sample using 297 µm hose filters and two spin-down sediment traps (150 and 63 µm screens) to produce a clarified product. This pre-filtered material was then used as the ΦHD input. To ensure these additional filtration steps did not capture significant quantities of phage, we titered the material at each stage against indicator strains (PAO1 and K12) and found negligible losses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>). We titered input and second stage concentrates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H,I</xref>) on <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Escherichia</italic> indicators, confirming phage concentration, with final titers increasing 118-fold and 108-fold, respectively. We attempted to look for non-selective concentration of virus-like particles (VLPs) with TEM, however this was complicated by residual particulate matter. Nonetheless, we were able to appreciate some phages in retentates but not the unconcentrated input material (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3J,K</xref>). We also screened the second stage concentrate against the previous panel of clinical and laboratory strains. This yielded phages for 9 of 12 bacterial strains screened, and phage titers were higher than at other sites (darker red) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>).</p>

<title>Collective shallow shotgun metagenomic sequencing</title>
<p>Phage diversity varies significantly across different biomes due to factors such as host availability, ecological niches, and environmental conditions. To test the utility of ΦHD for metagenomic applications, we looked at viral metagenomes from input sample (5L) and ΦHD concentrate (60mL of 6667X retentate) and found substantial increases in unique viral contigs (Supp. Table 3, Supp. Fig. 3A,B). We compared putative <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-infecting viruses from the input and ΦHD samples, and the ΦHD sample contained both different members from genetically distinct groups and a greater absolute number of unique anti-<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> viruses (Supp. Fig. 3C,D,E).</p>
<p>Given the apparent utility of ΦHD in concentrating samples for metagenomics, we looked at the viromes of fresh (Brays), brackish (Clear Creek), waste (West University WWTP), and seawater (Galveston). We clustered our putative, non-redundant viral sequences into vOTUs, or virus operational taxonomic units. We generated a gene-sharing network with vCONTact2 with each node representing a vOTU, colored by source and clustered them with reference genomes from the Prokaryotic Viral RefSeq v201 database (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<p>39.1% of viruses clustered with a reference genome at the genus level, while 20.3% were outliers sharing only 1-2 genes with other genomes. 30.3% were singletons with no genes related to any other genomes in the data set (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). We also used PhaGCN to classify each virus, but only 33.5% of viruses could be classified to the family-level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Of the classified genomes, <italic>Kyanoviridae</italic> (green) and <italic>Autographiviridae</italic> (orange) made up largest identifiable taxa in Clear Creek and Galveston (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>).

There are 4 distinct viral signatures present, separating wastewater, seawater, freshwater and brackish water (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). We further clustered viruses from each biome together to identify overlaps and visualized them with Venn diagrams (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). We saw that overlaps of viral genomes reflected the physical environment; for example, the brackish water of Clear Creek overlapped between seawater and freshwater - representing its status as an admixture of the two. Next, we used CHERRY for host prediction and made heatmaps normalized by hosts. A large majority of phages with pathogenic hosts were found in wastewater virome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>, black box).</p>
<p>In designing cocktails for phage therapy, it is desirable to have a mixture of diverse viruses to minimize the emergence of phage resistance, for instance by targeting multiple phage receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> As such, a phage collection should be diverse and including phages from multiple sources can help ensure this.

Phylogenetic analysis of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-infecting viruses showed significant increases in diversity when combining vOTUs from the two biomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Counting and clustering the unique genomes, there were no sequences that were in common between sewage and freshwater (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Analyzing the <italic>Escherichia</italic>-infecting viruses, phylogenetic diversity was greatly increased by including freshwater phages, and the two biomes had no sequences in common (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C,D</xref>).

<title>Resistant phage library (RΦ-Library)</title>
<p>To test our approach of geΦmapping and ΦHD and generate a therapeutic phage library for extremely phage resistant organisms (XΦROs) that posed clinical challenges, we used 17 XΦROs from the TAILΦR collection. These failed all conventional phage discovery methods (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) including sewage spotting and Appelmans protocol (for host range expansion). As screening ΦHD concentrates allows searching far larger volumes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), we immediately found therapeutic phage candidates for all 17 XΦROs using freshwater (Brays Bayou) and sewage (West University) sources (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study leverages the billion year-long evolutionary war between phages and their hosts, focusing on discovering and harnessing natural phages. We report: i) the design, construction, and successful use of a high-throughput phage capture device (ΦHD); ii) the use of this device to identify regional sources of both bacteria and phages (geΦmapping); iii) the use of geΦmapping coupled with ΦHD sampling to identify novel phages that target phage-resistant strains, when all other phage matching solutions failed (RΦ-Library); and iv) the characterization of new metagenomes. Collectively, this work provides a rich resource for therapeutic phages against resistant ESKAPEs (<italic><bold>E</bold>nterococcus faecium, <bold>S</bold>taphylococcus aureus, <bold>K</bold>lebsiella pneumoniae, <bold>A</bold>cinetobacter <bold>b</bold>aumannii, <bold>P</bold>seudomonas aeruginosa, and <bold>E</bold>nterobacter spp</italic>.) and a rich gene library for new biological discovery (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>Wastewater, areas of high human activity and dense urban development are particularly rich in phages capable of targeting antibiotic-resistant pathogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> This is largely due to the elevated microbial loads in these settings, which naturally support a higher abundance and diversity of phages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> Human activity imposes evolutionary pressure on bacteria, driving the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains—and, by extension, their phage counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> To strategically identify optimal sampling locations, we employed geΦmapping to pinpoint environments with high pathogen loads (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). We identified Brays Bayou as an excellent locale for anti-<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and other phages, with agreement between genomic mapping and phenotypic phage surveys. We extended our approach to sewage, not only localizing to a single WWTP for phage hunting but to a specific section of that plant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A-F</xref>).</p>
<p>This targeting enabled the use of ΦHD which was able to concentrate VLPs 100-3,500-fold in these locations producing phage rich retentates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>, Supp. Fig. 2G). These retentates were used to target XΦROs in clinical cases resulting in not only the generation of the RΦ-library (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) and discovery new genera of phages (Supp. Fig. 4,5) but also treatment in patient cases. Currently, 1 patient has received 2 phages that necessitated the ΦHD approach, and 6 more patient cases are in progress that required ΦHD-derived phages (not published). This illustrates the critical need of phage discovery being addressed by the geΦmapping and ΦHD approach.</p>
<p>Our study is limited by multiple factors. Our current geΦmap is limited to the Gulf Coast area around Houston, TX, USA and thus is of limited utility to others. However, the overall approach of localizing phage reservoirs is generalizable. In the field, it is technically challenging to remove all phages and bacteria from the hollow fiber units at the end of a sampling run. We employ simple backflushing through the retentate port which increases yield 25-50%. Given the amount of particulate removed later during cleaning, we are certain recovery percentages can be further increased. While the ΦHD system is portable, the total assembly is large and requires at least 2 people to carry. We are currently developing a smaller, portable version for single person use to address this. Finally, our approach is limited to liquid biomes, but it is well known that the soils of forests and other areas harbor huge phage biodiversity. We are currently working on ways to address this for both viral ecology and clinical phage discovery.</p>
<p>Collectively, we used a bioprospecting approach to localize therapeutic phages and harvest them <italic>en masse</italic> with ΦHD. This resulted in large metagenomic data sets informing the viral ecology of the Gulf Coast, critical therapeutic phages for challenging clinical cases and tools for others to use in phage discovery.</p>

<title>Sample acquisition and preparation for 16S mapping</title>
<p>4L freshwater and seawater samples from 15 locations were collected in containers cleaned with 10% bleach and copiously pre-rinsed in ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Locations and weather were precisely recorded (Supplementary Table 6). Samples were collected in triplicates with the exception to Brays Bayou @ HEB. Based on 16S mapping and data not shown here, this location is biologically equivalent to Brays Bayou @ Medical Center due to its short distance and lack of inflow between them. For sampling purposes, we used this location due to its easier access to the bayou and safety reasons. Samples were transported back to the laboratory within hours of gathering samples and stored at 4°C until further processing next day. We centrifuged approximately 400 mL of each sample at 10,000xg for 20 minutes to pellet bacteria and debris. 250 mg was measured out in pre-weighed tubes. In some samples, where there were insufficient pellets (e.g. Buffalo @ Santa Ana Capture Site, Galveston, West Bay, Sims Bayou, Halls @ Keith Weiss Park), we centrifuged an additional 400mL of water until 250 mg was met. Sewage samples were obtained from various wastewater treatment plants by plant workers and transported to BCM and handled in a similar fashion. We centrifuged 50 mL samples at 10,000xg for 20 minutes. 250 mg of the pellet was measured in pre-weighed tubes.</p>

<title>ΦHD environmental sampling</title>
<p>A filtration/concentration device, ΦHD, was designed to filter microbes and phages from water. The filtration train starts with a 297 µm stainless steel mesh hose filter (3.6’’ in height and 2’’ in width) attached to silicone peristaltic tubing and goes into a water source (the feed line). The hose filter excludes trash, plant matter, and fish from the system. The tube connects to a Countertop Filtration System equipped sequentially with a 25 µm blown polypropylene cartridge and a 5 µm spun polypropylene cartridges. The filters remove more debris (soil, sand, etc.) and larger microorganisms like bacteria. Tubing then connects to the feed port of a 100 kDa hollow fiber unit (modified polyether sulfone (mPES), 65 cm, KrosFlo Hollow Fiber Filter Module). Anything smaller than 100 kDa (viruses, smaller bacteria, etc.) is filtered by tangential flow filtration (TFF) and filtered through the permeate ports. The retentate port ejects filtered water into a (pre-cleaned with 10% bleach and diH<sub>2</sub>0-rinsed) 4L reservoir. Stop valves are connected to the retentate line and bottom permeate line to control flow rates and fill the jacket of the unit. We use one head of a dual-headed peristaltic pump to propel water through the filtration train. The pump is powered with a travel-size battery station, Jackery Explorer 300, that was charged with solar panels.</p>
<p>Water was filtered and concentrated into a single reservoir, and a second 100 kDa hollow fiber unit was used to further concentrate the water into smaller volumes. The second head of the pump continuously cycled retentates from reservoir to unit. We used a custom-built aluminum stand that allows easy field use of the hollow fiber units. The concentrated product was expected to be 500 mL to 1 L in volume. ΦHD sampling in-field is the first stage of processing. Samples were brought back to the lab in 1-2 hours. We centrifuged the samples, generally 1-2L, at 10,000xg for 20 minutes and filtered the samples with 0.22 µm vacuum-filters (Steritop filters (PES). Samples were stored at 4°C until second stage processing in lab (next day). A smaller version of the 100 kDa hollow fiber unit was used to achieve volumes of 50-200 mL per sample (mPES, 20 cm, MidiKros Hollow Fiber Filter Module). Retentate flow rates are controlled by Luer lock stoppers on the retentate line and bottom permeate line. Concentrations of each sample were recorded accordingly after secondary concentration (Supp. Table 2).</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Cleaning-in-place (CIP) protocol of hollow fiber units (TFF units)</title>
<p>After each ΦHD run, we cleaned the TFF units to regenerate them. For 5-10 mins, water was flushed through the permeate ports on both ends of the TFF unit. This reverse flow removes the majority of biological build-up in the units. The outer jacket and hollow fibers were then filled with 0.5M HCl and left overnight to incubate at room temperature. The next day, we rinsed the units with water then soaked outer jacket and hollow fibers in 0.5M NaOH overnight. Once rinsed with diH<sub>2</sub>O, the units are ready to be used again. For more polluted waters (such as wastewater), we repeated the CIP protocol. We’ve successfully used the units over 10 times for this study (Supp. Table 2).</p>

<title>ΦHD wastewater sampling</title>
<p>Wastewater has a high burden of flotsam (toilet paper, wet wipes and feminine hygiene production, etc.) as well as smaller particulates. We pre-filtered wastewater and used the pre-filtered input as the feed to ΦHD. Two silicone peristaltic tubes drew wastewater 1-2 meters from the influent tank of West University WWTP and into two large tubs, pre-cleaned with 70% ethanol and Clorox wipes. This helped avoid gravitation issues such as slower flow rates and battery tripping. Wastewater was allowed to settle for 30 minutes. This allowed larger, denser material to sediment to the bottom. Two tubes with styrofoam floaters and barbed hose filters propelled water through two spin down filters – containing 150 and 63 µm mesh cartridges. The floaters were essential in avoiding the settled debris at the bottom, and the larger filters helped remove more debris. Wastewater was stored in two pre-cleaned tubs; this became the input for ΦHD where we processed the water as described above. For wastewater processing, an additional valve on the feed line is needed to slow down flow rate. Similarly, we centrifuged the first stage concentrate (1-2L) at 10,000g for 20mins and filtered the samples with 0.22 µm vacuum filters. second stage processing lowered the volume to 150-200 mL.</p>

For plaque assays, overnight cultures were suspended in 0.75% LB top agar with 10-1000µL of ΦHD concentrate and poured onto 1.5% LB plates to solidify. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C. Plaques are counted next day. For phage streaks, a single plaque on agar plates was picked and resuspended in 25 µL of phosphate buffer saline. Bacterial cultures were suspended on 0.75% LB top agar and poured onto LB plates. Before the top agar solidifies, the resuspended plaque was streaked with a pipette. To isolate individual phages from a plaque, the phage was continuously streaked out until plaque morphologies are consistent (at least twice).</p>

    <p>Raw data was uploaded into KBASE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> and examined with FastQC (0.12.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> then trimmed with Trimmomatic (v0.36) with default settings (sliding window size 4, sliding minimum quality 15, post tail crop length null, head crop length 0, leading minimum quality 3, trailing minimum quality 3, minimum read length 36).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> Post-trimmed reads were assessed with FastQC (0.12.1). Reads were assembled into contigs with metaSPAdes (v3.15.3); minimum contig length was 300 ≤ 2000 bp and k-mer sizes were 21,33,55,77,99, and 127.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> Contigs were uploaded into CyVerse for further analysis with VIBRANT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> VIBRANT was used to identify and extract viral contigs from the dataset; default settings were used (length of bp was 1000, number of ORFs per scaffold was 4). Viral contigs from individual samples were clustered into viral operational taxonomic unit (vOTU) using average nucleotide identity (ANI)-based clustering (95% ANI, 85% alignment coverage) on PhaBOX.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> We used CheckV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> to assess quality and completeness of vOTUs. vOTUs were annotated with PROKKA (v1.14.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> on KBASE, and gene-sharing networks were made with vConTACT2 (v0.9.19).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> Settings were set to default, and the reference database used for cluster taxonomy was NCBI Bacterial and Archaeal Viral RefSeq V201. We visualized the gene-networks with Cytoscape.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> vOTUs were further taxonomically classified with PhaGCN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> (minimum length ≥ 5kb, 75% amino acid identity (AAI), shared protein 15, and 80% protein coverage) and predicted host of each vOTUs with CHERRY<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> (minimum length ≥ 5kb, 75% amino acid identity (AAI), shared protein 15, and 80% protein coverage, 90% CRISPRs identity). Again, we generated heatmaps of the relative amounts of identified taxa or predicted hosts by calculating z-scores and displayed them using pheatmap in R.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>vOTUs with predicted hosts in the genera <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Escherichia</italic> were manually extracted from the datasets of wastewater (West University WWTP) and freshwater (Brays Bayou). We clustered vOTUs with AAI-based clustering mode on PhaBOX (45% AAI, 15 shared protein, and 80% protein coverage). We used VIPTree<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> phylogenetic analysis then visualized the resulting Newick trees using ggtree<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> in RStudio.</p>

<title>Generation of RΦ collection</title>
<p>We obtained clinical isolates from the collection of TAILΦR Labs at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM). We selected isolates for which no phage had been isolated despite exhaustive searches in sewage spotting and testing of the TAILΦR phage library. Study of these clinical isolates was approved by BCM’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). We grew each isolate overnight in LB media, mixed 100 μL of this overnight culture with 3 mL of 0.7% top agar and either 100 μL or 1mL of environmental or sewage ΦHD concentrate as indicated. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C. Next day, plaques that we considered as lytic in appearance (non-cloudy, cleared zones on bacterial lawns) were picked with a pipette tip and streaked in top agar with the same clinical strain prepared in an identical manner. Plaques were streaked 3 times to ensure purity. We endeavored to pick 2-3 different plaque morphologies per clinical isolate for each source (environment or sewage). The purified plaques were picked and mixed in 100 μL of phage buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>). We then made plate lysates by mixing 50 μL of this phage-laden material with 100 μL bacterial overnight of the indicated strain and 3 mL 0.7% top agar and incubating overnight. These were harvested by scraping the top agar from the plates, rinsing the plate surface with 3 mL phage buffer and centrifuging this mixture at 2200xg for 10 minutes and removing residual bacteria with a 0.22 μm PVDF filter (Merck Millipore, Ireland). These phages were titered using standard methods on 0.75% top agar on the indicated strain. Anti-HPC3.1 phages underwent plate lysate production in a laboratory strain PAO1 owing to the amount of mucus produced, and were subsequently titered on the indicated clinical strain.</p>

<title>Genetic analysis of the RΦ collection</title>
<p>We employed various methods of DNA preparation for the phages. For samples with adequate titers, we used the EZNA Universal Pathogen Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Phage strains with lower titers or that failed to produce adequate DNA using the EZNA kit were processed by generation of 9 mL of plate lysate (as above) and centrifugation with a Sw-41Ti rotor at 37.5k rpm for 2 hours to pellet virus-like particles (VLPs). This pellet was then processed using a Qiagen Power Soil Kit using the manufacturer’s instructions. For DNA samples with ratios outside of 1.8-2.0, we further purified them with the NEB Genomic DNA Purification kit using the manufacturer’s “clean-up” protocol. Whole genome sequencing using standard protocols was done by BCM’s CMMR core. We processed short reads data using FastQC (v0.12.1) to assess data quality, removed low quality sequences (Q&gt;30 cut off) and removed the adapters using Trimmomatic (v0.39) with default settings. We verified removal of adapters and quality cutoffs with another run of FastQC. These clean reads were then assembled using SPAdes (v3.15.3) (DNA source standard, minimum contig length 200 ≤ 500) and annotated using RASTtk (v1.073) (default setting). We identified candidate viral sequences from these assemblies using VirSorter2 (discarding sequences with &lt;2 hallmark genes, requiring hallmark genes on all sequences, only output high confidence viral sequences, and requiring viral genes to be annotated). Sequences with high dsDNA phage score, &gt;4-6 hallmark genes, relatively low cellular gene fraction and coverage suggestive of high copy number above the bacterial host were examined manually and BLASTn was used to determine phage or not. Confirmed phage sequences were then re-annotated with RASTtk (v1.073) to provide final phage genomes for the RΦ library. We compared TAILOR sequences (pre-existing data) with the sequences of purified phages from RΦ library. We used VIPTree<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> for a proteomic dendrogram and then visualized the resulting Newick trees using ggtree<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> in RStudio. Several Klebsiella phages that were isolated on related host strains were identical and so we removed these duplicates prior to visualization.</p>

<title>Electron microscopy</title>
<p>Various environmental, sewage and purified phage samples were imaged at BCM’s Cryo-EM Advanced Technology Core Facility. Samples were deposited on grids (Quantifoil 2/2 200 Cu + 2-nm ThinC; Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH, Jena, Germany) and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate using standard techniques. Images were collected with either a JEOL 1230 electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) at 80 kV equipped with a 4,000 by 4,000 Gatan Ultrascan charge-coupled device camera (Gatan, Ametek) or a JEOL 2100 (200 kV) electron microscope equipped with a Gatan 4k x 4k CCD. Images were collected at numerous magnifications, and representative examples were selected and viewed in NIH ImageJ.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study establishes a workflow based on environmental sampling for the discovery of bacteriophages capable of infecting antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The experimental design, analysis, and results demonstrating the effectiveness of the workflow are <bold>convincing</bold>, although a broader sampling scheme and more careful framing of the data within the current limitations of viral taxonomy could strengthen the work. This study will interest researchers working on bacterial infections, environmental microbiology, and phage-based alternatives for addressing antimicrobial resistance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript &quot;Pathogen-Phage Geomapping to Overcome Resistance,&quot; Do et al. present an impressive demonstration of using geographical sampling and metagenomics to guide sample choice for enrichment in human-associated microbes and the pathogen of interest to increase the chances of success for isolating phages active against highly resistant bacterial strains. The authors document many notable successes (17!) with highly resistant bacterial isolates and share a thoughtfully structured phage discovery effort, potentially opening the door to similar geomapping efforts across the field. While the work is methodologically strong and valuable for the community, there are a few areas where additional clarification and analysis could better align the claims with the data presented.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript describes a well-executed and transparent example of overcoming a major obstacle in therapeutic virus identification, providing a practical success story that will resonate with researchers in microbiology and medicine.</p>
<p>(2) Many phage researchers have anecdotally experienced a similar phenomenon, that a particular wastewater treatment plant always seems to have the pathogens you need. Quantifying this with metagenomics modernizes and adds evidence to this phenomenon in a way that could help researchers reproduce this success in a methodical way.</p>
<p>(3) The methodology of combining environmental sampling, viral screening, and host-range analysis is clearly articulated and reproducible, offering a valuable blueprint for others in the field.</p>
<p>(4) The data are presented with appropriate analytical rigor, and the results include robust sequencing and metagenomic profiling that deepen understanding of local viral communities.</p>
<p>(5) The 17 successes yielding 35 phages have a lot of phylogenetic novelty beyond what the Tailor labs have typically found with previous methods.</p>
<p>(6) The work highlights a practical and innovative solution to an increasingly important clinical problem, supporting the development of personalized antiviral strategies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The central concept of geomapping as a broadly applicable strategy is wonderfully supported by the 17 successes documented in the paper. While this is actually, of course, a strength, the study does not include a comparative analysis across multiple sites with varying sampling outcomes for different bacterial types, which would be necessary to validate this claim more generally.</p>
<p>(2) Some elements, such as beta diversity comparisons and the metagenomics analysis of viral dark matter, would benefit from additional statistical analysis and clearer context.</p>
<p>(3) Claims about therapeutic cocktails would be better framed as speculative and/or moved to the discussion section.</p>
<p>(4) The manuscript could be strengthened by elaborating on the scope and composition of the phage and bacterial isolate collections, which are important for interpreting the broader significance of the findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Do and colleagues aims to develop a workflow for isolating and identifying bacteriophages with potential applications in phage therapy against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The workflow integrates geΦmapping as a strategy to identify potential phage sources, ΦHD as a device for phage concentration, and RΦ as a phage library constructed from the initial sampling, resulting in the discovery of 36 new phages. The paper is overall interesting, and the proposed method appears robust and effective.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The methods proposed combined state-of-the-art strategies to solve an ever-increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. The methods are robust, and the controls are appropriate. The integration of environmental sampling, concentration strategies, and downstream genomic characterization is a clear strength and provides a potentially scalable framework for identifying candidate therapeutic phages. The manuscript is clearly written overall, and the results support the main conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors acknowledge several limitations, some aspects require clearer framing or additional clarification. The proposed workflow focuses exclusively on aquatic environments as sources of phages, which may limit the diversity of hosts and phage types recoverable using this approach. Some interpretations, particularly regarding taxonomic classification and sampling saturation, would benefit from more cautious wording given current limitations in viral taxonomy and the observed data.</p>
