<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Generalising information from ourselves to others, and others to ourselves allows for both a dependable source of navigation and adaptability in interpersonal exchange. Disturbances to social development in sensitive periods can cause enduring and distressing damage to lasting healthy relationships. However, identifying the mechanisms of healthy exchange has been difficult. We introduce a theory of self-other generalisation tested with data from a three-phase social value orientation task - the Intentions Game. We involved individuals with (n=50) and without (n=53) a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and assessed whether self-other information generalisation may explain interpersonal (in)stability. Healthy controls initially used their preferences to predict others and were influenced by their partners, leading to self-other convergence. In contrast, individuals with borderline personality disorder maintained distinct self-other representations, generating a new neutral prior to begin learning. Both groups steadily reduced their updating over time, with healthy participants showing increased sensitivity to update beliefs. Furthermore, we explored theory-driven individual differences underpinning learning. Overall, the findings provide a clear explanation of how self-other generalisation constrains and assists learning, how childhood adversity disrupts this through separation of internalised beliefs and makes clear predictions about the mechanisms of social information integration under uncertainty.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social animals have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for cooperation. To coordinate, individuals exchange information, enabling independent and group regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Emerson, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wheeler, 1911</xref>). Interaction provides the self with insights about others and, simultaneously, about its own state within the environment. In humans, this psychological differentiation begins in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ciaunica et al., 2021</xref>) and continues into adulthood. This prolonged differentiation facilitates the distinction between self and others, allowing grounded social orientation and flexible adaptation. Early psychological theorists highlighted the importance of healthy social exchange in humans for integrating constructive relational blueprints, noting that disruptions during sensitive periods can impair the formation of trusting, safe social bonds (e.g., Fairbairn, 1952; 1994) and foster less adaptable interpersonal beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Young et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>At the individual level, humans must manage information exchange to navigate and reduce relational uncertainty. When faced with external uncertainty about others’ characteristics, prior knowledge can swiftly and effectively guide predictions. When uncertainty arises regarding one’s own internal state, external cues can provide anchoring information to support self-through-other calibration. To reduce uncertainty about others, theories of the relational self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson &amp; Chen, 2002</xref>) suggest that the self is the most extensive and well-grounded representation available, leading to a readily accessible initial belief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kreuger &amp; Clement, 1994</xref>) that can be projected or integrated into social learning. Conversely, to address uncertainty about the self, individuals can generalize information from others to themselves—this social contagion facilitates adaptation to social groups and is a crucial component of interpersonal cohesion that relies on trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Frith &amp; Frith, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Computational modelling has advanced our understanding of how humans engage in self-insertion and social contagion to achieve efficient prediction and adaptation. By integrating self-preferences into prior beliefs, self-insertion models account for increased reaction times at the onset of learning and enhanced predictive accuracy as a function of interpersonal similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tarantola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barnby et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, uncertain self-preferences can be influenced by observing others’ intertemporal discounting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Garvert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Moutoussis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>However, critical questions remain: How do humans adjudicate between self-insertion and contagion during interaction to manage interpersonal generalization? Does the uncertainty in self-other beliefs affect their generalizability? How can disruptions in interpersonal exchange during sensitive developmental periods (e.g., childhood maltreatment) inform models of psychiatric disorders? Understanding the computational processes humans use in social exchange has broad implications for theories of healthy childhood development, group cohesion, reputation management, interpersonal synchrony, and the breakdown of social bonds.</p>
<p>In this study, we present a formal account of self-other generalization in healthy individuals and those seeking psychiatric support, tested through an interactive social economic paradigm—the Intentions Game—and a computational model that concurrently allows for self-insertion and social contagion. We evaluate our model using data from matched participants with and without a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). BPD is characterized by interpersonal sensitivity, relational instability, emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, paranoia, and severe fear of abandonment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gunderson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Euler et al., 2021</xref>). It is strongly associated with early childhood adversity, such as psychological, physical, and sexual abuse or neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Afifi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>), and inconsistent parenting experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Crawford et al., 2009</xref>), particularly during sensitive developmental periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fonagy &amp; Bateman, 2008</xref>). Early adversity interacts with pre-existing variations in stress-homeostasis mechanisms, exacerbating interpersonal disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pratt et al., 2017</xref>), underpinned by difficulties in mentalizing and trust appraisal, leading to disruptions in social learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fonagy &amp; Luyten, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nolte et al., 2023</xref>) and representations of self and other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hanegraaf et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Computational models have probed social processes in BPD, linking the BPD phenotype to a potential over-reliance on social versus internal cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Henco et al., 2020</xref>), ‘splitting’ of social latent states that encode beliefs about others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Story et al., 2023</xref>), negative appraisal of interpersonal experiences with heightened self-blame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mancinelli et al., 2024</xref>), inaccurate inferences about others’ irritability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hula et al., 2018</xref>), and reduced belief adaptation in social learning contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies have typically overlooked how self and other are represented in tandem, prompting further investigation into why any of these BPD phenotypes manifest.</p>
<p>We propose a theory with testable predictions to begin addressing this question, outlining that information generalization is foundational to healthy and evolving social bonds, and that the BPD phenotype may arise from an infraction to this process. To foreshadow our results we discover that healthy participants employ a mixed process of self-insertion and contagion to predict and align with the beliefs of their partners in the Intentions Game. In contrast, individuals with BPD exhibit distinct, disintegrated representations of self and other, despite showing similar average accuracy in their predictions about partners. Our model and data suggest that the previously observed computational characteristics in BPD, such as reduced self-anchoring during ambiguous learning and a relative impermeability of the self, arise from the failure of information about others to transfer and inform the self. By integrating separate computational findings, we provide a foundational model and a concise, dynamic paradigm to investigate uncertainty, generalization, and regulation in social interactions. Additionally, we examine the extent to which self-reported complex trauma and its sequelae are linked to these computational processes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Healthy participants (CON; n=53) and participants diagnosed with BPD (n=50), matched on age, gender, education, and social deprivation indices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), were invited to participate in a three-phase social value orientation paradigm—the Intentions Game (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)—with virtual partners. In the first phase, participants made forced choices between two options for splitting points with an anonymous partner. In the second phase, participants learned to predict the decisions of a new anonymous partner using the same forced-choice setup, receiving feedback on the accuracy of their successive predictions. Notably, using a novel server architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Burgess et al., 2023</xref>), partners in phase 2 were configured to be approximately 50% different from the participants in terms of their choices, ensuring that all participants had to learn about their phase 2 partner. The third phase mirrored the first, with participants informed that they were matched with a third anonymous partner, unrelated to those in phases 1 and 2. Detailed descriptions of the task can be found in the methods section.</p>

<title>Psychometric and Behavioural Results</title>
<p>Participants with BPD, compared to CON, reported significant childhood trauma, epistemic disruptions (including mistrust and credulity), elevated referential and persecutory beliefs, and demonstrated ineffective trait mentalizing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The groups did not differ in trait measures of certainty regarding self and others’ mental states, nor in elevated trust.</p>
<p>We analyzed the ‘types’ of choices participants made in each phase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). For example, a participant could make prosocial (self=5; other=5) versus individualistic (self=10; other=5) choices, or prosocial (self=10; other=10) versus competitive (self=10; other=5) choices. There were 12 types of pairs in phases 1 and 3 (individualistic vs. prosocial; prosocial vs. competitive; individualistic vs. competitive).</p>
<p>In phase 1, both CON and BPD participants made prosocial choices over competitive choices with similar frequency (CON=9.67[3.62]; BPD=9.60([3.57]). However, CON participants made significantly fewer prosocial choices when individualistic choices were available (CON=2.87[4.01]; BPD=5.22[4.54]; t=2.75, p=0.007). Both groups favored individualistic over competitive choices with similar frequency (CON=11.03[1.95]; BPD=10.34([2.63]). Examining reaction times (in milliseconds; ms) in phase 1 by choice type revealed that, compared to competitive choices, individualistic choices were made faster (linear estimate = -880.60, 95%CI: -1385.42, -376.2; t = -3.42, p &lt; 0.001), and prosocial choices were made fastest (linear estimate = -1171.1, 95%CI: -1701.97, -640.71; t = -4.32, p &lt; 0.001) irrespective of the type of choice pair. Prosocial choices were made significantly faster than individualistic choices (linear estimate = -290.70,95%CI: -548.50, -32.91; t = -2.21, p = 0.027). There was no difference in reaction times between CON and BPD participants in phase 1.</p>
<p>In phase 2 each group showed good predictive accuracy (CON=77.2%[13.9%]; BPD=72.7%[15.6%]). There was no difference in overall predictive accuracy between BPD and CON (linear estimate=2.44, 95%CI: -0.67, 5.54; t=1.56; p=0.12), nor when analysed on a trial-by-trial basis (linear estimate=0.26, 95%CI: -0.06, 0.59; z=1.61, p=0.11) using a random effects models. All participants showed an effect of time on accuracy, such that participants became more accurate in predicting their partner over the course of phase 2 (linear estimate=0.013, 95%CI: 0.008, 0.017; z=6.01; p&lt;0.001). There was no impact of choice type on reaction times in phase 2.</p>
<p>In phase 3, both CON and BPD participants continued to make equally frequent prosocial versus competitive choices (CON=9.15[3.91]; BPD=9.38[3.31]), and CON participants continued to make significantly less prosocial versus individualistic choices (CQN=2.03[3.45]; BPD=3.78 [4.16]; t=2.31, p=0.02). Both groups chose equally frequent individualistic versus competitive choices (CON=10.91 [2.40]; BPD=10.18[2.72]). Reaction times in phase 3 revealed that compared to competitive choices, individualistic choices were made faster (linear estimate = -528.50, 95%CI: - 943.60, -114.6; t = -2.50, p = 0.012), and prosocial choices were made fastest (linear estimate = -693.5, 95%CI: -1137.65, -250.39; t = -3.07, p = 0.002), irrespective of the type of choice pair. Prosocial choices were no longer executed significantly faster than individualistic choices. All participants made faster choices in phase 3 compared to phase 1 (linear estimate = -242.02, 95% CI: -332.64, -151.41; t = -5.24, p = 0.001). There was no significant effect of group on reaction times between phases 1 and 3, nor within phase 3 when analyzed independently.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Participants were invited to play a three-phase, repeated social value orientation paradigm—the Intentions Game—with virtual partners. Phase 1 of the Intentions Game lasted 36 trials and asks participants to make a forced choice between two options as to how to split points with an anonymous virtual partner. An example of a prosocial-individualistic pair of options could be (self=5, other=5) or (self=10, other=5) - if the participant chooses option 1 they could be viewed as less individualistic and more prosocial as the outcomes to the other do not change, but the self would earn less. In phase 2, lasting 54 trials, participants were asked to predict the decisions of a new anonymous partner using the same two-forced choice set-up and the same option pairs; participants were given feedback on whether they were correct or incorrect in their prediction. We used Amazon Web Services to create a novel server architecture to match participants and (virtual) partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Burgess et al., 2023</xref>). Partners in phase 2 were matched to be approximately 50% different from the participant with respect to their choices in phase 1 to ensure all participants needed to learn about their phase 2 partner, and to provide a mechanism to examine whether beliefs about partners had an effect on the self. Phase 3 was identical to phase 1, although participants were informed that they were matched with a third anonymous partner, unconnected to the partners in phase 1 and 2. At the end of the game, if participants collected over 1000 points overall, they were entered into a lottery to win a bonus. (B) We created four models that may explain the data and to test theories of social generalization. Model M1 assumes participants are subject to both self-insertion and social-contagion, that is, participants used their own preferences as a prior about their partner in phase 2, and partner behaviour subsequently influenced participant’s preferences in phase 3. Model M4 assumes participants are subject to neither self-insertion nor social contagion, instead forming a novel prior around the phase 2 partner rather than using their own preferences and failing to be influenced by their partner after observation. Models M2 and M3 suggest participants are only explained by either self-insertion or social-contagion, not both. <bold>(C)</bold> We assume that participants choices in phase 1 are governed by both a median <inline-formula id="ID1">

</inline-formula> to predict and learn about the preferences of their partner <italic>(θ<sub>par</sub></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; see methods). Model M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) suggests that participants initially use their own preferences as a prior belief about their partner (self-insertion), which is gradually diminished during the learning process in phase 2. M1 also posits that, following learning, the inferred beliefs about a partner will influence participants’ own preferences, making them more similar to their partner’s preferences following observation (social contagion). According to this model, participants shift towards their partner based on their uncertainty about self and others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>): greater uncertainty over self-preferences and increased precision in representing the other cause stronger social contagion effects.</p>
<p>Model M4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), on the other hand, suggests that participants do not engage in these generalization processes: predictions about others are not grounded in the self, and observing others does not alter self-preferences. Models M2 and M3 allow for either self-insertion or social contagion to occur independently. Consistent with prior research, we also constructed a model that assumes the same insertion and contagion processes as M1, but along a single prosocial-competitive axis (‘Beta model’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barnby et al., 2022</xref>). The ‘Beta model’ accommodates the possibility that participants might only consider a single dimension of joint reward allocation, which is typically emphasized in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hula et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<title>Model Comparison – BPD Participants Hold Disintegrated Self-Other Beliefs</title>
<p>We found that CON participants were best fit at the group level by M1 (Frequency = 0.59, Protected Exceedance Probability = 0.98), whereas BPD participants were best fit by M4 (Frequency = 0.54, Protected Exceedance Probability = 0.86; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consequently, we analyzed common parameters between groups, assuming that M1 and M4 best fitted the CON and BPD groups, respectively. It is worth noting that a minority of participants were best fit by M3 (CON: Frequency = 0.32; BPD: Frequency = 0.39), which assumes that participants were influenced by their partner but were not subject to self-insertion biases. We therefore also examined the change in beliefs between phases 1 and 3 under the assumption that M3 was accurate. Anticipating this analysis, we find that our main conclusions hold, showing that BPD participants were significantly less influenced by their partner compared to CON participants.</p>

<title>Generative Accuracy and Recovery</title>
<p>We simulated data for each participant using their individual parameters from the winning model within each group and refitted our models using this simulated data. Model comparison yielded very similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), with CON synthetic participants best fit at the group level by M1 (Frequency = 0.58, Protected Exceedance Probability = 0.98) and BPD synthetic participants best fit by M4 (Frequency = 0.57, Protected Exceedance Probability = 0.85). The simulated data closely matched the actions of participants across all three phases (median accuracy = 0.8, SD = 0.12). In phase 2, the model-predicted total correct scores were not significantly different from observed scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Both model responsibility and common parameters within each dominant model were strongly and significantly associated (model confusion p = 0.46–0.97, p &lt; 0.001; parameter recovery p = 0.70–0.94, p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Given the very good to excellent performance of the models, we continued to analyze individual parameters and simulations across each group.</p>

<caption><title>Beliefs between groups and within phases.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> We used random-effects hierarchical model fitting and comparison to jointly estimate group level and individual level parameters based on real data from participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Piray et al., 2021</xref>). CON participants were best fit by M1, whereas BPD participants were best fit by M4 on a group level. Looking within each model by simulating the beliefs of each participant reveals that – as expected – CON participants use the median of their self-preferences (black distribution) as a basis for their prior beliefs about partners (light orange distribution), and that the precision of their posterior beliefs about partners (dark orange distribution) and the precision of their own self preferences leads to a shifted model of the self (grey distribution). BPD participants on the other hand have a disintegrated prior over their partner which is not subject to their own self representation. Likewise, there is no change in self-preferences following learning, and thus an absence of the light grey distribution. For illustration, we focus on beliefs over relative preferences (β) and use real individual participants as exemplars for illustration. (B) Across models we extracted the common parameters that generate the behaviour of both CON and BPD participants – that is, their median and standard deviation over both <italic>α</italic> (absolute reward preferences) and <italic>β</italic> (relative value preferences), the flexibility over participants’ prior beliefs about their partners over each dimension, and the absolute change in posterior beliefs in phase 2 over each dimension <inline-formula id="ID31">

</inline-formula>. Using hierarchical Bayesian t-tests we demonstrated the mean difference in parameter values between groups. Purple values lower than 0 indicate that the BPD participants had significantly smaller parameter values. Here we find that BPD participants were less individualistic, equally prosocial, and more certain about their self-preferences. BPD participants were also less flexible over their beliefs about a partner’s absolute reward preferences and updated their beliefs less across the board. (C) We also calculated the Kullback-Leibler divergence (D<sub>KL</sub>) of beliefs between each trial (<italic>t</italic>-1 vs <italic>t</italic>) on each trial during phase 2. We observed three things: 1. All participants display more sensitive updates initially, 2. all participants ‘cool off’ in their sensitivity over the course of phase 2, and 3. BPD participants make significantly less sensitive updating throughout the course of phase 2 vs. CON participants. (D) Examining reaction times of participants over phase 2 revealed that participants became faster at making predictions as phase 2 continued. We also find that participant similarity interacted with trial to change reaction times, such that higher participant-partner similarity reduced reaction times in earlier trials but this difference was attenuated over time. Participant(PPT)- partner(PAR) similarity was calculated as the combined distance between participant and partner parameters determined by server matching along absolute (α) and relative reward (<italic>β</italic>) axes. Similarity was visualised as dichotomous for illustration but treated as a continuous variable in our analyses) (E) Examining participants under a blanket assumption that participants in both BPD and CON groups were influenced by their partner revealed that BPD participants were significantly less influenced by their partner across the board, both with respect to their phase 3 median and standard deviation of beliefs. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used between groups within the visualisation. *=p&lt;0.05, **=p&lt;0.01, ***=p&lt;0.001, ****=p&lt;0.0001.</p></caption>

<title>Phase 3 – BPD Participants Are Less Influenced by Partners</title>
<p>In the dominant model for the BPD group—M4—participants are not influenced in their phase 3 choices following exposure to their partner in phase 2. To further confirm this conclusion, we also analyzed participants under the assumption that M3 was the dominant model for both groups, considering that a minority of participants were best explained by this model. This analysis aligns with our primary model comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). CON participants altered their absolute median beliefs in phase 3 (linear estimate = 1.75, 95% CI: 0.73, 2.79; t = 3.36, p &lt; 0.001) and increased their precision (linear estimate = 1.53, 95% CI: 0.65, 2.40; t = 3.43, p &lt; 0.001) more than BPD participants. There was also an interaction with the type of belief: CON participants changed their median beliefs about relative reward along the prosocial-competitive axis more than their beliefs about absolute reward (linear estimate = 2.13, 95% CI: 0.09, 4.18; t = 2.06, p = 0.041), and became more precise along the same axis (linear estimate = 3.01,95% CI: 1.30,4.71; t = 3.47, p &lt; 0.01), compared to BPD participants. This suggests that relative reward preferences are particularly resistant to change in BPD participants.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> We used random-effects hierarchical model fitting and comparison to jointly estimate group level and individual level parameters on simulated data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Piray et al., 2019</xref>). CON participants were best fit by M1, whereas BPD participants were best fit by M4 (B) Server matching between participant and partner in phase two was successful, with participants being approximately 50% different to their partners with respect to the choices each would have made on each trial in phase 2 (mean similarity=0.49, SD=0.12). Model accuracy across the task was very high (mean accuracy=0.8, SD=0.12). Model accuracy within each phase was very high (mean accuracy[phase1]=0.83, SD[phase1]=0.16; mean accuracy[phase2]=0.77, SD[phase2]=0.14; mean accuracy[phase3]=0.82, SD[phase3]=0.17). Loglikelihood values were also well above what would be expected had the model fitted the data by chance (median=-40.68, SD=22.7; chance value=-87.33). Choice probabilities generated by the model on each trial were also well above chance thresholds (median=0.91, SD=0.24; chance value=0.5). (C) The spearman association between the responsibility allocated for each participant during real and recovered model comparison was highly correlated on the diagonal. There was some correlation between M1-M2 but this was due to M2 being a nested model of M1, sharing similar free parameters; this was not worrying in light of excellent model identifiability overall in the synthetic comparison. Associations between real and recovered parameters from the dominant model within each BPD and CON participants was very high with few cross correlations on the off-diagonal.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We built and tested a theory of interpersonal generalization in a population of matched participants with (BPD) and without (CON) a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder using the Intentions Game, a three-phase social value orientation task. Both groups demonstrated equivalent behavioral accuracy but employed opposite strategies. CON participants used a process of self-other generalization to predict and align with their partners, while BPD participants maintained distinct representations of self and other. In phase 2, CON participants exhibited greater belief sensitivity to new information during observational learning, eventually adopting a similar updating regime to those with BPD. Our findings also indicate that reported childhood trauma and persecutory beliefs were linked to reduced flexibility when learning about partners, diminishing the influence of a partner’s behavior on self-change. Collectively, our results integrate prior computational and behavioral findings in BPD and provide a formal account of social information generalization in humans, alongside a concise social paradigm to test these processes.</p>
<p>The data replicate models of social generalization that have focused on individual processes of self-insertion and contagion, extending these theories by demonstrating both processes in conjunction. Models of self-insertion directly map participant preferences onto prior beliefs about others, which has been used to explain increased reaction times in observational learning of others’ snack food preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tarantola et al., 2017</xref>), as well as improved predictive accuracy when matched with individuals of similar social values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barnby et al., 2022</xref>). Both findings are replicated in this study. Although we did not explicitly model reaction times, we observed an interaction between reaction time reductions over time and interpersonal similarity at baseline. In tandem, models of social contagion have focused on intertemporal discounting and explain shifts in self-preferences as a function of uncertainty regarding self and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Moutoussis et al., 2016</xref>). In both the dominant (M1) and sub-dominant (M3) models that best explained data in healthy participants, shifts in self-beliefs were also influenced by representational uncertainty of self and other: greater self-uncertainty and reduced other uncertainty led to larger shifts in self-beliefs.</p>
<p>The data also align with prior research on social impression formation, which suggests that humans form rapid evaluations of others that are refined over time (Bone et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Moutoussis et al., 2023</xref>). This initial ‘heating’ and subsequent ‘cooling’ of beliefs corresponds to the computational complexity employed: model-based strategies are typically used early in interactions, transitioning to simpler, model-free computations once a partner’s behavior becomes predictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gęsiarz &amp; Crockett, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Guennouni &amp; Speekenbrink, 2022</xref>). Our findings support this framework, demonstrating initial variability early in interactions followed by steady, minimal updating. Notably, participants with a BPD diagnosis exhibit a less sensitive updating profile compared to CON participants.</p>
<p>Disruptions in self-to-other generalization provide an explanation for previous computational findings related to task-based mentalizing in BPD. BPD is characterized by early life adversity and neglect, which result in diminished representations of self and other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fonagy &amp; Bateman, 2008</xref>). Studies tracking observational mentalizing reveal that individuals with BPD, compared to those without, place greater emphasis on social over internal cues when learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Henco et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Fineberg et al., 2018</xref>) and demonstrate reduced belief adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>), along with ‘splitting’ of latent social representations (Story et al., 2024). This heightened focus on others often leads to perceiving them as harmful. From the perspective of our model, those with BPD intensely focus on social information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Henco et al., 2020</xref>) due to the adoption of a new, neutral belief about others. The absence of constrained self-insertion may predispose them to ‘split’ beliefs (Story et al., 2024), as individuals with BPD reach the beliefs of their partner more rapidly, are less receptive to new information, and adopt greater belief precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). This may represent an attempt to quickly reduce the uncertainty of a neutral prior. Essentially, individuals with BPD assume ambiguity and are quicker to settle on an explanation given limited data. Although self-insertion may intuitively seem counter to rational belief formation, it has important implications for sustaining trusting social bonds through moderation of information in the face of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Those with a diagnosis of BPD also show reduced permeability in generalising from other to self. While prior research has predominantly focused on how those with BPD use information to form impressions, it has not typically examined whether these impressions affect the self. In interactive trust paradigms, neural responses to monetary offers from others to the self were substantially blunted in individuals with BPD compared to those without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">King-Casas et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, in non-social reward tasks, those with BPD show reduced neural feedback-related negativity amplitudes, which obstructs feedback-related self-change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Stewart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vega et al., 2013</xref>). Our results suggest a mechanistic basis for social contagion, indicating that self-rigidity prevents observed social behaviors from generalizing to the self, potentially exacerbated by childhood trauma, paranoia, and impaired mentalizing capabilities. Resistance to social influence may serve as a protective response but can also contribute to the pervasive loneliness experienced by individuals with BPD, even in the absence of social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Liebke et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Clinical implications of our work underscores the importance of consistency and stability in clinical support for individuals with a diagnosis of BPD. Encouragingly, we found that those with BPD were not entirely impermeable to observed behavior, suggesting that consistent external models of trust could be internalized over time. Restoring a stable sense of self through social learning and effective mentalizing, along with a consistent focus on differentiating self from other (de Meulemeester et al., 2021), are central to mentalization-based therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2010</xref>; Smits et al., 2024) and other evidence-based treatments for BPD. We hope that our paradigm and model can offer insights into the effectiveness of these and other therapies in driving mechanistic psychological change.</p>
<p>More broadly, our model bridges formal theories of associative learning and social cognition. Reinforcement learning approaches have effectively organized theories around uncertainty navigation in non-social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Piray et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zika, 2023</xref>). However, humans do not function in isolation. Bayesian models of internal and external social beliefs are better suited to capture the dynamic nature of time, context, and uncertainty during interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">FeldmanHall &amp; Nassar, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Velez &amp; Gweon, 2021</xref>). This is particularly important for understanding psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barnby et al., 2023</xref>). Our paradigm is concise, visually engaging, includes straightforward rules and instructions, and allows for tight experimental control over partner similarity to promote learning. Our model and paradigm effectively capture core social psychological principles grounded in general computational approaches to learning and uncertainty, elucidating key aspects of human social interaction and exchange.</p>
<p>We note some limitations to our study. Primarily, we focused on the ability of individuals to integrate their self-concept into beliefs about others. It is also possible that humans possess strong, salient representations of others (or groups of others) that serve as dominant templates for learning. This may be particularly relevant for individuals with BPD, who will often have interpersonal experiences of abuse, neglect, or other forms of distress. The use of a salient, negative other-prior as a basis for learning was not measured in this study, but it may explain the ambivalent prior observed in phase 2, where a mixture of self and notional other influences belief formation, leading to rigid belief updating. Individuals with BPD may integrate priors from different sources as a mixture. We can simulate this by modelling a causal framework that incorporates priors based on both self and a strong memory impression of a notional other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure S3</xref>). However, a strength of our data is that we observed impression formation independent of valence—impressions were formed regardless of whether a partner was more or less prosocial or selfish than the participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure S4</xref>). This supports our hypothesis that a vulnerable self-model and lack of self-insertion contribute to the formation of overly precise beliefs during learning as a means of rapidly reducing uncertainty. Even if a mixture model better explains the ambivalent prior in phase 2, it would still support a general hypothesis about the fractured concept of self and other in BPD.</p>
<p>Another strength of our work is demonstrating processes of self-insertion and contagion under minimal interaction conditions: simple observation alone was sufficient to elicit both processes. However, this is also a limitation. While we predict that these processes will apply in more naturalistic settings, this has yet to be tested, and it remains unclear whether these effects will persist in richer conditions, particularly when higher affective arousal and challenges to mentalising are present. Lastly, the action space and parameters governing choice in our study were quite simple—two actions influenced by two parameters. This was a deliberate computational choice to avoid overly complex action spaces that may be difficult to fit to real human data, and which might fail to capture how these mechanisms operate in the context of increasing action and model complexity.</p>
<p>Our findings open new possibilities for testing how social uncertainty across the lifespan, and in the context of ill-health, may explain the formation and maintenance of healthy social bonds as well as their disruption. We make two key predictions: 1. The self is an evolving and dynamic concept, particularly susceptible to peer influence during adolescence. We predict that adolescents will use self-insertion to a lesser degree (if at all) than adults in our sample, and that the extent of social contagion in our paradigm will correlate with reported peer influence in other areas. We further predict that the degree of social contagion will correspond to brain regions associated with self-processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sebastian, Burnett &amp; Blakemore, 2008</xref>), and that these contagion effects will diminish as individuals progress into emerging and full adulthood. 2. Psychosis is conceptualized as a heightened absorption in self-generated conscious experiences, leading to a collapse of the internal and external boundaries of self and other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Humpston, 2018</xref>). We predict that in our paradigm, this will manifest as an exaggeration of self-insertion when predicting others, accompanied by low learning rates and minimal social contagion effects.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>We used a case-control, between-subjects design with 103 participants: a control group from the general population (N = 53) and a clinical group diagnosed with BPD (N = 50). Both groups were recruited for a larger study investigating social exchanges in BPD and Anti-Social Personality Disorder (approved by the Research Ethics Committee for Wales, 12/WA/0283). The control and clinical groups were matched on age, sex, years in education, and the English Indices of Deprivation based on the 2019 census (loD 2019; Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government, 2019). Participants received £70 compensation for completing questionnaires and online tasks which included the Intentions Game. They also received a performance bonus if they were entered into the lottery for surpassing 1000 points over the course of the game.</p>
<p>Participants for the control group were recruited through an advertisement on the Call For Participants website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.callforparticipants.com">https://www.callforparticipants.com</ext-link>), local community services and adult schools. Inclusion criteria required control participants to have no pre-existing or current diagnoses of mental health disorders, neurological disorders, or traumatic brain injuries. Additionally, control participants must not have been currently in therapy or taking medication for any psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>BPD participants were recruited through referrals by psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and trainee clinical psychologists within personality disorder services across 9 NHS Foundation Trusts in the London, and 3 NHS Foundation Trusts across England (Devon, Merseyside, Cambridgeshire). Participants were also recruited through the UCLH website, where the study was advertised. Individuals who discovered the study through this platform and were interested in participating initiated contact themselves. To be included in the study, all participants needed to have, or meet criteria for, a primary diagnosis of BPD (or emotionally-unstable personality disorder or complex emotional needs) based on a clinical assessment and be under the care of one of the trusts collaborating in recruitment or have a general practitioner whose details they were willing to provide. Clinical participants with recent psychotic episodes, severe learning disability, or current or past neurological disorders were excluded.</p>

<title>Green et al. Paranoid Thought Scale (GPTS).</title>
<p>The GPTS assesses paranoid thoughts, including ideas of social reference (scale A) and persecution (scale B), in both general and clinical populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Green et al., 2008</xref>). Each item is scored from 0 (not at all) to 5 (totally) concerning endorsement of each item.

<title>Paradigm, procedure and server architecture</title>
<p>The Intentions Game is a repeated social-value orientation paradigm with three phases.</p>
<p>In Phase 1 of the Intentions Game, participants take on the role of the decider with an anonymous partner over 36 trials. In each trial, participants choose between two options to distribute points between themselves and their partners. Participants make 12 choices each between prosocial and competitive (e.g. Option 1 =[10,10], Option 2 = [10,5]) individualistic and competitive (e.g. Option 1=[10,5], Option 2=[8,1]), and prosocial and individualistic options (e.g. Option 1 =[5,5], Option 2=[10,5]). Phase 1 choices allowed experimenters to classify participants’ social preferences as prosocial (preferring equal outcomes), individualistic (maximising own payoff), or competitive (maximising relative payoff difference at the cost of lower self-gain).</p>
<p>We included a task environment that balanced each type of choice pair (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In phase 2 of the game, participants were matched with a new anonymous partner and played the role of the recipient over 54 trials. In this phase, the participants predicted which of the two options their partner would choose on each trial. Trial numerical values for self and other were identical to Phase 1. Partners’ decisions were determined via a dynamic algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Burgess et al., 2023</xref>) to ensure partners were approximately ~50% different from the participants’ based on participants’ choices in phase 1. To surmise this architecture, we implemented a version of the client-server paradigm hosted on an Amazon Web Service (AWS) LightSail server, where the web-based behavioural task (implemented with JavaScript in Gorilla.sc) acted as the client and exchanged information with a remote AWS server. The server received all anonymised behavioural data following phase 1. The Application Programming Interface (API) to interact with the server used a customizable R script (v4.3) to process the received data from the participant, and additional R scripts were used to process and generate output for the participant. A function within the backend scripts first used Bayesian inference to approximate a participant’s parameters for phase 1. It then simulated what choices the participant would have made in phase 2 had the participant been in the role of the partner. The algorithm then sought to find parameters that would be at least 50% dissimilar from participant parameters with respect to the generated choices of those parameters. This allowed the task behaviour of phase 2 to be dynamically updated in response to participant choices in phase 1. This facilitated tight control over the state of the task and enabled advanced computations to be performed on participant data beyond the capabilities of a web browser.</p>
<p>Participants were incentivised in phase 2 to predict accurately, as accurate predictions would contribute to their total point scores (total correct answers were multiplied by 10 and added to their points) and determined their entry into the lottery to win an extra £20 Amazon voucher. After participants had made their predictions, they were given feedback informed on whether their predictions were accurate.</p>
<p>At the end of phase 2, participants were asked to rate (1) the extent to which they thought their partner was driven by the desire to earn points in this task overall (self-interest) and (2) the extent to which they thought their partner was driven by the desire to reduce the participant’s points in this task overall (attribution of harmful intent). The answers were presented using two separate sliders from 0 to 100; the sliders were initialised to be invisible until the participants made the first click.</p>
<p>Phase 3 was identical to phase 1 except that participants were matched with a new anonymous partner. Participants would take on the decider role similar to phase 1 which allowed experimenters to estimate whether the observation of their partner in phase 2 had an influence on participants in phase 3.</p>

<title>Behavioural Analysis</title>
<p>All analysis was conducted in R (v. 4.3.3) on a macbook pro (M2 Max; OS=Ventura13.5). All individual numeric values extraneous of statistical tests are reported with their mean and standard deviation (mean=KCWM8V4, SD=YY). All statistical tests where dependent variables mapped one value to one participant (e.g. trait psychometric scores) were conducted as linear models, with the regression coefficient, 95% confidence interval (95%CI), t-value and p-value reported like so (linear estimate=KCWM8V4, 95%CI:AA,BB; t=CC, p=DD). When dependent variables mapped multiple values to each participant (e.g. trial-by-trial accuracy or reaction time) random-effects linear modelling was used. All correlations used Pearson estimates (r) unless distributions were non-normal, in which case Spearman-ranked correlations (ρ) were performed.</p>

<title>Model space and Computational Analysis</title>
<p>We apply four computational hypotheses (M1-M4) which could explain the data collected from the Intentions Game (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), centred around formal principles of self-insertion and social contagion. Self-insertion states that a self inserts their own preferences into their beliefs about others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson &amp; Chen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kreuger &amp; Clement, 1994</xref>); Social Contagion states that a self’s preferences will change when exposed to the preferences of an other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Frith &amp; Frith, 2012</xref>). In each case, cognitive representations of self and other are allowed to intermingle to form a new hybrid of the two for the purposes of computational efficiency and/or social bonding.</p>
<p>We note some important assumptions in our notation going forward. In dyadic social interaction, both parties are trying to estimate and predict the true state (θ) of the self (θ<sub>S</sub>) and the other (θ<sub>o</sub>). However, this estimation is inherently imperfect. Theories of social inference need to consider three sources of noisy estimation of this quantity: a self’s (s) metacognitive model of their own state, <inline-formula id="ID82">

<p>All computational models were fitted using a Hierarchical Bayesian Inference (HBI) algorithm which allows hierarchical parameter estimation while assuming random effects for group and individual model responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Piray et al., 2019</xref>). During fitting we added a small noise floor to distributions (2.22e<sup>-16</sup>) before normalisation for numerical stability. Parameters were estimated using the HBI in native space drawing from broad priors (μM=0, σ<sup>2</sup>M = 6.5; where <bold>M</bold>={M1, M2, M3, M4}). This process was run independently for each group. Parameters were transformed into model-relevant space for analysis. All models and hierarchical fitting was implemented in Matlab (Version R2022B). All other analyses were conducted in R (version 4.3.3; arm64 build) running on Mac OS (Ventura 13.0).</p>
<p>To conduct model recovery we simulated synthetic participants (CON=53; BPD=50) using their fitted parameters from the dominant model of the group (CON=M1; BPD=M4). We then performed model fitting with an identical procedure to the real behavioural data. We tested associations between model responsibility and individual parameters for the real and recovered models, as well as the association between choices and predictions made by the model from simulation and the choices and predictions made by participants in each trial.</p>
<p>Differences between groups for individual-level parameters were estimated using hierarchical Bayesian t-tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bååth, 2014</xref>). This used JAGS as a backend MCMC sampler; differences in mean between groups (Δ<italic>μ</italic>) are additionally reported with their corresponding posterior 95% High Density Interval (95%HDI).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors use a sophisticated task design and Bayesian computational modeling to test their hypothesis that information generalization (operationalized as a combination of self-insertion and social contagion) in social situations is disrupted in Borderline Personality Disorder. Their main finding relates to the observation that two different models best fit the two tested groups: While the model assuming both self-insertion and social contagion to be present when estimating others' social value preferences fit the control group best, a model assuming neither of these processes provided the best fit to BPD participants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the presented work lie in the sophisticated task design and the thorough investigation of their theory by use of mechanistic computational models to elucidate social decision-making and learning processes in BPD.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript's primary weakness relates to the number of comparisons conducted and a lack of clarity in how those comparisons relate to the authors' hypotheses. The authors specify a primary prediction about disruption to information generalization in social decision making &amp; learning processes, and it is clear from the text how their 4 main models are supposed to test this hypothesis. With regards to any further analyses however (such as the correlations between multiple clinical scales and eight different model parameters, but also individual parameter comparisons between groups), this is less clear. I recommend the authors clearly link each test to a hypothesis by specifying, for each analysis, what their specific expectations for conducted comparisons are, so a reader can assess whether the results are/aren't in line with predictions. The number of conducted tests relating to a specific hypothesis also determines whether multiple comparison corrections are warranted or not. If comparisons are exploratory in nature, this should be explicitly stated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors present some measures for external validation of the models, including comparison between reaction times and belief shifts, and correlations between model predicted accuracy and behavioural accuracy/total scores. However it would be great to see some more formal external validation of how the model parameters relate to participant behaviour, e.g., the correlation between the number of pro-social choices and ß-values, or the correlation between the change in absolute number of pro-social choices and the change in ß. From comparing the behavioural and computational results it looks like they would correlate highly, but it would be nice to see this formally confirmed.</p>
<p>The statement in the abstract that 'Overall, the findings provide a clear explanation of how self-other generalisation constrains and assists learning, how childhood adversity disrupts this through separation of internalised beliefs' makes an unjustified claim of causality between childhood adversity and separation of self - and other beliefs, although the authors only present correlations. I recommend this should be rephrased to reflect the correlational nature of the results.</p>
<p>Currently, from the discussion the findings seem relevant in explaining certain aberrant social learning and -decision making processes in BPD. However, I would like to see a more thorough discussion about the practical relevance of their findings in light of their observation of comparable prediction accuracy between the two groups.</p>
<p>Relatedly, the authors mention that a primary focus of mentalization based therapy for BPD is 'restoring a stable sense of self' and 'differentiating the self from the other'. These goals are very reminiscent of the findings of the current study that individuals with BPD show lower uncertainty over their own and relative reward preferences, and that they are less susceptible to social contagion. Could the observed group differences therefore be a result of therapy rather than adverse early life experiences?</p>
<p>Regarding partner similarity: It was unclear to me why the authors chose partners that were 50% similar when it would be at least equally interesting to investigate self-insertion and social contagion with those that are more than 50% different to ourselves? Do the authors have any assumptions or even data that shows the results still hold for situations with lower than 50% similarity?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper investigates social-decision making, and how this changes after observing the behaviour of other people, in borderline personality disorder. The paper employs a task including three phases, the first where participants make decision on how to allocate rewards to oneself and to a virtual partner, the second where they observe the same task performed by someone else, and a third phase equivalent to phase one, but with a new partner. Using sophisticated computational modelling to analyse choice data, the study reports that borderline participants (versus controls) are more certain about their preferences in phase one, used more neutral priors and are less flexible during phase two, and are less influenced by partners in phase three.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The topic is interesting and important, and the findings are potentially intriguing. The computational methods employed is clever and sophisticated, at the cutting edge of research in the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are two major weaknesses. First, the paper lacks focus and clarity. The introduction is rather vague and, after reading it, I remained confused about the paper's aims. Rather than relying on specific predictions, the analysis is exploratory. This implies that it is hard to keep track, and to understand the significance, of the many findings that are reported. Second, although the computational approach employed is clever and sophisticated, there is important information missing about model comparison which ultimately makes some of the results hard to assess from the perspective of the reader.</p>

<p>In this paper, the authors use a three-phase economic game to examine the tendency to engage in prosocial versus competitive exchanges with three anonymous partners. In particular, they consider individual differences in the tendency to infer about others' tendencies based on one's preferences and to update one's preferences based on observations of others' behavior. The study includes a sample of individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and a matched sample of psychiatrically healthy control participants.</p>
<p>On the whole, the experimental design is well-suited to the questions and the computational model analyses are thorough, including modern model-fitting procedures. I particularly appreciated the clear exposition regarding model parameterization and the descriptive Table 2 for qualitative model comparison. My broad question about the experiment (in terms of its clinical and cognitive process relevance): Does the task encourage competition or give participants a reason to take advantage of others? I don't think it does, so it would be useful to clarify the normative account for prosociality in the introduction (e.g., some of Robin Dunbar's work).</p>
<p>The finding that individuals with BPD do not engage in self-other generalization on this task of social intentions is novel and potentially clinically relevant. The authors find that BPD participants' tendency to be prosocial when splitting points with a partner does not transfer into their expectations of how a partner will treat them in a task where they are the passive recipient of points chosen by the partner. In the discussion, the authors reasonably focus on model differences between groups (Bayesian model comparison), yet I thought this finding -- BPD participants not assuming prosocial tendencies in phase 2 while CON participant did -- merited greater attention. Although the BPD group was close to 0 on the \beta prior in Phase 2, their difference from CON is still in the direction of being more mistrustful (or at least not assuming prosociality). This may line up with broader clinical literature on mistrustfulness and attributions of malevolence in the BPD literature (e.g., a 1992 paper by Nigg et al. in Journal of Abnormal Psychology). My broad point is to consider further the Phase 2 findings in terms of the clinical interpretation of the shift in \beta relative to controls.</p>
<p>On the conceptual level, I had two additional concerns. First, the authors note that they have &quot;proposed a theory with testable predictions&quot; (p. 4 but also elsewhere) but they do not state any clear predictions in the introduction, nor do they consider what sort of patterns will be observed in the BPD group in view of extant clinical and computational literature. Rather, the paper seems to be somewhat exploratory, largely looking at group differences (BPD vs. CON) on all of the shared computational parameters and additional indices such as belief updating and reaction times. Given this, I would suggest that the authors make stronger connections between extant research on intention representation in BPD and their framework (model and paradigm). In particular, the authors do not address related findings from Ereira (2020) and Story (2024) finding that in a false belief task that BPD participants *overgeneralize* from self to other. A critical comparison of this work to the present study, including an examination of the two tasks differ in the processes they measure, is important.</p>
<p>In addition, perhaps it is fairer to note more explicitly the exploratory nature of this work. Although the analyses are thorough, many of them are not argued for a priori (e.g., rate of belief updating in Figure 2C) and the reader amasses many individual findings that need to by synthesized.</p>
<p>Second, in the discussion, the authors are too quick to generalize to broad clinical phenomena in BPD that are not directly connected to the task at hand. For example, on p. 22: &quot;Those with a diagnosis of BPD also show reduced permeability in generalising from other to self. While prior research has predominantly focused on how those with BPD use information to form impressions, it has not typically examined whether these impressions affect the self.&quot; Here, it's not self-representation per se (typically, identity or one's view of oneself), but instead cooperation and prosocial tendencies in an economic context. It is important to clarify what clinical phenomena may be closely related to the task and which are more distal and perhaps should not be approached here.</p>
<p>On a more technical level, I had two primary concerns. First, although the authors consider alternative models within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, some challenges arise when one analyzes parameter estimates fit separately to two groups, particularly when the best-fitting model is not shared. In particular, although the authors conduct a model confusion analysis, they do not as far I could tell (and apologies if I missed it) demonstrate that the dynamics of one model are nested within the other. Given that M4 has free parameters governing the expectations on the absolute and relative reward preferences in Phase 2, is it necessarily the case that the shared parameters between M1 and M4 can be interpreted on the same scale? Relatedly, group-specific model fitting has virtues when believes there to be two distinct populations, but there is also a risk of overfitting potentially irrelevant sample characteristics when parameters are fit group by group.</p>
<p>To resolve these issues, I saw one straightforward solution (though in modeling, my experience is that what seems straightforward on first glance may not be so upon further investigation). M1 assumes that participants' own preferences (posterior central tendency) in Phase 1 directly transfer to priors in Phase 2, but presumably the degree of transfer could vary somewhat without meriting an entirely new model (i.e., the authors currently place this question in terms of model selection, not within-model parameter variation). I would suggest that the authors consider a model parameterization fit to the full dataset (both groups) that contains free parameters capturing the *deviations* in the priors relative to the preceding phase's posterior. That is, the free parameters $\bar{\alpha}_{par}^m$ and $\bar{\beta}_{par}^m$ govern the central tendency of the Phase 2 prior parameter distributions directly, but could be reparametrized as deviations from Phase 1 $\theta^m_{ppt}$ parameters in an additive form. This allows for a single model to be fit all participants that encompasses the dynamics of interest such that between-group parameter comparisons are not biased by the strong assumptions imposed by M1 (that phase 1 preferences and phase 2 observations directly transfer to priors). In the case of controls, we would expect these deviation parameters to be centred on 0 insofar as the current M1 fit them best, whereas for BPD participants should have significant deviations from earlier-phase posteriors (e.g., the shift in \beta toward prior neutrality in phase 2 compared to one's own prosociality in phase 1). I think it's still valid for the authors to argue for stronger model constraints for Bayesian model comparison, as they do now, but inferences regarding parameter estimates should ideally be based on a model that can encompass the full dynamics of the entire sample, with simpler dynamics (like posterior -&gt; prior transfer) being captured by near-zero parameter estimates.</p>
<p>My second concern pertains to the psychometric individual difference analyses. These were not clearly justified in the introduction, though I agree that they could offer potentially meaningful insight into which scales may be most related to model parameters of interest. So, perhaps these should be earmarked as exploratory and/or more clearly argued for. Crucially, however, these analyses appear to have been conducted on the full sample without considering the group structure. Indeed, many of the scales on which there are sizable group differences are also those that show correlations with psychometric scales. So, in essence, it is unclear whether most of these analyses are simply recapitulating the between-group tests reported earlier in the paper or offer additional insights. I think it's hard to have one's cake and eat it, too, in this regard and would suggest the authors review Preacher et al. 2005, Psychological Methods for additional detail. One solution might be to always include group as a binary covariate in the symptom dimension-parameter analyses, essentially partialing the correlations for group status. I remain skeptical regarding whether there is additional signal in these analyses, but such controls could convince the reader. Nevertheless, without such adjustments, I would caution against any transdiagnostic interpretations such as this one in the Highlights: &quot;Higher reported childhood trauma, paranoia, and poorer trait mentalizing all diminish other-to-self information transfer irrespective of diagnosis.&quot; Since many of these analyses relate to scales on which the groups differ, the transdiagnostic relevance remains to be demonstrated.</p>
