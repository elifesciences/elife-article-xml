<title>Abstract</title><sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>The outer mitochondrial Rho GTPase 1, MIRO1, mediates mitochondrial motility within cells, but implications for vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) physiology and its roles in vascular diseases, such as neointima formation following vascular injury are widely unknown.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Carotid ligation was performed in an in vivo model of selective Miro1 deletion in smooth muscle cells. VSMC proliferation during the cell cycle and molecular mechanisms of smooth muscle cell proliferation were explored in cultured aortic VSMCs by imaging mitochondrial positioning and cristae structure and assessing the effects on ATP production, metabolic function and interactions with components of the electron transport chain (ETC). MIRO1 expression was analyzed in human coronary arteries, and its function was assessed via knockdown in human coronary artery VSMCs.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Results revealed strong MIRO1 expression in VSMCs within human atherosclerotic plaques. MIRO1 facilitated VSMC proliferation and neointima formation by regulating mitochondrial positioning and PDGF-stimulated ATP production and respiration, critical for cell-cycle progression at G1/S. Deletion of Miro1 disrupted mitochondrial cristae structure, diminished ETC complex I activity, and impaired super complex formation. Notably, restoring MIRO1 function with a mutant lacking EF hands, which are essential for mitochondrial mobility, only partially rescued these effects. MIRO1 knockdown in human coronary artery VSMCs confirmed its pivotal role in mitochondrial function and VSMC proliferation.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study highlights two key mechanisms by which MIRO1 regulates VSMC proliferation. First, it maintains ATP synthesis by preserving mitochondrial cristae integrity. Second, its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent EF hands enable ATP-dependent mitochondrial positioning. By linking mitochondrial motility and energy production to VSMC physiology, these findings position MIRO1 as a critical regulator of vascular remodeling and a potential target for therapeutic interventions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mitochondria play a crucial role in various cellular functions throughout the cardiovascular system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, yet their specific roles in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of systemic arteries remain underexplored, particularly with respect to vasoproliferative diseases such as neointimal hyperplasia. Insights into these processes have largely stemmed from extending findings on cytosolic pathways. For instance, neointima formation has been shown to be inhibited either by promoting apoptosis via mitochondrial pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> or by reducing mitochondrial ROS production through overexpression of uncoupling protein 2 or superoxide dismutase 2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Mitochondria dynamically adapt to cellular changes through fission and fusion, which modulate VSMC proliferation, migration, and neointima formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, over a decade ago Chalmers et al. showed that interfering with mitochondrial movement blocks VSMC proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Despite this, the molecular regulators governing mitochondrial mobility in VSMCs have remained largely understudied.</p>
<p>The outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase MIRO1 is essential for orchestrating mitochondrial positioning in many cell types, including neurons, lymphocytes, and various cancer cell lines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. MIRO1 contains two canonical EF-hand domains that are flanked by two GTPase domains and a C-terminal transmembrane domain that anchors MIRO1 to the outer mitochondrial membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. MIRO1 associates with trafficking kinesin-binding proteins (TRAKs), linking mitochondria to microtubules and myosin XIX <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. These interactions are regulated by changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels: when MIRO1 is not bound by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin, it links mitochondria to microtubules; when the EF hands are bound by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a conformational change causes mitochondria to dissociate from microtubules, arresting their movement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In addition to playing a role in promoting mitochondrial mobility, MIRO1 is believed to control mitophagy through phosphorylation by the Pink/Parkin complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and to facilitate the formation of mitochondrial cristae via associations with the mitochondrial contact site (MICOS) complex and the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Reports of MIRO1âs diverse roles have prompted some investigations into its role in human diseases. For example, Miro1 mutations identified in humans (for example p.R272Q) have been linked genetically and pathophysiologically to Parkinsonâs disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, few studies have investigated its impact on cardiovascular disease. Cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal rats lacking Miro1 were protected against phenylephrine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and mitochondrial fission <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. However, its specific contributions to vascular pathologies remain unclear, with data from our laboratory highlighting MIRO1âs impact on VSMC migration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Emerging evidence positions MIRO1 as a regulator of cell proliferation of fibroblasts and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Our group recently reported that cyclic changes in formation of mitochondrial ER contact sides (MERCS) that enable the transfer of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and other metabolites to mitochondria are required for cell proliferation and controlled by MIRO1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to determine whether MIRO1 controls VSMC proliferation and, if so, to uncover the underlying mechanisms involved. We investigated the effects of MIRO1 manipulation on VSMC proliferation and the potential mechanism by which MIRO1 affects cell cycle progression, mitochondrial mobility, ATP production, and respiration. Additionally, we used a transgenic mouse model in which Miro1 was deleted specifically in VSMCs to test its effects on neointima formation in vivo.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Animal studies were conducted in accordance with the NIH <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic>, following protocols that were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Iowa. SMMHC-CreERlJÂ² mice, in which expression of tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase is driven by the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) promoter, were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Strain #019079). The Mitochondrial Rho1 GTPase LoxP (Floxed Miro1 conditional KO) mice were graciously provided by Dr. Janet Shaw (University of Utah) and backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Strain #000664). The VSMC-selective floxed Miro1 conditional knockout mice (SM-Miro1<sup>-/-</sup> mice) were generated by crossbreeding with SMMHC-CreERlJÂ² mice. Cre recombination was induced by intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen (80 mg/Kg) for 5 days, followed by a 14-day break. SMMHC-CreERlJÂ² mice were injected with same dose of tamoxifen and used as a control for in vivo experiments. In vivo experiments were performed in male mice because the tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase in this model, whose expression is driven by the SMMHC promoter, is present on the Y-chromosome.</p>

<title>Ligation of the common carotid artery and preparation of vessels for quantification of neointima and media</title>
<p>10â12-week-old SM-Miro1<sup>-/-</sup> mice and controls were fed high-fat chow for 3 weeks (D12492, 60 kcal% fat, Research Diets) and then, the animals were anesthetized, and survival surgeries of left common carotid artery ligation were performed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. A high fat diet was used to approximate human-like cholesterol levels and model metabolic conditions. This diet elevates serum cholesterol to approximately 250 mg/dL and slightly increases nonfasting glucose levels (â¼200 mg/dL), creating a metabolic profile close to that observed in humans with coronary artery disease (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/jax-mice-and-services/strain-data-sheet-pages/phenotype-information-380050">https://www.jax.org/jax-mice-and-services/strain-data-sheet-pages/phenotype-information-380050</ext-link>). At 21 days after the surgery, the animals were anesthetized and underwent transcardiac perfusion with 10 ml of PBS, followed by fixation with 10 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), at physiological pressure. The left (ligated) and right (non-ligated) common carotid arteries were excised at the carotid bifurcation and embedded for sectioning followed by Verhoeff Van Gieson (VVG) staining.</p>

<title>Culture of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)</title>
<p>Primary mouse aortic VSMCs were isolated enzymatically; incubation in elastase (1U/ml for 10 min at 37Â°) was performed to remove the adventitia. The medial layer of the aorta, which contains the VSMCs, was minced and incubated in 2 mg/ml collagenase type II digestion solution (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) for 2 hr. In early experiments, VSMCs were isolated from SM-Miro1<sup>-/-</sup> and littermate mice (referred to as SM-Miro1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs). In later experiments, VSMCs were isolated from Miro1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and had been transduced with adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 for 2 weeks (referred to as MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs). VSMCs from littermate controls were subjected to the same procedure with empty vector control adenovirus.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed under guidance from the University of Iowa Department of Biostatistics. Data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 10.0 software and expressed as mean Â± SEM. Normality and equal variance were assessed. Statistical comparisons between two groups were carried out using the unpaired t test when a normal distribution could be assumed. Otherwise, the Mann-Whiney U test was used. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukeyâs multiple comparisons was used for multiple group comparisons when a normal distribution could be assumed. Otherwise, the Kruskall-Wallis test with Dunnâs multiple comparisons was used. Two-way ANOVA followed by Å idÃ¡k multiple comparisons was used for grouped data sets. A <italic>P</italic>-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant, and p-values are indicated in the figures.</p>

<title>Loss of MIRO1 blocks neointima formation</title>
<p>To study the effects of MIRO1 on smooth muscle cell biology after vascular injury, we generated a transgenic model in which MIRO1 is selectively deleted in smooth muscle cells after administration of tamoxifen (SM-MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup>). Reduced levels of MIRO1 mRNA and protein in carotid arteries and the aorta were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and quantitative real time PCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1A, B</xref>). Mice of both the wild type and SM-MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> genotypes were fed a high-fat diet for three weeks, and then vascular injury was induced by ligation of the common carotid artery. Three weeks after ligation, the mice were euthanized and neointima size was assessed. Neointima formation was robust in wild type mice and significantly reduced in SM-MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The neointimal and medial areas were smaller in the arteries from the SM-MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> mice than in those of their wild type counterparts. Moreover, the neointimal area was decreased at 250 Î¼m from the ligation site and the cumulative neointimal area over the first one mm of the carotid artery proximal to the ligation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-F</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis in mouse carotid arteries after ligation revealed robust expression of MIRO1 in VSMCs of the neointima (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Lastly, we confirmed that MIRO1 is present in human coronary arteries. In a subject without a medical history of coronary disease, MIRO1 was present in the media. In human subjects with atherosclerotic disease, MIRO1 was expressed in both the media and the neointima, in cells also positive for smooth-muscle actin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2</xref>). Moreover, in the atherosclerotic plaque, we detected the colocalization of MIRO1 with the proliferation marker Ki67. In some cells, both colocalized with smooth-muscle actin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Loss of MIRO1 reduces the proliferation of smooth muscle cells</title>
<p>To determine the relevance of MIRO1 to cell proliferation, VSMCs were explanted from the aortas of SM-MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> mice and cultured. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was used to enhance cell proliferation. The cell number was assessed 3 days after plating. In the case of wild type cells, the number was approximately 80% greater for those treated with PDGF than for those not treated with PDGF. In the case of SM-MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs, cell counts were lower in both the PDGF-treated and non-treated cells, particularly in the former (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4A</xref>). Given the generally poor proliferation of VSMCs from SM-MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, in later experiments we used VSMCs isolated from MIRO1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and infected them with adenovirus expressing cre (Ad Cre; these cells are henceforth denoted as Miro1<sup>-/-</sup>). As negative controls, we used cells isolated from the same mice infected with an empty vector control adenovirus (Ad EV). In this model, cre recombination was efficient (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4B-D</xref>). At 72 hr after plating in growth medium, the number of Miro1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs was significantly lower than that of wild type cells, both when the cells were grown under the same conditions and when they were additionally treated with PDGF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Cells were synchronized by serum starvation for 48 hr and FACS analysis was performed to identify the phase of the cell cycle during which the growth delay caused by a lack of MIRO1 occurred (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S5</xref>). At baseline (0 hr), no differences in the cell cycle distribution were observed across the experimental groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). At both 24 h and 48 h, significant differences in percentage of cells in G1 and S phase were present. At 24 h, however, significantly more wild type than MIRO<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs had exited the G1 phase. At 48 h, the percentage of wildtype cells in G1 was more than 80%, similar to the percentage at 0h, suggesting that the cell cycle was completed. In contrast, at 48 h, more MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs remained in S phase and fewer were in G1 phase than at 0h, indicating a delay in cell cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

<title>MIRO1âs EF hands are required for mitochondrial mobility and cell proliferation</title>
<p>Next, we also tested the extent to which the reconstitution of MIRO1 in MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs rescued cell proliferation. Expressing wildtype MIRO1 at levels similar to those in wild type cells normalized proliferation, whereas expressing a MIRO1 mutant lacking the EF hands at same levels only partially rescued cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>). These data demonstrate that MIRO1 is required for cell proliferation, that it affects early cell cycle progression during G1/S-phase, and that the EF hands of MIRO1 are necessary for normal cell proliferation. The EF hands of MIRO1 mediate the attachment to microtubules in neurons and without them, mitochondria do not move normally within axons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. To determine the extent to which MIRO1 contributes to mitochondrial mobility in VSMCs, we plated wild type or MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs on microchips (CYTOOchip<sup>TM</sup>) with Y-patterns. In wild type VSMCs, after cell cycle arrest caused by serum starvation, the mitochondria were concentrated around the nucleus. At 6 hr after treatment in growth media supplemented with PDGF, the mitochondria were distributed throughout the cell, including near the cell edges (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref>). In the MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs, however, the mitochondria remained near the nucleus. Reconstitution of MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs with wild type MIRO1 fully rescued the mitochondrial distribution at 6 hr after PDGF treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-J</xref>). In contrast, after transduction of MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs with the MIRO1 mutant KK (MIRO1-KK), which lacks functional EF hands, the mitochondria were irregularly and unequally distributed. These data demonstrate that MIRO1 is required for both cell proliferation and coordinated mitochondrial mobility within the cell. In the absence of EF hands, proliferation and mobility is partially recovered, suggesting that MIRO1 supports proliferation through a mechanism beyond control of mobility.</p>

<p>Next, we sought to further elucidate the relationship of ATP production, mitochondrial mobility and VSMC proliferation. First, we determined whether mitochondrial ATP production is necessary for mitochondrial mobility or VSMC proliferation. For this purpose, we added oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP synthesis, to proliferating wild type VSMCs for 72 hr. This treatment reduced the number of VSMCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) as well as in the intracellular ATP level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). To test the effect of ATP production by mitochondria on their mobility, we assessed the mitochondrial distribution in wild type VSMCs plated on micropatterned CYTOOchips. Mitochondrial mobility was reduced when ATP production was inhibited by oligomycin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref>). Then, to investigate whether blocking mitochondrial mobility affects intracellular ATP levels, we performed control experiments with Nocodazole, which inhibits microtubule assembly. This treatment effectively arrested mitochondrial mobility, but ATP levels were not affected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, G</xref>).. These findings support that mitochondrial respiration is required for VSMC proliferation as well as mitochondrial mobility along microtubules and that MIRO1 controls both. In contrast, mitochondrial mobility is not required for optimal ATP production.</p>

<title>Loss of MIRO1 leads to impaired metabolic activity and reduced proliferative capacity</title>
<p>Our findings that mitochondrial mobility is controlled by MIRO1 and depends on mitochondrial ATP production imply that Miro1 deletion causes a defect in metabolic activity. Given cell proliferation is impaired at the early stages of the cell cycle in VSMCs with MIRO1 deletion and that intracellular ATP demands are high during the G1/S transition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, we measured intracellular ATP levels in cells after 16 hr of PDGF treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). ATP levels were significantly lower in MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs than in their wild type counterparts. Additionally, transduction with MIRO1-WT normalized ATP production, whereas transduction with MIRO1-KK did not (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). AMP kinase is an intracellular indicator of the metabolic state and regulates the expression of cyclins D and E. Thus, we determined AMP kinase activation by immunoblotting. In MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs, the phosphorylation of AMP kinase was elevated, indicating an intracellular energy deficiency (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-E</xref>). AMP kinase suppresses cell cycle progression through phosphorylation and stabilization of p53 and subsequent induction of the p21, which leads to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. In MIRO1-/- VSMCs, the p53 and p21 levels increased and cyclin D1 decreased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-H</xref>), supporting that MIRO1 is required for energy production and cell-cycle progression in the G1/S phase. We also measured the oxygen consumption rate in wildtype and Miro1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs by Seahorse. We detected decreased basal respiration in MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs treated with PDGF compared to wild type (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I, J</xref>). However, the rate of extracellular acidification, a measure of glycolysis, was not significantly affected in MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>), indicating a lack of compensatory upregulation of glycolysis.</p>

<title>MIRO1 controls electron transport chain (ETC) activity</title>
<p>We sought to establish the mechanism by which MIRO1 controls ATP production. Previous findings in embryonic fibroblasts have suggested that MIRO1 associates with both the mitochondrial contact site (MICOS) complex and the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex, which collectively control the folding of mitochondrial cristae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, we recently reported that MIRO1 regulates the formation of mitochondria-ER contact sides (MERCS) during the cell cycle and facilitates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to mitochondria. We assessed the effect of MIRO1 deletion on the formation of mitochondrial cristae in VSMCs by transmission electron microscopy. Consistent with findings in fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, we found that in Miro1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs, the cristae were less dense than those in wild type controls, and their morphology was distorted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-C</xref>). Next, we established the associations of wild type MIRO1, MIRO1-KK, and a MIRO1 mutant lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domain with components of the electron transport chain and the MIB/MICOS complex. Pull-down experiments in HEK 293T cells revealed interactions between MIRO1 and several MIB/MICOS proteins (Sam50, Mic60, and Mic19; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-G</xref>) and NDUFA9 subunits of electron transport chain complex I (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). The transmembrane domain by which MIRO1 is attached to mitochondria was necessary for the association with all proteins, and in the absence of the EF hands the association with all proteins was weaker.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study uncovers the crucial role of the outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase, MIRO1, in driving VSMC proliferation and neointima formation. The findings highlight that mitochondrial mobility, regulated by MIRO1, is essential not only for cell migration, as previously established <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, but also for smooth muscle cell proliferation. Contrary to the belief that mitochondrial mobility is mainly required to align mitochondria before mitosis, the study demonstrates that proliferation is hindered in the early cell cycle stages, particularly during the ATP-demanding G1 to S phase transition. The research shows that MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> cells have reduced ATP levels, emphasizing the importance of MIRO1-mediated ATP production. Based on our recent report <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, we posit that mitochondrial mobility facilitates the formation of MERCS, which support enhanced calcium transfer during the G1 to S phase, ultimately boosting ATP production. Furthermore, MIRO1 forms associations with the MIB/MICOS complex, the microtubule motor machinery, and the ETC subunit Nduf9, suggesting a dual role in supporting both mitochondrial ATP production and mobility. This insight into the interplay between mitochondrial dynamics and cellular energy metabolism offers advancements in understanding mitochondrial function in proliferation mechanisms.</p>
<p>Firstly, we discovered that neointima formation is abolished in a mouse model with VSMC-specific MIRO1 deletion, and that cell proliferation in cultured aortic VSMCs lacking MIRO1 is significantly reduced due to delays in the early phases of the cell cycle. Unlike previous research primarily focusing on the role of MIRO1 in neurons and embryonic fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, our findings extend its importance to primary proliferating VSMCs, revealing its critical involvement in VSMC proliferation and neointima formation. We are the first to demonstrate that MIRO1 deletion in VSMCs results in abolished neointima formation in a mouse model, highlighting MIRO1 as a potential new therapeutic target for treating vasoproliferative diseases. In immortalized cells lacking MIRO1 and 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, impaired cytokinesis with asymmetric partitioning of mitochondria to daughter cells was reported in M-phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In addition to reduced progression in the G2/M phase in MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs, we found strong evidence for impairments in the early phases of the cell cycle.</p>
<p>Secondly, the loss of MIRO1 reduced intracellular ATP levels and abolished mitochondrial mobility. Moreover, inhibiting mitochondrial respiration blocked their mobility, whereas halting mobility by microtubule disassembly did not affect ATP levels. MIRO1 not only controls mobility, but also supercomplex formation and ETC activity. Thus, we provide evidence on the relationship that mitochondrial energy production is required for mitochondrial mobility. Whether reduced ATP production negatively impacts mitochondrial mobility because of impaired activity of the C-terminal GTPase domain of MIRO1 as recently described or impaired actin polymerization will require further investigation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>VSMCs are believed to mostly rely on glycolysis to fuel their proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. However, recent studies have provided evidence that, analogous to proliferating cancer cells, VSMCs also depend on glutaminolysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, which shuttles metabolites to the TCA cycle and promotes oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings indicate that VSMCs require mitochondrial ATP since ATP synthase inhibition blocked mitochondrial mobility and VSMC proliferation. In our study, halting mitochondrial mobility by microtubule disassembly did not decrease overall intracellular ATP levels in VSMCs. These data further support that mitochondrial mobility controlled by MIRO1 enables subcellular mitochondrial positioning within VSMCs, which then supports localized subcellular ATP and ROS production. MIRO1 ensures that mitochondrial metabolites exert their effects on local targets, similar to findings in embryonic fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we found that the reconstitution of MIRO1<sup>-/-</sup> VSMCs with MIRO1-WT normalized cell proliferation, ATP levels, and mobility, whereas the reconstitution of MIRO1-KK, which lacks EF hands, resulted in only partial recovery. These results suggest that the EF hands of MIRO1 are important for its full functionality in VSMCs. In neurons, MIRO1 regulates the anterograde transport of mitochondria along microtubules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Mitochondrial arrest in response to elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> in subcellular domains and synaptic activity is driven by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing EF hands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Here, we provide evidence that without Ca<sup>2+</sup>-controlled mitochondrial arrest through point mutations of the EF hands, VSMC proliferation is reduced. We speculate that the loss of functional EF hands impairs alignment of mitochondria and ER. In a recent study, we demonstrated that MIRO1 deficiency disrupts MERCS formation and mitochondrial calcium uptake during the cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Fourthly, MIRO1 loss caused an intracellular energy deficit, increased AMP kinase phosphorylation, and reduced the expression of proteins promoting the G1/S cell-cycle transition. This finding suggests a mechanism where MIRO1 influences cell proliferation through its impact on cellular energy status and cell cycle regulatory proteins. Indeed, a link between AMP kinase activation and upregulation of p53 and G1/S cell cycle arrest has been described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Here, our data provide an explanation for how low ATP levels caused by MIRO1 deletion block cell cycle progression at this cell cycle stage.</p>
<p>Fifth, we observed that MIRO1 loss impaired the formation of mitochondrial cristae as observed in embryonic fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In our model of VSMCs with MIRO1 deletion, this correlated with reduced formation of ETC supercomplexes and activity of ETC complex I. In agreement with a prior study, MIRO1 associated with MIC19, MIC60 and SAM50 and the expression of MICOS/MIB proteins were not impaired with MIRO1 deletion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In addition, we detected a previously unrecognized association between NDUFA9, a subunit of ETC complex I, and decreased ETC complex I activity. These findings provide a potential mechanism by which MIRO1 controls mitochondrial ATP production, in addition to putative decreasing metabolite transfer at distorted mitochondrial ER contact sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Some findings of our study agree with published data on MIRO1, which have highlighted its role in mitochondrial dynamics, energy production, and cell signaling. Previous studies have shown that MIRO1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial transport and positioning, which are critical for metabolic signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. The observed effects of MIRO1 loss on ATP production and mitochondrial structure in our study align with reports indicating that MIRO1 dysfunction can lead to impaired mitochondrial respiration and energy deficits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Additionally, the role of MIRO1 in cell proliferation is supported by the literature demonstrating its involvement in mitotic spindle formation at later stages of the cell cycle and most recently, also in G1/S phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite these compelling findings, our study has limitations. One limitation is the use of a mouse model, which, while informative, may not fully replicate human VSMC behavior. We selected the complete ligation model for this study due to its high reproducibility and excellent surgical feasibility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, which allow for consistent outcomes across investigators. While it does not fully replicate some aspects of human balloon angioplasty with restenosis, such as endothelial denudation, it provides valuable insights into mechanisms of neointima formation. Additionally, our experiments focused primarily on cultured aortic VSMCs, which may not entirely represent the in vivo environment. Future studies should include a broader range of VSMC models and in vivo validations to confirm these mechanisms. Moreover, MIRO1 shares 60% sequence identity with its paralog MIRO2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Both are ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes, yet they are not functionally redundant <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. In VSMCs with MIRO1 deletion, we did not detect a compensatory upregulation of MIRO2. The functions of MIRO2 in the vasculature are currently unknown. However, a previous study proposed that after trans-aortic banding, the expression of MIRO2 in cardiac myocytes improved mitochondrial function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that MIRO1 is a pivotal regulator of VSMC proliferation and neointima formation. Our study revealed the specific mechanisms by which MIRO1 regulates ATP production and mitochondrial mobility, linking these processes to cell cycle progression and energy homeostasis. This connection between mitochondrial dynamics and cell proliferation is a significant advancement in understanding how mitochondrial dysfunction can contribute to vascular disease. The findings suggest that targeting MIRO1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating vasoproliferative diseases, such as neointima formation. Further research is needed to fully understand the downstream effects of MIRO1 loss and to explore the potential clinical applications of these insights.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors investigate the effects of Miro1 on VSMC biology after injury. Using conditional knockout animals, they provide the important observation that Miro1 is required for neointima formation. They also confirm that Miro1 is expressed in human coronary arteries. Specifically, in conditions of coronary diseases, it is localized in both media and neointima, and, in atherosclerotic plaque, Miro1 is expressed in proliferating cells.</p>
<p>However, the role of Miro1 in VSMC in CV diseases is poorly studied, and the data available are limited; therefore, the authors decided to deepen this aspect. The evidence that Miro-/- VSMCs show impaired proliferation and an arrest in S phase is solid and further sustained by restoring Miro1 to control levels, normalizing proliferation. Miro1 also affects mitochondrial distribution, which is strikingly changed after Miro1 deletion. Both effects are associated with impaired energy metabolism due to the ability of Miro1 to participate in MICOS/MIB complex assembly, influencing mitochondrial cristae folding. Interestingly, the authors also show the interaction of Miro1 with NDUFA9, globally affecting super complex 2 assembly and complex I activity.</p>
<p>Finally, these important findings also apply to human cells and can be partially replicated using a pharmacological approach, proposing Miro1 as a target for vasoproliferative diseases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The discovery of Miro1 relevance in neointima information is compelling, as well as the evidence in VSMC that MIRO1 loss impairs mitochondrial cristae formation, expanding observations previously obtained in embryonic fibroblasts.</p>
<p>The identification of MIRO1 interaction with NDUFA9 is novel and adds value to this paper. Similarly, the findings that VSMC proliferation requires mitochondrial ATP support the new idea that these cells do not rely mostly on glycolysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 3:</p>
<p>I appreciate the system used to assess mitochondrial distribution; however, I believe that time-lapse microscopy to evaluate mitochondrial movements in real time should be mandatory. The experimental timing is compatible with time-lapse imaging, and these experiments will provide a quantitative estimation of the distance travelled by mitochondria and the fraction of mitochondria that change position over time. I also suggest evaluating mitochondrial shape in control and MIRO1-/- VSMC to assess whether MIRO1 absence could impact mitochondrial morphology, altering fission/fusion machinery, since mitochondrial shape could differently influence the mobility.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 6:</p>
<p>The evidence of MIRO1 ablation on cristae remodeling is solid; however, considering that the mechanism proposed to explain the finding is the modulation of MICOS/MIB complex, as shown in Figure 6D, I suggest performing EM analysis in each condition. In my mind, Miro1 KK and Miro1 TM should lead to different cristae phenotypes according to the different impact on MICOS/MIB complex assembly. Especially, Miro1 TM should mimic Miro1 -/- condition, while Miro1 KK should drive a less severe phenotype. This would supply a good correlation between Miro1, MICOS/MIB complex formation and cristae folding.</p>
<p>I also suggest performing supercomplex assembly and complex I activity with each plasmid to correlate MICOS/MIB complex assembly with the respiratory chain efficiency.</p>
<p>(3) I noticed that none of the in vitro findings have been validated in an in vivo model. I believe this represents a significant gap that would be valuable to address. In your animal model, it should not be too complex to analyze mitochondria by electron microscopy to assess cristae morphology. Additionally, supercomplex assembly and complex I activity could be evaluated in tissue homogenates to corroborate the in vitro observations.</p>
<p>(4) I find the results presented in Figure S7 somewhat unclear. The authors employ a pharmacological strategy to reduce Miro1 and validate the findings previously obtained with the genetic knockout model. They report increased mitophagy and a reduction in mitochondrial mass. However, in my opinion, these changes alone could significantly impact cellular metabolism. A lower number of mitochondria would naturally result in decreased ATP production and reduced mitochondrial respiration. This, in turn, weakens the proposed direct link between Miro1 deletion and impaired metabolic function or altered electron transport chain (ETC) activity. I believe this section would benefit from additional experiments and a more in-depth discussion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study identifies the outerâmitochondrial GTPase MIRO1 as a central regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and neointima formation after carotid injury in vivo and PDGF-stimulation ex vivo. Using smooth muscle-specific knockout male mice, complementary in vitro murine and human VSMC cell models, and analyses of mitochondrial positioning, cristae architecture, and respirometry, the authors provide solid evidence that MIRO1 couples mitochondrial motility with ATP production to meet the energetic demands of the G1/S cell cycle transition. However, a component of the metabolic analyses is suboptimal and would benefit from more robust methodologies. The work is valuable because it links mitochondrial dynamics to vascular remodelling and suggests MIRO1 as a therapeutic target for vasoproliferative diseases, although whether pharmacological targeting of MIRO1 in vivo can effectively reduce neointima after carotid injury has not been explored. This paper will be of interest to those working on VSMCs and mitochondrial biology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of the study lies in its comprehensive approach, assessing the role of MIRO1 in VSMC proliferation in vivo, ex vivo, and importantly in human cells. The subject provides mechanistic links between MIRO1-mediated regulation of mitochondrial mobility and optimal respiratory chain function to cell cycle progression and proliferation. Finally, the findings are potentially clinically relevant given the presence of MIRO1 in human atherosclerotic plaques and the available small molecule MIRO1.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There is a consistent lack of reporting across figure legends, including group sizes, n numbers, how many independent experiments were performed, or whether the data is mean +/- SD or SEM, etc. This needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>(2) The in vivo carotid injury experiments are in male mice fed a high-fat diet; this should be explicitly stated in the abstract, as it's unclear if there are any sex- or diet-dependent differences. Is VSMC proliferation/neointima formation different in chow-fed mice after carotid injury?</p>
<p>(3) The main body of the methods section is thin, and it's unclear why the majority of the methods are in the supplemental file. The authors should consider moving these to the main article, especially in an online-only journal.</p>
<p>(4) Certain metabolic analyses are suboptimal, including ATP concentration and Complex I activity measurements. The measurement of ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP ratios for energy charge status (luminometer or mass spectrometry), while high-resolution respirometry (Oroboros) to determine mitochondrial complex I activity in permeabilized VSMCs would be more informative.</p>
<p>(5) The statement that 'mitochondrial mobility is not required for optimal ATP production' is poorly supported. XF Seahorse analysis should be performed with nocodazole and also following MIRO1 reconstitution +/- EF hands.</p>
<p>(6) The authors should consider moving MIRO1 small molecule data into the main figures. A lot of value would be added to the study if the authors could demonstrate that therapeutic targeting of MIRO1 could prevent neointima formation in vivo.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study addresses the role of MIRO1 in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, proposing a link between MIRO1 loss and altered growth due to disrupted mitochondrial dynamics and function. While the findings are potentially useful for understanding the importance of mitochondrial positioning and function in this specific cell type within health and disease contexts, the evidence presented appears incomplete, with key bioenergetic and mechanistic claims lacking adequate support.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study focuses on an important regulatory protein, MIRO1, and its role in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, a relatively underexplored context.</p>
<p>(2) It explores the link between smooth muscle cell growth, mitochondrial dynamics, and bioenergetics, which is a potentially significant area for both basic and translational biology.</p>
<p>(3) The use of both in vivo and in vitro systems provides a potentially useful experimental framework to interrogate MIRO1 function in this context.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The central claim that MIRO1 loss impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics is not convincingly demonstrated, with only modest changes in respiratory parameters and no direct evidence of functional respiratory chain deficiency.</p>
<p>(2) The proposed link between MIRO1 and respiratory supercomplex assembly or function is speculative, lacking mechanistic detail and supported by incomplete or inconsistent biochemical data.</p>
<p>(3) Key mitochondrial assays are either insufficiently controlled or poorly interpreted, undermining the strength of the conclusions regarding oxidative phosphorylation.</p>
<p>(4) The study does not adequately assess mitochondrial content or biogenesis, which could confound interpretations of changes in respiratory activity.</p>
<p>(5) Overall, the evidence for a direct impact of MIRO1 on mitochondrial respiratory function in the experimental setting is weak, and the conclusions overreach the data.</p>
