<abstract>
<p>A fundamental challenge in the optogenetic toolbox is that all opsins, regardless of their excitation spectra, are activated by blue light. We hypothesized that pairing a red-shifted channelrhodopsin with a blue light-sensitive anion channel of appropriately matching kinetics shall render neurons responsive to a red but not blue light. To achieve this, we used a semi-rational mutagenesis strategy to optimize the kinetics and light spectrum of a chloride channelrhodopsin. By pairing optimized variants of blue light-sensitive anion channel ZipACR with vfChrimson, a fast red-shifted channelrhodopsin, we created a system in which red light derives precise and faithful action potentials of high frequencies, while blue light, through shunting inhibition, nullifies the effect of the red-shifted ChR2. Additionally, by a simple switch between red and blue lights, one can effectively excite or inhibit the activity of the same neurons.</p>

<p>Despite the short history of optogenetics, optical manipulation of neuronal activity has become an indispensable tool in the studies for functional analysis of brain circuits. The increasing needs for a more precise temporal and spatial manipulation of the neurons along with the untapped potentials of optogenetics have been driving forces in expanding the repertoire of optogenetics toolbox. Main development among these expansions is the discovery of opsins of diverse excitation spectra, with the current excitatory opsins showing light sensitivity ranging from near UV to near far-red spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Yizhar <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Deisseroth and Hegemann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Marshel <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). The main purpose for such developments is to independently as well as collectively control the activity of distinct populations of neurons. This aim, however, has not been satisfied, mainly because all opsins, in addition to their own excitation spectral peak, are activated by blue light, a problem known in the field as cross-over or bleed-through. Attempts to create blue light-insensitive opsins will be most likely unsuccessful due to the intrinsic blue absorption by the retinal molecule, the non-encoded chromophore, which captures light energy in channelrhodopsins (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Waddell <italic>et al</italic>., 1973</xref>; <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>There have been two stand out attempts to overcome the problem of cross-over. One uses a variant of blue-shifted ChR2 with fast kinetics in combination with a slow kinetics red-shifted ChR2 (R-ChR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Klapoetke <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). The reasoning is that short pulses of blue light will activate only fast ChR2. Since it requires a tight regulation of the protein expression as well as the light intensity, this method has not been adopted for in-vivo application. Another approach is to expose axons expressing a R-ChR to prolonged photostimulation. Immediately following this, axons become unresponsive to light pulses and cease to fire. This method is limited to axonal regions as prolonged optical stimulation of the soma induces trains of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Hooks <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>A potential solution to the problem of cross-over, the one that we propose here, is to co-express a blue-shifted anion channelrhodopsin (B-ACR) along with the R-ChR to ‘suppress’ its excitation by blue light. For this purpose, we chose vfChrimson-currently the fastest R-ChR-to gain more precise temporal control of red light excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Mager <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). This would, however, require a new variant of anion channelrhodopsin to optimize pairing. We used a semi-rational mutagenesis approach to modify the kinetic properties of ZipACR, an ultrafast blue light-activated chloride channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Govorunova <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). We describe here two variants of ZipACR, I151T and I151V, with appropriate kinetics, light spectra, and photocurrent. We then paired the optimized anion channels with vfChrimson in a single expression unit. The new system, Zip-IvfChr, can drive time-locked high-frequency action potentials (APs) in response to red pulses (635 nm). In response to blue pulses (470 nm), on the other hand, Zip-IvfChr provides selective suppression of individual APs within trains of high frequency firing with high precision.</p>

<title>The strategy to reduce blue light-mediated excitation by red-shifted channelrhodopsins</title>
<p>The channelrhodopsin Chrimson and its variants have the most red-shifted spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Klapoetke <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), and their response to 470 nm has a slower on-rate compared to the 590 nm light (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1A-B</xref>). Despite this, 470 nm light is equally effective in inducing APs (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref>). To overcome this limitation, we decided to take advantage of blue light-gated inhibitory chloride channels which effectively block action potential upon exposure to blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Govorunova <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Govorunova <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). By co-expressing a B-ACR along with a Chrimson variant, photostimulation of targeted neurons by red light only activates R-ChR, which causes photoactivation of these neurons. Blue light, however, activates R-ChR as well as B-ACR. This allows the chloride channel to induce shunting inhibition of the neurons which in turn prevents firing of the neurons by blue light (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Validation of the co-expression strategy in Drosophila</title>
<p>As the first step for validating this approach, we took advantage of the well-studied male-specific P1 neurons in the fly central brain that elicit courtship singing upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">von Philipsborn <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Inagaki <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ellendersen and von Philipsborn 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Mohammad <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B1-B2</xref>). When Chrimson was co-expressed with an inactive control protein (tdTomato), illumination at 470 nm and 590 nm wavelengths led to similar amounts of courtship song (respectively 110.1 ± 12.8 and 78.5 ± 11.6, n = 16-17), demonstrating that blue light at the chosen intensity was efficiently activating Chrimson (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). When Chrimson was co-expressed with the blue-sensitive anion channelrhodopsin GtACR2, 590 nm light illumination reliably elicited male courtship song (95.2 ± 9.14), however, 470 nm light illumination did not evoke any detectable pulse song (n = 17-18). Neither 590 nm nor 470 nm light pulses induced courtship song in flies expressing only GtACR2 (n = 5).</p>

<p>Although GtACR2 proved to be effective in protocols with pulses of long duration, its slow current decay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, see GtACR2, 161 ± 24 ms, n = 3) limits its application to optical stimulations of lower frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Govorunova <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Govorunova <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>).

<p>For a fast R-ChR, we evaluated the recently published vfChrimson, the fastest red-shifted channelrhodopsin available at this time, which can induce APs up to the intrinsic limit of the neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Mager <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Previously, we found that Chrimson and its variants traffic poorly to the membrane and developed a strategy to improve the trafficking (C-Chrimson-ts, Buonaventura <italic>et al</italic>., 2019). We adapted this modification to improve the trafficking of vfChrimson (referred as IvfChrimson). In our measurements in HEK293 cells, IvfChrimson has a channel off-rate consistent with previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Mager <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) (off-rate time constant of 5.6 ± 0.3 ms, n = 10 compared to C-Chrimson-ts 21.5 ± 1.2, n = 10; mean ± SEM, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). When comparing C-Chrimson-ts and IvfChrimson photocurrents, we observe 1.68 fold reduction of normalized photocurrent of IvfChrimson (0.086 ± 0.055 pA/pF/A.U, n = 25) compared to C-Chrimson-ts (0.145 ± 0.126 pA/pF/A.U., n = 25; mean ± SD, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>) when the peak photocurrent amplitude was adjusted to membrane capacitance and membrane fluorescence.</p>
<p>To counteract the IvfChrimson excitation, we estimated that desired properties of the blue light activated anion ChR should have the off-rate time constant of ∼15-30 ms, minimal response to light of wavelength &gt; 590 nm and a strong photocurrent. We identified ZipACR, RsACR_995, GcACR_457, RlACR_477 and GtACR2 as possible templates for further development based on published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Govorunova <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). GtACR2, RsACR_995 and RIACR_477 are spectrally ideal with negligible response to 590 nm light (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>), but their kinetics are slow (mean off-rate of 161.0 ± 24.1, 122.7 ± 36.3 and 95.8 ± 49.4 ms, respectively, n = 3, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) which could have undesired long lasting inhibitory effects after light termination. GcACR_457 has very small photocurrents and cannot be characterized accurately, possibly due to poor membrane trafficking. ZipACR, although spectrally not ideal (∼515 nm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Govorunova <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) has a kinetic close to the desired range (9.5 ± 3.0 ms, n = 9) and it has strong photocurrents (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the inhibitory property of ZipACR, we injected 40 Hz somatic current in organotypic hippocampal neurons expressing the channel. Consistent with the original report, individual pulses of 470 nm light resulted in the time-locked suppression of APs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Next we examined whether ZipACR can block blue light-mediated APs in neurons expressing vfChrimson. Recordings from the granule cells in acute hippocampal slices co-expressing ZipACR and vfChrimson showed that, compared with 635 nm light, 470 nm light induced significantly fewer APs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>), in line with our prediction. However, we consistently observed the appearance of individual APs time-locked to the blue light offset (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C1-C2</xref>). We concluded that due to the fast closing rate, the photoinhibitory current generated by ZipACR decays too early to suppress the remaining excitatory response of vfChrimson. Therefore, we decided to generate variants of ZipACR with slightly slower off-kinetics.</p>

<p>It is technically easier to generate mutations with slower kinetics and blue-shifted spectra than generating variants with faster on-and off-kinetics. Thus, we decided to use ZipACR as a template for further mutagenesis instead of further modifying GtACR2. To identify relevant mutation sites in ZipACR, we generated a homology model of ZipACR with the crystal structure of GtACR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Govorunova <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) and identified the putative residues forming the retinal binding pocket in ZipACR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Multiple alignments were performed with the kinetically slower GtACR1 and GtACR2 to identify possible replacement of these residues that would result in slower kinetics and/or small blue-shift in ZipACR without disrupting the channel function (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A2</xref>). We tested these variants in HEK293 cells for photocurrent ratio 590 nm / 470 nm LED stimulating light and measured the channel off-rate kinetics and photocurrent amplitude (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Of these candidates, we identified I151V and I151T at the 4th transmem-brane domain of ZipACR that resulted in a small increase in channel off-rate time constant (15.5 ± 8.4 ms for I151V and 20.2 ± 6.4 ms for I151T, mean ± SD, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) compared to the original ZipACR (9.5 ± 2.9 ms, mean ± SD). We also generated double and triple mutants combining the I151V or I151T with Y170F, Y177F or V229L mutations but most of these double or triple mutants appeared to have smaller photocurrents and off-rate kinetics that could not be fitted well with single exponential back to zero baseline. Based on these results, we concluded the variants I151V (Zip(151V)) and I151T (Zip(151T)) are the best candidates for the pairing and proceeded for further characterizations.</p>
<p>Neither Zip(151V) nor Zip(151T) mutations changed the ion permeability of ZipACR as measured by channel reversal potential in potassium gluconate and cesium chloride based intracellular recording solutions (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3B-C</xref>). In terms of light sensitivity, it is desirable that the ZipACR variant would respond to 470 nm light faster and stronger and to red-shifted light slower and weaker than IvfChrimson at the same intensity (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). With both Zip(151V) and Zip(151T), the channel on-rate kinetics have the desirable properties as described above to 470 nm and 590 nm light, although the Zip(151T) on-rate starts to approach the on-rate of IvfChrimson at light intensities &gt;5 mW/mm2 at 590 nm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C1</xref>). With 470 nm light, IvfChrimson does not appear to reach saturating response even at 20 mW/mm2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C2</xref>). With 590 nm light, IvfChrimson reaches saturating response at 10 mW/ mm2 whereas none of the ZipACR variants appears to reach saturating response even at 20 mW/mm2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C2</xref>). Spectrally, Zip(151T) shows a wider red-shifted action spectra than ZipACR whereas Zip(151V) may have a slightly narrower blue-shifted action spectra than ZipACR (<xref rid="fig3a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Since Zip(151T) is a more red-shifted variant of the two (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B,D</xref>), we asked whether red light pulses may induce photoinhibitory currents that suppress APs. We expressed Zip(151T) in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus in hippocampal slices using AAV vector and tested its inhibitory effect upon 470 nm and 635 nm light pulses. We injected somatic current at 40 Hz, while alternately delivering overlapping 5 ms pulses of light. Except in two instances, blue light pulses were consistently effective in blocking APs, while red light had no effect on APs induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, n = 10 for 470 and n = 6 for 635, the two outliers are presented in <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). It has been reported that at resting or hyperpolarized membrane potentials ZipACR may produce light-evoked APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kato <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). We did not observe such a phenomenon under our experimental setup (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Validation of the co-expression strategy in brain slice</title>
<p>Since co-injection of two viruses results in variability in the ratio of expression in different neurons, we created constructs containing IvfChrimson and Zip(151T/V) (ZipT-IvfChr and ZipV-Ivf-Chr) using the bicistronic 2A sequence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). This ensures an equimolar expression of the two channels. We also introduced a soma targeting Kv2.1 sequence into the constructs while eliminating the endoplasmic reticulum-exporting sequence of Ivf-Chrimson construct. Based on the photocurrent amplitudes of the constructs in response to 590 nm light (at -40mV holding potential with potassium gluconate-based intracellular solution to minimize Zip(151V) variant responses), the photocurrent amplitudes of IvfChrimson-only and ZipV-IvfChr constructs are comparable after adjustment to cell size and membrane fluorescence in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). We did not test the ZipT-IvfChr variant as the red-shifted response of Zip(151T) is difficult to eliminate to 590 nm light.</p>

<p>As the first step to test the performance of the system, we examined the power at which 470 nm and 635 nm lights induce APs in ZipT-IvfChr and ZipV-IvfChr, as well as in vfChrimson expressing neurons. We expressed AAV constructs in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampal slices (as described in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E1</xref>). We recorded cells under the current-clamp mode and injected current through the patch pipette to maintain the membrane potentials at −60 mV. As expected, in vfChrimson expressing neurons 470 nm and 635 nm lights induced APs with light powers as low as 0,5mW/mm<sup>2</sup> (n = 10, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In contrast, ZipT-IvfChr expressing neurons produced APs only to 635 nm light stimulation, whereas 470 nm light powers as high as 10 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> failed to induce APs (n = 7-8). As for ZipV-IvfChr, we occasionally observed blue light-induced APs (n = 4-7, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), which may be explained by its relatively faster decay time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). In neurons expressing vfChrimson, we noticed a reduction in probability of AP upon successive optical stimulation specifically to 635 nm pulses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed a reduction in response in HEK293 cells expressing IvfChrimson (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7A,B</xref>). This phenomenon, likely caused by the desensitization of the channel, is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the efficiency of 635 nm and 470 nm lights in inducing high frequency APs, we delivered 10 Hz and 20 Hz light pulses of 5 ms duration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). As expected, in vfChrimson expressing neurons both 470 nm and 635 nm lights induced APs (n = 8-9). In neurons expressing either ZipT-IvfChr or ZipV-IvfChr, 635 nm pulses were equally effective in driving APs. On the other hand, 470 nm light only induced modest depolarization, which never reached the threshold for AP induction (n = 5-12 for each opsin) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C2</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the temporal precision of the system in blocking AP, we stimulated the neurons by somatic current injection at 40 Hz, while alternately delivering perfectly overlapping 5 ms pulses of lights. Light pulses of 470 nm were consistently effective in blocking APs, while 635 nm light pulses had virtually no effect on Aps induction as its amplitude, half-width and delayed time were in-distinguishable from APs induced in the absence of light pulse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Local mono-synaptic connection is a common feature in many brain regions. For this reason, independent dual optical activation requires that while optically stimulating pre-synaptic neurons, post-synaptic neurons remain responsive to the pre-synaptic inputs. To test whether our system meets this criterion, we asked how fast a neuron recovers from the inhibition induced by the ZipACR variants. We induced APs through somatic current injection at different time points from the offset of a light pulse. Blue light pulses blocked APs if the current was injected simultaneously. As expected from the off-rate of Zip(151T), within 5 ms from the light offset neurons expressing Zip(151T) or ZipT-IvfChr produced APs with high probability (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). The success rate reached its maximum within 10-15 ms. The recovery time for ZipV-IvfChr was immediate, with 100% success rate immediately following the light offset. This indicates that ZipV-Ivf-Chr could be used for dual optical activation without off target inhibition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main purpose of this work was to find a practical solution to the problem of cross-over where all opsins, regardless of their preferred excitation spectra, are activated by blue light. We describe a R-ChR2 expression system by which pulses of red light drive time-locked high frequency APs, while blue light remains ineffective. We created this system by pairing a B-ACR with the ultrafast red-shifted ChR2, IvfChrimson. This requires the B-ACR to have a significantly larger photocurrent compared to R-ChR2 as well as a faster channel opening and slightly slower channel closing. For this reason, we chose ZipACR as the template B-ACR for further modifications. Based on our homology modelling and multiple alignments with the kinetically slower B-ACRs, GtACR1 and GTACR2, we identified potential residue replacements within the putative retinal binding pocket which would result in slightly slower kinetics without impairing the channel function.</p>
<p>To our surprise, many mutations of ZipACR around all-trans retinal do not alter the channel properties or compromise channel conductance too strongly. This is contrary to our past experiences with channelrhodopsins where conductance is highly sensitive to mutations around the retinal binding pocket (data not shown). ZipACR double mutants appear to have more compromised conductance or altered properties. Among the tested positions, the I151 residue appears to have significant influences in kinetics and spectral properties. Indeed, we found that two variants, Zip(151T) and Zip(151V), sit in a sweet spot for our purpose. More specifically, the channels off-rate kinetics have the desirable property of being slightly but sufficiently slower than Ivf-Chrimson without compromising the opening rate, photocurrent and light spectrum. Thus, when paired with IvfChrimson, they prevent AP induction by blue light, without interfering with red light-induced high frequency neural spiking. On a similar note, although blue light pulses produced subthreshold depolarization, we did not observe charge integration that could have resulted in AP, even in frequencies as high as 20 Hz; this most likely reflects the reverse potential of the ZipACR. Of the two variants, we observed Zip(151T), and consequently ZipT-IvfChr, to be more consistent in blocking blue light-induced APs, which could be explained by its slightly slower closing rate. Although Zip(151T) is the more red-shifted of the two, within the tested range of light intensities and expression, only rarely did we observe a block of APs at 635 nm. However, we do not recommend the use of orange light pulses, as we observed a significant photocurrent in this wavelength.</p>
<p>Based on its impact on the kinetics and spectral properties, it will be of value to conduct saturating mutagenesis study on I151 residue that may produce variants of interesting properties or pairing that could outperform Zip(151V) and Zip(151T).</p>
<p>A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Vierock <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) proposed a R-ChR2 expression system by relying on the pairing between GtACR2 and Chrimson, as we did in our early stage work with <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For physiological as well as experimental reasons, the priority we set was to create a system with fast closing kinetics. As channelrhodopsins are known to conduct calcium ions, long opening lifetime can evoke significant elevation of intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>) and activate second messenger pathways with complicating biological effects in experiments of long duration. The same concern applies to B-ACRs with slow closing kinetics as they could have additional inhibitory effects after the termination of blue light and alter the physiology to be studied. From an experimental viewpoint, a fast photostimulation system has the flexibility to perform a wide range of optical manipulations. This includes driving neuronal activity to their firing limits as well as suppressing their firing with single spike precision. Al-though not tested here, our results indicate that the fast closing kinetics of the B-ACR channels, particularly ZipV-IvfChr, should allow dual optical activation of monosynaptically connected neurons.</p>
<p>Before concluding, we must note that our approach, which runs based on chloride influx is unlikely to be suitable for axonal terminal activation, where the chloride concentration is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Mahn <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Mahn <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). For this matter, we refer the readers to some published methods by which independent dual channel photostimulation of the axons might be feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Klapoetke <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Hook <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Thus, our system complements these studies as they are unsuitable for somatic photoactivation. This provides researchers with complementary methods to choose from based on their experimental needs.</p>

<p>For GcACR_457, RsACR_995 and RlACR_477, the cDNA were in the original pcDNA3.1 vector as EYFP fusion as available on Addgene (#103137, 103772, 103771). The GtACR2 construct was synthesized (IDT DNA) and modified with a N-terminal signalling peptide from the commercial pDisplay vector (Invitrogen) and a trafficking signal prior to tdTomato or citrine fusion and inserted in the pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen) for expression. For the ZipACR constructs, the original EYFP fusion from Addgene (#88844) was retained and the construct was either inserted into the pcDNA3.1+ vector or a second generation lentiviral vector pLenti with CMV promoter. No functional or fluorescent difference in the expressed protein were observed between expression from pcDNA3.1+ and pLenti vector in HEK293 cells and the results were combined for comparison and analysis.</p>
<p>Site-directed mutagenesis of the ZipACR, Chrimson and GtACR2 were performed with overlap extension PCR using Phusion DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies) and ligated into the pcDNA3.1+ or pLenti expression vector.</p>
<p>For ChrimsonR and vfChrimson, additional improvements for membrane trafficking was used as previously described (Buonaventura <italic>et al</italic>., 2019). In brief, N-terminal leading sequence from ChR1/oChIEF/ReaChR was transplanted to the transmembrane A-G of ChrimsonR and vfChrimson. Trafficking sequence was added after the transmembrane G before fusion to tdTomato. The modified ChrimsonR/vfChrimson-tdTomato constructs were inserted into the 2nd generation lentiviral pLenti vector with CMV promoter and used to make stable ChrimsonR/vfChrimson-td-Tomato HEK293 cell lines. The improved vf-Chrimson is named IvfChrimson.</p>

<p>Whole-cell patch-clamping was performed with Axopatch 200A patch-clamp amplifier with Digidata 1322A data acquisition board and pCLAMP10 software. Cells were clamped at -60mV except in experiments with the ramp protocol and experiments comparing the 590 nm light-induced photocurrents between Ivf-Chrimson-citrine and ZipV-IvfChr expressing cells. In the experiment comparing the IvfChrimson-citrine photocurrent to the 2A configuration, cells were clamped at -40mV to reduce the influence of ZipACR response with IvfChrimson photocurrent. Series resistance for the recorded cells were mostly under 15 MΩ and series resistance were compensated up to 70% during recordings where possible.</p>
<p>The extracellular solution was composed of (in mM): 145 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 20 D-glucose and 10 HEPES (pH 7.35). For most experiments, the intracellular solution contained (in mM): 110 CsCl, 15 TEACl, 10 HEPES, 5 Cs2EGTA, 1 MgCl2 and 0.1mM CaCl2 (pH 7.25). In experiments comparing the 590 nm light-induced photocurrents between IvfChrimson-citrine and ZipV-IvfChr expressing cells and some ramp experiments, a K-gluconate based intracellular solution containing: 115 K-gluconate, 10 K2EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 NaCl, 10 KCl, 2 MgATP and 0.1 Tris-GTP (pH 7.25), was used.</p>
<p>Channelrhodopsin-expressing cells were imaged and recorded on an Olympus IX73 microscope with a 40x air objective equipped with Photometrics Cascade II 512 EMCCD camera. Images were acquired using Micromanager 1.4 with no gain and no electron multiplication and exposure time of 250 ms. Excitation light was provided by a Thorlabs 4 channel LED (LED4D118 with 405, 470, 530 and 590 nm channels and only 470 nm and 530 nm light were used for imaging with LED driving currents of 150 and 80 mA, respectively). Citrine and EYFP expression were imaged with a GFP filter cube (Semrock, FF02-470/30 excitation, FF01-520/35 emission and FF495-Di03 dichroic) and tdTomato was imaged with a TRITC filter cube (Semrock, FF01-543/22 excitation, FF01-593/40 emission and FF562-Di03 dichroic).</p>
<p>For most channelrhodopsin stimulation experiments 10 mW/ mm2 of 470 nm and 590 nm stimulation lights from Thorlabs 4 channel LED light source (LED4D118) were delivered to the specimen plane. The light intensity was controlled with a Thorlabs DC4104 4 channel controller electronically by the separate analogue outputs of a HEKA ITC-18 DAQ board under the control of WinWCP 5.5 software. In the spectral response experiment, a Sutter VF-5 system with a smart shutter in the neutral density mode was used to achieve cross spectrum stimulation at the same photon flux at 1.586 x 1015 photons / s / mm2 (25.1 mW/mm2 at 400 nm and 15.4 mW/mm2 at 650 nm) between 400-650 nm (25 nm increments). The VF-5 has the following filters and bandwidth settings: 451-398 nm with 15 nm bandwidth, 503-446 nm with 15 nm bandwidth, 564-498 nm with 14 nm band-width, 632-557 nm with 14 nm bandwidth, 703-627 nm with 13 nm bandwidth. A second Sutter shutter was placed in the light path before the light guide to control the light output. For experiments with ACRs, a 15-sec interval was used between stimulation episodes. For ChrimsonR/IvfChrimson stimulation, stimulation light pulses either have 15-sec intervals between stimulation episodes (no preconditioning) or a 15-sec interval -1-sec 405 nm light pulse – 15-sec interval stimulation pattern for preconditioning before the subsequent stimulation. The stimulation light was guided into the fluorescent excitation light path of the Olympus IX73 microscope as with imaging but reflected with a Semrock FF685-DiO2 dichroic mirror to the objective.</p>
<p>Light intensity (in mW/mm2) was measured with a Thorlabs slide based light detector (S170C) at the specimen plane with illumination area defined by the microscope aperture and manually calculated for photon flux or illumination intensity.</p>
<p>For comparison of the membrane expression of our Ivf-Chrimson-citrine and ‘2A’, transfected cells were imaged on an Olympus BX51 microscope with a 40x Olympus water immersion objective, X-Cite 110LED and Hamamatsu Orca Flash4. The images were taken at 15% light intensity and 250ms exposure time with FF02-472/30 excitation filter, FF01-520/35 emission filter and FF495-Di03 dichroic mirror (Semrock, NY). A line profile was drawn across the cell and the membrane values were averaged and used for calculating the ratio with the mean cytosolic values.</p>

From that moment, all the steps were performed in a laminar flow tissue culture hood using sterile equipment and in total asepsie. The brain was poured into a petri dish filled with the low sodium ACSF solution for hippocampi dissection under microscope guidance (Stereomicroscope, Olympus x1 objective). After extraction, the hippocampi were sliced at 400um thickness using an automatic tissue chopper (McIL-WAIN) and moved to a dish with pre-heated culture medium containing MEM Eagle medium 78.8% (Gibco), 20% heat-inactivated horse serum (Gibco), 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM CaCl2, 2mM MgSO4, 170 nM insulin, 0.0012% ascorbic acid, 12.9 mM D-glucose, 5.2 mM NaHCO3, 300 mM HEPES (Sigma), pH = 7.2-7.3, osmolarity adjusted to 315–325. The slices with intact DG and CA regions were then transferred onto air-fluid interface-style Milli-cell culture inserts (Millipore) in 6-well culture plates (ThermoFisherScientific) with 800 uL of sterile medium added below each insert. The slices were kept in a sterile incubator at 37 degrees with 5% CO2 (ThermoScientific, Steri-cycle i-160). The medium was replaced by a pre-warmed medium (37 degrees) three times a week.</p>
<p>After two to three days of culture, the slices were microinjected in DG (or in CA1 when specified) along the characteristic horseshoe pattern with a pulled glass pipette containing the following viruses: retro-vfChrimson (titer: 7×10<sup>12</sup> particles/mL), retro-Zip(151T) (titer: 9×10<sup>12</sup> particles/mL), retro-ZipT-IvfChr (titer: 2×10<sup>12</sup> particles/mL), or retro-ZipV-IvfChr (titer: 1.5×10<sup>12</sup> particles/mL). The injections were done under a microscope (using a Picospitzer III (Parker) connected to a Pulse Pal (10 ms pulse, every 0.5-sec).</p>

<title>Whole-cell electrophysiology and light delivery in-vitro</title>
<p>Two to three weeks post-infection, the organotypic slices were transferred into the recording chamber and continuously perfused with Artificial Cerebrospinal Fluid containing (in mM): 119 NaCL, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4, supplemented with 11 D-glucose, 4 CaCl2, 4 MgCl2. Additionally, APV (50mM), NBQX (100mM) and picrotoxin (100mM) were added to block excitatory and inhibitory fast transmission. The solution was adjusted to pH 7.4 (osm ∼330) and bubbled with a mixture of CO2 (5%) and O2 (95%), at room temperature. The chamber was mounted on an upright microscope (Scientifica) linked to a digital camera (QImaging Exi Aqua) and the cells were visualized using 60X water-immersion objective (Olympus, LumiPlan). Acquisitions were performed in whole-cell configuration using Clampex 10.6 connected to a Multiclamp 700B amplifier via a Digidata 1550A digitizer (all from Molecular Devices). Voltage-clamp data were low-pass filtered at 200 Hz and digitized at 10 kHz and the whole-cell capacitance was compensated. Patch pipettes (2-4 MΩ of resistance) were filled with an internal solution containing (in mM): 153 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 4.5 NaCl, 9 KCl, 0.6 EGTA, 2 MgATP, and 0.3 NaGTP. The pH and osmolarity of the internal solution were close to physiological conditions (pH 7.4, osmolarity 297 mOsm). The access resistance of the cells in our sample was ∼ 25 MOhm. For voltage-clamp experiment, the Dentate Gyrus granule cells (otherwise specified when done in CA1 pyramidal cells) were clamped at -60mV. For current-clamp experiments, the cells were maintained at -60mV (except for the protocol where the potential was brought from -70 to -40mV) by constant current injection (holding current ± 100pA).</p>
<p>The recorded neurons were illuminated with 470 nm and 635 nm (nominal wavelengths) light with a coolLED pE-4000 system connected to the Digidata via a single TTL. The light irradiance was controlled via the control pod and was adjusted to 4mW/ mm2 for 470 nm and 7 mW/mm2 for 635 nm (otherwise specified). Light irradiance was measured with a Thorlabs digital optical power meter (PM100D) at the specimen plane with illumination area defined by the microscope aperture. Between the recordings, wavelengths were switched from 470 nm to 635 nm and vice versa. At the end of the recordings, the location of the recorded cell was confirmed by inspection at 10x magnification. Data analysis was performed using Clampfit 10.6 (Molecular device).</p>
<p>After recordings, slices were kept in 4% formalin, and later mounted under coverslips with Fluoromount (Sigma-Aldrich). Pictures were taken with an Apotome.2 (Zeiss) and ZEN software at 10X and 40X magnifications.</p>

<title>Acute slices</title>
<p>Experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Buenos Aires (CICUAL). Briefly, 4-week old C57 mice (n = 4) were co-injected with AAV-8/2-hSyn1-ChrimsonVF_EYFP_Kv2.1 and AAV-8/2-hSyn1-ZipACR_Kv2.1_IRES_DsRed2 within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (250nl of a 1:1 mixture, coordinates from Bregma: 1 mm mediolateral, -2 mm anteroposterior, -1.5 dorsoventral). After 3 weeks of expression, the animals were sacrificed and the brain removed and cut in a solution composed of (in mM): 234 sucrose, 11 glucose, 26 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 MgSO4, and 0.5 CaCl2 (equilibrated with 95% O2–5% CO2). The slices were maintained at room temperature before being transferred in a recording chamber mounted on a microscope (Nikon) connected to a Mightex Illumination system for 470 nm and 635 nm light delivery (at 10mW). For current clamp experiments the amount of current injected was corrected in the inter-sweep interval to keep it close to -60 mV. In voltage clamp experiments holding potential was -60 mV.</p>
<p>Recordings were done in a solution of composition (in mM): 126 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2 and 10 Glucose (pH 7.4).</p>
<p>Patch-pipettes (2-4 MΩ of resistance) were filled with a K-gluconate based internal solution (in mM, 130 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.6 EGTA, 2.5 MgCl2·6H2O, 10 Phosphocreatine, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.4 GTP-Na3).</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, the authors generate an AAV-deliverable tool that generates action potentials in response to red light, but not blue light, when expressed in neurons. To do this, they screen some red light-excitatory/blue light-inhibitory opsin pairs to find ones that are spectrally and temporally matched. They first show that this works with Chrimson and GtACR2, however, they expand their search after finding that the tau-off (inactivation after light cessation) kinetics of these two opsins are not well-matched. They directly examine a small set of options based on a literature search and settle on a variant of red light-excitatory Chrimson and blue light-inhibitory ZipACR. To more closely match the kinetics of this pair, the authors create a structure homology model of the ZipACR retinal binding pocket and use this to guide the generation of a small mutagenesis panel, leading to a more optimized ZipACR mutant. They then show that a bicistronically expressed fusion arrangement of these opsins, plus some functional peptides, can drive action potentials up to 20hz with red light and does not do so with blue light, in hippocampal cells transduced by AAV. They also show function in vivo, in a mouse, using a physiological readout. They conclude that their new tool may be useful for complex experimental designs requiring multiple optical channels for write-in/read-out.</p>
<p>The major advantage claimed by the authors over existing tools is the temporal time-locking of their inhibitory opsin - this is driven by the contrast between the tau-off kinetics of their ZipACR variant compared to gtACR2, which is used by the leading competitor tool (BiPOLES).</p>
<p>Big thoughts</p>
<p>
While the authors were carefully thoughtful about the potential influence of temporal kinetics on the efficiency of a tool such as this one, there were no experiments conducted that made use of the unique properties of this molecular strategy. To understand why they embarked on this engineering program, I was required to put on my neuroscientist hat and contemplate this question myself:</p>
<p>First, experimental designs where I require multiple optical channels of control. This appears to be aligned with the author's thoughts, as they state, correctly, that opsins utilizing retinal as a light-sensing chromophore are universally activated by blue light (the so-called 'blue shoulder'). Therefore, their tool may be useful for stimulating multiple populations using a blue excitatory opsin in neuron A and their tool for red excitation of neuron B - or, in the author's own words, &quot;A potential solution to the problem of cross-talk...&quot;. Yet, there are no data presented that showcases their new tool for this purpose (e.g. Vierock, Johannes, et al. &quot;BiPOLES is an optogenetic tool developed for bidirectional dual-color control of neurons.&quot; Nature Communications 12.1 (2021): 4527. Figure 4f-I; 6). The same set-up could be imagined for green GECI (or equivalent) imaging of cells in the same volume that their tool is being used in - for instance, interleaving red stimulation light and blue imaging light, (perhaps) without the typical concern of imaging light bleed-through activating the opsin itself.</p>
<p>Second, for high-frequency temporal control over both excitation and inhibition in the same neuron. The red light turns the cell on, and blue light turns the cell off (see, for instance, Zhang, Feng, et al. &quot;Multimodal fast optical interrogation of neural circuitry.&quot; Nature 446.7136 (2007): 633-639. Figure 2; Vierock as above, Figure 4a,b). Again, here the authors are long on theory (&quot;The new system...can drive time-locked high-frequency action potentials in response to red pulses&quot;) and short on data. While they do show that red light = excitation and blue light = inhibition, they neither show 1) all-optical on/off modulation of the same cell; nor 2) high-frequency inhibition or excitation (max stim rate of 20hz, which is the same as the BiPOLES paper used for their LC stimulation paradigm; Vierock, as above, Figure 7a-d).</p>
<p>Despite these major shortcomings, the further development and characterization of tandem opsins, such as this one, is of interest to the community. There is ongoing work by the BiPOLES team to create new iterations (e.g. Wahid, J., et al. &quot;P-15 BiPOLES2 is a bidirectional optogenetic tool with a narrow activation spectrum and low red-light excitability.&quot; Clinical Neurophysiology 148 (2023): e16.). To make the case that the tool described in this manuscript is worth the effort that the authors are requesting the neuroscience community invest in trialing it in their own hands, they must revise the manuscript to show that their approach is both 1) different in some way when compared to BiPOLES (it is my understanding that they did not do this, as per the supplementary alignment of the BiPOLES sequence and the sequence of the BiPOLES-like construct that they did test) and 2) that the properties that the investigators specifically tailored their construct to have confer some sort of experimental advantage when compared to the existing standard.</p>
<p>There are a number of additional concerns and clarifications that will strengthen the manuscript that are communicated directly to the authors through this peer-review process.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
One often wishes to combine activation of a neural population via red light with simultaneous modulation of a different population via blue light, or simultaneous imaging of a blue-excited fluorescent reporter. The problem is that all red-shifted opsins have an action spectrum with a long blue tail, leading to spurious opsin activation by blue light.</p>
<p>This valuable paper presents a clever solution to this problem, by pairing an engineered blue-shifted inhibitory chloride-conducting opsin with a red-shifted excitatory opsin. The combined effect is excitation by red light and shunting inhibition by blue light. The paper is very thorough, with convincing spectroscopic and patch clamp characterization of the tools, and tests in brain slices and in vivo. This tool is likely to be useful in the neuroscience community.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The methods are solid, including the complete characterization of each tool separately, as well as the combination in vivo. The array of testing gives a strong degree of confidence that this tool will work as expected.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are two discussion points and one experimental point which would make the paper stronger.</p>
<p>1. In the Introduction or Discussion, the authors could better motivate the need for a red-shifted actuator that lacks blue crosstalk, by giving some specific examples of how the tool could be productively used, e.g. pairing with another blue-shifted excitatory opsin in a different population, or pairing with a GFP-based fluorescent indicator, e.g. GCaMP. The motivation for the current tool is not obvious to non-experts.</p>
<p>2. Simultaneous excitation and inhibition are not the same as non-excitation. The authors mentioned shunting briefly. Another possible issue is changes in osmotic balance. Activation of a Na+ channel and a Cl- channel will lead to net import of NaCl into the cell, possibly changing osmotic pressure. Please discuss.</p>
<p>3. The authors showed that in ZipT-IvfChr, orange light drives excitation and blue light does not. But what about simultaneous blue and orange light? Can the blue light overwhelm the effect of the orange light? Since the stated goal is to open the blue part of the spectrum for other applications, one is now worried about &quot;negative&quot; crosstalk. Please discuss and, ideally, characterize this phenomenon.</p>

<p>This study addresses the important topic of dual-color optogenetic control of neuronal activity, which is challenging due to significant optical crosstalk between channelrhodopsins of different absorption colors and ion selectivity. However, Mermet-Joret et al. demonstrate in flies that simple coexpression of a strong blue light-activated inhibitory opsin, such as the chloride-selective channelrhodopsin GtACR2, can suppress the blue light activity of a red-shifted excitatory opsin, such as Chrimson, and allow dual-color optogenetic control of the expressing neuron. The same concept was previously discussed by Vierock et al. and led to the generation of BiPOLES, which combines both channels in a single fusion protein. In the present manuscript, the authors introduce an alternative combination of channels with accelerated off-kinetics that are coexpressed by a bicistronic expression cassette. The goal is to better match the duration of illumination and optogenetic manipulation in order to reduce potential side effects induced by prolonged channel opening.</p>
<p>The major novelty of this work lies in the choice of the employed ion channels: the excitatory cation channel vf-Chrimson and the inhibitory anion channel ZipACR, alongside their subsequent modifications (Fig. 2 - 4). Both channels belong to the fastest known ChRs, but the choice of ZipACR raises questions. First, it has a peak absorption at 515 nm that is 40 nm further red-shifted than GtACR2 tested in Figure 1 and accordingly important optical cross-talk with the coexpressed Chrimson channel. Second, it was reported to have reduced chloride selectivity, first by Govorunova et al. in 2017 and later also by Kato et al. in 2018. Both of these aspects are also mentioned by the authors but were not resolved through molecular engineering. Instead site-directed mutagenesis primarily focused on membrane expression and photoreceptor kinetics of the employed channels. Nonetheless, improving the membrane targeting of the vf-Chrimson channel by exchange of the N-terminus finally provided sufficient red light activation at low light intensities to reliably activate expressing neurons and allowed in combination with the decelerated ZipACR mutants dual color optogenetic control with millisecond time resolution. At higher light intensities inactivation of Chrimson and the optical crosstalk of both channels seem to limit its performance.</p>
<p>The experimental results are well presented; but, certain questions persist:</p>
<p>1. The enhanced vf-Chrimson could potentially be a highlight of the manuscript, serving broader applications. Yet, gauging the overall improvements of ivf-Chrimson in comparison to other Chrimson variants remains intricate due to several reasons. First, photocurrents from ivf-Chrimson seem smaller than those from C-Chrimson (Supplemental Figure 3), and a direct comparison with standard vf-Chrimson is absent. Second, while membrane expression of ivf-Chrimson appears enhanced in provided bright-field recordings, the quantitative analysis would necessitate confocal microscopy and a membrane marker (Supplemental Figure 2). Finally, other N-terminal modified Chrimson variants, like CsChrimson by Klapoetke et al. in 2014 and C1Chrimson by Oda et al. in 2018, have been generated. Comparing ivf-Chrimson to vf-CsChrimson or vf-C1Chrimson would be important to evaluate the benefits of the applied N-terminal modification.</p>
<p>2. The action spectra of ZipACR suggest peak absorption of ZipACR WT and its mutant at 525 - 550 nm (Fig. 3). This is even further red-shifted than previously reported by Govorunova et al. Further action spectra recordings differ for all constructs between recordings initiated with blue or red light (Supplementary Fig. 5). This discrepancy is unexpected and should be discussed. Additionally, the representative photocurrents of Zip(151V) in Fig. 3D1 do not align with the corresponding action spectrum in Fig. 3D2 as they show maximal photocurrents for 400 nm excitation.</p>
<p>3. The authors introduce two different bicistronic expression cassettes-ZipT-IvfChR and ZipV-IvfChR-without providing clear guidelines on their conditions of use. Although the authors assert that ZipT is slower and further red-shifted than ZipV, the differences in the data for both ACR mutants are small and the benefits of the different final constructs should be explained.</p>
<p>4. The ZipT/V-IvfChRs are designed as bicistronic constructs; yet, disparities in membrane trafficking and protein degradation between the two channels could lead to divergences in blue and red light photoresponses. For future applicants, understanding the extent of expression ratio variations across cells using the presented expression cassettes could be of significance and should be discussed.</p>
