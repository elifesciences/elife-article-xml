<title>Abstract</title><p>Accurate reconstruction of the timescale of organismal evolution requires knowledge of the placement of extinct representatives among living branches. The fossil record has the capacity to reframe hypotheses of organismal evolution by producing representatives of clades that predate previously known fossils or node ages. Recently, one fossil with the potential to drastically change current consensus surrounding the timescale of reptile diversification was described from Triassic fissure-fill deposits in the United Kingdom. This taxon, <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic>, was originally placed deep within the squamate crown clade, suggesting that many lineages of lizards and snakes must have appeared by the Triassic and implying long ghost lineages that paleontologists and molecular phylogeneticists have failed to detect using all other available data. Our team questioned this identification and instead suggested <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> had unclear affinities to living reptiles, but this alternative interpretation was again challenged by the team that originally described this species. Here, we dissect the morphological character codings used to support a crown squamate affinity for <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic> and illustrate empirical problems with analyses that hypothesize this taxon to be a crown squamate. Our analyses emphasize the importance of stringency in constructing hypodigms of fossils, particularly when they may be key for proper time calibration of the Tree of Life.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Paleontology has found a new role in the era of widespread genome sequencing of living phylogenetic diversity: providing justification for the placement of fossil calibrations along molecular phylogenies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Placing fossils on the Tree of Life has become common practice, and new discoveries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and reshuffling of hypothesized phylogenetic relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] often revise which fossils are best to use as prior constraints. These factors make the robust placement of potential fossil calibrations essential for calibrating phylogenies to absolute time, which themselves are a foundation of modern evolutionary biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], described <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic> based on a partially articulated skeleton and a collection of referred material from the Carnian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] to Norian-Rhaetian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] (237-201.5 million years ago) fissure fill deposits of England, UK. In a subsequent study, we [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] refuted the affinities of <italic>C. microlanius</italic> to Anguimorpha as a deeply nested crown squamate that was proposed by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] based on a re-examination of the CT scan data of the holotype and referred specimens. This prompted substantial edits to how this taxon was scored in the morphological data matrix used to assess its phylogenetic relationships, finding <italic>C. microlanius</italic> to be “…<italic>either an archosauromorph or an indeterminate neodiapsid…</italic>” and not a lepidosaur, much less a crown squamate. In an impassioned response to our study, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] disagreed with many of our anatomical observations and restated their position on the affinities of <italic>C. microlanius.</italic> Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] also referred additional Late Triassic fossils to <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic> and presented putative phylogenetic results that this taxon is a crown group squamate (squamate hereafter).</p>
<p>Here we provide point-by-point re-examination of the new evidence and interpretations of Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] regarding the anatomy and phylogenetic affinities of <italic>C. microlanius</italic>. We identify and describe what we consider to be major methodological errors in the comparative anatomical work and phylogenetic analyses of Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], and present the results of our reanalysis of their actual data matrices and the recovered synapomorphies ignored by those authors.</p>

<title>Errors and Untested Synapomorphies</title>
<p>Both Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] include numerous comparative anatomy errors that can broadly be grouped into two categories: (i) anatomical interpretation, and (ii) translating these interpretations into scorings in different phylogenetic datasets. In Brownstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], we identified 22 errors in the study of Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] of type (i) (“Results” in Brownstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]) and several more of type (ii) (“Supplementary Material” in Brownstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]). In Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], the authors claim that there were five observational errors in Brownstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Four of these are supposed observational errors (type (i)) and one concerns a difference in how Brownstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] and Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] score a character (type (ii)). In turn, this implies that Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] acknowledge that the other 18 type (i) errors produced by their previous study were correctly identified by Brownstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Yet, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] discuss additional characters in sections of their study and provide different interpretations of the anatomy of <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic> than do Brownstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], but without clear justification.</p>
<p>In this section we also revisit each alternative interpretation of the anatomy of <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic> provided by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], who discussed 26 characters that they suggest have bearing on the placement of this taxon within Lepidosauria, Pan-Squamata, crown Squamata, and successive clades within the crown. We note first that these characters do not correspond to optimized character states in the phylogenies that Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and WEA24 inferred, but instead to an assemblage of character state optimizations presented in various papers in the literature (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]). This is not an issue <italic>per se</italic> for a referral of <italic>C. microlanius</italic> to Squamata, but it does mean that these characters are of unclear relevance to the actual support for the position(s) of <italic>C. microlanius</italic> among reptiles that Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] recovered in the phylogenies that they presented. With this noted, we provide a point-by-point discussion of character interpretations in Brownstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] that were challenged by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<sec id="s2a1">
<title>Entepicondylar and ectepicondylar foramen of humerus</title>
<p>The features on the humeri that Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] figure and claim are the ente- and ectepicondylar foramina, are in fact, fossae that are filled in with sediment. Although they claim to observe this in yet another referred humerus, they neither figure the internal structure of the bone nor provide any evidence for its referral to <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic>. Contrary to the assertion of Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], CT scans do in fact provide essential information about the structure of these fossae and show that, when infill is removed, foramina are absent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> in Brownstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]). Further, these structures are in the wrong place to be the claimed foramina. In all diapsids that possess these foramina, they are placed low on the anterior surface (entepicondylar) and high on the distal surface (ectepicondylar) of the humerus (e.g., see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] for examples in squamates, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] for turtles, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] for sphenodontians) and are dissimilar in shape and size (the entepicondylar foramen is elongated along the long axis of the humerus; the ectepicondylar foramen is circular). The features that Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] figure are similar in shape and size, are placed on the same side of the bone, and differ in placement from humeral foramina observed in other exemplar fossils and living reptile species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. The morphology of the fossae observed on the distal end of the humeri referred to <italic>C. microlanius</italic> by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] are, however, similar in placement, size, and shape to fossae described on the distal ends of the humeri of some archosauromorphs, including the azendohsaurid <italic>Puercosuchus traverorum</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>; also see fig.13a in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]). We further note that, even if WEA24’s interpretation was accurate, the entepicondylar foramen is always absent in all crown squamates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Among lepidosaurs, the presence of both entepicondylar and ectepicondylar foramina is found only among sphenodontians, stem lepidosaurs, and stem squamates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Further, these foramina are also present in many non-lepidosaurian reptiles, including captorhinids (e.g. <italic>Captorhinus</italic>), younginiforms (e.g., <italic>Hovasaurus</italic> and <italic>Youngina</italic>), Claudiosaurus, Acleistorhinidae (Delorhynchus), <italic>Mesosaurus</italic>, the possible stem turtle <italic>Eunotosaurus africanus</italic>, and in some sauropterygians (e.g., <italic>Serpianosaurus</italic> and <italic>Lariosaurus</italic>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. If anything, the presence of both foramina would support the assignment of <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> as outside of crown Squamata, not within the clade nor as a squamate synapomorphy. The position taken by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] on this feature is puzzling.</p>

<sec id="s2a2">
<title>Absence of jugal posterior process</title>
<p>WEA24 state: “<italic>Except for a very few fossil taxa, including two polyglyphanodontians,Tianyusaurus and Polyglyphanodon, … squamates lack a posterior process on the jugal…</italic>”. This is entirely incorrect. The two extinct taxa noted by WEA24 here are only unusual among squamates in the fact that they have a complete lower temporal bar, and thus an elongated jugal posterior process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. However, most families of squamates include species with a jugal posterior process (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], even if a complete lower temporal bar is not present. The high degree of observed variability in the development of the jugal posterior process and lower temporal bar (e.g., <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) means that the placement of <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic> within any pan-lepidosaur clade based on this feature should be viewed with caution. The development and enclosure of the temporal fenestra in reptiles has been linked to the expression of two genes, <italic>Runx2</italic> and <italic>Msx2</italic>, in <italic>in vivo</italic> studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. We suspect that the variable extent of this feature in many early-diverging lepidosaur and archosauromorph lineages might be an example of the ‘zone of variability’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], in which the canalization of development and other constraints (e.g., functionality; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]) had not yet completely acted to ‘fix’ the morphology of the posterior process. This hypothesis will of course require further experimental study of living model systems. Together, these observations suggest that the presence of a jugal posterior process was incorrectly scored in the datasets used by WEA24 (type (ii) error).</p>

<title>Anterior emargination of the maxillary nasal process</title>
<p>Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] state that Brownstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] <italic>“seemingly relied on the anteriorly broken left maxilla”</italic> and that “<italic>The anterior margin of the maxillary nasal process of the right maxilla tapers anteriorly…with no evidence of the type of emargination suggested”</italic>. The character in question (ch. 18 in the dataset used by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]), is one of the original characters from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], which is the basis for the dataset used by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. In both datasets, this character is described as “<italic>Maxillae, <bold>posterior emargination</bold>, between nasal and orbital processes</italic>”[boldface added], and this character is extensively described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Therefore, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] incorrectly assessed the anterior margin of the maxilla instead of the posterior margin, which is another type (ii) error.</p>

<title>Expanded radial condyle of the humerus</title>
<p>Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] (p. 3) state that Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] “<italic>noted an expanded radial condyle on the humerus.</italic>” Yet, nowhere in Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] do the authors mention or figure such a structure. Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] (p.3, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">fig. 1b</xref>) write in their figure caption regarding another isolated fragment: <italic>“(b) NHMUK PV 38911 isolated larger specimen of the distal end of left humerus of</italic> Cryptovaranoides microlanius <italic>in (above) anterior and (below) posterior views <bold>showing similar features except the condyle of the capitellum</bold></italic>.” (boldface added). Then, in Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] (subsection 2.3), the authors state that this fragment does not have a radial condyle/capitellum of the humerus, which they defend as follows: “<italic>This is reinforced by the larger humerus (</italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1b</xref><italic>) which is missing the condyle, </italic><italic><bold>as is typical in the preservation of fissure lepidosaurs</bold></italic><italic> (e.g. Clevosaurus; [12, fig. 29b]) but the </italic><italic><bold>cavity in which it sat clearly indicates a substantial condyle in life.</bold></italic><italic>”</italic> (boldface added). What WEA24 highlight is that there is no condyle in this humerus or the holotype specimen and defer it to poor preservation without justification beyond <italic>“…as is typical ….of fissure lepidosaurs…</italic>” as a reason to conclude the condyle was present and to explain this inconsistency among the bones referred to <italic>Cryptovaranoides.</italic> Taphonomy and poor preservation cannot be used to infer the presence of an anatomical feature that is absent. Finally, even in the case of the isolated humerus with a preserved capitulum, the condyle illustrated by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] is fairly small compared to even the earliest known pan-squamates, such as <italic>Megachirella wachtleri</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] claim that a small, disarticulated piece of bone that is preserved anterolateral to the vomer in the block containing the holotype of <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic> is the septomaxilla. They further suggest that a portion of the medial surface on a maxilla referred to this taxon that is likely from a much larger reptile provides additional support for the presence of a septomaxilla in <italic>C. microlanius.</italic> Simply put, the CT scans published by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] show that the bone in the holotype is isolated and with no clear morphological affinities to the septomaxillae in squamates (see CT scans in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]). Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] also suggest that the identity of this bone as the septomaxilla is supported by its placement between the maxilla and premaxilla of the holotype but given the level of disarticulation of the holotype and the morphology of the bone fragment, a similar argument could be made that it is a portion of the anterior end of one of the vomers. In any case, we feel it is premature to code <italic>C. microlanius</italic> for any character related to the morphology of the septomaxilla based on this disarticulated and damaged bone fragment.</p>

This is not the condition specified in either of the morphological character sets that they cite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] – the presence of a distinct condyle that is expanded – and is by their own description not homologous to the condition in other squamates.</p>

<title>Subdivision of the metotic fissure</title>
<p>Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] claim that the division of the metotic fissure into the vagus foramen and recessus scala tympani by the crista tuberalis, a key squamate feature, can be scored for <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic>, yet paradoxically suggest the presence of this condition is only inferable based on other observations of the anatomy of the holotype and referred specimens. In fact, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] argue that because another character relating to a different part of the structure of the metotic fissure can be inferred based on the presence of the crista tuberalis, that the division of the metotic fissure may also be inferred by the presence of the crista tuberalis. This logic would imply that no reptile taxon should exist that possesses solely either a crista tuberalis or a subdivided metotic fissure, even when this is an observed state combination in squamates scored for the matrices that both our teams have used to analyze the phylogenetic position of <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Thus this inference lacks justification. To verify that <italic>C. microlanius</italic> possessed a vagus foramen, Whiteside et al.

It is unclear to us how Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] accounted for confirmation bias when conducting this collections search, or on what basis they refer this isolated bone to <italic>C. microlanius</italic>. In any case, the presence of the lateral opening of the recessus scala tympani is not figured in the fragment, and thus the division of the metotic fissure is not demonstrated in the referred fragment.</p>

<title>Fusion of exoccipitals and opisthotics</title>
<p>As Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] note, we concur with their identification of an otoccipital in <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic> formed by the fusion of the exoccipitals with the opisthotics. Our concern is with the use of this feature to assign <italic>C. microlanius</italic> to Squamata. Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] cite de Queiroz and Gauthier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], who list the presence of an otoccipital as a distinguishing feature of squamates. However, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] fail to provide any phylogenetic evidence supporting the optimization of this feature as a squamate synapomorphy in phylogenies including <italic>C. microlanius</italic>, nor do they recognize that an otoccipital is present in numerous non-squamate reptiles, including numerous archosauromorphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. For these reasons, the presence of an otoccipital alone cannot be used to assign <italic>C. microlanius</italic> to Squamata or even Lepidosauria instead of Archosauromorpha or other clades of reptiles known from the Permo-Triassic, except to distinguish the turtle total clade (<italic>Eunotosaurus africanus</italic> possesses unfused exoccipitals and opisthotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]). We acknowledge that with respect to a character state widespread among reptiles, optimization along a phylogeny is what is of primary importance for referring taxa to a particular clade. To this end, we reiterate that Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] did not show that the presence of an otoccipital optimizes as an ambiguous or unambiguous synapomorphy of Lepidosauria, Pan-Squamata, or Squamata in any of their phylogenies. For characters that show evidence of homoplastic evolution like the presence of an otoccipital (and indeed, the presence of a jugal posterior process; see above), phylogenetic character optimization is essential.</p>

<title>Development of the choanal fossa of the palatine</title>
<p>Squamata includes multiple instances where the complexity of the bony palate increases dramatically, an innovation that is related to chemosensory evolution and the integration of different bones that form this region of the skull [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. One feature recognized as phylogenetically informative is the development of the choanal fossa on the ventral surface of the palatine (also known as the palatine sulcus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] claim that the development of the palatine choanal fossa in <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic> is comparable to the development of this feature in living squamates, and cite the living iguanian genus <italic>Ctenosaura</italic> as an example of a squamate with similar anteroposterior development of this feature as <italic>C. microlanius.</italic> Importantly, most iguanians appear to show the plesiomorphic condition where the choanal fossa is anteriorly restricted on the palatine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]; this feature has contributed to debates about whether Iguania forms the living sister group of all other crown squamates (as found in many morphological character-based phylogenies; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]) or is deeply nested within the crown clade and secondarily convergent with rhynchocephalians (as implied by phylogenies made using DNA sequence data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] and some made using morphological data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]). As such, this comparison is not salient to the discussion about whether the development of the choanal fossa in <italic>C. microlanius</italic> represents the squamate condition. Secondly, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] take issue with our contention that the palatine fossa is present, albeit variably, across a wide swath of reptilian diversity, including many early-diverging archosauromorph clades. They explicate this concern by distinguishing between the narrow channel found in taxa like <italic>Tanystropheus</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1l</xref> in Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]) and the wider fossa found in <italic>C. microlanius</italic>. We agree that the fossa in <italic>C. microlanius</italic> is more developed than in some early-diverging lepidosaurs, such as <italic>Marmoretta oxoniensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. However, it is clear that the feature in <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> falls within the variation in the choanal fossa length and depth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) that represents the ancestral condition in lepidosaurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and is exemplified across archosauromorph (see, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]) and indeed diapsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] diversity. Finally, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] cite the discovery of a large, isolated palatine that they state confirms the presence of a “squamate-type” choanal fossa in <italic>C. microlanius</italic>, except they provide no justification for why this isolated bone should be referred to this species.

<title>Vomer ventral ridges and dentition</title>
<p>Whiteside et al.

We dispute this on the basis that the vomer of <italic>C. microlanius</italic> as figured by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] shows no clear ridges equivalent to those in <italic>Pseudopus apodus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] or other squamates with ridged vomers, including extinct forms such as <italic>Eoscincus ornatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Instead, the new photograph of the holotype specimen of <italic>C. microlanius</italic> provided in Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] shows that the vomer is indeed toothed, but no ridges are figured or visible. We once again reexamined the CT scan data and failed to find any structure resembling the ridges present in some anguimorphs, although we acknowledge that the nature of the scan data (43 microns per segment) means that the vomer surface on the scan segmentations is coarse. In any case, no ridges equivalent in shape or size to those found in anguimorph squamates are present in the holotype of <italic>C. microlanius.</italic> The presence of teeth on the vomer is itself rare among squamates; only in the pan-scincoid <italic>Eoscincus ornatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] and some [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] anguid and varanoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] species are vomerine teeth documented. Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] appear to suggest that the presence of vomerine ridges and a row of vomerine teeth therefore allies <italic>C. microlanius</italic> with anguimorphs. The structure of the vomer in <italic>C. microlanius</italic>, however, is fundamentally unlike those of anguimorph squamates, which are elongate and possess pronounced ridges that are placed medially on the ventral surface of the main body of each vomer and each house only one row of teeth along their posterior third [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. In contrast, the condition that Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] figure for <italic>C. microlanius</italic> shows multiple, parallel rows of vomerine teeth on either side of the vomer that run across the entire length of the bone. This morphology is even unlike that observed in the only squamate known where multiple vomerine tooth rows are present, <italic>Eoscincus ornatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In that species, all vomerine teeth are restricted to a raised surface at the posterior end of the ventral surface of the vomer main body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Thus, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] have provided no evidence that vomerine ridges are present in <italic>C. microlanius</italic>. We note again that vomerine teeth are widespread across neodiapsid diversity outside Squamata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>] and appear in many lineages of Triassic archosauromorphs.</p>

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] dispute this by suggesting that the CT scan data does not reliably show the feature, and instead provide a photograph of the holotype skull that was stated to show this morphology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2a-c</xref> in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]). This figure shows no curvature to the lacrimal, which appears as a flat element, whereas an arch dorsally and a floor ventrally would indicate the presence of a foramen. Whiteside et al.

This appears to suggest that, despite never conducting an analysis where this feature is coded as ‘present’ for <italic>C. microlanius</italic>, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] used the presence of the feature to ally <italic>C. microlanius</italic> with Anguimorpha, not as a recovered synapomorphy, but stating that it was so. This action would be an arbitrary unification of a species with a clade based on a selected character state and would deny the equal possibility that this character state is absent due to secondary reversal in <italic>C. microlanius.</italic> In sum, the use of lacrimal morphology to ally <italic>C. microlanius</italic> with anguimorphs is apparently not based on direct character state optimization, i.e., a test of congruence.</p>

However, Whiteside et al.

<title>Frontal underlaps parietal laterally on frontoparietal suture</title>
<p>Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] confirm that the presence of this feature in <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</italic> is based on the morphology of a referred isolated frontal that they state matches the corresponding articular portion of the prefrontal in the holotype. However, we do not understand how this bone could possibly match the corresponding articular surface unless it was from the same individual or an animal of exactly the same size. Unless Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] were actually able to articulate these bones, it is unclear how this inference can be made. Finally, we note that the posterior process of the prefrontal is broken off in the holotype of <italic>Cryptovaranoides microlanius.</italic> In squamates and other lepidosaurs, this process abuts the lateral surface of the frontal along its anteroposterior axis. Several of us (C.D.B. and D.L.M.) worked to rearticulated the holotype of <italic>Eoscincus ornatus</italic>, which involved rearticulating the prefrontal and frontal. Rearticulating these bones is simply impossible without the complete posterior process of the prefrontal, as the orientation of this process must match the curvature of the lateral margin of the frontal. Because the isolated frontal is not figured in either paper by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], it is impossible for us to verify whether this bone actually matches the corresponding articulation surface on the prefrontal in the holotype.

<title>Bicapitate cervical ribs and cervical ribs with an anteriorly oriented process</title>
<p>Whiteside et al.

We assume that Whiteside et al.

<title>Cervical and dorsal vertebral intercentra</title>
<p>Whiteside et al.

In fact, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] state in their original paper that there “are gaps between the vertebrae indicating that intercentra were present (but displaced in the specimen) on CV3 and posteriorly. Some images of bones on the scans are identified as intercentra” (p. 11, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]). The statement in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] consequently represents an incorrect attribution and an incorrect characterization of our reexamination, as we determined that no cervical and dorsal intercentra were preserved or present in the holotype. Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] justify their position that cervical intercentra are present in <italic>C. microlanius</italic> based on the morphology of another isolated bone that they refer to this taxon. In any case, the absence of dorsal intercentra is not a distinguishing feature of squamates because several lineages of squamates, including lacertids, xantusiids, gekkotans, and the stem-squamate <italic>Bellairsia gracilis</italic> all possess cervical and dorsal intercentra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>].</p>

<p>Whiteside et al.

Confusingly, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] label this feature as the ‘primary coracoid fenestra’ in their figure 3i-j, even though it is clearly the coracoid foramen. Whiteside et al.

<p>Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] describe and defend their addition of isolated elements to fill in gaps in the holotype concept of <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> to build, in our view, an unjustifiably inflated hypodigm. WEA24 (p. 15) try to ameliorate this problem in their Section (5.5) where they state that: “<italic>We emphasize that we always match isolated bones with their equivalents on the holotype…</italic>” and then state in contradiction that: “<italic>We consider it <bold>remiss</bold> not to include isolated bones as they provide details which no scan can.

In summary, Whiteside et al.

<title>Apomorphic characters not empirically obtained</title>
<p>Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] discussed nearly 30 anatomical characters (Sections 2-6), most of which are used to support their core hypothesis that <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> is a squamate. Yet, none of these 30 characters or conditions are actually found by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] to be synapomorphies of Squamata in their various phylogenetic analyses. In other words, they did not present the results of their Tests of Congruence, but rather simply elected to argue that untested interpretations of anatomy were apomorphies, synapomorphies, or shared characters.This is a non-trivial substantive methodological flaw in Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], that was perpetuated in Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], and that nullifies the bulk of the arguments presented repeatedly in both studies.</p>
<p>In Section 6, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] (p. 16) indicate they modified the datasets of Brownstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], but preferred the results of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] and performed two different analyses based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]: one using only morphological data, and one using morphological data with several constraints from a molecular backbone. The former was tested using maximum parsimony and the latter using Bayesian inference. What is not clear from either Section 6 or 7, is which phylogenetic analysis was used by WEA24 to “<italic>review the apomorphy distribution</italic>”. But this uncertainty is inconsequential as the apomorphy distributions discussed in Section 7 of Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] were not derived from their phylogenetic analyses. Instead, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] (p. 19) exclusively extracted characters from the literature to support their identification of <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> as a squamate, rather than basing this inference primarily on their own phylogenetic analyses. These literature sourced characters include <italic>“two diagnostic characters of Squamata (=crown-clade Squamata)”</italic> and <italic>“…further eight squamate synapomorphies”</italic> listed by WEA24 (Section 7, p. 19). As stated by the authors, “<italic>we give the citation for the squamate synapomorphy at the end of each character”</italic>— indicating that these diagnostic characters or synapomorphies were picked from the literature and not derived from ancestral state reconstructions based on their phylogenetic results.</p>
<p>In order to check the characters listed by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] (p.19) as “<italic>two diagnostic characters</italic>” and “<italic>eight synapomorphies</italic>” in support of a squamate identity for <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic>, we conducted parsimony analysis of the revised version of the dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] provided by WEA24 in TNT v 1.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. We used Whiteside et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] own data version—e.g., with (0) scored for character 1 and not including character 383. We recovered eight apomorphies at the squamate node of which only three were recovered as unambiguous synapomorphies (boldface indicates the state as scored by Whiteside et al.

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>As we noted above and in Brownstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], the anatomy of <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> is similar to many Late Triassic neodiapsid reptiles. For example, the quadrates of <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> are closely comparable to those of archosauromorphs such as <italic>Prolacerta</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>], <italic>Macronemus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>] and <italic>Malerisaurus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>], with which <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> shares the presence of a notch on the quadrate for an immobile articulation with the squamosal. Furthermore, WEA24’s inference that the quadrate, the notch, and the articulation with the squamosal was mobile, i.e., streptostylic as in squamates, is unfounded.</p>
<p>Similarly, the vertebrae and cervical ribs of the holotype of <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> do not resemble those of squamates, but in fact share important features with non-squamate neodiapsids, especially archosauromorphs (a point left unaddressed by Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]). For example, whereas fusion of the neural arches to the centra occurs during embryonic ossification in squamates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>], in <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> unfused bony neural arches and centra are present, as commonly observed in archosaurs and other non-lepidosauromorph neodiapsids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]—we provide a long-form review of these and other features in <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> that compare favorably with non-squamate reptiles in Supplementary Material.</p>
<p>Several errors in Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] identified in Brownstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], and subsequent errors in Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] that were discussed above result in the incorrectly interpreted neodiapsid and lepidosaur anatomy of <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> and consequently provide erroneous scorings for <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> for morphological character matrices. Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] also make additional errors on an alpha taxonomic level, such as the unjustified inflation of the <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> hypodigm based on contradictory arguments pertaining to the assignment of fragmentary and isolated elements to the holotype. Finally, we highlight here that where Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] should have reported their own recovered synapomorphies, that is, the actual results of their phylogenetic analyses, rather than listing a substantive number of supposed apomorphies that the authors argue support the squamate affinities of <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> broadly, and anguimorph affinities more specifically. On a methodological and analytical level, we do not consider that manually selecting apomorphic characters supporting their preferred placement of <italic>Cryptovaranoides</italic> instead of using characters empirically obtained from phylogenetic ancestral state reconstruction of their phylogenetic results, stands as valid support of a phylogenetic hypothesis.</p>
<p>We end with a perspective on the fossil record of neodiapsid evolution. The anatomies and morphologies that diagnose crown group squamates are many and varied, and except for a few features, hardly universally distributed amongst the living and fossil members of the crown. They are themselves the product of some 250 million years of evolutionary time and would not have evolved in a linear fashion. Rather, phylogenetic analyses of diverse extinct and living reptile clades have shown that the squamate <italic>bauplan</italic> originated in the context of extensive mosaic and homoplastic osteological character evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. We do not doubt that members of Pan-Squamata were present during the Triassic; this is supported by the fossil record [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] as well as numerous time-calibrated phylogenies based on genomic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] morphological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] and total-evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] data. However, Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and Whiteside et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] have provided no direct osteological evidence that supports the presence of crown Squamata or any of its inclusive clades in the Triassic.</p>

<p>Cryptovaranoides, an end-Triassic animal (just over 200 Ma old), was originally described as a possibly anguimorph squamate, i.e., more closely related to snakes and some extant lizards than to other extant lizards, making Squamata much older than previously thought and providing a new calibration date inside it. Following a rebuttal and a defense, this fourth <bold>important</bold> contribution to the debate makes a meticulous and <bold>solid</bold> argument that Cryptovaranoides is not a squamate. However, further comparisons to potentially closely related animals would greatly benefit this study, and parts of the text require clarification.</p>

<p>In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic (around 230 to 180 Ma ago), southern Wales and adjacent parts of England were a karst landscape. The caves and crevices accumulated remains of small vertebrates. These fossil-rich fissure fills are being exposed in limestone quarrying. In 2022 (reference 13 of the article), a partial articulated skeleton and numerous isolated bones from one fissure fill of end-Triassic age (just over 200 Ma) were named Cryptovaranoides microlanius and described as the oldest known squamate - the oldest known animal, by some 20 to 30 Ma, that is more closely related to snakes and some extant lizards than to other extant lizards. This would have considerable consequences for our understanding of the evolution of squamates and their closest relatives, especially for their speed and absolute timing, and was supported in the same paper by phylogenetic analyses based on different datasets.</p>
<p>In 2023, the present authors published a rebuttal (reference 18) to the 2022 paper, challenging anatomical interpretations and the irreproducible referral of some of the isolated bones to Cryptovaranoides. Modifying the datasets accordingly, they found Cryptovaranoides outside Squamata and presented evidence that it is far outside. In 2024 (reference 19), the original authors defended most of their original interpretation and presented some new data, some of it from newly referred isolated bones. The present article discusses anatomical features and the referral of isolated bones in more detail, documents some clear misinterpretations, argues against the widespread but not justifiable practice of referring isolated bones to the same species as long as there is merely no known evidence to the contrary, further argues against comparing newly recognized fossils to lists of diagnostic characters from the literature as opposed to performing phylogenetic analyses and interpreting the results, and finds Cryptovaranoides outside Squamata again.</p>
<p>Although a few of the character discussions and the discussion of at least one of the isolated bones can probably still be improved (and two characters are addressed twice), I see no sign that the discussion is going in circles or otherwise becoming unproductive. I can even imagine that the present contribution will end it.</p>

<p>Congratulations on this thorough manuscript on the phylogenetic affinities of Cryptovaranoides. Recent interpretations of this taxon, and perhaps some others, have greatly changed the field's understanding of reptile origins- for better and (likely) for worse.</p>
<p>This manuscript offers a careful review of the features used to place Cryptovaranoides within Squamata and adequately demonstrates that this interpretation is misguided, and therefore reconciles morphological and molecular data, which is an important contribution to the field of paleontology. The presence of any crown squamate in the Permian or Triassic should be met with skepticism, the same sort of skepticism provided in this manuscript.</p>
<p>I have outlined some comments addressing some weaknesses that I believe will further elevate the scientific quality of the work. A brief, fresh read‑through to refine a few phrases, particularly where the discussion references Whiteside et al. could also give the paper an even more collegial tone.</p>
<p>This manuscript can be largely improved by additional discussion and figures, where applicable. When I first read this manuscript, I was a bit surprised at how little discussion there was concerning both non-lepidosauromorph lepidosaurs as well as stem-reptiles more broadly. This paper makes it extremely clear that Cryptovaranoides is not a squamate, but would greatly benefit in explaining why many of the characters either suggested by former studies to be squamate in nature or were optimized as such in phylogenetic analyses are rather widespread plesiomorphies present in crownward sauropsids such as millerettids, younginids, or tangasaurids. I suggest citing this work where applicable and building some of the discussion for a greatly improved manuscript. In sum:</p>
<p>(1) The discussion of stem-reptiles should be improved. Nearly all of the supposed squamate features in Cryptovaranoides are present in various stem-reptile groups. I've noted a few, but this would be a fairly quick addition to this work. If this manuscript incorporates this advice, I believe arguments regarding the affinities of Cryptovaranoides (at least within Squamata) will be finished, and this manuscript will be better off for it.</p>
<p>(2) I was also surprised at how little discussion there was here of putative stem-squamates or lepidosauromorphs more broadly. A few targeted comparisons could really benefit the manuscript. It is currently unclear as to why Cryptovaranoides could not be a stem-lepidosaur, although I know that the lepidosaur total-group in these manuscripts lacks character sampling due to their scarcity.</p>
<p>(3) This manuscript can be improved by additional figures, such as the slice data of the humerus. The poor quality of the scan data for Cryptovaranoides is stated during this paper several times, yet the scan data is often used as evidence for the presence or absence of often minute features without discussion, leaving doubts as to what condition is true. Otherwise, several sections can be rephrased to acknowledge uncertainty, and probably change some character scorings to '?' in other studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study provides an interesting contribution to our understanding of Cryptovaranoides relationships, which is a matter of intensive debate among researchers. My main concerns are in regard to the wording of some statements, but generally, the discussion and data are well prepared. I would recommend moderate revisions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Detailed analysis of the discussed characters.</p>
<p>(2) Illustrations of some comparative materials.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some parts of the manuscript require clarification and rewording.</p>
<p>One of the main points of criticism of Whiteside et al. is using characters for phylogenetic considerations that are not included in the phylogenetic analyses therein. The authors call it a &quot;non-trivial substantive methodological flaw&quot; (page 19, line 531). I would step down from such a statement for the reasons listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Comparative anatomy is not about making phylogenetic analyses. Comparative anatomy is about comparing different taxa in search of characters that are unique and characters that are shared between taxa. This creates an opportunity to assess the level of similarity between the taxa and create preliminary hypotheses about homology. Therefore, comparative anatomy can provide some phylogenetic inferences. That does not mean that tests of congruence are not needed. Such comparisons are the first step that allows creating phylogenetic matrices for analysis, which is the next step of phylogenetic inference. That does not mean that all the papers with new morphological comparisons should end with a new or expanded phylogenetic matrix. Instead, such papers serve as a rationale for future papers that focus on building phylogenetic matrices.</p>
<p>(2) Phylogenetic matrices are never complete, both in terms of morphological disparity and taxonomic diversity. I don't know if it is even possible to have a complete one, but at least we can say that we are far from that. Criticising a work that did not include all the possibly relevant characters in the phylogenetic analysis is simply unfair. The authors should know that creating/expanding a phylogenetic matrix is a never-ending work, beyond the scope of any paper presenting a new fossil.</p>
<p>(3) Each additional taxon has the possibility of inducing a rethinking of characters. That includes new characters, new character states, character state reordering, etc. As I said above, it is usually beyond the scope of a paper with a new fossil to accommodate that into the phylogenetic matrix, as it requires not only scoring the newly described taxon but also many that are already scored. Since the digitalization of fossils is still rare, it requires a lot of collection visits that are costly in terms of time.</p>
<p>(4) If I were to search for a true flaw in the Whiteside et al. paper, I would check if there is a confirmation bias. The mentioned paper should not only search for characters that support Cryptovaranoides affinities with Anguimorpha but also characters that deny that. I am not sure if Whiteside et al. did such an exercise. Anyway, the test of congruence would not solve this issue because by adding only characters that support one hypothesis, we are biasing the results of such a test.</p>
<p>To sum up, there is nothing wrong with proposing some hypotheses about character homology between different taxa that can be tested in future papers that will include a test of congruence. Lack of such a test makes the whole argumentation weaker in Whiteside et al., but not unacceptable, as the manuscript might suggest. My advice is to step down from such strong statements like &quot;methodological flaw&quot; and &quot;empirical problems&quot; and replace them with &quot;limitations&quot;, which I think better describes the situation.</p>
