<title>Abstract</title><p>The combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) and endocrine therapy has revolutionized treatment for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) metastatic breast cancer. However, the emergence of resistance in most patients often leads to treatment discontinuation with no consensus on effective second-line therapies. The therapeutic benefits of maintaining CDK4/6i or incorporating CDK2 inhibitors (CDK2i) after disease progression remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that sustained CDK4/6i therapy, either alone or combined with CDK2i, significantly suppresses the growth of drug-resistant HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer. Continued CDK4/6i treatment induces a non-canonical pathway for retinoblastoma protein (Rb) inactivation via post-translational degradation, resulting in diminished E2F activity and delayed G1 progression. Importantly, our data highlight that CDK2i should be combined with CDK4/6i to effectively suppress CDK2 activity and overcome resistance. We also identify cyclin E overexpression as a key driver of resistance to CDK4/6 and CDK2 inhibition. These findings provide crucial insights into overcoming resistance in HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer, supporting the continued use of CDK4/6i and the strategic incorporation of CDK2i to improve therapeutic outcomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metastatic breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). A key dysregulation in breast cancer involves the overactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Active CDK4/6 phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a crucial regulator that prevents cell-cycle initiation by sequestering E2F transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Rb phosphorylation results in the release of E2F, thereby promoting CDK2 activation and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Understanding this mechanism has driven significant advancements in therapeutic strategies, particularly for hormone receptor-positive (HR<sup>+</sup>)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2<sup>-</sup>) breast cancer, which constitutes approximately 70% of breast cancer cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The current standard first-line treatment for HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> metastatic breast cancer is a combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) and endocrine therapy (ET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Although this approach has markedly improved patient outcomes, resistance remains a significant challenge, with about 30% of patients developing resistance within two years and most eventually facing resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Upon disease progression, CDK4/6i therapy is often discontinued, leading to aggressive tumor growth with effective second-line therapies lacking.</p>
<p>While continuing ET after disease progression has demonstrated clinical benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), the efficacy of maintaining CDK4/6i treatment post-progression is still elusive. Ongoing clinical trials investigate the potential advantages of continuing CDK4/6i therapy using FDA-approved inhibitors such as palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib in patients experiencing disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The MAINTAIN phase 2 trial suggests that continuing ribociclib with alternative ET post-progression on a palbociclib and ET regimen can significantly extend progression-free survival (PFS) compared to switching to ET alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Similarly, interim results from the postMONARCH phase 3 study indicate that adding abemaciclib to ET improved PFS compared to ET alone in patients who have progressed on ET and a prior CDK4/6i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Conversely, the PACE and PALMIRA clinical trials did not observe a significant PFS benefit when maintaining palbociclib combined with new ET after disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>Like CDK4/6, CDK2 also phosphorylates Rb before the G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The relevance of CDK2 activation in CDK4/6i-resistant tumors highlights the potential of targeting CDK2 to overcome CDK4/6i resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Several clinical trials are exploring CDK2 inhibitors (CDK2i) in patients who have progressed on CDK4/6i-based treatments as monotherapies or in combination with CDK4/6i. Determining the optimal strategy for incorporating CDK2i in treating HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer that has developed drug resistance remains a critical question.</p>
<p>This study emphasizes that continued CDK4/6i treatment in drug-resistant cells leads to incomplete and ineffective retinoblastoma (Rb) inactivation, significantly slowing G1-phase progression. Additionally, it highlights the therapeutic potential of combining CDK2i with CDK4/6i as an effective second-line treatment strategy. Notably, the research underscores the critical role of cyclin E overexpression in driving resistance to the CDK2i and CDK4/6i combination, providing insights into overcoming such resistance in future cancer treatments.</p>

<title>Maintaining CDK4/6i treatment attenuates the growth of drug-resistant cells by extending G1-phase progression</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of maintaining CDK4/6i treatment on drug-resistant cells, we used three HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, and CAMA-1) and a triple-negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). These cells were chronically exposed to palbociclib for over a month to induce drug resistance. We confirmed increased half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for palbociclib in drug-resistant cells compared to drug-naïve cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1A</xref>). We either maintained or discontinued CDK4/6i treatment in these drug-resistant cells and evaluated the cumulative proliferation rate over 12 days, along with drug-naïve cells. We found a significantly slower growth rate in drug-resistant cells maintained on CDK4/6i treatment compared to other conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Conversely, drug-resistant cells with discontinued CDK4/6i treatment exhibited similar growth rates to drug-naïve cells. These results suggest that despite the development of drug resistance, maintaining CDK4/6i treatment significantly impedes the growth rate of drug-resistant cells.</p>

<p>We next monitored cell-cycle progression in individual cells to understand how continued CDK4/6i treatment suppresses the growth rate in drug-resistant cells. We employed MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing live-cell sensors for CDK4/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) and CDK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) activities, cell-cycle phases (Cdt1 degron) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), and a nucleus marker (histone 2B) for individual cell tracking. The CDK sensors dynamically shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm based on their phosphorylation by the relevant kinase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> top). The Cdt1 degron is degraded during the S phase, enabling visualization of the G1/S and S/G2 transitions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> bottom). After mitosis, proliferating drug-naïve cells continuously activated CDK4/6, followed by gradual increase in CDK2 activity to enter the S phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, CDK4/6i-resistant cells activated CDK2 with low CDK4/6 activity to enter the S phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). When evaluating thousands of cells, approximately 98% of drug-naïve cells continuously activated both CDK4/6 and CDK2 to enter the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1C</xref>). While drug withdrawal led to CDK4/6 reactivation, over 90% of drug-resistant cells continued to proliferate regardless of the presence of CDK4/6i (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1E</xref>). To monitor cell-cycle dynamics, we aligned cells by the end of mitosis (cytokinesis) and classified them based on CDK2 activity into proliferating and quiescent cells. Without CDK4/6i treatment, drug-resistant cells exhibited similar kinetics of CDK4/6 and CDK2 activities, as well as S-phase entry, compared to drug-naïve cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2A–S2D</xref>). However, with continued CDK4/6i treatment, drug-resistant cells showed low CDK4/6 activity, slower activation kinetics of CDK2, and increased heterogeneity in the timing of S-phase entry, as indicated by Cdt1 degradation, compared to other conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2F</xref>). These results indicate that continuous treatment with CDK4/6i leads to marked deceleration and irregularity in cell-cycle progression of drug-resistant cells, thus suppressing their growth rates.</p>
<p>CDK6 overexpression has emerged as a key driver of CDK4/6i resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). In line with these findings, we observed elevated CDK6 levels in CDK4/6i-resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3A</xref>). To investigate the role of CDK6 in modulating CDK4/6 activity under resistance, we established CDK6 knockout (KO) MCF-7 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 and induced resistance to CDK4/6i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3B</xref>). Despite CDK6 depletion, CDK4/6 activity remained comparable between wild-type and CDK6-KO cells under continuous CDK4/6i treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3C–S3F</xref>). These results suggest a potential non-canonical role for CDK6 in mediating resistance to CDK4/6i therapy.</p>
<p>To assess the impact of continuous CDK4/6i treatment on cell-cycle progression, we measured the intermitotic time and the duration of each cell-cycle phase in MCF-7 and CAMA-1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The intermitotic time was comparable between drug-naïve and drug-resistant cells without ongoing CDK4/6i treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). However, in drug-resistant cells that were continuously treated with CDK4/6i, the intermitotic time was extended by 30–50% compared to other conditions. Moreover, continuous CDK4/6i treatment prolonged the G1 phase by approximately 200–300% without affecting the duration of the S and G2/M phases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C–2E</xref>). Our data indicate that maintaining CDK4/6i treatment in drug-resistant cells significantly extends the G1 phase, thereby decelerating the overall growth rate.</p>

<title>Maintaining CDK4/6i treatment triggers an ineffective Rb inactivation pathway</title>
<p>We sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the extended G1 phase and slow CDK2 activation kinetics in drug-resistant cells under continuous CDK4/6i treatment. Our recent studies demonstrated that CDK4/6 inhibition initially halts cell proliferation through Rb activation but ultimately reduces Rb protein due to decreased stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). We confirmed a decrease in both total and phosphorylated Rb levels in drug-resistant cells continuously treated with CDK4/6i compared to drug-naïve cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Discontinuation of CDK4/6i treatment restored both total and phosphorylated Rb levels. Importantly, the reduction of Rb protein in drug-resistant cells was incomplete, as evidenced by comparisons to Rb-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4A</xref>). Furthermore, Rb KO in drug-resistant cells reversed the extended G1 duration and the slowed activation kinetics of CDK2 without affecting CDK4/6 activity, even in the presence of continuous CDK4/6i treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4C</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that maintaining CDK4/6i treatment in drug-resistant cells induces a non-canonical pathway for Rb inactivation via its degradation. This passive Rb inactivation may result in ineffective E2F and CDK2 activation kinetics, delaying G1-phase progression.</p>

<p>To test our hypothesis, we monitored CDK2 activity to isolate proliferating cells and aligned them with corresponding fixed-cell data by the end of mitosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5A</xref>). Using 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, we measured the kinetics of entry into the S phase. Almost all drug-naïve and -resistant cells without CDK4/6i treatment transitioned sharply into the S-phase about 6 hr after mitosis and completed DNA replication within 12 hr (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, 3D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5B</xref>). However, drug-resistant cells under continued CDK4/6i treatment exhibited a dramatically slowed G1/S transition and increased variability in entering the S-phase compared to other conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5C</xref>). We also confirmed no S-phase entry in quiescent cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Using immunostaining and mRNA FISH, we evaluated the kinetics of Rb phosphorylation and E2F activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Cells were classified based on Rb phosphorylation at Serine 807/811, which is a previously characterized marker for hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). The expression levels of E2F1 mRNA are regulated via autoregulatory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), thereby serving as a proxy of E2F transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). In the absence of CDK4/6i, both drug-naïve and -resistant cells fully induced Rb phosphorylation before S-phase entry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Conversely, in the presence of CDK4/6i, drug-resistant cells initiated CDK2 activation and G1 progression without Rb phosphorylation, showing low and slow E2F mRNA accumulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H and I</xref>). Moreover, when comparing CDK2 activity with levels of E2F1 mRNA or EdU incorporation, drug-resistant cells under continuous CDK4/6i treatment required higher CDK2 activity to achieve the same levels of E2F1 mRNA and to trigger the G1/S transition compared to other conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J, 3K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5E</xref>). The observed reduction in E2F1 mRNA during the S phase could be attributed to the suppression of atypical E2Fs, E2F7 and E2F8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). These findings suggest that maintaining CDK4/6i treatment in drug-resistant cells induces inefficient Rb inactivation, characterized by reduced and delayed E2F activation kinetics. Such alterations substantially increase the duration of the G1 phase and the variability in the G1/S transition.</p>

<title>Maintenance of CDK4/6i suppresses the growth of drug-resistant tumors</title>
<p>We investigated the therapeutic benefits of maintaining CDK4/6i treatment after the onset of drug resistance in vivo. To this end, we established an MCF-7 xenograft model by orthotopically inoculating drug-naïve MCF-7 cells into the mammary fat pad of immunodeficient mice. When the tumor reached a volume of 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, we treated mice with palbociclib and monitored tumor growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). After an initial phase of tumor stasis and regression lasting for varying durations, we observed the emergence of drug resistance, evidenced by tumor regrowth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Once tumors regrew to volumes between 145 and 155 mm<sup>3</sup>, the mice were randomly assigned to secondary treatment groups: discontinuation of drug treatment, continuation with palbociclib, or switching to ribociclib or abemaciclib. Consistent with our in vitro results, maintaining CDK4/6i significantly attenuated overall tumor growth compared to discontinuing drug treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C–E</xref>). Analysis of Rb expression in tumor tissues post-secondary treatment revealed the restoration of total Rb expression exclusively in the drug-discontinued condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). These data underscore the therapeutic advantages of maintaining CDK4/6i to attenuate the growth of drug-resistant tumors.</p>

<title>Addition of ET augments the efficacy of CDK4/6i maintenance</title>
<p>Our recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of c-Myc in amplifying E2F activity and fostering CDK4/6i resistance following alternative Rb inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Using a doxycycline-inducible system, we found that induction of c-Myc significantly facilitated the growth of drug-resistant cells under ongoing CDK4/6i treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure S6A</xref>). Furthermore, despite similar low CDK4/6 activity, c-Myc induction facilitated cell-cycle progression in CDK4/6i-resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure S6B–D</xref>). These data demonstrated that c-Myc promotes CDK4/6i resistance by facilitating cell-cycle progression in drug-resistant cells.</p>
<p>Given the estrogen responsiveness of c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), we hypothesized that the continued addition of ET could further suppress the growth of CDK4/6i-resistant cells by downregulating c-Myc expression. We employed the estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of maintaining the combination of CDK4/6i and ET. While MCF-7 cells exhibited primary resistance to fulvestrant, CAMA-1 and T47D cells displayed sensitivity to this drug (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We used these MCF-7 and CAMA-1 cells to examine whether primary ET resistance contributes to the benefit of maintaining CDK4/6i and ET in drug-resistant cells. These cells were chronically exposed to palbociclib and fulvestrant for over two months to induce drug resistance. Subsequently, these resistant cell lines were subjected to continuous treatment with either palbociclib or fulvestrant alone or in combination, and their cumulative proliferation rate was monitored. We observed a significantly slower growth rate in drug-resistant cells continuously exposed to the combination therapy compared to other treatment conditions, not only in CAMA-1 but also in MCF-7 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">S7A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">S7B</xref>). Continued treatment with fulvestrant, either alone or combined with palbociclib, reduced c-Myc levels compared to palbociclib maintenance alone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Our data indicate distinct resistance mechanisms between CDK4/6i and ET. Therefore, regardless of primary resistance to ET, the continued addition of ET to CDK4/6i treatment is beneficial in suppressing the growth of drug-resistant cells by inhibiting c-Myc.</p>

<p>To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the attenuation of growth resulting from continued treatment with the drug combination, we assessed CDK4/6 and CDK2 activities along with cell-cycle progression (Cdt1 degron) in drug-resistant MCF-7 cells. Cells were continuously treated with palbociclib or fulvestrant alone or in combination. By classifying cells into proliferation and quiescence based on CDK2 activation, we found over 80% of cells were proliferating in all conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D, 5E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">S7C</xref>). Furthermore, we observed reactivation of CDK4/6 in drug-resistant cells continuously treated with fulvestrant alone. However, when we monitored cell-cycle dynamics by aligning cells to mitosis, the maintenance of the drug combination caused slower CDK2 activation kinetics and greater heterogeneity in S-phase entry, as indicated by Cdt1 degradation, compared to single-drug treatment conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F, 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">S7D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">S7E</xref>). By analyzing each cell-cycle duration, we observed a significant increase in intermitotic time and G1-phase duration, while S- or G2-phase durations remained relatively unchanged (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H, 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">S7F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">S7G</xref>). This emphasizes the role of the drug combination in altering cell-cycle kinetics in the G1 phase. Our findings showed the therapeutic benefits of maintaining a combination of CDK4/6i and ET in attenuating the growth of drug-resistant cells.</p>

<title>The benefit of using CDK2i in combination with CDK4/6i as a second-line therapy</title>
<p>We next evaluated the potential of integrating CDK2i as a second-line treatment by employing the CDK2i INX-315. We examined the growth of palbociclib/fulvestrant-resistant MCF-7 and CAMA-1 cells under various treatment regimens: treatment discontinuation, fulvestrant alone, fulvestrant + palbociclib, fulvestrant + INX-315, and fulvestrant + palbociclib + INX-315. Continued treatment with the combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant significantly reduced the growth rate of drug-resistant cells compared to treatment discontinuation, fulvestrant alone, and fulvestrant + INX-315 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A–6C</xref>). Notably, the triple combination most effectively suppressed the growth of these drug-resistant cells. We next investigated cell-cycle dynamics by assessing CDK activities and Cdt1-degron levels a week after drug treatment. Consistent with earlier results, CDK4/6 reactivation was observed following palbociclib withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure S8A–S8D</xref>). Furthermore, we found CDK2 reactivation even in the presence of INX-315 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8D</xref>). The triple-drug combination caused the most extended intermitotic time and G1-phase duration without affecting the S and G2 phases (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8E</xref>). Analysis of cells synchronized by mitosis revealed that the triple-drug combination most prominently delayed CDK2 activation kinetics (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). To further understand the effects of second-line therapies on the transcriptome landscape of CDK4/6i/ET-resistant cells, we performed RNA sequencing 20 days after drug treatment. In line with our previous observations, continued palbociclib and fulvestrant more effectively suppressed E2F-target gene expression compared to the INX-315 and fulvestrant combination, with the triple-drug regimen showing the most robust inhibition of both E2F and Myc target gene expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8F</xref>). These data suggest that despite CDK2 reactivation, the addition of CDK2i to CDK4/6i and ET maintenance therapy further attenuates E2F activity and CDK2 activation kinetics, thereby inhibiting the growth rate of drug-resistant cells.</p>

<title>Role of cyclin E/A in CDK2 reactivation under combined CDK4/6 and CDK2 inhibition</title>
<p>A recent study identifies the cyclin A-CDK complex as a key driver of rapid adaptation to CDK2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). To investigate the mechanism of CDK2 reactivation during CDK2i treatment, we explored the role of the CDK2 activators, cyclin E and A. Using a doxycycline-inducible system, we induced the overexpression of cyclin E1 or A2 in drug-naïve MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Figure S9A</xref>). While treatment with INX-315 (100 nM–1 µM) initially inhibited CDK2 activity, CDK2 reactivation occurred within 1–2 hr after drug treatment, regardless of cyclin E1 or A2 overexpression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">S9B–S9D</xref>). The combination of CDK2i and CDK4/6i blocked this rapid CDK2 reactivation, but the overexpression of cyclin E1 or A2 hindered complete suppression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">S9E–S9G</xref>). These findings suggest that CDK4/6 inhibition is necessary for effectively suppressing CDK2 activity by CDK2i, and that cyclin E1 and A2 overexpression may contribute to CDK2 reactivation.</p>

<p>We next examined the impact of cyclin E and A overexpression in the development of persister cells, which are implicated in residual tumor growth and eventual resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). We used drug-naïve MCF-7 cells expressing live-cell sensors for CDK2, CDK4/6, and anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (Geminin degron) activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). APC/C is a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase typically inactivated near the G1/S transition, leading to Geminin-degron accumulation. Treatment with CDK4/6i and CDK2i induced near-complete cell-cycle arrest within 24 hr (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). However, approximately 10% of cells developed a persister phenotype through CDK2 reactivation. Overexpression of cyclin E1 increased the percentage of persister cells, while cyclin A2 had no obvious impact (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS10">S10</xref>). Further kinetic analysis revealed that cyclin E1 overexpression accelerated CDK2 reactivation and APC/C inactivation in persister cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). These findings indicate that cyclin E1, but not cyclin A2, facilitates CDK2 reactivation and persister development, promoting resistance to the CDK4/6i and CDK2i combination.</p>
<p>Since cyclin A is a substrate of APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), the lack of effect from cyclin A2 induction could be due to its degradation by APC/C. Thus, this degradation may reduce cyclin A to insufficient levels, preventing its impact on persister cell development. To further evaluate the impact of cyclin E and A overexpression on resistance development, we exposed palbociclib-resistant MCF-7 cells to the combination of palbociclib and INX-315. Both cyclin E1 and A2 overexpression significantly accelerated the development of resistance to the drug combination, with cyclin E1 having a more significant effect than cyclin A2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). These results indicate that although CDK2 activity is targeted by CDK2i, the overexpression of cyclin E and A promotes resistance to the combination of CDK4/6i and CDK2i. Due to cyclin A degradation by APC/C in quiescent cells, cyclin E may play a more critical role in driving resistance to this drug combination.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The combination therapy of CDK4/6i and ET has revolutionized the treatment landscape for HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Despite the initial efficacy of these treatments, the inevitable emergence of drug resistance remains a significant challenge, mainly as there is no established second-line therapy. Our findings demonstrate that sustained CDK4/6i treatment in drug-resistant cells results in ineffective Rb inactivation, significantly delaying E2F activation and G1-phase progression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). Concurrent ET further suppresses G1 progression by inhibiting c-Myc-mediated E2F amplification, intensifying the blockade of cell-cycle progression. Additionally, we observed that CDK2i is only effective at suppressing CDK2 activity and the growth of drug-resistant cells when combined with CDK4/6i. Notably, overexpression of cyclin E and A fosters resistance to this drug combination. These insights suggest the advantages of continuing CDK4/6i therapy beyond disease progression, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, it aligns with previous reports highlighting the importance of dual targeting CDK4/6 and CDK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data indicate that maintaining both CDK4/6i and ET synergistically decelerates cell-cycle progression in drug-resistant cells by further delaying CDK2 activation kinetics and the G1/S transition without affecting the S and G2 phases. This dual effect stems from CDK4/6i causing suboptimal Rb inactivation while ET suppresses the global transcription amplifier c-Myc, collectively leading to diminished E2F transcriptional activity. As a result, this reduced E2F activity lowers the expression of critical cell-cycle genes, such as cyclin E and A, extending the time needed for CDK2 activation. Given that CDK2 plays an essential role in initiating and advancing DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>), its delayed activation significantly prolongs the G1/S transition. Moreover, CDK2 activation also contributes to Rb phosphorylation and inactivation. High CDK2 activity is required to phosphorylate Rb, and CDK2-mediated Rb phosphorylation is tightly coupled with DNA replication timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Thus, upon Rb phosphorylation by CDK2 at the G1/S transition, drug-resistant cells may effectively proceed through the cell cycle even under continued CDK4/6i treatment.</p>
<p>Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of sustained CDK4/6i therapy predominantly use PFS as the primary endpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). However, our findings suggest that drug-resistant tumors continue to proliferate despite CDK4/6i maintenance. Consequently, maintaining CDK4/6i appears to slow tumor growth rather than completely arrest it. This underscores the need for clinical trials to consider overall survival and tumor progression rates as more appropriate endpoints for assessing the true benefits of sustained CDK4/6i therapy. Furthermore, the distinct polypharmacology profiles among CDK4/6i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>), with ribociclib being the most specific and abemaciclib the least, may explain the varying therapeutic outcomes observed among these inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>).</p>
<p>Maintaining CDK4/6i treatment post-disease progression may be particularly beneficial for approximately 70% of patients who do not acquire new genetic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). However, it is important to recognize that resistance to CDK4/6i often arises from mutations in genes associated with mitogenic or hormone-signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). These include mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>ESR1</italic>, <italic>FGFR1</italic>–<italic>3</italic>, and <italic>HER2</italic>, which have been linked to increased c-Myc expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Additionally, recent studies have identified <italic>FAT1</italic> mutations as a driver of CDK4/6i resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). These resistance mutations may reduce the efficacy of maintaining CDK4/6i and ET therapy. Moreover, approximately 4.7% of HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer patients exhibit <italic>Rb</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>), making CDK4/6i treatment unlikely to be effective, thus making its continuation unadvisable in these cases.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study offers significant mechanistic insights that support the continued use of CDK4/6i and ET in patients with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer after disease progression. Our findings also emphasize the necessity of combining CDK2i with CDK4/6i to enhance therapeutic efficacy, reinforcing conclusions from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Moreover, we underscore the critical role of cyclin E overexpression in driving resistance to the combination of CDK4/6i and CDK2i, which may inform future strategies to overcome therapeutic resistance in breast cancer.</p>

Briefly, using Gibson assembly, constructs including H2B-iRFP670-p2a-mCerulean-Cdt1 (a.a.1–100) (Addgene, 223965), H2B-iRFP670-p2a-mCerulean-Geminin (a.a.1–110) (Addgene, 223959), and DHB (a.a.995–1087)-mVenus-p2a-mCherry-Rb (a.a.886–928) (Addgene, 126679) were inserted into pLenti-IRES vectors encoded with puromycin, blasticidin, or neomycin selection markers. Doxycycline-inducible c-Myc, cyclin E1, and cyclin A2 were created by inserting PCR products into the lentiviral pCW57.1 vector (Addgene, 50661) following NheI and BamHI restriction digestion. Stable cell lines were established through lentiviral transduction. For virus production, lentiviral plasmids encoding the genes of interest were transfected into HEK-293T cells along with packaging plasmids pMDLg/pRRE (Addgene, 12251), pRSV-Rev (Addgene, 12253), and envelope plasmid pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene, 8454), using polyethyleneimine transfection reagent in Opti-MEM (Thermo Scientific, 31985070).

<p>To induce resistance to CDK4/6i, breast cancer cells were subjected to chronic exposure to palbociclib (1 µM) or a combination of palbociclib (1 µM) and fulvestrant (500 nM) over 1–2 months. The cell culture media containing the drugs was refreshed every 2–3 days throughout the experimental period.

<title>Live-cell reporters</title>
<p>Histone 2B (H2B) tagged with iRFP670 was used to define nuclear regions and track individual cells. Live-cell reporters were employed to monitor CDK activity and cell-cycle transitions. Fluorescently tagged Cdt1 degron (a.a.1–100) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) was used to detect cell-cycle phase transitions. Fluorescent geminin protein was used to track S-phase entry. CDK4/6 and CDK2 kinase translocation reporters (KTRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) were used to monitor the phosphorylation state of specific substrates. The CDK4/6 substrate was the C-terminal domain of Rb (a.a.886–928), and the CDK2 substrate was DNA helicase B (a.a.994–1087). Fluorescence translocation between the nucleus and cytoplasm provided a quantitative readout of CDK activity. The cytoplasmic/nuclear fluorescence intensity ratio was used to represent kinase activity. Since the CDK4/6 KTR contains a degenerate CDK2 substrate motif from the CDK2 KTR and thus detects activities measured by the CDK2 sensor during the S and G2 phases, we applied a correction factor derived from a linear regression based on the CDK2 sensor, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). CDK4/6 activity was adjusted by subtracting a calculated fraction of the CDK2 KTR signal, as follows:</p>
<p>MCF-7: CDK4/6 activity = CDK4/6 reporter activity – (0.41 × CDK2 reporter activity)</p>
<p>MDA-MB-231: CDK4/6 activity = CDK4/6 reporter activity – (0.35 × CDK2 reporter activity)</p>

<p>Cells were seeded in glass-bottom 96 well plates (Cellvis, P96-1.5H-N) at least one night prior to each experiment. The percentage of S-phase cells was determined using EdU incorporation.

Permeabilization was then performed using 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, T8787) in PBS (PBS-T) for 15 minutes. Visualization of EdU incorporation was achieved using a click reaction in 2 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, C1297), 20 mg/ml sodium ascorbate (Sigma-Aldrich, A4034), and 3 µM Alexa Fluor Dye 647 picolyl azide in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, T6066) (pH 8.3) for 15 minutes. For immunofluorescence staining, cells were incubated in blocking buffer (10% FBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01% NaN<sub>3</sub> in PBS) for 1 hour. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for Phospho-Rb (Cell Signaling Technology, 8516), Rb (BD Biosciences, 554136), and c-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology, 5605), diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer, overnight at 4°C. The following day, Alexa Fluor 488- or 568-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied at 1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. DNA was stained with Hoechst 33342 dye (Thermo Scientific, 62249) (10 mg/ml), diluted in PBS (1:10000) for 15 minutes at room temperature prior to imaging. Cells were washed with PBS between each step and stored in PBS prior to imaging. For mRNA FISH, the ViewRNA ISH Cell Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, QVC0001) was used along with a probe targeting E2F1 (Thermo Scientific, VA1-12108-VC). Following live-cell imaging, cell fixation and permeabilization were conducted as described in the immunofluorescence section. The fluorescent protein signal was then photobleached using 3 % H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, H1009) with 20 mM HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, 320331) in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature.

<p>Cells were seeded and maintained at 30–80% confluency during experiments in 96-well glass-like polymer bottom plates (Cellvis, P96-1.5P). Phenol red-free media was used to minimize background fluorescence. Cell imaging was conducted using a microscope mounted onto an inverted Eclipse Ti-2 body (Nikon), and multichannel fluorescent images were captured with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion camera. Acquisition used either a 10× (Nikon CFI Plan Apo Lambda, 0.45 NA, no binning) or a 20× (Nikon CFI Plan Apo Lambda, 0.75 NA, 2×2 binning) objective. Live-cell imaging was performed in a 37 °C humidified chamber with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, capturing 3 sites per well at 12-min intervals. 9 (10× objective) or 32 (20× objective) sites per well were collected for fixed-cell imaging. Total light exposure time was kept under 500 ms for each time point. mRNA FISH images were acquired with 1.5 µm z-stack intervals. Whole tumor cross-sections were imaged using an Axio Observer 7 microscope with Apotome 2 (Zeiss) and a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4 camera, using a 10× (Zeiss Plan-Apochromat, 0.45 NA, no binning) objective at a 1.5 µm z-stack interval.</p>

<title>Image processing and analysis</title>
<p>Live- and fixed-cell image processing and analysis were conducted using custom MATLAB scripts (MathWorks, R2021a). To reduce biased light illumination, flat-field correction was applied. In fixed-cell analysis, nuclei were segmented based on the Hoechst signal according to a threshold of histogram curvature. For live-cell analysis, cell segmentation was performed using the H2B-iRFP670 signal and a Laplacian of Gaussian blob detector. A marker-based watershed algorithm was then employed to separate neighboring nuclei. To correct for background signal, the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile of pixels in the remaining background was subtracted after masking nuclei. In the analysis transitioning from live to fixed cells, cells were initially segmented and then aligned between the fixed cell data and the last frame of the live-cell experiment. A deflection-bridging algorithm was utilized to track cell movement over time during live-cell acquisition. Mitotic events were identified by isolating two daughter cell nuclei adjacent to a prior nucleus, with H2B signals approximately 45–55% of the mother cell’s nuclear signal. In live-cell analysis, cytoplasmic signal determination involved measuring the median pixel intensity within a ring positioned between 0.65–3.25 µm outside the nuclear perimeter. Cells with overlapping cytoplasmic rings were excluded from the final analysis. For RNA FISH, the whole cell area was estimated by creating a mask including and extending 50 µm from the nucleus. Overlapping cells with adjacent cell nuclei were excluded from the analysis. Raw images underwent a top hat filter with a 4 µm radius circular kernel to create the FISH puncta mask. Tissue image analysis was performed using ImageJ software.</p>

After trypsinization, cells were rinsed with PBS then lysed in suspension using 600 µL of the supplied lysis buffer supplemented with 14.3M β-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad, 1610710). After homogenization and addition of 360 µL 100% ethanol (Fisher Scientific, BP28184), RNA was isolated and collected by centrifugation before final elution with DNase/RNase-free distilled water (Thermo Scientific, 10977-015). RNA sequencing was then performed by Azenta Life Sciences. Statistical analysis of count matrix was performed using DESeq2 R package (v1.44.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). Log2 fold-change shrinkage was applied to improve effect size estimates using the ‘apeglm’ method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Gene sets were obtained from the Molecular Signatures Database (Hallmark, C2, C5) utilizing the msigdbr package (version 7.5.1). Heatmaps were created with the ComplexHeatmap package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted with hallmark annotations from MSigDB using the R package clusterProfiler (v4.12.6). Ranked gene lists were input with a maximum gene set size of 500, and significance was evaluated through 10,000 permutations. Terms were considered significantly enriched if their <italic>P</italic> value was below 0.05 and their False Discovery Rate (FDR) was under 0.25.</p>

<title>Animal</title>
<p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with NIH guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Six-week-old female Foxn1-/-J:NU mice (The Jackson Laboratory, 007850) were housed in a barrier facility with ad libitum access to food and water on a 12-hour light-dark cycle. Mice were regularly monitored in compliance with institutional guidelines for ethical endpoints.</p>

<title>Xenograft experiments</title>
<p>Female J:NU mice were anesthetized with ketamine (45 mg/kg) plus xylazine (5 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Mice were then orthotopically injected with drug-naïve MCF-7 cells (8×10<sup>6</sup> cells per mouse) suspended in 1:1 ratio of PBS and Geltrex LDEV-Free Reduced Growth Factor Basement Membrane Matrix (Thermo Scientific, A1413201) directly into the abdominal mammary fat pad. Tumors were measured biweekly using a digital caliper (volume = [width<sup>2</sup> × length] × 1/2). Once tumor volumes reached ~100 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice began daily treatment with palbociclib (50 mg/kg) by oral gavage. When tumors reached between 145–155 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were randomly assigned to 1) discontinuation of treatment, 2) daily palbociclib (50 mg/kg) treatment, 3) daily abemaciclib (50 mg/kg) treatment, or 4) daily ribociclib (200 mg/kg) treatment for 32 days. Upon treatment completion, mice were anesthetized by ketamine/xylazine, then perfused with 1% formaldehyde before tumor extraction.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>After vascular perfusion with 1% formaldehyde in PBS, tumors were fixed in 1% formaldehyde at 4°C for 1 hour. Following fixation, tissues were washed with PBS-T and incubated in 30% sucrose at 4°C overnight. Samples were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Fisher Scientific, 23-730-571), frozen at −80°C, and sectioned into 40 µm sections onto Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, 12-550-15). Tumor sections were rehydrated in PBS-T and subsequently blocked with 5% normal goat serum (The Jackson Laboratories, 005-000-121) in PBS-T for 1 hour at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with recombinant anti-Rb monoclonal antibody (Abcam, ab181616) in 5% normal goat serum in PBS-T at 1:1000 overnight at room temperature. Following washing with PBS-T, the sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (Thermo Scientific, A32731) at 1:500 in PBS-T at room temperature for 4 hours. DNA was counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, D9542) 1:500 in PBS-T for 10 minutes, then mounted with Fluoromount-G (Invitrogen, 00-4958-02) for image acquisition.</p>

<title>Statistics and Reproducibility</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10.2.0. For parametric data, we utilized unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc tests, as appropriate, to assess pairwise differences. When comparing two-paired groups, paired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests were employed. Statistical test results are reported in the figure legends and detailed in Supplementary Table 1. All experiments were conducted in at least two independent experiments.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>fundamental</bold> insights into overcoming resistance in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer by demonstrating that sustained CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, either alone or in combination with CDK2 inhibitors, significantly suppresses the growth of drug-resistant cancer cells. The findings are supported by <bold>compelling</bold> evidence from both in vitro cell line experiments and in vivo mouse models, highlighting the therapeutic potential of maintaining CDK4/6 inhibitors beyond disease progression. Additionally, the identification of cyclin E overexpression as a key driver of resistance offers a target that will be of value for future therapeutic strategies, potentially improving outcomes for patients with advanced breast cancer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors identified that</p>
<p>
(1) CDK4/6i treatment attenuates the growth of drug-resistant cells by prolongation of the G1 phase;</p>
<p>
(2) CDK4/6i treatment results in an ineffective Rb inactivation pathway and suppresses the growth of drug-resistant tumors;</p>
<p>
(3) Addition of endocrine therapy augments the efficacy of CDK4/6i maintenance;</p>
<p>
(4) Addition of CDK2i with CDK4/6 treatment as second-line treatment can suppress the growth of resistant cell;</p>
<p>
(5) The role of cyclin E as a key driver of resistance to CDK4/6 and CDK2 inhibition.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>To prove their complicated proposal, the authors employed orchestration of several kinds of live cell markers, timed in situ hybridization, IF and Immunoblotting. The authors strongly recognize the resistance of CDK4/6 + ET therapy and demonstrated how to overcome it.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study elucidated the mechanism underlying drug resistance induced by CDK4/6i as a single agent and proposed a novel and efficacious second-line therapeutic strategy. It highlighted the potential of combining CDK2i with CDK4/6i for the treatment of HR+/HER2- breast cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study demonstrated that CDK4/6 induces drug resistance by impairing Rb activation, which results in diminished E2F activity and a delay in G1 phase progression. It suggests that the synergistic use of CDK2i and CDK4/6i may represent a promising second-line treatment approach. Addressing critical clinical challenges, this study holds substantial practical implications.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Drug-resistant cell lines: Was a drug concentration gradient treatment employed to establish drug-resistant cell lines? If affirmative, this methodology should be detailed in the materials and methods section.</p>
<p>(2) What rationale informed the selection of MCF-7 cells for the generation of CDK6 knockout cell lines? Supplementary Figure 3. A indicates that CDK6 expression levels in MCF-7 cells are not notably elevated.</p>
<p>(3) For each experiment, particularly those involving mice, the author must specify the number of individuals utilized and the number of replicates conducted, as detailed in the materials and methods section.</p>
<p>(4) Could this treatment approach be extended to triple-negative breast cancer?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, Armand and colleagues investigate the potential of continuing CDK4/6 inhibitors or combining them with CDK2 inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer that has developed resistance to initial therapy. Utilizing cellular and animal models, the research examines whether maintaining CDK4/6 inhibition or adding CDK2 inhibitors can effectively control tumor growth after resistance has set in. The key findings from the study indicate that the sustained use of CDK4/6 inhibitors can slow down the proliferation of cancer cells that have become resistant, and the combination of CDK2 inhibitors with CDK4/6 inhibitors can further enhance the suppression of tumor growth. Additionally, the study identifies that high levels of Cyclin E play a significant role in resistance to the combined therapy. These results suggest that continuing CDK4/6 inhibitors along with the strategic use of CDK2 inhibitors could be an effective strategy to overcome treatment resistance in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary: </p>
<p>
In this manuscript, the authors identified that</p>
<p>(1) CDK4/6i treatment attenuates the growth of drug-resistant cells by prolongation of the G1 phase;</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study elucidated the mechanism underlying drug resistance induced by CDK4/6i as a single agent and proposed a novel and efficacious second-line therapeutic strategy. It highlighted the potential of combining CDK2i with CDK4/6i for the treatment of HR+/HER2- breast cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study demonstrated that CDK4/6 induces drug resistance by impairing Rb activation, which results in diminished E2F activity and a delay in G1 phase progression. It suggests that the synergistic use of CDK2i and CDK4/6i may represent a promising second-line treatment approach. Addressing critical clinical challenges, this study holds substantial practical implications.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Drug-resistant cell lines: Was a drug concentration gradient treatment employed to establish drug-resistant cell lines? If affirmative, this methodology should be detailed in the materials and methods section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer for raising this important question. In the revised manuscript, we will update the methods section to include a detailed description of how the drug-resistant cell lines were developed. Specifically, we will clarify whether a drug concentration gradient treatment was employed and provide step-by-step details to ensure reproducibility.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) What rationale informed the selection of MCF-7 cells for the generation of CDK6 knockout cell lines? Supplementary Figure 3. A indicates that CDK6 expression levels in MCF-7 cells are not notably elevated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful question about the rationale for selecting MCF-7 cells to generate CDK6 knockout cell lines. This choice was guided by prior studies highlighting the significant role of CDK6 in mediating resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors (1-4). Moreover, we observed a 4.6-fold increase in CDK6 expression in CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant MCF-7 cells compared to their drug-naïve counterparts (Supplementary Figure 3A). While we did not detect notable differences in CDK4/6 activity between wild-type and CDK6 knockout cells under CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, these findings point to a potential non-canonical function of CDK6 in conferring resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) For each experiment, particularly those involving mice, the author must specify the number of individuals utilized and the number of replicates conducted, as detailed in the materials and methods section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. In the revised manuscript, we will provide explicit details regarding the number of replicates and mice used for each experiment. This information will be included in the materials and methods section, figure legends, and relevant text to ensure transparency and clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Could this treatment approach be extended to triple-negative breast cancer?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s inquiry about extending our findings to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Based on our data presented in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 2, which include the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231, we anticipate that the benefits of maintaining CDK4/6 inhibitors could indeed be applied to TNBC with an intact Rb/E2F pathway.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, Armand and colleagues investigate the potential of continuing CDK4/6 inhibitors or combining them with CDK2 inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer that has developed resistance to initial therapy. Utilizing cellular and animal models, the research examines whether maintaining CDK4/6 inhibition or adding CDK2 inhibitors can effectively control tumor growth after resistance has set in. The key findings from the study indicate that the sustained use of CDK4/6 inhibitors can slow down the proliferation of cancer cells that have become resistant, and the combination of CDK2 inhibitors with CDK4/6 inhibitors can further enhance the suppression of tumor growth. Additionally, the study identifies that high levels of Cyclin E play a significant role in resistance to the combined therapy. These results suggest that continuing CDK4/6 inhibitors along with the strategic use of CDK2 inhibitors could be an effective strategy to overcome treatment resistance in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Continuous CDK4/6 Inhibitor Treatment Significantly Suppresses the Growth of Drug-Resistant HR+ Breast Cancer: The study demonstrates that the continued use of CDK4/6 inhibitors, even after disease progression, can significantly inhibit the growth of drug-resistant breast cancer.</p>
<p>(2) Potential of Combined Use of CDK2 Inhibitors with CDK4/6 Inhibitors: The research highlights the potential of combining CDK2 inhibitors with CDK4/6 inhibitors to effectively suppress CDK2 activity and overcome drug resistance.</p>
<p>(3) Discovery of Cyclin E Overexpression as a Key Driver: The study identifies overexpression of cyclin E as a key driver of resistance to the combination of CDK4/6 and CDK2 inhibitors, providing insights for future cancer treatments.</p>
<p>(4) Consistency of In Vitro and In Vivo Experimental Results: The study obtained supportive results from both in vitro cell experiments and in vivo tumor models, enhancing the reliability of the research.</p>
<p>(5) Validation with Multiple Cell Lines: The research utilized multiple HR+/HER2- breast cancer cell lines (such as MCF-7, T47D, CAMA-1) and triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (such as MDA-MB-231), validating the broad applicability of the results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript presents intriguing findings on the sustained use of CDK4/6 inhibitors and the potential incorporation of CDK2 inhibitors in breast cancer treatment. However, I would appreciate a more detailed discussion of how these findings could be translated into clinical practice, particularly regarding the management of patients with drug-resistant breast cancer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate this opportunity to further contextualize our findings within clinical practice. In the revised manuscript, we will expand the discussion to explore how the identified mechanisms can inform patient stratification and therapeutic combinations. We will also highlight the potential of integrating CDK2 inhibitors with continued CDK4/6 inhibition as a second-line strategy for HR+ breast cancer patients who exhibit resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors, leveraging insights from current and ongoing clinical trials. This will provide a clearer framework for translating our findings into actionable therapeutic strategies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While the emergence of resistance is acknowledged, the manuscript could benefit from a deeper exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance development. A more thorough understanding of how CDK2 inhibitors may overcome this resistance would be valuable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this insightful suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we will delve deeper into the molecular mechanisms by which CDK2 inhibitors counteract resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy. We will emphasize the role of the non-canonical Rb inactivation pathway and upregulated transcriptional activity in reactivating CDK2, which contribute to resistance under CDK4/6 inhibition. Furthermore, we will discuss how dual inhibition of CDK4/6 and CDK2 effectively suppresses this resistance pathway, offering a mechanistic rationale for the therapeutic potential of this combination strategy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The manuscript supports the continued use of CDK4/6 inhibitors, but it lacks a discussion on the long-term efficacy and safety of this approach. Additional studies or data to support the safety profile of prolonged CDK4/6 inhibitor use would strengthen the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer for raising this important point. To address this, we will incorporate a discussion on the long-term safety and efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitor maintenance therapy. Drawing from clinical trials and retrospective analyses (5-9), we will highlight data supporting the tolerability of prolonged CDK4/6i treatment, particularly in combination with endocrine therapy. We will also discuss its clinical benefits over chemotherapy or endocrine therapy alone, contextualizing these findings with our proposed therapeutic approach (6,8-11).</p>
