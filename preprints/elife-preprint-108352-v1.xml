<abstract><p>Neuronal activity is driven by the complex interplay between various membrane currents, often located in distinct domains of the spatially extended dendritic tree. How the effect of these currents propagates to the soma and contributes to neuronal output under in vivo conditions is not fully understood. Here, we extend the currentscape method to measure and visualise the contributions of individual membrane currents to the somatic response in spatially extended biophysical model neurons. Our approach relies on the recursive decomposition of the axial current flowing between neighbouring compartments in proportion to the underlying membrane currents. We apply this method to visualise the inputs driving hippocampal place cell activity. Our method provides a compact and intuitive description of the various dendritic events underlying subthreshold activity, spiking, or burst firing. By contrasting the dendritic input currents preceding spiking and bursting, we demonstrate that both could occur at highly variable input levels to proximal dendrites (basal and oblique), and that strong distal inputs facilitates, rather than controls, the generation of complex spike bursts. Our method opens a novel window onto single-neuron computations that will help to design better models and to interpret the results of in vivo imaging experiments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Characterizing the relationship between the dynamics of individual ion channels and the neuronal activity <italic>in vivo</italic> is crucial for mechanistic understanding of biological computation, to develop more realistic circuit models of brain activity, and to identify potential therapeutic targets.</p>
<p>Ion channels have been extensively studied both in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hille, 2001</xref>) and also in their interactions with other channels to explain the emergence of diverse neuronal activity patterns observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Koch, 1999</xref>). A dominant view emerged that neurons form non-linear dynamical systems, with state variables corresponding to membrane potential, gate openings, and second messenger concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Izhikevich, 2007</xref>). Studying the impact of particular ion channels on the neuronal response in such a dynamical system under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions is hindered by two major obstacles: First, synaptic inputs to neurons arrive in complex temporal patterns often engaging a combination of ion channels that interact with each other in potentially highly nonlinear, state-dependent manner. Measuring channel-contributions under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>) or by pharmacological manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>) may not engage the ion channels in the same way as during the high-conductance state <italic>in vivo</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Destexhe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ujfalussy et al., 2018</xref>). In response to these challenges, the currentscape technique has recently been developed to provide an intuitive and simple way to visualize the high-dimensional current dynamics during naturalistic neural activity in one-compartmental biophysical neuron models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alonso and Marder, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, synaptic inputs target the spatially extended dendritic tree of the neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) where electrical and biochemical compartmentalization renders state variables local (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Stuart and Häusser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Branco and Häusser, 2010</xref>). With local state variables, the recruitment of ion channels can vary greatly between different dendritic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Häusser and Mel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Poirazi et al., 2003</xref>), which makes it especially difficult to understand or visualise current-interactions in neurons with a large dendritic tree under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. There are three simple ways to adapt the currentscape technique to neurons with realistic morphology: First, one could visualize the current dynamics in each compartment separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guet-McCreight and Skinner, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Linaro et al., 2022</xref>). This strategy could work for few compartmental models but is clearly not feasible beyond a critical size and does not provide an intuitive description of the current propagation in neurons. Second, it is possible to sum up all membrane currents throughout the dendritic tree (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-D</xref>). However, this approach can not reveal the contribution of currents to the output of the cell, as even large-amplitude distal dendritic currents often fail to propagate to the soma (white arrowhead in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Third, one could focus on a single compartment and study the input currents locally, for example at the somatic action potential generation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Linaro et al., 2022</xref>). However, most input currents can be currents flowing axially as a consequence of the activation of synaptic or intrinsic currents in other compartments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Here, we develop a computational technique, the <italic>extended currentscape</italic>, which is able to trace the axial currents back to their origin: the location and type of the membrane currents that generated them.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the ability of the extended currentscape method to provide an intuitive visualisation of input integration in neuron models with complex morphology under <italic>in vivo</italic>-like conditions, we apply it to study the generation of complex spike bursts (CSB) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (PCs). In PCs CSBs are associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes in the apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larkum et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grienberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Magó et al., 2021</xref>) and are believed to play a critical role in learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Payeur et al., 2019</xref>) and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grienberger and Magee, 2022</xref>). However, the precise input conditions necessary to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes in these cells remained controversial: On the one hand, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes can be readily initiated by distal dendritic, but not by somatic current injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Golding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>), the timing of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes coincides with inputs to the most distal branches during theta oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>) and blocking entorhinal inputs decreases the probability of CSB firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, CSBs can be triggered by somatic current injection in most PCs at random spatial locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">2017</xref>) and distal tuft dendrites are variably recruited during putative CSB events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">O’Hare et al., 2025</xref>) <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In this paper, we first describe the <italic>extended currentscape</italic> technique that generalizes the standard currentscape visualization method to neurons with spatially extended dendritic trees. Next, we show that the extended currentscape accurately and intuitively captures the origin and type of dendritic events driving place cell-like activity in a biophysical model CA1 PC. We further show that the membrane potential throughout the entire dendritic arbor has low-dimensional dynamics dominated by global activity even when the cell is driven by a few dendritic branches receiving strong input. Next, we analyze CSBs in the model using the extended currentscape method and show that they can be started with highly variable initiation dynamics. By contrasting CSBs and isolated single spikes we reveal that although distal inputs facilitate the generation of CSBs, there is no need for exceptionally strong tuft inputs nor Ca<sup>2+</sup> hotspots for their initiation.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>The extended currentscape method</title>
<p>We start by describing the extended currentscape visualization method which aims to capture how membrane currents in a distal <italic>reference</italic> (e.g., dendritic) compartment influence the activity of a <italic>target</italic> (e.g., soma) compartment. Our method relies on the equivalent circuit model of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Koch and Segev, 2000</xref>) and requires measuring the membrane and axial currents throughout the dendritic tree of a neuron (in every node of the circuit) to partition the axial currents flowing into the target compartment by the underlying membrane currents. Since this kind of data is not available in real neurons, we used a multicompartmental biophysical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jarsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ujfalussy and Makara, 2020</xref>) to develop and test our method. With the advent of novel single-neuron voltage imaging techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brooks et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Park et al., 2025</xref>), our method could potentially also be adapted to data from real neurons in the near future.</p>
<p>The intuition behind our method is that distal currents can directly influence the membrane potential of the target compartment only if there is a continuous flow of axial current from reference to target. In order to characterise the relationship between the axial currents and the membrane currents we start with Kirchhoff’s current law, stating that the sum of all currents flowing into or out of a node in an electrical circuit must be zero. Applying it to a small section of a neuronal process, we have:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="667243v1_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Here <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="667243v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the capacitive current, <italic>I</italic><sup>mem</sup> denotes the membrane currents, including all synaptic and intrinsic currents, <italic>I</italic> <sup>ax</sup> denotes the axial currents and <italic>I</italic><sub>inj</sub> is the current injected into the cell through a stimulation electrode. <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. (1)</xref> states that if the axial current between the reference and the target compartment is negative (i.e., it is an outward current for the reference compartment as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) then the sum of the inward currents must be larger than the sum of the remaining outward currents in the reference compartment. In this case, we postulate that this excess inward current is responsible for the outward flowing axial current, and we partition the axial current in the proportion of the inward currents in the reference compartment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In contrast, when the direction of the axial current between the reference and the target reverses, we partition it proportionally to the outward currents in the reference compartment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Note that the sign of the membrane currents can also reverse when the membrane potential crosses its reversal potential. In our simulations this often happened with the leak current, which had a reversal potential <italic>E</italic><sub>leak</sub> = −66 mV, falling between the reversal potential of excitatory (<italic>E</italic><sub>NMDA</sub> = 0 mV) and inhibitory inputs <italic>E</italic><sub>GABA,</sub> <sub>slow</sub> = −80 mV. This way, the same current type can contribute to inward or outward axial currents at different time points or in different compartments.</p>

Next, the partitioned axial currents are added to the membrane currents in the intermediate target (compartment 2; E).

<graphic xlink:href="667243v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>In a multicompartmental model, the partitioning of the axial currents can be applied recursively starting from the most distal compartment and proceeding towards the target iteratively once all axial currents arriving at the intermediate targets from the more distal branches had been partitioned (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>). In the next step, the partitioned axial currents are added to the membrane currents in the intermediate target (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) before partitioning the axial current flowing towards the next target (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-G</xref>).</p>
<p>The topology of the model is represented by an acyclic graph, where each node is a compartment, the directed edges represent the flow of the axial current and the root node of the graph is the target (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). The nodes where the direction of the axial current reverses are collision points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). Since the propagation of the axial current is blocked at the collision points, the membrane currents of the more distal nodes do not have a direct influence on the activity at the target. Therefore, to make the algorithm computationally more efficient, in every time step we truncate the graph at the collision points and apply the partitioning recursion only to the truncated graph (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J-K</xref>).</p>
<p>After partitioning the axial currents of the target compartment we can use the standard currentscape plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alonso and Marder, 2019</xref>) to visualize the contribution of distal membrane currents to the membrane potential dynamics of the target. The entire process must be repeated when a new target compartment (e.g. a dendritic branch) is selected. Throughout the paper, we will use two different variants of the partitioning algorithm: we will either partition axial currents by the <italic>type</italic> of membrane currents (e.g., current flowing through Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> channels) or by the dendritic <italic>region</italic> of the reference compartments (i.e., basal, oblique or tuft dendrites). However, alternative variants of the partitioning algorithm can also be applied (see Methods). Next, we will apply the extended currentscape technique to analyze input integration and the mechanism of burst firing in hippocampal place cells.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Currentscape analysis of dendritic integration CSBs in the CA1 pyramidal neuron model</title>
<p>To study the synaptic input conditions that lead to burst firing under <italic>in vivo</italic>-like conditions we extended a previous CA1 PC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jarsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ujfalussy and Makara, 2020</xref>) with a calcium and a potassium channel. Experimental data indicates that R-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels are mainly responsible for both burst firing and for dendritic plateau potentials in this cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Magee and Carruth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Metz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>). We used a novel Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel model that displayed similar activation and inactivation kinetics to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents recorded in the apical dendrites in CA1 PCs (Fig. S1A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Magee and Johnston 1995</xref>) and distributed it uniformly across all apical dendrites (trunk, obliques, and tuft) of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Magee and Johnston, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Poirazi et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Various potassium channels contribute to the repolarization after Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes, including Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Golding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">King et al., 2015</xref>), but the precise biophysical characterization of these channels is currently lacking. To model their overall effect, we used a high voltage activated potassium current with relatively slow kinetics (Fig. S1B) in the apical dendrites.</p>
<p>Equipped with these channels, our model was able to fire a short burst of 3-4 action potentials with decreasing amplitude riding on a depolarizing wave upon dendritic current injection (Fig. S1C). These somatic bursts were accompanied by dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes, so we refer to them as complex spike bursts or CSBs. In agreement with the experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Golding et al., 1999</xref>) the model had a lower threshold for initiating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes in the apical trunk than in the soma (Fig. S1D). Under <italic>in vivo</italic>-like synaptic input conditions (see below and Methods), dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes could also be evoked by somatic current injection (Fig. S1E), as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al. (2015)</xref>.</p>
<p>To illustrate the ability of the extended currentscape method to provide a compact and intuitive summary of dendritic events in the model, we first tested it under simple, spatially and temporally restricted input conditions. We first used the model without dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels and stimulated an increasing number of synapses in a single oblique branch <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). We found that the somatic response became superlinear beyond a branch-specific threshold, with a sigmoid superlinearity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>), reminiscent of experimental findings with 2-photon glutamate uncaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>). Partitioning the somatic currents by the current type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, middle) indicated that before stimulation, the inward currents were mainly leak currents (dark green), with some contribution from the somatic and axonal Na<sup>+</sup>-currents (red). Partitioning the somatic currents by the region of their origin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, bottom) showed, that current flew from the axon and basal dendrites towards the soma and further towards the apical dendrites, which was more hyperpolarized than the soma due to the larger density of K<sup>+</sup> channels in the apical trunk. Upon stimulation, the inward currents show first a fast, AMPA-mediated and later a slower NMDA-mediated component (yellow and olive in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, middle), both originating from the stratum radiatum (levander in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, bottom). At n=20 inputs a Na<sup>+</sup>-spike that remains local to the stimulated branch is responsible for the spikelet appearing in the somatic response (pink in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, right). During these events, the inward current arrived transiently from the apical dendrites (see shades of levander in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, bottom), and left the soma towards the basal dendrites (pink in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). At the end of the events the NMDA contribution disappeared from the soma as the axial current reversed to its original direction, flowing from basal towards apical dendrites.</p>

<p>Next we repeated the same stimulation protocol after including the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels to the apical dendrites of the neuron. The addition of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels rendered the shape of the superlinearity more step-like, as in single-photon uncaging or synaptic stimulation experiments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wei et al. (2001)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ariav et al. (2003)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cai et al. (2004)</xref>). Under these conditions the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes did not lead to somatic action potential firing but remained localised to the stimulated branch. The currentscape analysis revealed that although Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels first activated at near-threshold responses (at n=10 inputs, orange in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), they were greatly boosted by local Na<sup>+</sup>-spikes (at n=15 or 20 inputs; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). During these events NMDA-mediated- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-currents contributied similarly to the somatic depolarization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Taken together, these simulations confirmed that extended currentscapes provide a rich form of visualization of the sequence of dendritic events leading to somatic responses under relatively simple input conditions.

<title>CSBs in the CA1 pyramidal neuron model</title>
<p>To create <italic>in vivo</italic>-like input condition we simulated the activity of 2000 excitatory and 200 inhibitory presynaptic neurons during the traversal of a 2 m long linear track as described previously (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ujfalussy and Makara, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim et al., 2023</xref>)). Briefly, each excitatory neuron had a ∼ 20 cm long place field and neurons showed theta modulation and displayed phase precession. Place fields were distributed uniformly across the linear track. Inhibitory neurons showed theta modulation but were spatially untuned. The majority of the 2000 excitatory synapses were placed randomly on the dendritic tree (avoiding the soma and the proximal apical trunk; light green in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), while the remaining 240 inputs active in the middle of the track were organized into 12 functional synaptic clusters where presynaptic neurons with similar place fields (dark green circles in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) innervated neighbouring dendritic locations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and had larger synaptic conductance (see Methods). These synaptic clusters provided strong drive to the cell in the middle of the track by activating a few dendritic branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ujfalussy and Makara, 2020</xref>). Half of the inhibitory cells targeted the soma and the proximal apical trunk, the other half was randomly distributed throughout the dendritic tree (blue circles in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>First, we analyzed the somatic and dendritic membrane potential response of the model. The neuron responded to synaptic stimulation with a train of action potentials in the middle of the simulated track consisting of a variable number of single spikes and CSBs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). During CSBs the distal apical dendrites showed a membrane potential response similar to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes observed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, bottom trace). In a set of 16 simulations with variable cluster placement and synaptic input patterns, the membrane potential of the entire neuron was highly correlated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), with a single factor explaining ∼70% of the total variance across the dendritic branches (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). The weights associated with this first factor uniformly covered the entire dendritic tree (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, see also Fig. S2) indicating the dominance of the global modulation of the dendritic membrane potential mainly due to back-propagating action potentials (bAPs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Spruston et al. 1995</xref>). In contrast, the weights associated with the second principal component increased consistently along the apical dendrite, demonstrating a greater level of independence from the soma in distal tuft branches (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>When we inspected the dendritic membrane potential during CSBs we found that in our model CSBs are not preceded by large, global Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes in the tuft. Instead, dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes typically started asynchronously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">O’Hare et al., 2025</xref>), often after a local Na<sup>+</sup>-spike or a back-propagating action potential (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Park et al. 2025</xref>). Although in distal dendrites we could occasionally observe local Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes not coupled to somatic activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), local dendritic membrane potential peaks closely followed somatic APs in the majority of cases (&gt;90%; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). This indicates that dendritic events tend to follow somatic APs even when the neuron is mainly driven by strong, functionally clustered synaptic inputs to a few dendritic branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ujfalussy and Makara, 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Currentscape analysis of place field dynamics</title>
<p>To better understand how individual dendritic events influenced the somatic response of the cell, we calculated the extended currentscape of the simulated neuron in the time window around its activity in the place field (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Partitioning the somatic axial currents by current type revealed that before entering the place field, the cell was driven mainly by synaptic currents (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ba-c</xref>). Voltage dependent Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels only activated occasionally and briefly, and their effect often remained localized, not being able to efficiently propagate to the soma (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ba-c</xref>). When the effect of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup>-spikes reached the soma, they either appeared as small spikelets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ba</xref>) or as fast rise in the somatic membrane potential (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ca</xref>). Partitioning the somatic axial currents by their origin indicated that the soma was driven mainly by the basal dendrites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Bd</xref>). Performing similar partitioning of the axial currents in the tuft by their type (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Be</xref>) and by their origin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Bf</xref>) revealed that the tuft region was driven by local synaptic currents and was largely decoupled from the rest of the cell.</p>
<p>Within the place field, somatic action potentials were evoked directly by synaptic inputs (first AP in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) or triggered by Na<sup>+</sup>-spikes propagating from nearby basal dendritic branches (second AP in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). At the beginning of the action potential, a brief current originating from the axon can be observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Cd</xref>), indicating that APs are initiated in the axon. In our model, active backpropagation of the APs is limited to the apical trunk, since the Na<sup>+</sup>-channels in the higher order dendritic branches have a higher voltage threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ujfalussy and Makara, 2020</xref>). Indeed, back-propagating APs do not recruit local, dendritic-type Na<sup>+</sup>-channels in the tuft (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ce</xref>). In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-currents are recruited in the apical dendrites and contribute to the spike after depolarization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ca-f</xref>).</p>
<p>The model neuron also fired complex spike bursts (CSBs) within its place field (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). When we magnified the current dynamics around the second CSB, we found that it was preceded by strong Ca<sup>2+</sup>-currents and dendritic Na<sup>+</sup>-spikes that eventually reached the soma and elicited a somatic AP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Da-d</xref>). In this case, the cell was driven by a mixture of synaptic and intrinsic inputs from the apical dendrites already before the CSB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Dd</xref>). The first AP propagated back to the dendrites and amplified the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Na<sup>+</sup>-currents (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Db-d</xref>). These intrinsic currents, originating from the apical dendrite, became the dominant inward drive in the soma and drove the cell to fire further APs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Db-d</xref>) until the slow potassium current in the dendrites terminated the burst (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5De-f</xref>). Taken together, the extended currentscape plots provide compact and intuitive visualization of the complex current dynamics underlying neuronal activity during spatially and temporally structured synaptic inputs. Next, we studied the conditions leading to CSB firing in our model.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Input conditions for complex spike burst generation</title>
<p>To identify the input conditions leading to complex spike burst firing in our model, we focused on 41 CSB events from 16 simulations with different cluster location and input patterns, and contrasted them with 58 isolated action potentials (iAP; no other APs within 30 ms). First, we focussed on the membrane potential dynamics in long (&gt;60 <italic>µ</italic>m) terminal branches in the basal, oblique or tuft region. We found that during CSBs the membrane potential was highly variable across events, but was typically substantially depolarized for ∼40 ms in both tuft and oblique dendrites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), indicating the presence of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes in these branches. The large depolarizations associated with local Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes were absent in basal dendrites or during iAPs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, the depolarization started earlier in the tuft than in the oblique branches, where it reached its maximum level only after the second AP in the burst. During CSBs most tuft branches participated in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spike firing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), whereas the prevalence of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes remained low during isolated spikes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). In the tuft branches, but not in obliques, both the mean membrane potential and the probability of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes diverged between CSBs and iAPs already ∼10 ms before the start of the event (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B,D</xref>). Note that the synapse density, the ion channel mechanisms and the input statistics are identical for tuft and oblique branches, suggesting that the morphology of the cell could be the primary factor underlying the increased excitability of the tuft for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes.</p>
<p>To more directly test the involvement of tuft dendrites in CSB generation, we compared the location of active synaptic clusters during CSBs and iAPs. We found that the average cluster distance from the soma was significantly larger during CSBs than iAPs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). These observations confirm earlier results suggesting the special importance of tuft branches in controlling CSBs in CA1 neurons(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grienberger and Magee, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Park et al., 2025</xref>).</p>
<p>To further analyze the synaptic and dendritic events leading to CSB firing, we turned to our extended currentscape method and calculated the average currentscapes for both CSBs and iAPs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>). The somatic currentscapes by current type and current origin revealed the strong Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Na<sup>+</sup>-currents driving burst firing in the soma during CSBs and being responsible for the relative depolarization after iAPs. However, to our surprise, there was almost no difference between CSBs and iAPs until the end of the first spike neither in the magnitude, nor in the origin or the composition of the somatic currents.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="667243v1_fig7.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Since we observed a large variability in the membrane potential, we speculated that averaging across many events could potentially conceal important differences between iAPs and CSBs. Therefore, we calculated the total magnitude of each current type in the soma for each event in the 8 ms period before the first AP of iAPs or CSBs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). We found a large variability in the currents underlying both iAPs and CSBs with the distributions entirely overlapping between the two types of events. We got similar results when analysing the origin of the axial currents in the soma (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). This indicates that it is impossible to distinguish CSBs and iAPs before the first AP from the somatic state of the neuron, and suggests that the soma can not control burst firing.</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed currents in the apical dendrites from the distal trunk region and from the apical tuft. Although we found some small, but significant alterations in the current types in both the trunk (not shown) and the tuft (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>), the largest differences were in the origin of the currents driving these regions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>): before CSBs the tuft did not receive inward (excitatory) currents from proximal regions but was driven solely by local excitatory intrinsic and synaptic currents. In contrast, outward currents from the tuft propagated towards the trunk and obliques significantly more during CSBs than during iAPs. However, we still observed a substantial variability between the events indicating that both iAPs and CSBs could be highly diverse. We were wondering whether this diversity could be captured by a few dominant factors along which iAPs and CSBs were segregated.</p>
<p>In order to test this idea, we applied factor analysis to the dataset containing the magnitude of 42 current types in the 3 different dendritic domains (soma, trunk, tuft; see Methods) before the first spike of the event. The factor analysis revealed that the data indeed was low-dimensional: The first two factors together explained almost 80% of the total variance with additional factors providing negligible contribution (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). When we projected the data into the space defined by the first two factors, the datapoints corresponding to CSBs and iAPs tended to occupy different regions of the state space (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>) indicating that these factors capture characteristic differences between these event types.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="667243v1_fig8.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, we checked how different current types contributed to these first two factors. We found that the outward currents (GABA and K<sup>+</sup>) in the tuft region had the largest positive loadings, while the distal inward currents (NMDA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents) had the largest negative loadings to the first factor (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>; note that inward currents are negative). Thus, strong excitatory or inhibitory tuft inputs both increase the first factor. We thus interpreted the first factor as capturing the strength of the inputs to the tuft region. Similarly, the second factor had the strongest positive loadings on inhibitory, and negative weights on excitatory currents in the trunk region (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). Interestingly, proximal NMDA and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-current had opposite effects (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>): somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-current, originating from the apical dendrites, increased both factors, while somatic NMDA currents, indicating dominant excitation from basal branches, decreased them. We interpret the second factor as capturing the strength of inputs to the oblique/trunk region of the cell.</p>
<p>This analysis revealed that most of the variability between iAPs is confined to a single dimension with low tuft input and a varying degree of oblique or basal excitation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B,D-E</xref>). Moreover, iAPs occur only exceptionally at high tuft input levels (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). In contrast, CSBs occupy a greater fraction of the state space with varying tuft and trunk input, but generally avoiding the lowest levels of tuft excitation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B, G-I</xref>). Note that occasionally highly similar currents preceded iAPs and CSBs and which of these occurred could depend on later synaptic inputs or subtle differences in the state of intrinsic conductances (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B, D-I</xref>; see also Fig. S3).</p>
<p>To further elucidate the role of the inputs targeting different dendritic domains in evoking spikes or CSBs, we selectively decreased the input rates at basal, oblique or tuft branches, simulating optogenetic inhibition experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, we randomly selected 300 input synapses targeting either of these domains, decreased their input rates by 75%, and measured the changes in postsynaptic spiking and CSB firing. We found that decreasing the tuft input had the strongest effect in reducing both the CSBs and the spike rate of the cell (Fig. S4A). This effect was not explained by the more clustered location of the inhibited synapses in the tuft (Fig. S4A), further emphasizing the crucial role of the tuft in controlling the excitability of the cell. In agreement with the experimental results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>), the tuft inhibition caused a larger reduction in the CSBs rates (≈ 20% of the control) than in the spike rates (≈ 35% of the control; Fig. S4). Nevertheless, inhibition of basal or oblique synapses also decreased the number of CSBs, which confirms that complex spike bursts are not exclusively triggered by distal inputs in our model.</p>
<p>Taken together, these analyzes demonstrated that, in agreement with previous experimental results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grienberger and Magee, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Park et al., 2025</xref>) strong distal inputs facilitate the generation of CSBs. However, in our model there was no need for exceptionally high input synchrony at the tuft synapses neither for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-hotspots in the dendrites to evoke CSBs. Instead, CSBs could be evoked under a large variety of synaptic and intrinsic current conditions by input to apical dendrites even at relatively weaker tuft excitation.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In this paper, we first introduced the extended currentscape technique to quantify and visualize the effect of dendritic events on the somatic response of a biophysical model neuron. Next, we illustrated the extended currentscape method in a standard experiment probing dendritic integration <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our method could compactly and intuitively capture the sequence of dendritic events leading to a superlinear somatic response. After validating the model using spatio-temporally restricted stimuli, we turned towards <italic>in vivo</italic>-like inputs and examined dendritic activity during simulated place field dynamics. We found that although correlated activity dominated the dendritic membrane potential dynamics of the model, the extended currentscape method could identify various dendritic events underlying somatic spikelets, action potentials, and complex spike bursts. Next, we contrasted the somatic and dendritic current dynamics preceding iAPs and CSBs. Although we found a large diversity of current contributions before the two event types, the distribution of the currents were surprisingly similar before CSBs and iAPs. Finally, we applied factor analysis to the somatic and dendritic currents and showed that the large variability is dominated by two factors, corresponding to inputs to the proxial and distal apical dendrites. We found that CSBs and iAPs could occur at variable oblique and basal input levels, but strong distal inputs facilitated the generation of CSBs.</p>

<p>Our analysis is based on the extended currentscape method to identify the type and origin of membrane currents that drive the activity of any compartment in a neuron with spatially extended morphology. Our technique relies on simulating the neuron using a standard biophysical modeling software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hines and Carnevale, 1997</xref>) and measuring the membrane currents and the membrane potential in each model segment at every timestep. We used Kirchhoff’s current law to partition the axial currents between neighbouring pairs of segments proportionally to the composition of the incoming or the outgoing membrane currents, depending on the direction of the axial current. We applied this partitioning algorithm recursively starting from the tip of the dendrites (leaf nodes) and proceeding towards the target segment.</p>
<p>In this paper, we partitioned the axial currents either by the channel type or by the dendritic region of the associated membrane currents. Partitioning the axial currents by the type of the membrane currents generating them provides a compact and intuitive summary of the sequence of events mediated by different intrinsic and synaptic conductances during various neuronal activity patterns, illustrated here for the case of theta activity, spiking and bursting in place cells. In contrast, partitioning the axial currents by their dendritic origin reveals the relative contribution of the different dendritic domains to driving the neural response at any given time. Here we distinguished only a few major regions (axon, soma, basal, oblique and tuft dendrites) within the cell, but different divisions, with more fine grain compartmentalization or combination with partitioning by current type, would be an interesting future application of the method.</p>
<p>Previous approaches dissecting the contribution of individual ion channel types to the somatic response of the model relied on targeted perturbation of the available biophysical mechanisms both in real neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wei et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ariav et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>) and in biophysical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gasparini et al., 2004</xref>; Gómez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">González et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Behabadi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grienberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Goetz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim et al., 2023</xref>). However, interpreting the result of these perturbations is hampered by the potential interactions between various biophysical mechanisms, especially under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Losonczy and Magee (2006)</xref> found that blocking dendritic Na<sup>+</sup>-spikes inhibited both the fast and the slow components of the superlinear somatic response. They posited that the supralinear input-output function critically depends on the facilitation of NMDA spikes by local dendritic Na<sup>+</sup>spikes. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Smith et al. (2013)</xref> found the blocking NMDA receptors greatly reduced the number of local dendritic fast spikes in layer 2/3 PCs, suggesting a reciprocal interaction between NMDA– and Na<sup>+</sup>–spikes. Here we propose an alternative approach that does not require perturbations but calculates the contribution of ion channel types directly from the recorded axial and membrane currents, albeit currently only in biophysical models. Importantly, our method works equally well under a wide variety of input conditions, including stimulation localised to a single dendritic branch or distributed throughout the entire dendritic tree.</p>

<title>Biophysical model / Implications for burst firing</title>
<p>Our biophysical model CA1 neuron is a modified version of the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jarsky et al. (2005)</xref> originally developed to capture the generation and propagation of Na<sup>+</sup> spikes along the apical trunk and later modified to account for the integration of synaptic inputs via Na<sup>+</sup>-, and NMDA-spikes in basal and oblique dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ujfalussy and Makara, 2020</xref>). As Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes in CA1 PCs are primarily mediated by R-type channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>), we added Ca<sup>2+</sup>channels using kinetic scheme taken from (Magee and Johnston, 1995) to model dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>spikes. Our model was able to generate complex spike bursts, with associated dendritic plateau potentials upon current injection or synaptic stimulation into the dendrites. However, this model is not yet able to capture all, potentially important, properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes in CA1 neurons, including their failure to generate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spike upon strong somatic current injection in most cells, the delayed initiation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>spikes, the inhibitory effects of the Na<sup>+</sup>-APs on Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Golding et al., 1999</xref>) and the generation of somatic plateau potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>). Currently we are not aware of any CA1 PC model that would be able to reproduce these experimental observations (see the references in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sáray et al. 2021</xref>) indicating the need for further research revealing the biophysical mechanisms of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>spikes.</p>
<p>Recognizing the incompleteness of our biophysical model, we believe that our simulations still provide several important insights into the generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes under <italic>in vivo</italic>-like conditions. First, it was unclear whether increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel density in the tuft region or special perforant path input patterns were necessary for evoking burst firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grienberger and Magee, 2022</xref>). Our simulations demonstrated that distal tuft branches are especially well suited to promote burst firing even with uniform Ca<sup>2+</sup>channel density and similar input statistics along the apical subtree. This observation suggests that it is the morphology of the cell and the presence of strong inhibitory conductance load on the apical trunk that makes tuft branches more excitable than oblique dendrites.</p>
<p>Second, we observed a high variability between the activation of individual tuft and oblique branches during CSB firing. This observation is reminiscent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data from the distal dendrites showing a variable recruitment of tuft dendrites during place field formation and subsequent traversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">O’Hare et al., 2025</xref>). Our simulations clarified that tuft Ca<sup>2+</sup>-plateaus are not necessarily associated with uniform tuft activation and the high variability between branches can be caused by diversity in the synaptic inputs.</p>
<p>Third, we found a large heterogeneity among CSBs in the input currents preceding the events: while some CSBs were elicited at unusually high tuft currents, many were triggered at lower or intermediate level of distal inputs. This suggests that the presence of distal inputs facilitates rather than controls the emergence of CSBs. This finding explains why it is possible to elicit plateau potentials <italic>in vivo</italic>using somatic current injection during BTSP induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>) where the same stimulus usually fails to evoke Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Golding et al., 1999</xref>) and makes a direct prediction that reduction of CA3 inputs to the oblique or basal dendrites would also decrease CSB rate, BTSP induction and the associated reward zone over-representation similarly to the effect of inhibiting the more distal EC inputs (Fig. S4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grienberger and Magee 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fan et al. 2023</xref>). The facilitatory action of distal tuft inputs on CSBs is reminiscent of the conjunctive bursting mode, where bursts are generated by a synergistic interaction between different input streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larkum et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Naud and Sprekeler, 2018</xref>) and is consistent with the conclusions of the recent study postulating that dendritic plateaus are initiated within the distal regions of stratum radiatum by strong inputs to both distal tuft and radial oblique dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">O’Hare et al., 2025</xref>).</p>
<p>Although we could frequently observe complex spike bursts in our simulations, we did not observe large amplitude (&gt;20 mV) prolonged (&gt; 100 ms), plateau-like depolarization events in the soma with substantially reduced AP amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>) during naturalistic synaptic inputs. However, a response more similar to plateau potentials could be evoked in our model by direct somatic current injection (Fig. S1E). We thus speculate that the generation of plateau potentials might require strong perisomatic excitatory currents. Our preliminary simulations suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels added to the basal dendrites can provide this additional excitation. The biophysical mechanism and the natural synaptic input conditions that lead to CSB versus plateau potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons is a promising subject for future research.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>In order to make the partitioning algorithm self-consistent, we had to also include the capacitive current among the membrane currents in <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. (1)</xref>: It is possible that in a given segment the only inward current may be the capacitive current but the axial current is still outward. The capacitive current acts as a delay line in the membrane equation, representing the indirect effect of currents that were active earlier and have charged the membrane capacitance. In practice, we found that the capacitive current may sometimes have a large contribution to the membrane dynamics (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Ce</xref>) and can thus mask the delayed contribution of various membrane currents. A potential extension of our method would be to also partition the capacitive current, but it is not clear how this could be achieved self-consistently and is beyond the scope of our current paper.</p>
<p>Our partitioning algorithm identifies only the direct contribution of the membrane currents to membrane potential changes in the target compartments, and ignores all indirect effects. This property follows from the presumption that there must be a direct chain of links between cause and effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pearl, 2009</xref>), in particular, there must be a continuous flow of axial current between the membrane current in a distal dendrite and the change it triggers in the target. Thus, our method is blind to indirect effects otherwise known to be present in complex dendritic trees, such as off-the-path inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gidon and Segev, 2012</xref>). Revealing the contribution of such indirect causes under complex synaptic stimulation would require causal perturbation methods that have been proposed in the context of synaptic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bicknell and Häusser, 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Testing the model: electrophysiology or voltage imaging</title>
<p>Experimental testing of the partitioning algorithm presents considerable challenges. Accurate measurements of the contribution of membrane currents to the somatic activity of a neuron require simultaneous measurement of all membrane currents and potentials, which is not feasible with current experimental methods.</p>
<p>Although measuring individual current contributions is not feasible in real neurons, a recent study performed whole-cell recordings in visual cortical neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> and used the systematic change of the input resistance with depolarization to estimate the contribution of intrinsic and synaptic currents to neuronal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al., 2020</xref>). They found that during visual stimulation the intrinsic and synaptic conductances have comparable contribution to the subthreshold membrane potential changes of the cell, with intrinsic channels amplifying the synaptic response. Similar analysis on <italic>in vivo</italic> hippocampal recordings could test whether synaptic and intrinsic conductances amplify or counteract each other <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hoffman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Epsztein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>). However, in the absence of dendritic recordings, this study was unable to identify the spatial origin of synaptic and intrinsic changes within the dendritic tree.</p>
<p>More direct test of current propagation in real neurons would require measuring the membrane and axial currents at multiple spatial locations. As a recent step towards achieving this <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Meszéna et al. (2023)</xref> combined somatic patch-clamp recordings and multichannel extracellular recordings to reconstruct the spatiotemporal distribution of the membrane currents and the membrane potential of a single neuron during AP generation. Alternatively, one could use <italic>in vivo</italic> voltage imaging to monitor the membrane potential of dendrites and the soma simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelfattah et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Park et al., 2025</xref>). From the local membrane potential one can calculate the axial currents after estimating the intracellular resistivity and the dendritic cable diameters. Our method of partitioning the axial current by its origin within the dendritic tree can be applied directly to this kind of data. Therefore, such data could be used to directly test both the behaviour of the biophysical model under <italic>in vivo</italic>-like input conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F-G</xref>) and the large diversity of the origin of the input currents before single spikes and CSBs in CA1 neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<title>CA1 neuron model</title>
<p>We used a modified version of a previously developed CA1 PC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jarsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ujfalussy and Makara, 2020</xref>), maintaining the same ion channel distributions and densities for Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and proximal and distal type K<sup>+</sup> channels as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ujfalussy and Makara (2020)</xref> (Fig. S5).</p>
<p>To capture dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes and somatic CSBs, we added an R-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel to the model. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel kinetics were based on the steady-state activation and inactivation curves fitted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Magee and Johnston (1995)</xref>, with a slight modification to allow for a larger window current (Fig. S1A). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel was expressed in the apical dendritic tree with a uniform distribution and an ion channel density of 0.006 S<italic>/</italic>cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we added a high-voltage activated, slow K<sup>+</sup> channel that was used to simulate the combined effect of multiple K<sup>+</sup> channels including Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels, contributing to the repolarization after the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes. The slow K<sup>+</sup> channel was expressed in the apical dendritic tree with a uniform distribution and an ion channel density of 0.001 S<italic>/</italic>cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The CA1 cell received inputs from 2000 excitatory and 200 inhibitory presynaptic neurons. We simulate the activity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons during the movement of a mouse on a 2-m long circular track with constant velocity of 20 cm/s. Each presynaptic excitatory neuron had a single idealised place field and represented the CA3 inputs received by the postsynaptic CA1 neuron. Excitatory synapses were placed randomly with a uniform distribution on the entire dendritic tree, except 240 inputs, active in the middle of the track, that were selected to form functional synaptic clusters. There were a total of 12 clusters, and each cluster had 20 synapses. Synaptic clusters were placed on the middle of terminal dendritic branches longer than 60 <italic>µ</italic>m with 1 <italic>µ</italic>m distance between the synapses. Inhibitory presynaptic inputs were modulated by theta oscillation but were not spatially tuned. These synapses were divided into two groups with 80 synapses targeting the soma and the apical trunk and the remaining synapses distributed randomly along the entire dendritic tree.</p>
<p>The model included AMPA and NMDA excitation and slow and fast GABA inhibition. Synaptic parameters were kept identical to those described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ujfalussy and Makara (2020)</xref> (see Fig. S6 for kinetic parameters). To induce reliable firing within the neuron’s place field, we increased the AMPA (from <italic>g</italic><sub>max</sub> = 0.6 <italic>nS</italic> to <italic>g</italic><sub>max</sub> = 1 nS) and NMDA (from <italic>g</italic><sub>max</sub> = 0.8 nS to <italic>g</italic><sub>max</sub> = 1.2 nS) conductance associated with the clustered synaptic inputs. Inhibitory synapses had a maximal conductance of <italic>g</italic><sub>max</sub> = 0.2 nS.</p>
<p>We simulated place cell activity for 10 seconds as the hypothetical animal completed a single lap on the track. A total of 16 simulations were run, each with different random configurations of synapse placement and presynaptic input patterns. During each simulation, we recorded the membrane potential (mV), intrinsic (mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) and synaptic currents (nA) of all segments of the neuron (<italic>N</italic><sub>sec</sub> = 161 sections and <italic>N</italic><sub>seg</sub> = 1529 segments in total, including the 2<italic>N</italic><sub>sec</sub> internal segments; see below). This was the raw dataset we used to calculate the currentscapes. We also saved the model connectivity structure between segments together with the axial resistance values (MΩ) to calculate axial currents offline. Finally, we measured the area (<italic>µ</italic>m<sup>2</sup>) of each segment, which is needed during the preprocessing of membrane currents.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Preprocessing</title>
<p>The goal of preprocessing was to convert the raw dataset, saved by NEURON into two tables that we can use to calculate the partitioning of the axial currents. The first table contains the membrane currents for each segment and for each time step. The second table contains the axial currents between the segment pairs.</p>
<p>During the simulation, state variables were computed using NEURON’s built-in multi order variable time-step integration method. For subsequent preprocessing and currentscape calculation, the recorded output vectors were downsampled to 5 kHz.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Preprocessing membrane and synaptic currents</title>
<p>In the NEURON software, neurons are modelled as a series of sections, which represent unbranched lengths of continuous cable, such as dendrites or axon. These sections are connected together to form an acyclic graph, according to the morphology of the neuron. Each section is divided into multiple segments of equal length.</p>
<p>NEURON uses a normalized distance to express locations along a section, where 0 represents the start (closest to the parent section) and 1 represents the distal end. To compute membrane dynamics, NEURON calculates membrane potentials and membrane currents at discrete positions, known as nodes, located at the center of the segments. The nodes are evenly spaced internal points within a section. The number of segments within a section was chosen to ensure accurate description of signal propagation within the cable with reasonable computational efficiency. As a rule of thumb, we found that axial current partitioning is accurate if the magnitude of the membrane currents within the segment is small compared to the magnitude of the axial current, which was on average ≈ 1<italic>/</italic>17 for non-terminal branches in our case.</p>
<p>All segments that belong to the target section were merged for further analysis (that is, the membrane currents of the segments were summed and no axial current was calculated within the target section). The connections between the segments of the target section and its child branches were reassigned to the segment of the merged target.</p>
<p>In addition to the internal nodes, there are external nodes located at the 0 and 1 ends of each section. These external nodes are only used to connect segments, but no membrane mechanisms (synapses or ion channels) are associated with these external nodes (see below).</p>
<p>Each synapse is represented by a conductance-based mechanism that injects current into the postsynaptic compartment when triggered via a NetCon object. Since each NetCon delivers spikes independently, and multiple synapses can target the same segment, synaptic currents (in nA) were summed per segment and per synaptic type (AMPA, NMDA, GABA<sub>fast</sub>, GABA<sub>slow</sub>) to accurately capture the total synaptic input.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency in subsequent calculations, intrinsic currents were converted from units of mA/cm<sup>2</sup> to nA. This was done by multiplying the recorded current by the corresponding segment area (in <italic>µ</italic>m<sup>2</sup>) and applying a scaling factor of 10<italic><sup>−</sup></italic><sup>2</sup>. Finally, intrinsic and synaptic currents were combined into a single data structure, where each row corresponds to a unique segment and current type pair, and each column is a simulation time point.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Preprocessing axial currents</title>
<p>To compute axial currents we first created a list with the adjacent segment pairs between which axial currents will be calculated. Connections between sections (branches) are implemented in NEURON through a pair of external nodes: one at the distal end of the parent section and another at the proximal end of the child section. Although these nodes formally belong to different sections (parent and child), they have identical membrane potential as they represent the same point within the cable, so we merged them to remove the duplicates from our primary dataset.</p>
<p>The axial current between a parent and child segment is computed using Ohm’s law:

<title>Extended Currentscape Calculation</title>
<p>The extended currentscape calculation requires the following inputs: the preprocessed membrane and axial currents across all segments, a specified target segment, and a defined partitioning strategy, such as current type-specific or region-specific partitioning.</p>
<p>The first step of calculating the extended currentscape was to separate positive and negative membrane currents. Certain currents, such as capacitive currents, can be both inward and outward at the same time in different compartments. Without separation, such positive and negative currents would partially cancel each other, reducing the contribution of the current type during the extended currentscape calculation. This effect is even more pronounced when partitioning the axial currents by the origin (see below): Strong positive and negative currents from two different basal branches can cancel each other, largely concealing the basal contribution to the somatic activity. By treating the positive and negative membrane currents independently, we ensured that the outward and inward membrane current components of the target’s axial current are calculated separately.</p>
<p>The core algorithm underlying the extended currentscape calculation is the axial current partitioning algorithm. By default, this algorithm decomposes the axial current of a target compartment into underlying membrane current components. However, alternative variants of the partitioning algorithm can be applied if the membrane current data structure is reindexed and recalculated. In region-specific partitioning, membrane currents are reassigned based on their location within different subcellular regions (for example, axon or dendrite). These different approaches can also be combined in a flexible way to measure e.g., the somatic influence of NMDA channels in a particular dendritic branch. In this study, we demonstrate two such variants: Membrane current type-specific partitioning and a combined partitioning where we distinguished 5 subcellular regions (axon, soma, basal dendrites, trunk+oblique dendrites and tuft dendrites) and 2 current types (synaptic and intrinsic currents). The intrinsic category incorporated all non-synaptic currents, including capacitive and passive currents.</p>
<p>Following preprocessing, including reindexing and recalculation of membrane currents when required by the region-specific partitioning, a directed graph was constructed at each time step. The nodes of the graph represent individual neuronal segments and the directed edges indicate the direction of axial currents flowing between them.</p>
<p>To determine the partitioning order, we performed a depth-first search (DFS) on the directed graph starting from the target segment along each dendritic branch separately. The search proceeds through the directed graph until it encounters collision points, where axial currents reverse direction. At these points, current propagation is blocked, and distal nodes beyond the collision points are excluded from further calculations, as they do not directly influence the target compartment. We create two separate subgraphs from the target segment: one for the inwardly flowing and one for the outward axial currents. The two subgraphs identified by this search define the structures upon which axial current partitioning is performed. Partitioning is calculated independently for the two subgraphs, with the inward (outward) axial graph partitioned according to the inward (outward) membrane currents, respectively.</p>
<p>Partitioning is carried out recursively, beginning from the leaf nodes of the subgraph and progressing toward the target compartment. At each time step, the axial current is partitioned into inward (negative) or outward (positive) membrane current components depending on the direction of the axial current flow. Specifically, for a given time point <italic>t</italic>, the positive or negative membrane currents <italic>I</italic> <sup>m,ref</sup> of the reference compartment are first normalised by their sum. The resulting fractions are multiplied by the magnitude of the axial current <italic>I</italic> <sup>ax</sup> flowing between the reference and target compartment. The contribution of membrane current of type <italic>i</italic> to the axial current can be expressed as:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="667243v1_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The partitioned axial current components <italic>I</italic> <sup>part</sup>(<italic>t</italic>) are then added to the corresponding membrane currents of the parent section according to:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="667243v1_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="667243v1_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is magnitude of the membrane current type <italic>i</italic> measured in the parent segment. This recursive procedure is repeated for each pair of nodes along the subgraph until the target compartment is reached.</p>
<p>The final output of the extended currentscape calculation consists of two data structures, each including the partitioned axial currents of the target compartment: one containing the inward membrane currents and the other containing the outward membrane currents in each time step.</p>

<p>To calculate the average currentscapes in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> we first calculated the percentage of the different current shares of each event and then averaged the percentages across the events.</p>

<title>Factor analysis</title>
<p>Factor analysis in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> was performed using the partitioned somatic, trunk, and tuft current types before the first spike of the CSB or iAP events. Specifically, we averaged the magnitude of the incoming current types in the interval <italic>t</italic> = {−10, −2} before each event. We performed the averaging separately for the positive and negative currents for all types with nonzero variance (e.g., NMDA currents are always inward, so their contribution to outward currents has zero mean and variance). For this analysis, we used the raw current magnitudes instead of the percentages. We performed factor analysis using the FactorAnalysis function using sklearn’s decomposition module.</p>

<title>Simulating optogenetic inhibition</title>
<p>We simulated targeted optogenetic inhibition of different dendritic domains (Fig. S4) by randomly selecting a similar number (E[<italic>n</italic>] = 300) of presynaptic inputs and decreasing their firing rate to 25% of their baseline value. In different experiments, we selected inputs targeting either basal, oblique, or tuft dendrites.</p>

<caption><title>Simulating optogenetic inhibition of inputs different dendritic domains.</title>
<p><bold>A</bold>) The 75% of the input spikes were removed for <italic>N</italic> ≈ 300 randomly selected presynaptic inputs targeting the basal (of the <italic>N</italic><sub>total</sub> ≈ 900 inputs), oblique (<italic>N</italic><sub>total</sub> ≈ 700) or tuft (<italic>N</italic><sub>total</sub> ≈ 400) dendrites. In the <italic>basal clustered</italic> case, the number of synapses in the basal input clusters affected by the inhibition were matched to the number of synapses in tuft input clusters. These manipulations significantly reduced both the average number of output spikes and the complex spike bursts (CSBs) per lap (Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared to control, p &lt; 0.01 in all cases), with the tuft inhibition having the strongest effect on both spikes and CSBs. Moreover, inhibiting the tuft was more specific than that of the oblique of basal domains as it reduced the number of CSBs to a greater extent than the number of spikes. <bold>B</bold>) The number of CSB events per spikes is most strongly reduced by tuft inhibition. <bold>C</bold>) Simulated optogenetic inhibition also reduced the number of spikes outside of CSBs. This effect was strongest for basal dendrites. Symbols show mean across 16 laps, error bars indicate SE.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Fogel &amp; Ujfalussy report an extension of a visualization tool that was originally designed to enable an understanding of detailed biophysical neuron models. Named &quot;extended currentscape&quot;, this new iteration enables visual assessment of individual currents across a neuron's spatially extended dendritic arbor with simultaneous readout of somatic currents and voltage. The overall aim was to permit a visually intuitive understanding for how a model neuron's inputs determine its output. This goal was worthwhile and the authors achieved it. Their manuscript makes two additional contributions of note: (1) a clever algorithmic approach to model the axial propagation of ionic currents (recursively traversing acyclic graph subsections) and (2) interesting, albeit not easily testable, insights into important neurophysiological phenomena such as complex spike generation and place field dynamics. Overall, this study provides a valuable and well-characterized biophysical modeling resource to the neuroscience community.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors significantly extended a previously published open-source biophysical modeling tool. Beyond providing important new capabilities, the potential impact of &quot;extended currentscape&quot; is boosted by its integration with preexisting resources in the field.</p>
<p>The code is well-documented and freely available via GitHub.</p>
<p>The author's clever portioning algorithm to relate dendritic/synaptic currents to somatic yielded multiple intriguing observations regarding when and why CA1 pyramidal neurons fire complex spikes versus single action potentials. This topic carries major implications for how the hippocampus represents and stores information about an animal's environment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While extended currentscape is clearly a valuable contribution to the neuroscience community, this reviewer would argue that it is framed in a way that oversells its capabilities. The Abstract, Introduction, Results, and Methods all contain phrases implying that extended currentscape infers dendritic/synaptic currents contributing to somatic output., i.e. backwards inference of unknown inputs from a known output. This is not the case; inputs are simulated and then propagated through the model neuron using a clever partitioning algorithm that essentially traverses a biologically undirected graph structure by treating it like a time series of tiny directed graphs. This is an impressive solution, but it does not infer a neuron's input structure.</p>
<p>Because a directed acyclic graph architecture is shown in Figure 2, it is unintuitive that the authors can infer bidirectional current flow, e.g. Figure 3 showing current flowing from basal dendrites and axon to soma, and further towards the apical dendrites. This is explained in Methods, but difficult to parse from Results amidst lots of rather abstract jargon (target, reference, collision, compartment). Figure 2 would have presented an opportunity to clearly illustrate the author's portioning algorithm by (1) rooting it in the exact morphology of one of their multicompartmental model neurons and (2) illustrating that &quot;target&quot; and &quot;reference&quot; have arbitrary morphological meanings; they describe the direction of current flow which is reevaluated at each time step.</p>
<p>Analyses in Figure 7, C and D, are insightfully devised and illuminating. However, they could use some reconciliation with Figure 5 regarding initiation of individual APs versus CSBs within place fields.</p>
<p>The intriguing observations generated by extended currentscape also point to its main weakness, which the authors openly acknowledge: as of now, no experimental methods exist to conclusively tests its predictions.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The electrical activity of neurons and neuronal circuits is dictated by the concerted activity of multiple ionic currents. Because directly investigating these currents experimentally isn't possible with current methods, researchers rely on biophysical models to develop hypotheses and intuitions about their dynamics. Models of neural activity produce large amounts of data that is hard to visualize and interpret. The currentscape technique helps visualize the contributions of currents to membrane potential activity, but it's limited to model neurons without spatial properties. The extended currentscape technique overcomes this limitation by tracking the contributions of the different currents from distant locations. This extension allows tracking not only the types of currents that contribute to the activity in a given location, but also visualizing the spatial region where the currents originate. The method is applied to study the initiation of complex spike bursts in a model hippocampal place cell.</p>
<p>Strengths.</p>
<p>The visualization method introduced in this work represents a significant improvement over the original currentscape technique. The extended currentscape method enables investigation of the contributions of currents in spatially extended models of neurons and circuits.</p>
<p>Weaknesses.</p>
<p>The case study is interesting and highlights the usefulness of the visualization method. A simpler case study may have been sufficient to exemplify the method, while also allowing readers to compare the visualizations against their own intuitions of how currents should flow in a simpler setting.</p>

<p>We are very pleased to hear the overall positive views and constructive criticisms of eLife Editors and Reviewers on our work. In particular, we appreciate their global assessment that the work offers a valuable tool for neuroscientists to visualize and assess dendritic computations.</p>
<p>We will clarify in a revised version of the manuscript that we do not infer the synaptic inputs of the neuron. Also, we will add a new simulation with simpler morphology to illustrate the method under more intuitive conditions. We will also clarify the meaning of the &quot;target&quot; and &quot;reference&quot; compartments. These labels do not depend on the direction of the current flow, but we can freely chose any compartment to be the target, and then the axial currents will be evaluated relative to that compartment in each time step.</p>
