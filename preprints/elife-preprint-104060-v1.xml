<title>Abstract</title><p>Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) is an important member of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. FGFR2 amplification occurs at a high frequency in gastric cancer (GC) and has been proven to be closely associated with poor prognosis and insensitivity to chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Current FGFR2-targeted therapies have limited efficacy. Hence, how to enhance efficacy and reverse resistance are urgent problems clinically. Src homology region 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) serves as the shared downstream mediator of all RTKs and a prominence immunosuppressive molecule. In this study, we identified FGFR2 amplification in 6.2% (10/161) of GC samples in our center. Then we showed that dual blocking SHP2 and FGFR2 enhanced the effects of FGFR2 inhibitor (FGFR2i) in FGFR2-amplified GC both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> via suppressing RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. We further showed that it overcame FGFR2i resistance by reversing the feedback activation mediated by other RTKs and continuously suppressing FGFR2-initiated downstream pathways. Notably, SHP2 blockade could suppress PD-1 expression and promoted IFN-γ secretion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, enhancing the cytotoxic functions of T cells in tumor immune microenvironment. Overall, our findings suggest that dual blocking SHP2 and FGFR2 is a compelling rationale with both targeted treatment and immune regulation for FGFR2-amplified GC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer death globally(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ajani et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Smyth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). Due to the absence of specific early signs, over 70% of GC patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Guan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Concurrently, treatments for advanced GC predominantly include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody nivolumab plus chemotherapy has been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the standard first-line treatment for advanced GC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Janjigian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Smyth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). Meanwhile, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has classified GC patients into four subtypes including Epstein Barr virus (EBV) type, Microsatellite Instability (MSI) type, Genomic stability (GS) type and chromosomal instability (CIN) type(&quot;Comprehensive molecular characterization of gastric adenocarcinoma,&quot; 2014). Among them, EBV and MSI types are more likely to benefit from immunotherapies, while CIN and GS types tend to be less responsive. Fortunately, the unique composition structure of CIN type provides potential anti-tumor targets. CIN type is in the majority, accounting for about 50%, with distinct aneuploidy and focal amplification of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) as its molecular feature(&quot;Comprehensive molecular characterization of gastric adenocarcinoma,&quot; 2014). RTKs are common tumor-driven genes, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and so on(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Du &amp; Lovly, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Paul &amp; Hristova, 2019</xref>). The combination of anti-HER-2 antibody Trastuzumab and chemotherapy has been approved by FDA as the first-line treatment for HER-2 positive advanced GC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kang, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Smyth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). In the meantime, other RTKs, especially FGFR2, have also displayed huge potential as anti-tumor targets.</p>
<p>FGFR2 is also a representative member of the RTK family. Several studies have documented that FGFR2 blockade can inhibit the occurrence and development of malignant tumors by regulating PI3K/AKT, RAS/ERK and JAK/STAT pathways(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babina &amp; Turner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gordon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Katoh &amp; Nakagama, 2014</xref>). It’s worth noting that FGFR2 amplification has been identified in up to 7.7% of advanced GC patients(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jogo et al., 2021</xref>), and is closely associated with poor prognosis and limited response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kim, Kim, Jang, et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Koh et al., 2019</xref>). Currently, there’ve been several approaches for FGFR2 inhibition in FGFR2-amplified GC. For instance, Bemarituzumab (FPA144) is a specific anti-FGFR2b monoclonal antibody(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Katoh et al., 2024</xref>), However, in a phase II clinical trial (NCT03694522), it has been demonstrated that Bemarituzumab monotherapy didn’t statistically significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) in FGFR2b-selected GC patients(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wainberg et al., 2022</xref>). Besides, small molecule inhibitors targeting FGFR2 are also primary methods for FGFR2-amplified GC treatment. In a previous phase II clinical trial (NCT01795768), FGFR2 inhibitor AZD4547 achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 33% in patients with previously treated advanced FGFR2-amplified gastroesophageal cancer, and a median PFS of responding patients of 6.6 months(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pearson et al., 2016</xref>). Based on its distinguished therapeutic effects, AZD4547 was granted by FDA as an orphan drug for GC. However, subgroup analysis indicated that robust single-agent response to AZD4547 was only observed in high-level FGFR2-amplified cancers in this trial(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pearson et al., 2016</xref>). And in another phase II clinical trial (NCT01457846), AZD4547 failed to significantly improve patients’ PFS compared to paclitaxel (3.5 months vs 1.8 months, P=0.9581) as a second-line treatment for advanced gastric adenocarcinoma(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Van Cutsem et al., 2017</xref>). Given that inhibiting FGFR2 alone is often difficult to achieve ideal therapeutic effects, identifying suitable combinations is crucial to the treatment of FGFR2-amplified GC. Although RTK targeted therapies have been proved to have certain anti-tumor therapeutic effects, drug resistance of RTK inhibitors remain a common problem. One of the main reasons for RTK inhibitors resistance is the activation of downstream signaling pathways mediated by bypass RTKs. Previous researches have revealed that the downstream pathway feedback upregulation caused by EGFR activation leaded to FGFR2 inhibitor resistance in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) with FGFR2 fusion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Src homology region 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) is the common downstream factor of RTKs including FGFR2, acting as a central node between FGFR2 and PI3K/AKT, RAS/ERK or JAK/STAT pathways(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sodir et al., 2023</xref>). As the shared molecule downstream of all RTKs, SHP2 inhibitor and its combination with RTK inhibitors were reported to be ideal strategies for treating a large class of RTK-driven cancers, including EGFR-amplified, KRAS-amplified, KRAS G12C-mutanted cancers and so on(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fedele et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that the combination of FGFR2 inhibitor and SHP2 inhibitor is likely to alleviate FGFR2 inhibitor resistance by inhibiting the feedback activation of bypass RTK pathways.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, SHP2 is also a significant downstream molecule of PD-1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Song et al., 2022</xref>). SHP2 has been proved to suppress T cell activation by inactivating TCR and CD28 signaling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2015</xref>), which are two costimulatory signals mediating T cell development and maturation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Numerous preclinical studies have revealed that SHP2 inhibition can inhibit tumors by enhancing anti-tumor immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, we suppose that simultaneously blocking FGFR2 and SHP2 has the potential to suppress tumor growth through both targeted intervention and immune activation.</p>
<p>Overall, we aim to explore the combined anti-tumor capacity and potential mechanisms of co-inhibiting FGFR2 and SHP2 in FGFR2-amplified GC, providing a “two-pronged” combination therapy mode with targeted and immune dual effects for GC patients with FGFR2 amplification.</p>

<title>Patient samples and next-generation sequencing</title>
<p>We collected gastroscopy biopsy or surgically collected specimens of 161 GC patients from January 2016 to August 2023 in Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and analysis were performed in OrigiMed (Shanghai, China) based on 450 YuanSu<sup>TM</sup> gene panel. At least 50 ng DNA were extracted from Formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues using QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit. Genes capture and sequencing were performed at a mean depth of 1000× by Illumina NextSeq 500 (San Diego, CA, USA). Gene alterations, including substitution, gene amplification, gene homozygous deletion, gene fusion and truncation were evaluated. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was estimated by calculating somatic non-synonymous mutations per megabase in each patient. The study was carried out in compliance with the code of ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) and approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital (No. 2021-324-01).</p>

<p>Four to six-week-old female BALB/c nude mice (T cell deficient) were subcutaneously injected with 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> SNU-16 cells suspended in 100 μL PBS with 50% Matrigel (BD Biocoat, 356234). When the tumor volume reached approximately 100-150 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were randomized into 4 groups (n=5 per group) and started on treatment with PBS, SHP099 50 mg/kg, AZD4547 1.56 mg/kg, SHP099 50 mg/kg plus AZD4547 1.56 mg/kg. The dosage of medications used in animal experiments referred to previous researches(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). Drugs were delivered by oral gavage every day for 21 days. Tumor dimensions were measured every other day and tumor size was calculated as 0.5 × length × width<sup>2</sup>. All mice were killed on day 28 after tumor implantation. Tumor tissues were harvested for further analysis. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Drum Tower Hospital (approval number: 2022AE01029).</p>

<title>Recurrent FGFR2 gene amplification in Chinese GC patients</title>
<p>161 GC samples collected from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital were performed with NGS. The top 5 most significantly altered genes were TP53 (61%), ARID1A (25%), CDH1 (16%), ERBB2 (12%) and PIK3CA (12%) (Fig. S1A). Meanwhile, CCNE1 (8%), ERBB2 (7%), FGFR2 (6%), MET (6%) and CCND1 (6%) were the top 5 most frequently amplified genes in the cohort (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Notably, the proportion of FGFR2 amplification ranked third after CCNE1 and ERBB2 among all amplified genomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We can find FGFR2-amplified GC patients also occupied quite a high portion in TCGA-STAD cohort (15/295; 5%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), further emphasizing the prevalence of FGFR2-amplified GC patients.</p>

<title>SHP099 enhances the anti-tumor effects and overcomes the resistance of FGFR2 inhibitors in FGFR2-amplified GC</title>
<p>FGFR2-amplified GC cell lines SNU-16 and KATOIII were detected to exhibit relatively higher FGFR2 expression levels compared to other human GC cell lines (Fig. S2). Then, the anti-tumor capacity of FGFR2 inhibitor, SHP2 inhibitor monotherapy or combination therapy was detected <italic>in vitro</italic>.

<p>To unravel the mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor effects of combination therapy, we investigated the expression levels of key proteins of PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways in KATOIII following drug treatment for 1 hour or 48 hours. While the combination of 3nM AZD4547 and 10 μM SHP099 might not have led to a stronger inhibition of phospho-FGFR and phospho-SHP2 compared to 10 nM AZD4547 single-agent treatment, it induced a more pronounced suppression of downstream signal pathways of FGFR2, particularly phospho-ERK1/2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Interestingly, levels of phospho-p38, which is a crucial cascade mediating another MAPK pathway(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), remained unaffected by the medication. It’s worth noting that although phospho-FGFR and phospho-SHP2 were further suppressed over time, AZD4547 single-agent treatment failed to sustain downstream signal suppression after 48 hours. In contrast, the combination treatment could continuously inhibit the downstream signaling molecules and overcome the feedback activation caused by prolonged treatment duration. Similar regulations of these phospho-proteins were also observed in another FGFR2-amplified GC cell line SNU-16 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>

<title>The synergistic efficacy of combining AZD4547 with SHP099 in primary tumor cells derived from a FGFR2 inhibitor-resistant GC patient</title>
<p>A 49-year-old Asian female was diagnosed with poorly-differentiated gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) through gastroscopy in November 2020. Subsequently, she underwent laparoscopic radical gastrectomy and received a 12-cycle biweekly chemotherapy regimen of Docetaxel and Tegafur from December 2020 to January 2021. However, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration began to rise in September 2021, and liver tumor metastasis rapidly ensued. Given that her tumor tissue NGS revealed an amplified FGFR2 copy number of 87.1, she commenced FGFR2 inhibitor treatment in March 2022 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). During the medication period, she initially received partial response (PR) and experienced a transient reduction on her liver lesion, but rapidly came to progressive disease (PD) in December 2022, manifesting multiple lesions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Similarly, serum AFP level decreased after 2 months of medication but subsequently continued to rise, reaching up to 10,000 ng/ml (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). As a result, we inferred that the patient initially exhibited sensitivity to FGFR2 inhibitors but swiftly developed resistance. After taking FGFR2 inhibitor for 13 months, the patient developed ascites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), and pathological examination confirmed the presence of tumor cells in her ascites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). To further evaluate the synergistic efficacy of dual blocking FGFR2 and SHP2 in patient-derived GC cells, we treated tumor cells derived from the patient’s ascites with AZD4547, SHP099 or their combination <italic>in vitro</italic> for 48 hours. Consistently, the data indicated that FGFR2 inhibitor-resistant tumor cells from her ascites were more sensitive to the combination therapy compared to AZD4547 monotherapy (P&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we detected the expression levels of key proteins related to FGFR2-initiated PI3K/AKT and RAS/ERK pathways after incubating tumor cells with different treatment for 1 hour. Interestingly, we didn’t observe a significant downregulation of phospho-SHP2 in groups with addition of SHP099. However, combination therapy exhibited relatively stronger inhibitory effects on phospho-FGFR and its downstream molecules, including phospho-AKT and phospho-mTOR. Furthermore, the addition of SHP099 significantly suppressed phospho-ERK1/2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>), suggesting that SHP099 may overcome FGFR2 inhibitor resistance mainly by suppressing RAS/ERK pathway. This case suggests that the combination of AZD4547 and SHP099 has potential application value in clinical FGFR2 inhibitor-resistant patients.</p>

<p>Considering the immunosuppressive role of SHP2 under PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, we also evaluated the effects of SHP099/AZD4547 combination therapy on T-cell immune activation <italic>in vitro</italic>. After incubating human PBMCs with different drug therapies for 24 hours in the presence of human anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, we observed s significant reduction of PD-1 expression in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in SHP099 monotherapy group (P=0.0006 vs. CD3/CD28 group) and combination therapy group (P=0.0001 vs. CD3/CD28 group) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> and S6A).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>FGFR2 amplification is a common form of genetic variations in GC, and it was identified in 5% of GC patients in TCGA-STAD cohort. Meanwhile, in our study, FGFR2 amplification occupied around 6.2% of GC patients in Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital cohort. And, it is conclusively shown that FGFR2 amplification of GC is closely related to poor prognosis. Previous study demonstrated that FGFR2 amplification was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, poor tumor differentiation and worse survival in GC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kim, Kim, &amp; Jang, 2019</xref>). Consistently, FGFR2-amplifed GC patients were observed to exhibit more advanced tumor stages in our cohort. It prompted that FGFR2 amplification is a potential therapeutic target for GC.</p>
<p>Although FGFR2-targeted therapy has made some progress in GC treatment, there still exists problems such as low drug sensitivity and susceptibility to drug resistance. We reported a typical clinical case of a FGFR2-amplified gastric SRCC patient, showing symptoms of liver metastasis less than one year after radical gastrectomy. The patient received FGFR2 inhibitors and achieved PR after 2-month medication, with a duration of response only 7 months. This case also indicates that FGFR2-amplifed GC patients tend to have poorer prognosis and develop resistance to FGFR2 inhibitors in relative short period.</p>
<p>In terms of the mechanisms of FGFR2 inhibitors resistance, as early as 2013, the research in <italic>Cancer Discovery</italic> revealed the potential causes of FGFR2 inhibitors resistance in FGFR3-mutated bladder cancer patients. It demonstrated that the bypass EGFR-mediated signaling activation would reduce the efficacy of FGFR inhibitors. As a result, the drug sensitivity of FGFR3-mutated bladder cancer patients to FGFR inhibitors was limited, leading to the occurrence of FGFR inhibitors resistance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Herrera-Abreu et al., 2013</xref>). Another research conducted a more in-depth exploration of this mechanism. Researchers found that in iCCA with FGFR2 fusion, feedback activation of downstream RAS/ERK, PI3K/AKT pathways mediated by EGFR alternative pathway is a significant contributor to FGFR2 inhibitors’ resistance. By combining EGFR inhibitor with FGFR2 inhibitor, the feedback activation of downstream pathways was successfully relieved(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). The existing researches have recognized the crucial role played by feedback activation in RTK inhibitors resistance. And, it cannot be ruled out that there are other bypass RTK activation besides EGFR, such as HER-2, cMET, FGFR3, etc(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Huang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ryan et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>SHP2 is a common molecule downstream of all RTKs. Several studied have documented that SHP2 inhibitor displayed superior anti-tumor capacity and synergistic combination efficacy with RTK inhibitors in RTK driven tumors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fedele et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). Since SHP2 transduces signaling from all RTKs, we speculate that SHP2 inhibition can not only directly promote the anti-tumor effects of FGFR2 inhibitors, but also overcome FGFR2 inhibitors resistance by blocking all possible alternative RTK pathways. Our study first established that SHP099 can effectively promote the direct anti-tumor capacity of AZD4547 in different FGFR2-amplified GC cell lines by further suppressing downstream RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Meanwhile, SHP099 could continuously inhibit upstream and downstream signaling molecules and overcome FGFR2 inhibitor resistance in long-term drug stimulated tumor cells. On the contrary, AZD4547 monotherapy exhibited obvious feedback activation of downstream pathways. We also validated the combined efficacy of SHP099 and AZD4547 in a SNU-16 cell-derived xenograft (CDX) nude mouse model, and no significant drug toxicity was observed. For further research, we isolated primary tumor cells from the FGFR2-inhibitor resistant patient’s ascites. It was observed that the combination treatment with SHP099 could enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of AZD4547 by inhibiting downstream RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. By dual blocking FGFR2 and SHP2, we successfully overcame FGFR2 inhibitors resistance by suppressing FGFR2-iniated downstream pathways in FGFR2 inhibitor-resistant patient’s cancer cells. These findings provide a potential effective approach for overcoming FGFR2 inhibitors resistance.</p>
<p>Previous studies only focused on drug resistance caused by bypass signaling activation of a specific RTK gene, while our study utilized SHP2 inhibitor to counteract feedback activation of downstream signaling pathways caused by all RTK activation, providing a widely applicable combination therapy model. Apart from the targeted tumor-killing capacity, we also validated the immune regulation role of SHP2 inhibition in treating FGFR2-amplified GC patients. FGFR2-amplified patients in TCGA-STAD cohort tended to have poorer PD-L1 mRNA expression and lower TMB levels compared to the unamplified group, while MSS occurred more frequently in FGFR2-amplified group. These characteristics are inextricably correlated with reduced responsiveness to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and poorer immune infiltration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fuchs et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shitara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Meanwhile, SHP2 serves as a downstream molecule in the PD-1 signaling pathway. It has been confirmed that SHP2 can be recruited and bound to PD-1, thus inhibiting cytotoxic T cells activation by suppressing CD28 and TCR signals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Previous study has demonstrated that T-cell SHP2-deficient mice bearing colitis-associated cancer showed enhanced cytotoxicity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and reduced tumor sizes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), corroborating that SHP2 inhibition can facilitate T cell anti-tumor immunity. In addition, the combination of SHP2 inhibitor and anti-PD-1 antibody has been proved to have synergistic anti-tumor effects in colon cancer by activating cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and normalizing TIME(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). The above evidence confirmed the enormous potential value of inhibiting SHP2 in regulating anti-tumor immunity. Although several researches have revealed that SHP2 inhibitor can be ideal synergistic combination partners for various RTK inhibitors from the perspective of targeted therapy, including MET(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pudelko et al., 2020</xref>), EGFR(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Xia et al., 2021</xref>) and RET inhibitors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lu et al., 2024</xref>), currently no in-depth study focusing on its immune regulatory function has been conducted. Our study demonstrated for the first time <italic>in vitro</italic> that SHP099 combing with AZD4547 down-regulated the T-cell exhaustion molecule PD-1 and up-regulated IFN-γ secretion in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, leading to an enhanced tumor-killing capacity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in FGFR2-amplifed GC cell line.</p>
<p>Taken together, our study collectively affirmed that the combination of SHP099 and AZD4547 can not only promote the targeted tumor-killing effects and overcome AZD4547 drug resistance, but also activate T cell immunity in FGFR2-amplified GC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). We have validated the utility and feasibility of combining SHP2 inhibitor to FGFR2 inhibitor in FGFR2-amplified GC patients, providing an effective combination mode with both targeted intervention and immune regulation. Moreover, we also furnished sufficient evidence for the combination of RTK inhibitors and SHP2 inhibitors for all RTK-driven pan-cancer treatment.</p>

<caption><title>Schematic of the mechasims of blocking SHP2 and FGFR2 in inhibiting tumor progression by targeted therapy and immune intervention.</title>
<p>On one hand, SHP2 inhibitor can boost the tumor-cytotoxicity effects of FGFR2 inhibitor by inhibiting PI3K/AKT and RAS/ERK pathways in FGFR2-amplified GC, and overcome FGFR2 inhibitor resistance caused by feedback activation. On the other hand, SHP2 inhibitor can activate CD8+ T cells to kill tumor cells, suggesting its synergizing effects with FGFR2 inhibitor by enhancing T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses. Our results demonstrate the utility and feasibility of combining SHP2 inhibitor to FGFR2 inhibitor in GC patients with FGFR2 amplification.</p></caption>

<p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Blocking SHP2 1 benefits FGFR2 inhibitor and overcomes its resistance in 2 FGFR2-amplified gastric cancer&quot; by Zhang, et al., reports that FGFR2 was amplification in 6.2% (10/161) of gastric cancer samples and that dual blocking SHP2 and FGFR2 enhanced the effects of FGFR2 inhibitor (FGFR2i) in FGFR2-amplified GC both in vitro and in vivo via suppressing RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Furthermore, the authors also showed that SHP2 blockade suppressed PD-1 expression and promoted IFN-γ secretion of CD8+ 46 T cells, enhancing the cytotoxic functions of T cells. Thus, the authors concluded that dual blocking SHP2 and FGFR2 is a compelling strategy for treatment of FGFR2-amplified gastric cancer. Although the finding is interesting, the finding that FGFR2 is amplified in gastric cancer and that FGFR inhibitors have some effect on treating gastric cancer is not novel. The data quality is not high, and the effects of double inhibitions are not significant. It appears that the conclusions are largely overstatement, the supporting data is weak and not compelling.</p>
<p>The data in Figure 1 is not novel, similar data has been reported elsewhere.</p>
<p>It is unclear why the two panels in Fig 2a and 2b can not be integrated into one panel, which will make it easier to compare the activities.</p>
<p>The synergetic effects of azd4547 and shp099 are not significant in Fig 2e and 2f, as well as in Fig. 3g and fig. 4f</p>
<p>Data in Fig. 5 is weak and can be removed. It is unclear why FGFR inhibitor has some activities toward t cells since t cells do not express FGFR.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript reports the application of a combined targeted therapeutic approach to gastric cancer treatment. The RTK, FGFR2 and the phosphatase, SHP2 are targeted with existing drugs; AZD457 and SHP099 respectively. Having shown increased mRNA levels of FGFR2 and SHP2 in a patient population and highlighted the issue of resistance to single therapies the combination of inhibitors is shown to reduce cancer-related signalling in two gastric cell lines. The efficacy of the dual therapy is further demonstrated in a single patient case study and mouse xenograft models. Finally, the rationale for SHP2 inhibition is shown to be linked to immune response.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data is generally well presented and the study invokes a novel patient data set which could have wider value. The study provides additional evidence to support the combined therapeutic approach of RTK and phosphatase inhibition.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Combined therapy approaches targeting RTKs and SHP2 have been widely reported. Indeed, SHP099 in combination with FGFR inhibitors has been shown to overcome adaptive resistance in FGFR-driven cancers. Furthermore, the inhibition of SHP2 has been documented to have important implications in both targeting proliferative signalling as well as immune response. Thus, it is difficult to see novelty or a significant scientific advance in this manuscript. Although the data is generally well presented, there is inconsistency in the interpretation of the experimental outcomes from ex vivo, patient and mouse systems investigated. In addition, the study provides only minor or circumstantial understanding of the dual mechanism.</p>
<p>Using data from a 161 patient cohort FGFR2 was identified as displaying amplification of FGFR2 in ~6% with concomitant elevation of mRNA of patients which correlated with PTPN11 (SHP2) mRNA expression. The broader context of this data is of value and could add a different patient demographic to other data on gastric cancer. However, there is no detail on patient stratification or prior therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>In SNU16 and KATOIII cells the combined therapy is shown to be effective and appears to be correlated with increased apoptotic effects (i.e. not immune response).</p>
<p>Fig 2E suggests that the combined therapy in SNU16 cells is a little better than FGFR2-directed AZD457 inhibitor alone, particularly at the higher dose.</p>
<p>The individual patient case study described via Fig 3 suggests efficacy of the combined therapy (at very high dosage), however, the cell biopsies only show reduced phosphorylation of ERK, but not AKT. This is at odds with the ex vivo cell-based assays. Thus, it is not clear how relevant this study is.</p>
<p>The mouse xenograft study shows a convincing reduction in tumor mass/volume and clear reduction in pAKT, whilst pERK remains largely unaffected by the combined therapeutic approach. This is in conflict with the previous data which seems to show the opposite effect. In all, the impact of the dual therapy is unclear with respect to the two pathways mediated by ERK and AKT.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors demonstrate the impact of SHP2 on PD-1 expression and propose that the SHP099/AZD4547 combination therapy significantly induces the production of IFN-γ in CD8+ T cells. This part of the study is unconvincing and would benefit from the investigation of the tumor micro-environment to assess T cell infiltration.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can be amplified in gastric cancer and serves as a potential therapeutic target for this patient population. However, targeting FGFR2 has shown limited efficacy. Thus, this study seeks to identify additional molecules that can be effectively targeted in FGFR2 amplified gastric cancer, with a focus on Src homology region 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2). The authors first demonstrate that 6% of gastric cancer patients in a cohort of human patient samples exhibit FGFR2 amplification. Furthermore, they demonstrate that FGFR2 mRNA expression is positively correlated with PTPN11 gene expression (which is the gene that encodes the SHP2 protein). Using human gastric cancer cell lines with amplified FGFR2, the authors then test the effects of combining the FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 with the SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 on tumor cell death and signaling molecules. They demonstrate that combining the two inhibitors is more effective at tumor cell killing and reducing activation of downstream signaling pathways than either inhibitor alone. In further studies, the authors obtained gastric cancer cells with FGFR2 amplification from a patient that was treated with FGFR2 inhibitor. While this patient initially showed a partial response, the patient ultimately progressed, demonstrating resistance to FGFR2 inhibition. Following isolation of tumor cells from the patient's ascites, the authors demonstrate that these cells are sensitive to the combination treatment of AZD4547 and SHP099. Further studies were performed using a xenograft model using athymic nude mice in which the combination of SHP099 and AZD4547 were found to reduce tumor growth more significantly than either treatment alone. Finally, the authors demonstrate using an in vitro culture model that this combination treatment enhances T cell mediated cytotoxicity. The authors conclude that targeting FGFR2 and SHP2 represents a potential combination strategy in gastric patients with FGFR2 amplification.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that FGFR2 amplification positively correlates with PTPN11 in human gastric cancer samples, providing rationale for combination therapies. Furthermore, convincing data are provided demonstrating that targeting both FGFR and SHP2 is more effective than targeting either pathway alone using in vitro and in vivo models. The use of cells derived from a gastric cancer patient that progressed following treatment with an FGFR inhibitor is also a strength. The findings from this study support the conclusion that SHP2 inhibitors enhance the efficacy of FGFR-targeted therapies in cancer patients. This study also suggests that targeting SHP2 may also be an effective strategy for targeting cancers that are resistant to FGFR-targeted therapies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main caveat with these studies is the lack of an immune competent model with which to test the finding that this combination therapy enhances T cell cytotoxicity in vivo. Discussing this limitation within the context of these findings and future directions for this work, particularly since the combination therapy appears to work quite well without the presence of T cells in the environment, would be beneficial.</p>
