<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Male genital development in XY mammalian fetuses is triggered by the action of hormones, including testosterone, secreted by the developing testes. Defects in this process are a cause for Differences in Sex Development (DSD), one of the most common congenital abnormalities in humans. Fetal Leydig Cells (FLC) play a central role for the synthesis of masculinizing hormones in the developing testes. Yet, the genetic cascade controlling their differentiation is poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of the orphan nuclear receptor NR2F2 (COUP-TFII) in FLC development. We report that NR2F2 is expressed in interstitial progenitor cells of the mouse embryonic testes and is downregulated upon their differentiation into FLC. By using two mouse models for conditional mutation of <italic>Nr2f2</italic> in the developing testes, we demonstrate that NR2F2 is required for testis morphogenesis and FLC development. NR2F2 acts in interstitial progenitors to regulate the initiation and progression of FLC differentiation. These results establish NR2F2 as an essential regulator of FLC development and steroid hormone synthesis in the mouse fetal testis and provide an entry point to understand the etiology of 46, XY DSD associated with pathogenic NR2F2 variants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sexual development in mammals is conditioned by the gonadal sex established during fetal life. In XY embryos, the initially undifferentiated gonads develop into testes that can produce testosterone which stimulates the differentiation of male internal and external genitalia (including epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, scrotum, and penis) leading to the masculinization of the fetus. In contrast, fetal ovaries do not produce testosterone and female internal and external genitalia (oviducts, uterus, vagina, and vulva) develop in XX individuals. Abnormalities in the masculinization process are mainly associated with defects in the androgen synthesis or signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Although this molecular cascade is well defined, the differentiation of androgen-producing cells in the embryo is only partially understood.</p>
<p>Androgen production in the developing testis relies mainly on Fetal Leydig Cells (FLC), which express all enzymes required for the biosynthesis of androstenedione from cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The final step of conversion of androstenedione into testosterone, catalyzed by HSD17B3, takes place in a different cell type, the fetal Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). In addition to their role in androgen synthesis, FLC also produce INSL3, a hormone required for testis descent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Defects in testis descent, regulated also by androgens, result in cryptorchidism, a condition which impacts fertility and constitutes a risk factor for testicular cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). While a fraction of FLC persist after birth, others de-differentiate or involute and adult testosterone production is ensured by a distinct population of steroidogenic cells, the Adult Leydig cells (ALC), which differentiate at puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>
<p>FLC differentiate from embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) in mice and increase in number during fetal life through the recruitment and differentiation of <italic>Wnt5a</italic> positive proliferative progenitors located in the interstitial space of the testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Interstitial progenitors also give rise to the contractile peritubular myoid cells (PTM) that will surround the future seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Despite being the most abundant cell population in the fetal testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), little is known about the genetic control of the proliferation, specification, and differentiation of the interstitial steroidogenic progenitor cells.</p>
<p>Lineage tracing and single cell transcriptomic analyses have revealed that interstitial progenitors have a dual origin. The majority are derived from the coelomic epithelium of the undifferentiated gonad which harbors early bipotential progenitors able to differentiate along the supporting (the future Sertoli cells) or the steroidogenic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). In addition, Nestin-positive cells migrate from the adjacent mesonephros into the gonad and differentiate along the steroidogenic lineage from E13.5 to give rise to up to a third of the FLC population by the end of gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>).</p>
<p>Positive and negative paracrine signals drive FLC differentiation by up-regulating the transcription factors NR5A1, GATA4 and GATA6 which in turn regulate the expression of genes related to cholesterol metabolism and steroidogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Desert Hedgehog (DHH) is secreted by Sertoli cells and acts on the interstitial progenitors expressing the Hedgehog receptor Patched1 (PTCH1) and the Hedgehog effectors GLI1, 2 and 3 to trigger FLC and PTM differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). In addition FLC development requires the activation of signaling pathways downstream of PDGFRA in the steroidogenic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). On the other hand, ligands present in vascular and peri-vascular cells activate the NOTCH2 receptor and the expression of the effectors HES1 and HEYL in interstitial progenitors to maintain their undifferentiated state and inhibit FLC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). In addition to the paracrine signals from adjacent cell populations, FLC differentiation is also regulated by the cell-autonomous action of the transcription factors ARX, TCF21, PBX1, MAF and MAFB expressed in the interstitial steroidogenic progenitors, although their precise roles remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>).</p>
<p>Nuclear Receptor subfamily 2 group F member 2 (NR2F2, also known as COUP-TFII) is abundantly expressed in interstitial progenitors of the fetal and adult testis in rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). NR2F2 activates or represses transcription depending on the cellular context by directly binding to DNA responsive elements or by interacting with other transcription factors. NR2F2 regulates cell differentiation during organogenesis, adult tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). NR2F2 function is essential for cardiac and vascular development so that <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutation in mouse leads to embryonic lethality at mid-gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). The study of mouse conditional mutants has shown that NR2F2 is essential for ALC differentiation in the post-natal testis before puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). However, the function of NR2F2 in the developing testis during fetal life has not been addressed and its role in the interstitial progenitors that give rise to the FLC lineage is currently unknown. It was initially proposed that NR2F2 could act as a negative regulator of steroidogenesis at fetal stages based on the inverse correlation between NR2F2 expression and steroidogenesis genes and testosterone levels in mouse and rat fetal testes treated with endocrine disruptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). More recently, rare variants in NR2F2 have been associated with cryptorchidism, hypospadias and defective penile growth in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). These phenotypes can be attributed to defective testosterone and INSL3 production during gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), suggesting a positive role for NR2F2 in promoting FLC differentiation and/or function in the fetal testis.</p>
<p>In this study we show that NR2F2 is expressed in interstitial progenitors of coelomic and mesonephric origin of the mouse fetal testes and is downregulated upon FLC differentiation. By using two Cre lines that drive <italic>Nr2f2</italic> deletion in mouse embryonic gonads, we show that NR2F2 is required for fetal mouse testis morphogenesis and for FLC differentiation. Absence of <italic>Nr2f2</italic> does not impair paracrine signals known to regulate FLC differentiation nor the proliferation or survival of the steroidogenic progenitor population. Our findings reveal that NR2F2 promotes the initiation of FLC differentiation as well as FLC maturation. Taken together, these results establish NR2F2 as an essential factor that positively regulates the development of steroidogenic cells in the mouse fetal testis.</p>

<title>NR2F2 is expressed in steroidogenic progenitors of the developing testis</title>
<p>We analyzed the spatio-temporal distribution of NR2F2 in the developing testis by immunofluorescence. At E11.5 (18-21 tail somites, ts) NR2F2 was detected in both the coelomic epithelium and the mesonephric mesenchyme adjacent to the gonads, two tissues that contribute to the population of interstitial steroidogenic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A and C</xref>). The majority of mesenchymal cells in the gonad expressed the transcription factor RUNX1 (RUNX1+) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), indicating that most of the gonadal somatic cells at this stage belong to the supporting lineage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A and D</xref>). Nevertheless, NR2F2+ RUNX1-cells were observed, revealing that interstitial progenitors were already present at this stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). NR2F2+ cells were either GATA4+ or GATA4-, suggesting that interstitial progenitors of coelomic and mesonephric origins respectively, were both present (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A-C</xref>).</p>

<p>In E12.5 testes, NR2F2+ cells were detected in the coelomic epithelium and in the interstitial space outside the developing testis cords (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E-H</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 A-D</xref>). NR2F2+ cells co-expressed the steroidogenic progenitor marker ARX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), and were actively proliferating (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1 E-H</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 E-H</xref>). At E14.5, NR2F2 expression was maintained in interstitial cells co-expressing PDGFRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), as well as in the peritubular myoid cells lining the testis cords and in the cells beneath the surface of the testis that will contribute to the future tunica albuginea (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I and J</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 M-P</xref>). NR2F2 expression was also found in NESTIN expressing peri-vascular cells that correspond to the mesonephros derived steroidogenic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 K and L</xref>). In contrast, NR2F2 protein was either absent or detected at very low levels in FLC marked by the expression of the steroidogenic enzyme HSD3B (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 M-P</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 I-L</xref>).</p>
<p>Together our results show that NR2F2 is expressed in the coelomic epithelium and the mesonephros as well as in the interstitial progenitors derived from both sources and is downregulated upon FLC differentiation in the developing testis.</p>

This phenotype was not due to a delay in the initiation of FLC differentiation, as the number of HSD3B positive cells remained strongly reduced in <italic>WT1<sup>CreERT2</sup>; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mutant gonads at E14.5 (60% reduction, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 L-N</xref>).

<p>At E11.5, NR5A1 is co-expressed with NR2F2 in the gonadal coelomic epithelium and in interstitial cells, but is absent from the mesonephros and mesonephros derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>)(<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 D-G</xref>). <italic>Nr5a1-Cre; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mutants show efficient <italic>Nr2f2</italic> deletion in gonadal interstitial cells at E12.5 and E14.5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B-E</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>).

Together these results demonstrate that in <italic>Nr5a1-Cre; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mutants, NR2F2 is deleted after E11.5 in interstitial cells derived from the coelomic epithelium except in the outermost layer of the testis.</p>
<p><italic>Nr2f2</italic> deletion by <italic>Nr5a1-Cre</italic> did not affect the initial formation of the supporting and steroidogenic lineages as evidenced by SOX9 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B, C and H</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3N and O</xref>) and ARX expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F and G</xref>), nor the differentiation of Sertoli cells as shown by normal expression levels of <italic>Dhh, Pdgfa</italic> and <italic>Amh</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3N</xref>). In addition, ACTA2 was detected in peritubular myoid cells and was only slightly reduced in the tunica albuginea of the posterior region in the mutant testes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 J and K</xref>). In contrast, the FLC population marked by HSD3B or CYP11A1 was decreased (40% reduction, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 I-M</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 L and M</xref>) and the expression of the FLC markers <italic>Cyp11a1</italic>, <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> and <italic>Insl3</italic> was strongly down-regulated in <italic>Nr5a1-Cre; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mutant testes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>N</italic></xref>). We conclude that <italic>Nr2f2</italic> deletion after E11.5 by <italic>Nr5a1-Cre</italic> leads to FLC reduction without Sertoli cell defects suggesting that NR2F2 is required cell-autonomously in the interstitial cells for FLC development.</p>
<p>In agreement with reduced <italic>Insl3</italic> expression, the testes of <italic>Nr5a1-Cre; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> embryos were undescended and exhibited an abnormal abdominal position at postnatal day (P) 3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> <italic>O</italic> and <italic>P</italic>). In addition, the anogenital distance, a readout for androgen levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>), was reduced in P0 and P1 <italic>Nr5a1-Cre; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> males when compared to male controls (Fig. S3<italic>P</italic>), consistent with the reduced expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the mutant testes. We conclude that defective FLC development in <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutants results in cryptorchidism and impaired masculinization of the external genitalia.</p>

The distribution and abundance of endothelial cells marked by PECAM-1 was not altered in <italic>Nr5a1-Cre; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K and L</xref>). In addition, <italic>Cdh5</italic> transcript levels (a readout of the abundance of endothelial cells) were similar in controls and <italic>Nr5a1-Cre; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>). These observations indicate that the reduction in FLCs in <italic>Nr5a1-Cre; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>mutants was not associated with an increased population of endothelial cells. The receptor NOTCH2 expressed in interstitial cells is involved in restricting FLC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). <italic>Notch2</italic> mRNA levels were not altered in <italic>Nr5a1-Cre; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>). NOTCH signaling activates the expression of its target genes (that also act as effectors of the pathway) including <italic>Heyl</italic>, specifically expressed in interstitial cells and strongly up-regulated upon vascular depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) and <italic>Hes1,</italic> expressed in interstitial cells and involved in restricting FLC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).

<p>Together these results indicate that NR2F2 deficiency does not impact the activity of the signaling pathways known to induce or repress FLC formation, suggesting that NR2F2 acts downstream or in parallel of these pathways to regulate FLC differentiation from interstitial progenitors.</p>

<p>FLC differentiation is accompanied by a change in cell shape from spindle shaped progenitors to round shaped FLC, and an increase in cytoplasmic volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). HSD3B positive FLC present in <italic>Nr5a1-Cre; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> and in <italic>WT1<sup>CreERT2</sup>; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>mutants were smaller and more elongated than those in control littermates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C-H</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). These cellular characteristics have been associated with immature FLC at the initial stages of FLC differentiation before the formation of large and round testosterone producing FLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results show that NR2F2 is required in interstitial steroidogenic progenitor cells for initiation of FLC differentiation but also for the subsequent step of FLC maturation leading to robust steroid production (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 I</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>NR2F2 protein is expressed in interstitial cells of coelomic epithelium and mesonephric origin and is absent or detected at very low levels in FLC as soon as they are formed at E12.5. Our observations are consistent with NR2F2 positive cells being progenitors for FLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>) and indicate that NR2F2 is quickly down-regulated upon differentiation of the fetal steroidogenic lineage, when the cells begin to synthetize steroid hormones.</p>
<p>We used two Cre lines to address the role of NR2F2 in the mouse fetal testis. <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutants exhibit reduced FLC numbers together with a strong reduction in <italic>Insl3</italic> and steroidogenic gene expression resulting in cryptorchidism and reduced anogenital distance. Importantly, the reduction of <italic>Insl3</italic> expression is sufficient to impair testis descent even when a fraction of FLC is still present. Our findings identify NR2F2 as an essential regulator of FLC and male reproductive system development in the mouse. This conclusion is confirmed by an independent <italic>Nr2f2</italic> conditional mutation resulting in a similar phenotype of FLC hypoplasia, cryptorchidism and hypospadias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Nr2f2</italic> deletion using <italic>Nr5a1-Cre</italic> does not impair the survival or proliferation of the interstitial steroidogenic progenitor population, yet the FLC population is reduced in <italic>Nr5a1-Cre; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>mutant testes. We found that the expression of the master regulator of steroidogenic differentiation NR5A1 is not up-regulated in <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutants, which is sufficient to account for the decrease in FLC numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). ChIP-seq analysis of whole E14.5 testes have identified NR2F2 binding peaks in the regulatory region of <italic>Nr5a1</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). In addition, NR2F2 regulates gene expression by directly interacting with NR5A1 in MA-10 cells, an <italic>in vitro</italic> model for immature ALC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). It would be interesting to explore whether an interaction between NR2F2 and NR5A1contributes to the strong up-regulation of <italic>Nr5a1</italic> itself in differentiating FLCs and/or whether NR2F2 cooperates with other factors for the regulation of <italic>Nr5a1</italic>.</p>
<p>The activity of the main paracrine pathways regulating FLC differentiation was not significantly altered in <italic>Nr5a1-Cre; Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>mutant testes, as shown by the expression of target genes of the DHH, PDGFRA and NOTCH signaling. These observations indicate that NR2F2 is a permissive factor in steroidogenic progenitors acting downstream or in cooperation with the signaling pathways regulating FLC differentiation. NR2F2 expression has been found to be modulated by Hedgehog and/or NOTCH signaling in other cell types, and whether a similar regulation of <italic>Nr2f2</italic> expression by DHH and NOTCH signaling occurs in the steroidogenic progenitors is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>).</p>
<p>A fraction of FLC differentiates in <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutants including when progenitors of both coelomic epithelium and mesonephric origins are targeted. This observation indicates that additional factors cooperate with NR2F2 to regulate the transition from the steroidogenic progenitor state to the differentiating FLC. The homeodomain protein ARX is expressed in <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutant steroidogenic progenitors and is a good candidate to be such a factor. <italic>Arx</italic> mutants exhibit decreased FLC numbers without defects in paracrine signals driving their differentiation, similar to <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>).</p>
<p>FLC and ALC are morphologically, transcriptionally and functionally distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>), yet NR2F2 function is required for the differentiation of both lineages. In contrast to the situation in the fetal testis, NR2F2 is maintained in cells that have started to express steroidogenesis genes in the post-natal testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). NR2F2 regulates the transition from the adult progenitor Leydig cell (characterized by their elongated shape, their ability to proliferate and a low level of testosterone synthesis) to the immature ALC (characterized by their round shape, low mitotic activity and increased testosterone production) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). In agreement with its <italic>in vivo</italic> role promoting maturation along the ALC lineage, NR2F2 co-operates with NR5A1 and GATA4 to activate the transcription of <italic>Insl3</italic>, <italic>Star</italic> (encoding the cholesterol transporter) and <italic>Amhr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>) in MA-10 cells.</p>
<p>Here we found that the steroidogenic cells that differentiate in <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutant fetal testes exhibit a small size, an elongated shape and reduced steroidogenic gene expression, features of the earliest stages of FLC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). A similar phenotype is obtained when <italic>Nr5a1</italic> is deleted after the onset of FLC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). This suggests that in addition to controlling the initial engagement of steroidogenic progenitors into the FLC lineage and similar to the situation in the post-natal testis, NR2F2 promotes FLC maturation possibly by directly regulating the initial expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis. In agreement with this hypothesis, NR2F2 binding peaks are found in the regulatory regions of genes involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis in ChIP-seq analysis of whole E14.5 testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>).</p>
<p>NR2F2 is required for additional aspects of fetal testis morphogenesis and differentiation. Testis cords are enlarged and abnormally shaped in <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutants. Testis cord development involves the formation of Sertoli-germ cell masses after E11.5 and their subsequent partition by growing wedges of interstitial cells and associated vascular branches at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). How NR2F2 dependent regulation of interstitial cell adhesion or migration contributes to this process will be the aim of future research.</p>
<p>Pathogenic variants in NR2F2 have been associated with congenital malformations including congenital heart disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia and syndromic 46,XX testicular or ovo-testicular difference/disorder in sex development (DSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). More recently, defects in the external genitalia (micropenis, hypospadias), and cryptorchidism have been associated with rare heterozygous variants in NR2F2 in 46, XY patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). These phenotypes can be attributed to defects in testosterone-dependent masculinization and INSL3-dependent testis descent during gestation and could be explained by a failure of FLC differentiation in the fetal testis. NR2F2 is abundantly expressed in interstitial cells of fetal human testes, a population that likely contains the progenitors for FLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). The present work demonstrating that NR2F2 is required in the steroidogenic progenitors of the murine fetal testis for the initiation and progression of FLC differentiation provides an entry point to understand the etiology of 46, XY DSD associated with pathogenic NR2F2 variants.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study, which has been improved further upon revision, reveals a critical role of the transcription factor NR2F2 in mouse fetal Leydig cell (FLC) differentiation. With elegantly carried out experiments, the authors provide <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that NR2F2 helps to initiate the differentiation of certain interstitial cells into FLC until these cells mature into functional secretory cells that produce androgen and insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3). The particular importance of the work comes from the fact that NR2F2 affects FLCs without altering paracrine signals known to be involved in FLC differentiation. The work will be of interest to colleagues studying reproductive development in mammals including humans or the biological functions of the nuclear receptor family.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this beautiful paper the authors examined the role and function of NR2F2 in testis development and more specifically on fetal Leydig cells development. It is well known by now that FLC are developed from an interstitial steroidogenic progenitor at around E12.5 and are crucial for testosterone and INSL3 production during embryonic development, which in turn shapes the internal and external genitalia of the male. Indeed, lack of testosterone or INSL3 are known to cause DSD as well as undescended testis, also termed as cryptorchidism.</p>
<p>The authors first characterized the expression pattern of the NR2R2 protein during testis development and then used two cKO systems of NR2F2, namely the Wt1-creERT2 and the Nr5a1-cre to explore the phenotype of loss of NR2F2. They found in both cases that mice are presenting with undescended testis and major reduction in FLC numbers. They show that NR2F2 has no effect on the amount and expression of the progenitor cells but in its absence, there are less FLC and they are immature.</p>
<p>The effect of NR2F2 is cell autonomous and does not seem to affect other signalling pathways implemented in Leydig cell development as the DHH, PDGFRA and the NOTCH pathway.</p>
<p>Overall, this paper is excellent, very well written, fluent and clear. The data is well presented, and all the controls and statistics are in place. I think this paper will be of great interest to the field and paves the way for several interesting follow up studies as stated in the discussion</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have fully addressed my concerns and the manuscript is looking excellent.</p>

<p>The major conclusion of the manuscript is expressed in the title: &quot;NR2F2 is required in the embryonic testis for Fetal Leydig Cell development&quot; and also at the end of the introduction and all along the result part. All the authors' assertions are supported by very clear and statistically validated results from ISH, IHC, precise cell counting and gene expression levels by qPCR. The authors used two different conditional Nr2f2 gene ablation systems that demonstrate the same effects at the FLC level. They also showed that the haplo-insufficiency of Wt1 in the first system (knock-in Wt1-cre-ERT2) aggravated the situation in FLC differentiation by disturbing the differentiation of Sertoli cells and their secretion of pro-FLC factors, which had a confounding effect and encouraged them to use the second system. This demonstrates the great rigor with which the authors interpreted the results. In conclusion, all authors' claims and conclusions are justified by their high-quality results.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>In their revised version, the authors have taken full account of all my suggestions, and I congratulate them on this. I have no further comments to make on this new version.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their comments which have improved and strengthened our manuscript. Please see our responses to specific comments below in blue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have several small comments:</p>
<p>(1) There has been recently a preprint from the Yao lab about the role of NR2F2 is steroidogenic cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.16.613312v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.16.613312v1</ext-link>). They performed cKO of NR2F2 using the Wt1creERT2 and found similar results. You should present and discuss this paper in light of your results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Estermann et al., report a very similar phenotype of FLC hypoplasia in an independent mouse model of <italic>Nr2f2</italic> conditional mutation. We have now referred to this article in the discussion of our manuscript as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the introduction I think it is important to mention that the steroidogenic progenitors are derived from Wnt5a positive cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35705036/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35705036/</ext-link>).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have mentioned this point in the introduction as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In both models you show a decrease in the number of FLC (60% or 40%) and yet they both present with undescended testis. It is important to discuss the fact that there is no need for a complete ablation of testosterone and INSL3 in order to get cryptorchidism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have mentioned this point in the discussion as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The fact that you get only partial reduction in FLC is likely due to redundancy with additional factors, possibly the ARX like you stated in the discussion and it will be interesting to explore that in the future but is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer, this question could be addressed by analyzing <italic>Arx,Nr2f2</italic> double mutants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In page 8 line 11 you mention data not shown- not sure if this is allowed in the journal .</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The data is now shown in Figure S5A as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Figure 2- it will be good if you add a schematic model of the mouse strains used as well as the experimental and control mice next to the Tam scheme. Similar scheme should be in figure 3 for Nr5a1-cre.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified Figures 2 and 3 as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) There is a clear and pronounced effect of the testis cords number and size. It will be good if you could qualify testis cord numbers/ diameter in the mutants even if you do not follow in detail the effect on Sertoli cells</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have quantified testis cords numbers and area in E14.5 Control and Wt1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup>; <italic>Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> testes. This data is now shown in Figure S2M.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) It will be good to present the undescended testis in the Wt1-cre model in figure 2 and not in the supp figure</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The data is now shown in Figure 2H-I as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Please add labelling of the testis, kidney, bladder, vas deferens in figure 3 N+O and in the Wt1-cre model</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the labels in Figures 2 and 3 as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) In figure 5 which present both models- it will be good to use the scheme I suggested before to highlight which results refer to which ko model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified Figure 5 as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The work presented in this manuscript gave me food for thought. I have always been intrigued by the fact that of the large number of interstitial cells in the testis, a minority differentiate into mature androgen-producing Leydig cells. In other words, how is the number of functional steroidogenic cells defined from a large pool of progenitor cells (ARX and NR2F2 positive ones)? This may have a link with the levels of androgens produced (a kind of feedback control) or the effectiveness of these androgens on the target tissues (i.e.: as spermatogenesis efficiency in adults). In addition, there must be specific signals (probably linked to gonadotropins) that induce the recruitment of Leydig cells from the progenitor pool. Perhaps the genetic models generated in this study could help to address these questions. I leave it to the authors to judge.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. How NR2F2 (and other factors) integrate extrinsic cues to regulate the recruitment of a subset of interstitial steroidogenic progenitors along the Leydig cell differentiation pathway is a fascinating question beyond the scope of this work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition to this reflection, I propose a few minor modifications likely to improve the quality of the manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) Page 3, lane 3: I suggest to replace &quot;growth&quot; by &quot;differentiation&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified the text as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Page 3, lane 4: the &quot;scrotum&quot; is missing in the parenthesis. Please add it before &quot;and penis&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified the text as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Page 5, lanes 21-24: kidney hypoplasia is also evident on Fig S2H (stated in the figure legend). It could be also mentioned in this sentence and it implies &quot;...that NR2F2 function is required for testicular and kidney development.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified the text as suggested.</p>

<p>(4) Page 5, lanes 28-30. In addition to the reduction in the number of HSD3B-positive cells, HSD3B staining seems clearly more faint in mutant FLC (Fig 2M) compared to adrenal cells on the same section or FLC in control gonads. This fits well with other results on the level of steroidogenic enzymes (Fig 2O) and those presented thereafter (Fig S4 I-J and Fig 5). Perhaps the author could mention this fact.</p>

<p>We have modified the text as suggested in the results section “NR2F2 is required for FLC maturation” (Page 8).</p>

<p>(5) Page 5, lanes 31-34: testicular descent is hugely sensible to INSL3 in the mouse (by contrast with other species where androgens seem to be more critical). I was wondering if you can check a better phenotypic marker for the absence (or reduction) of androgens like the differentiation of epididymides by HE staining or the anogenital distance at birth.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have measured the anogenital distance at P0 and P1 as suggested and have included the corresponding graph in Fig. S3P</p>

<p>(6) Page 8, lanes 21-22: &quot;HSD3B positive FLC were smaller and more elongated&quot;. It is clear on Fig 5F but not evident on Fig 5D. Could the authors propose another image?</p>

<p>We have modified Figure 5 as suggested and provide now another example of HSD3B positive FLCs in a <italic>Nr5a1Cre;</italic> <italic>Nr2f2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mutant gonad (Fig. 5D) and the corresponding control littermate (Fig. 5C).</p>

<p>(7) Page 14, lane 12: &quot;(arrow in I)&quot; should be &quot;(arrow in H)&quot;</p>

<p>We have modified the text as suggested. Please note that ACTA 2 expression is now shown in Figure S2 G-H.</p>

<p>(8) Page 15, lane 6: &quot;Arrows indicate NR5A1 positive FLC&quot;. There is no arrow on Fig4 C,D; but a kind of scale bar on the enlargement shown in C.</p>

<p>We have modified Figure 4 as suggested.</p>
