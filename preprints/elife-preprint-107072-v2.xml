<abstract>
<p>Many biological processes emerge as frequency-dependent responses to trains of external stimuli. Heart rhythm disturbances, i.e. cardiac arrhythmias, are important examples as they are often triggered by specific patterns of preceding stimuli. In this study, we investigated how ectopic arrhythmias can be induced by external stimuli in cardiac tissue containing a localised area of depolarisation. Using optogenetic <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and <italic>in silico</italic> modelling, we systematically explored the dynamics of these arrhythmias, which are characterized by local oscillatory activity, by gradually altering the degree of depolarization in a predefined region. Our findings reveal a bi-stable system, in which transitions between oscillatory ectopic activity and a quiescent state can be precisely controlled, i.e. by adjusting the number and frequency of propagating waves through the depolarized area oscillations could be turned on or off. These frequency-dependent responses arise from collective mechanisms involving stable, non-self-oscillatory cells, contrasting with the typical role of self-oscillations in individual units within biophysical systems. To further generalize these findings, we demonstrated similar frequency selectivity and bi-stability in a simplified reaction-diffusion model. This suggests that complex ionic cell dynamics are not required to reproduce these effects; rather, simpler non-linear systems can replicate similar behaviour, potentially extending beyond the cardiac context.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biological systems like the heart typically display complex dynamical behaviour through interactions among components such as genes, proteins, or cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dana et al. (2008</xref>)). These systems exhibit non-linear dynamics, feedback loops, and adaptability, reflecting phenomena like homeostasis, evolution, and rhythm stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Xiong and Garfinkel (2023</xref>)). Central to the framework of dynamical systems is the concept of the phase space, a multidimensional representation in which each point corresponds to a unique state of the system. In geography when a small ball rolls on a raised-relief map, a state would include the planar position, elevation, speed and acceleration of the ball.</p>
<p>Within the phase space, the long-term behaviour of a system can often be described in terms of attractors, which are subsets of the phase space that trajectories tend toward over time. Attractors can take various forms, including fixed points, periodic orbits, and chaotic sets, reflecting the rich diversity of behaviours possible in dynamical systems. By replacing the ball by local rain in the raised-relief map, rivers, lakes and other bodies of water are attractors where that rain is collected. A watershed, also known as a drainage basin, is an area of land where any rain that falls will drain into the same river, lake or body of water. Therefore they are basins of attraction. Mountain ridges are separatrices that divide the watersheds, or more formally theoretical surfaces that divide the phase space into different basins of attraction. A separatrix therefore denotes the transition between different regions of the phase space. The terminology introduced here comes back throughout our paper, with the addition of a “state”, i.e. one of the attractors in the system. When the system is not interacted with, it will stay at the same point(s) in phase space.</p>
<p>Some systems only have a single basin of attraction. However, in others the phenomenon of bi-stability emerges, where two distinct attractors coexist, each with its own basin of attraction. Bistability is a hallmark of many natural and engineered systems, from climate dynamics to neural networks, ecological models, and cardiac dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Angeli et al. (2004</xref>)). The interplay between basins in such systems can give rise to complex behaviours, making the characterization of these basins a critical component of a system’s analysis.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the focus is on the complex system of the heart. At rest, ventricular cardiomyocytes (i.e muscle cells of the lower heart chamber) have a membrane potential of -80 to -90 <italic>mV</italic>. This resting state is an attractor of the system. When pushed out of equilibrium (e.g. due to an influx of <italic>Na</italic><sup>+</sup> ions or electrical stimulation), cardiomyocytes first depolarize and subsequently get attracted again towards the resting state by an efflux of <italic>K</italic><sup>+</sup> ions. In phase space the trajectory that gets mapped out resembles a cycle, corresponding to one heartbeat. When multiple of these cells are connected to each other, emergent behaviour can arise. Within this dynamic system of cardiomyocytes, we investigated emergent bi-stability (a concept that will be explained more thoroughly later on) in cell monolayers under the influence of spatial depolarization patterns. By using a train of external (electrical) waves, the system could be actively moved from one basin of attraction to another.</p>
<p>Cardiac arrhythmias are typically initiated by specific triggers, with point-source waves, i.e. ectopic waves being the most prevalent. To study ectopy in laboratory settings, control needs to be exerted over the depolarisation of cardiomyocytes. This can be achieved by optogenetics, i.e. a biological technique to control the activity of cells with light. This approach relies on the introduction of recombinant genes encoding light-activatable proteins into cells to endow them with a new biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tan et al. (2022</xref>)). One way to depolarise a cardiomyocyte is by using mini-singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG). Upon activation with blue light, miniSOG converts molecular oxygen from its ground state (<sup>3</sup><italic>O</italic><sub>2</sub>) into highly reactive singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup><italic>O</italic><sub>2</sub>). The resulting oxidative damage induces a state of prolonged depolarisation in cardiomyocytes following electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jangsangthong et al. (2016</xref>)). In such a system, it was previously observed that spatiotemporal illumination can give rise to collective behaviour and ectopic waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Teplenin et al. (2018</xref>)) originating from illuminated/depolarised regions (with spatial high curvature). These waves resulted from the interplay between the diffusion current (also known in biology/biophysics as the gap junction mediated current) and the single cell bi-stable state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Teplenin et al. (2018</xref>)) that was induced in the illuminated region.</p>
<p>Although effects of illuminating miniSOG with light might lead to formation of depolarised areas, it is difficult to control the process precisely since it depolarises cardiomyocytes indirectly. Therefore, in this manuscript, we used light-sensitive ion channels to obtain more refined control over cardiomyocyte depolarisation. These ion channels allow the cells to respond to specific wavelengths of light, facilitating direct depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ördög et al. (2021</xref>, 2023)). By inducing cardiomyocyte depolarisation or hyperpolarisation only in the illuminated areas, optogenetics enables precise spatiotemporal control of cardiac excitability, an attribute we exploit in this manuscript (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>). With the aid of the light-gated ion channel CheRiff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hochbaum et al. (2014</xref>)), ectopic waves similar to those obtained in the miniSOG system could be elicited (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>). Due to the superior control over depolarisation imposed by CheRiff, we uncovered new effects and unobserved behaviour related to the transition from a mono-stable cardiac system to a bi-stable one that displays periodic oscillations. This transition resulted from the interaction of depolarized cardiomyocytes in an illuminated region with an external wave train not originating from within the illuminated region. More specifically, we found that our system displayed frequency selectivity: it oscillated only as a reaction to a specific range of inter-pulse external stimuli times. In neuroscience, this behaviour is classified as “resonance”. However, to avoid confusion with classical resonance, where the strength of the response is dependent on the input, here the phenomenon is called “induced pacemaker activity”. Evidence for this induced pacemaker activity will be presented both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Bi-stability in cardiomyocyte monolayers was realised both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> this happened through patterned illumination applied to neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM) monolayers, which were optogenetically modified using the blue light-activatable cation channel CheRiff (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic>, use was made of a slightly modified (see Methods and Materials) NRVM computational model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Majumder et al. (2016</xref>)) complemented with a model for a depolarising light-gated ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Williams et al. (2013</xref>)). In both cases, the illumination pattern consisted of a rectangle of variable light intensities. After initiating a periodic wave train (of variable pulse number and interpulse interval/period) from a pacing electrode, two main outcomes and one special case were observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The first outcome was that the tissue stayed in the stationary rest state (STA). The second outcome was that the illuminated region became a pacemaker, which sent out pulses from its edges as a form of oscillatory behaviour (OSC). The special case consisted of an in-between case, in which the illuminated region only sends out a limited amount of pulses before returning to the stationary state thus showing transient oscillatory behaviour (TR. OSC). Except for the occasional mention, this last behaviour of transient oscillations will be reserved for more detailed discussion in the supplement. All light intensity-influenced monolayer behaviours are visualised together in <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 3</xref> and the accompanying Supplemental video 1. Here, we will focus on the two main behaviours after periodic wave trains: STA and OSC. As shown below, these two behaviours can exist within the same monolayer under bi-stability and transitions from one state to the other are possible using periodic wave trains. The occurrence of this phenomenon appears to be influenced by the light intensity applied to the illuminated region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In a step-by-step manner, we unravelled the intricacies of this tissue level (i.e. collective) bi-stability between oscillatory and stationary behaviour, linking experiment to theory.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> realisation of collective light-induced bi-stability</title>
<p>To test the scope of collective bi-stability <italic>in vitro</italic>, multiple parameters were varied within our experimental set-up. The first one of these was the frequency of stimulation, visualised in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, where the number of electrical pulses and the light intensity (in the range 0.03125-0.25 <italic>mW /mm</italic><sup>2</sup>) were kept fixed. In every NRVM monolayer (26 biological replicates/monolayers), three frequencies (5.000, 1.666, and 0.833 <italic>Hz</italic> or stimulation periods 200, 600, and 1200 <italic>ms</italic>) were tested subsequently, with a total of three repetitions (technical replicates) of the full set, totalling 26 × 3 = 78 observations at each pacing frequency. Optical voltage signals were measured both at the center of the illuminated area (top traces) as well as in the bulk of the tissue (bottom traces), in order to visualise action potentials throughout the tissue. Underneath these optical voltage traces is a space-time plot of the experimental monolayer, the vertical axis showing space and the horizontal one showing time. At each moment in time, the middle line of the monolayer image was plotted. White shows depolarized tissue, while black signifies repolarised cells. From these plots, intermediate stimulation periods (600 <italic>ms</italic>) were observed to change the monolayer from a collective stationary state to a collective oscillatory state, while low (200 <italic>ms</italic>) or high (1200 <italic>ms</italic>) ones had no effect. It was observed that the oscillatory state consisted of ectopic pacemaker activity with a frequency (1.361 <italic>Hz</italic> or a 735-<italic>ms</italic> period) that was different from the stimulus train frequency (1.666 <italic>Hz</italic> or a 600-<italic>ms</italic> period). Similar results were found for the transient oscillatory state (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 4A</xref>). In short, we found that collective bi-stability becomes apparent in the mid-range of electrical pacing frequencies.</p>

<p><italic>In vitro</italic> monolayers of optogenetically modified NRVMs show that the transition from the stationary state (STA) towards the oscillatory state (OSC) is dependent on the frequency of excitatory waves passing through an illuminated area under a constant number of 4 pulses. <bold>(A)</bold> Four pulses at high frequency (5.000 <italic>Hz</italic> or a 200-<italic>ms</italic> period) are not enough to induce the transition. <bold>(B)</bold> Four pulses at medium frequency (1.666 <italic>Hz</italic> or a 600-<italic>ms</italic> period) are sufficient to induce the transition. <bold>(C)</bold> Four pulses at low frequency (0.833 <italic>Hz</italic> or a 1200-<italic>ms</italic> period) fail once again in inducing the transition.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="650000v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>A second parameter tested was the number of pulses, visualised in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, where the period of stimulation (600 <italic>ms</italic>) and the light intensity (in the range 0.03125-0.25 <italic>mW /mm</italic><sup>2</sup>) were kept fixed. In every NRVM monolayer (7 biological replicates/monolayers), two different pulse numbers (2 and 4) were tested subsequently, with a total of three repetitions (technical replicates) of the full set, totalling 7 × 3 = 21 observations for each number of pulses. Once again optical voltage traces were taken from the center of the illuminated area and from the bulk of the tissue. Our observations show that a minimum number of pulses is needed to change the collective behaviour of the monolayer from stationary to oscillatory.</p>
<p>Taken together, we found a way to control transitions of collective behaviour of cardiomyocyte monolayers from stationary to oscillatory through two different parameters, i.e. the frequency and number of pulses.</p>

<p>Having established a qualitative correspondence between the <italic>in silico</italic> model and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, the unique properties of the computational model were exploited to assert control over all variables in order to determine the parameter ranges of the state transitions. We previously identified three important parameters influencing such transitions: light intensity, number of pulses, and frequency of pulses. Scanning through all three variables revealed the specific conditions at which transition from the stationary state towards the oscillatory state occurred as shown in the rightmost panel of <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> with slices for fixed illumination extracted from this 3D-plot shown at the left. With increasing light intensity, the parameter range (pulse and period) in which bi-stability can be detected increases (the total area of TR.OSC. + OSC. becomes larger), and transient oscillatory states transition towards oscillatory states.</p>
<p>Except for the three aforementioned parameters, a fourth one was found to have an influence on the state transitions: the size of the illuminated region. Also this parameter was first tested <italic>in vitro</italic> resulting in 5 biological replicates/monolayers showing transitions to the oscillatory state and 6 biological replicates/monolayers showing transient oscillations. The effect of the size of the illuminated area on the occurrence of bi-stability was qualitatively reproduced <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 5</xref>). Varying the number and frequency of pulses together with the illuminated area at a fixed light intensity of 1.7200 <italic>mW /mm</italic><sup>2</sup> resulted in the dynamic behaviour shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>. For the conditions that resulted in stable oscillations, the green vertical lines in the middle and right slices represent the natural pacemaker frequency in the oscillatory state. After the transition from the stationary towards the oscillatory state, oscillatory pulses emerging from the illuminated region gradually dampen and stabilize at this period, corresponding to the natural pacemaker frequency. The location of this line depends on the light intensity and the size of the illuminated region. However, it is independent of the number of pulses and the frequency of the stimulus train. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> also illustrate that no oscillatory state could be induced with a high number of pulses for stimulus trains of high frequency (i.e. low stimulation period).</p>

<title>Termination of collective pacemaker activity</title>
<p>A closer look at the high frequency range showed that it not only prevented the initiation of ectopic pacemaker activity, but can also cause its termination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In NRVM monolayers (3 biological replicates/monolayers), collective ectopic pacemaker activity was first initiated using a stimulus train of 3 pulses with a period of 500 <italic>ms</italic>. Once ongoing, 8 pulses in the high frequency range (5.000 <italic>Hz</italic> or period 200 <italic>ms</italic>) terminated the ectopic pacemaker activity and made the tissue go back to its resting state. When copying this experimental protocol <italic>in silico</italic>, qualitative correspondence was shown using 4 pulses with a period of 500 <italic>ms</italic> to initiate pacemaker activity, and 7 pulses with a period of 180 <italic>ms</italic> to terminate it. Note that both experimentally and computationally every pulse of the stimulus train is captured (orange traces), despite the fact that the voltage traces from points inside the illuminated region do not give that impression.</p>

<title>The collective nature of wave train-induced pacemaker activity</title>
<p>After exploring collective bi-stability in practice, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon. Bi-stability is a wide-spread phenomenon and can take place at the single cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Guevara (2003</xref>)), which would be the simplest assumption for our monolayer system as well. When this would be the case, all cells would become oscillatory under illumination. We tested this hypothesis by making use of one of the four parameters we investigated earlier: the illuminated area. This parameter shows a transition from the stationary state towards the oscillatory state (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) just like the light intensity parameter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) resulting in spontaneous oscillatory behaviour with waves emanating from the center of the illuminated area for a large area size and at a constant low light intensity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). These circumstances allowed us to compare the voltage traces between the center of the irradiated area and the bulk of the tissue, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic>. While the cells outside of the illuminated area showed oscillating membrane potentials those in the center of the illuminated region, i.e. those least affected by the coupling current of neighbouring cells, displayed a stable elevation of membrane potential. Hence, this implies that not all illuminated cells became oscillatory. We can therefore reject the simplest hypothesis of bi-stability at the single cell level, but have to speak of a collective phenomenon. It is for this reason that throughout the manuscript the observed effects are referred to as “collective” pacemaker activity.</p>

<title>Insight into pulse-dependent collective state transitions</title>
<p>Knowing that we are dealing with a collective phenomenon, we wanted to gain a deeper understanding in the observed pulse-dependent collective transitions from stationary towards oscillatory pacemaker activity. In order to achieve this goal, <italic>in silico</italic> analysis was performed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) because it offers the possibility to visualise all parameters relevant for the system.

<p>As was shown in all figures from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, illuminated cells do not show dampening oscillations when reaching the stationary state after a transition from the oscillatory state. This behaviour is justified when looking at a projection of the phase space of the model where the voltage <italic>V</italic> and the gating variable <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> for the rapid delayed outward rectifier <italic>K</italic><sup>+</sup> current were chosen for the x- and y-axis, respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). The stable fixed point (STA) is not located inside the stable limit cycle (OSC) (right panel), hence showing no Hopf bifurcation (left panel) with its associated damped oscillations. The two attractor regions (STA and OSC) were also reconstructed from experimental data and showed two distinct trajectories (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Since we are dealing with a high-dimensional phase space in the <italic>in silico</italic> model, the visualisation of trajectories in time and the corresponding dynamic behaviour is rather complex. However, from the two-dimensional projections onto the <italic>V</italic> and <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> variables, we can see what causes the frequency and pulse dependency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) of ectopic pacemaker activity initiation, as visualised in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>. Four different pairs of stimulation period and number of pulses were selected, corresponding to different behaviour areas in the parameter space slice for a fixed illumination intensity (1.72 <italic>mW /mm</italic><sup>2</sup>) and size of the illuminated area (67 pixels edge length) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). The first point (<italic>α</italic>) comes from the region that shows no transition towards collective pacemaker activity for a low number of pulses (2) and intermediate stimulation periods of 800 <italic>ms</italic>. The phase space projection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>) shows that the pulses cycle around the stable limit cycle, and return back to the stable fixed point, indicating that two pulses are not enough to move within the attractor zone of the stable limit cycle. When the number of pulses is increased to 4 (<italic>β</italic>), the attractor zone of the stable limit cycle is reached from the outside, and collective ectopic pacemaker activity is induced. After switching to a faster stimulation period of 250 <italic>ms</italic> and sticking to just 3 pulses (<italic>γ</italic>), the phase space trajectories end up inside the stable limit cycle, but still within the attractor zone. Hence, also this time collective pacemaker activity was induced. If we now increase the number of pulses again, this time to 8 (<italic>δ</italic>), we are inside the stable limit cycle, but move again out of the region of attraction. Rather than producing oscillations, the system returns to the stationary state along dimensions other than those shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref> (voltage and <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>), as evidenced by the phase space trajectory crossing itself. This return is mediated by the electrotonic current.</p>
<p>Thus, there is frequency selectivity due to the region of attraction of the stable limit cycle, where too low and too high frequencies result in stationary behaviour. Also pulse accumulation is shown, where more pulses move the system closer to the attractor region. However, this is not a Hopf bifurcation, because in that case the system would not return to the stationary state when the number of pulses exceeds a critical threshold.</p>

<title>Insight into the termination of ectopic pacemaker activity</title>
<p>Let us look once more at a cell inside the illuminated tissue undergoing a stimulus train with a short period of 180 <italic>ms</italic> from outside and extract all time-dependent variables. In response to a high number of stimuli (20 pulses), the time trace in the phase-space projection plot goes inside the limit cycle (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>) towards a quasi-steady-state, and returns back to the stationary state through a strangely curved line (black). This quasi-steady-state is hidden within the oscillatory trajectory and no pacemaker activity is initiated. When the number of pulses is increased from 20 to 40, the voltage trace shows exactly the same behaviour, indicating that the number of pulses has no influence on the mechanism that moves the tissue back to the stationary state (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). However, repolarisation reserve does have an influence, prolonging the transition when it is reduced (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 7</xref>). This effect can be observed either by moving further from the boundary of the illuminated region where the electrotonic influence from the non-illuminated region is weaker, or by introducing ionic changes, such as a reduction in <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> and/or <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>to</italic></sub>. For example, because the electrotonic influence is weaker in the center of the illuminated region, the voltage there is not pulled down toward the resting membrane potential as quickly as in cells at the border of the illuminated zone.</p>

<p>To understand what is going on, we studied single cell dynamics under illumination. We already know from <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> that we are dealing with a purely collective phenomenon. Therefore, the single cell dynamics itself showed nothing peculiar, i.e. a standard current-voltage relationship (IV) curve with a single stable equilibrium (not shown). To add a multicellular component to our single cell model we introduced a current that replicates the effect of cell coupling and its associated electrotonic influence. This so-called bias current equals the average in time and space of the current inside the illuminated region using wave trains with a period of 180 <italic>ms</italic> (the current produced during the quasi-steady-state in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). When this bias current is present, the IV curve of the single cell displays two stable equilibria and shows bi-stability (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-1</xref>). The second stable equilibrium cannot be reached with a single pulse, but needs a stimulus train and can only be reached with short stimulation periods (180 <italic>ms</italic>) and intermediate stimulation amplitudes (-20 <italic>mV</italic>) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-2</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on this result, we next applied global stimuli with a period of 180 <italic>ms</italic> and amplitudes -58, -20, and 50 <italic>mV</italic> to a virtual cardiomyocyte monolayer with an illuminated square in the center (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). These pulses were applied when the tissue was either in the oscillatory state (top two rows) or the stationary state (bottom two rows). The stimulus amplitude of -20 <italic>mV</italic> that was necessary to get the single cell with a bias current into the second stable equilibrium, also terminates oscillatory behaviour (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D-2</xref>) while the other two amplitudes of -58 and 50 <italic>mV</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D-1,3</xref>) don’t alter the behaviour of the tissue. However, when starting from the stationary state, the behaviour is opposite and the intermediate amplitude of -20 <italic>mV</italic> fails to induce collective oscillatory behaviour while the other two amplitudes do elicit this behaviour. We thus conclude that high stimulation frequencies and intermediate stimulus amplitudes are capable of terminating collective oscillatory behaviour by transitioning through a quasi-steady-state.</p>
<p>We call this kind of bi-stability capable of terminating collective oscillatory behaviour “<italic>hidden bistability</italic>” for two reasons: (1) Single cell bi-stability depends on electronic interactions. Hence it can be said that this bi-stability is “hidden” and only emerges in collective behaviour. (2) It’s possible to escape the region of attraction of the oscillatory trajectory through opposite paths.</p>

<title>It’s complex, but not as complex as it seems</title>
<p>While it may be believed that the observed phenomena and explanations are intrinsic to entangled interactions specific to the complexity of a biological sample (<italic>in vitro</italic>) and a realistic computational model (<italic>in silico</italic>), we show here that this is not the case. By reducing the model equations, we show that collective oscillatory behaviour is not limited to the specific case of NRVMs. We started from the initial NRVM equations and reduced them to contain only a single depolarising current (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Na</italic></sub>), two repolarising currents (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Kr</italic></sub> and the time-independent <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K</italic>1</sub>), and a spatially dependent optogenetic current (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>ChR</italic>2</sub>).

<p>Just like in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, the simplified model showed no initiation of collective pacemaker activity at a low number of 2 pulses and a low stimulation frequency of 0.444 <italic>Hz</italic> or a 2250-<italic>ms</italic> period or at a high number of 8 pulses and a high stimulation frequency of 1.666 <italic>Hz</italic> or a 600-<italic>ms</italic> period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). However, pacemaker activity was induced when applying 3 pulses and a low stimulation frequency or 2 pulses and a high stimulation frequency. At a low frequency, the phase space projection (again projected onto the <italic>V</italic> and <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> variable plane) shows that the limit cycle is approached from the outside, while at high frequencies it is approached from the inside. Altogether, these results show frequency selectivity and pulse accumulation in the simplified model (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). To explain the findings in the rightmost panel of <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>, we had a closer look at the single cell dynamics under high stimulation frequencies. As shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>, 4 pulses at a low frequency (1.000 <italic>Hz</italic> or a 1000-<italic>ms</italic> period) resulted in normal behaviour, but high frequency stimulation (2.000 <italic>Hz</italic> or a 500-<italic>ms</italic> period) pushed the cell towards a stably elevated membrane potential (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>).

<p>In this study, <italic>in vitro</italic> observations were combined with <italic>in silico</italic> modelling to study and gain mechanistic insight into collective electrophysiological behaviour in NRVM monolayers.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Firstly, we demonstrated the existence of transitions from stationary cardiac monolayers towards ones that show pacemaker activity coming from an illuminated region, which are induced by wave trains of external pulses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) as a manifestation of <bold>collective bi-stability</bold>. This transition between the two states is dependent on four variables: the light intensity applied to the illuminated region, the size of the illuminated region, the number of pulses of an incoming wave-train, and the frequency of the pulses of the incoming wave train (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 4</xref><bold><italic>, </italic></bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments were quantitatively reproduced <italic>in silico</italic>, thereby establishing a link between model and experiment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 4</xref><bold><italic>, </italic></bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>)).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Secondly, we studied the mechanisms underlying the initiation and termination of pacemaker activity. In the presence of a diffusion current (or bias current in the case of a single cell), the illuminated cells transition to a second equilibrium under high frequency pacing. Because this second equilibrium only appears in a coupled system (or in the presence of a bias current), we can also speak of a <bold>hidden bi-stability</bold>. Hence, hidden bi-stability (high vs. low stationary resting membrane) is shown to underlie the collective phenomena (stationary vs. oscillatory behaviour) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 6</xref> and <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 7</xref>).</p></list-item>

<p>Below, we compare these phenomena to different types of arrhythmic events and mechanisms of bi-stability in cardiac tissue, and extend the relevance of our mechanisms to spiking behaviour in neuronal and other biophysical systems.</p>

<title>Ectopic pacemaker activity in cardiology</title>
<p>The generation of ectopic beats is considered as one of the main mechanisms triggering and maintaining cardiac arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pogwizd et al. (1992</xref>)). In most cases, ectopic sources are believed to be a result of triggered activity, which can manifest itself as early afterdepolarizations (EADs) or delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Qu et al. (2014</xref>)). Such ectopic sources are typically initiated by high frequency pacing resulting in a <italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup> overload that triggers EADs and DADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lerman et al. (2024</xref>)). However, as we didn’t observe <italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup> overload, the phenomenon observed in this study resembles induced pacemaker activity instead. In contrast with ectopy, this pacemaker activity is initiated at low pacing frequencies. Therefore our findings might explain the phenomenon of bradycardia-induced triggered activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brachmann et al. (1983</xref>)). The initiation of oscillations in our monolayers is the result of the spatial dynamics of the system, which stands in contrast with the frequency dependency of EADs that can be explained on a single cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tran et al. (2009</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Qu et al. (2014</xref>)). Our optogenetic current is absent in normal cardiac tissue, but its associated depolarisation could be caused by other late activating inward currents, which are also essential in the induction of EADs or DADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Song et al. (2008</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Qu et al. (2014</xref>)): e.g. the late Na current (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Na,L</italic></sub>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Belardinelli et al. (2015</xref>)), reactivation of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>CaL</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tran et al. (2009</xref>)), or NCX activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Song et al. (2015</xref>)). In addition, collective bi-stability might be observed in the presence of oxidative stress, ischemia or chronic heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Belardinelli et al. (2015</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Shryock et al. (2013</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Undrovinas et al. (1999</xref>)), where there is depolarisation-induced automaticity (triggered activity) caused by a background current (e.g. <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Na,L</italic></sub>).</p>
<p>The ectopic pacemaker activity in this study is a direct result of the combination of single cell depolarisation with spatial effects. Due to the additional inward current produced by the activation of CheRiff, a single uncoupled illuminated cell goes to a steady depolarised state (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). However, in a multicellular environment there is a repolarising electrotonic coupling current working against this depolarising light-induced current. This repolarising current is a consequence of the interaction between depolarised and non-depolarised parts in the monolayer. By playing with the illumination intensity and the size of the illuminated region, we were able to balance these de- and re-polarising effects to create a bi-stable regime (STA vs. OSC). This also explains why there are no oscillations present in the center of a large illuminated region, since there the electrotonic current is lower than at its edges (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). On the other hand, if the electrotonic current is too strong, it will prevent depolarisation by the optogenetic current and, as a consequence, the system wil stay in the stationary state. The balancing of currents also explains why the oscillatory boundary moves closer to the edge of the illuminated region at higher light intensities, since under those circumstances the depolarising current will overpower the spatial effects. However, when the illumination is very strong, it is possible to have oscillations that don’t need to be induced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and can even come from the corners of the illuminated region (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 3</xref><bold><italic>, </italic></bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Teplenin et al. (2018</xref>)). This last-mentioned phenomenon appears because the curvature of the boundary between illuminated and not-illuminated regions influences the electrotonic current.</p>

<title>Interplay between microscopic (single cell) and macroscopic (monolayer) behaviour</title>
<p>Collective bi-stability, as described in the previous section, is a bi-stability between two distinct behaviours (stationary STA and oscillatory OSC behaviour) that occur at the macroscopic level (monolayer). However, by looking more deeply at the dynamics that happen at the microscopic level (single cell), we can get more insight into the underlying mechanism(s). At the single cell level, the dynamic transition between a stationary monolayer and one showing induced pacemaker activity relies on two main processes:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>For the initiation of pacemaker activity, pulse accumulation (at intermediate frequencies) is necessary to bring the system into the attracting region of the oscillatory state.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For the termination of pacemaker activity, an interaction takes place between “hidden” bistable dynamics and coupling currents at high frequencies.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Both these processes occur as a consequence of wave pulses outside of the illuminated region. At low frequencies, no oscillatory activity can be induced. At intermediate frequencies, it is possible to escape the attracting zone of the stationary state and cross the separatrix into the attracting zone of the oscillatory state. However, for even higher frequencies, the system gets pushed out of the attracting zone of the oscillatory state again and through hidden bi-stability it returns to the stationary state.</p>
<p>Our data on the termination mechanism of induced pacemaker activity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>) indicate that we are not dealing with classical STA-OSC bi-stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Winfree (2001</xref>)). In systems displaying classical bi-stability between a limit cycle and the resting state, pacemaker annihilation can be achieved by applying sufficiently high frequency voltage perturbations. Through pulse accumulation it is then possible to exit the basin of attraction in the reverse direction from which it was entered. In contrast, our system enters (from outside the limit cycle) and leaves (towards the inside of the limit cycle) the attraction zone in opposite directions. This was concluded from the absence of a Hopf bifurcation in our system (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>The seemingly fragile nature of hidden bi-stability might be a requirement for coexistence of excitable and bi-stable regimes. Otherwise, if the hills and dips of the N-shaped steady-state IV curve were large (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-1</xref>), they would have similar magnitudes as the large currents of fast ion channels, preventing the subtle interaction between these strong ionic cell currents and the small repolarising coupling currents (≈ 0.1 <italic>𝒫A</italic>).</p>
<p>Although the termination mechanism was shown to be amplitude-dependent (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-D</xref>), the appropriate perturbation amplitudes are “automatically” selected by a high frequency train of travelling waves of excitation without any <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge about the state of the system. This wave train terminated ectopic triggers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), which is in accordance with previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Moak and Rosen (1984</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Glikson et al. (2021</xref>)). These publications also showed that uniform high voltage shocks are unable to terminate ectopic sustained activity, similar to our findings (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<p>Although its manifestations are clear in a monolayer system, hidden bi-stability might be challenging to be observed in single cell patch-clamp experiments. In <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-1</xref>, the height of dips and hills of the N-shaped steady-state IV curve under bias current are ≈ 0.2<italic>𝒫A/𝒫F</italic>. While it is possible to perform patch-clamping on individual cells in a monolayer experiencing diffusion currents, measurements of small amplitudes can be hindered by the statistical and instrumental errors of voltage-clamp recordings. The voltage bi-stability we are looking for can, for example, easily be lost via a shift in current balance due to the non-zero resistance of the patch pipette in current clamp mode. This might explain why the phenomenon of hidden bi-stability has only rarely been reported, for example in an <italic>in silico</italic> study dedicated to myotony in muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cannon et al. (1993</xref>)).</p>

<title>Extrapolation and translation</title>
<p>All key aspects of the initiation and termination of induced pacemaker activity, i.e. the points itemized above, were also demonstrated in a simplified 3 variable reaction-diffusion model (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>, <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—figure 8</xref>), implicating the more general nature of this observed phenomenon. A rigorous mathematical analysis can be accomplished in future work, but might be challenging due to the lack of efficient analytical tools to describe fully developed limit cycle oscillations in reaction-diffusion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sherratt and Smith (2008</xref>)). Based on the reproduction of our results in such a simplified model, we showed that we don’t need the full complexity of an ionic cardiomyocyte model, enabling extrapolation and translation of our results towards other scientific disciplines.</p>
<p>Frequency-dependent initiation and termination of oscillatory activity is not exclusive to cardiac systems, but is well known in a variety of non-linear biophysical systems. For example, the actomyosin cortex in the social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> responds to short pulses of 3’,5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by damped oscillations in average actin content, thereby allowing fine time-selective responses to either internal (pseudopodia initiation) or external (cAMP release) perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Westendorf et al. (2013</xref>)). Moreover, in synthetic gene regulatory networks, subthreshold stimuli might be used to discriminate environmental stimuli (e.g. growth factor release, heat shock) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Guantes and Poyatos (2006</xref>)). Also neurons can differentiate external stimuli depending on their frequency. As mentioned in the introduction, the frequency-dependent initiation and termination of oscillatory activity is known as ‘<italic>resonance</italic>’ in neuroscience. It is interesting to compare the resonance properties of our system with those actively studied in neurons.</p>
<p>Resonant neurons, also known as resonate-and-fire neurons or type II excitability neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Izhikevich (2000</xref>)), are governed by sub-threshold oscillations initiated due to proximity of the resting state to a Hopf bifurcation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hutcheon and Yarom (2000</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Roach et al. (2018</xref>)). They react to a stimulus train as follows: The first pulse initiates a damped sub-threshold oscillation of the membrane potential, while the effect of the second pulse depends on its timing. If timed correctly, it adds to the first pulse and either increases the amplitude of the sub-threshold oscillation or evokes repetitive spiking (transition to a limit cycle). Thus, the response and spiking of the resonator neuron depends on the frequency content of the input. These types of spiking neurons are usually associated with Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Izhikevich (2000</xref>)). However, another type of bifurcation, a saddle-node-loop (SNL) bifurcation, is also capable of generating spiking neurons and allows a bi-stability regime, in which the stable state lies outside the limit cycle similar to our case (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>SNL bifurcations were previously identified in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hesse et al. (2017</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hesse and Schreiber (2019</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Schleimer et al. (2021</xref>)), in a model of transcriptional regulation of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ciliberto et al. (2005</xref>)), and in the design of combined genetic switches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Perez-Carrasco et al. (2018</xref>)). Our result might represent the emergent analogue of a SNL bifurcation with resonant transitions on a neuronal/non-linear network level. SNL bifurcations have already been identified in the networks of coupled Kuramoto limit cycle oscillators both in a broad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Martens et al. (2009</xref>); <bold><italic>Childs and Stro- gatz (2008</italic></bold>)) and in a neuroscience context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buendía et al. (2021</xref>)). In these studies, SNL bifurcations were identified using dimensionality reduction techniques while ignoring the whole wealth of transient and finite-size phenomena. Moreover the Kuramoto model is a model without many physical details, describing a weak forcing regime on an idealized limit cycle oscillator, in which oscillations cannot be destroyed but only phase shifted. In our case, we provide a more realistic biophysically motivated model, which allows a strong forcing regime and destruction of oscillations due to the phenomenon of hidden bi-stability. This gives us reason to believe that idealized Kuramoto models could possess resonant properties if augmented/modified with sufficient physical/biophysical details. SNL bifurcations and hidden bi-stability could also be studied in a range of other unexplored biophysical situations including high frequency stimulation for the termination of neuronal oscillations during Parkinson disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Touboul et al. (2020</xref>)), multi compartment cable computational models of the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schwemmer and Lewis (2012</xref>)), and bi-stability in neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> (<bold><italic>Le et al. (2006</italic></bold>)). Additional studies can be carried out in neuroscience by local optogenetic activation of depolarizing ion channels, both <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lu et al.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Using both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> models, we explored a mechanism for frequency-dependent initiation and termination of oscillatory activity (i.e. induced pacemaker activity) in non-homogeneous cardiac tissue. This mechanism could be extended to more general excitable systems and is in neuroscience also known under the term resonance. Our collective “resonance” mechanism could be used to study or control collective states in cardiac but also other excitable systems.</p>

<title>Preparation of monolayers of NRVMs expressing the light-activatable cation channel CheRiff</title>
<p>All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Animal Experiments Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center and carried out in accordance with Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Union on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. Monolayers of NRVMs were established as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Engels et al. (2015</xref>). Briefly, the hearts were excised from anaesthetised 2-day-old Wistar rats.

The resulting cell suspension was enriched for cardiomyocytes by preplating for 120 minutes in a humidified incubator at 37<sup>°</sup>C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> using Primaria culture dishes (Becton Dickinson, Breda, the Netherlands). Finally, the cells were seeded on round glass coverslips (<italic>d</italic> = 15 mm; Gerhard Menzel, Braunschweig, Germany) coated with bovine fibronectin (100 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) to establish confluent monolayers. After incubation overnight in an atmosphere of humidified 95% air-5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37<sup>°</sup>C, these monolayers were treated with Mitomycin-C (10 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hours to minimise proliferation of the non-cardiomyocytes. At day 4 of culture, the NRVM monolayers were incubated for 20-24 h with lentiviral vector particles encoding CheRiff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hochbaum et al.

<title>Optical voltage mapping and patterned illumination of NRVM monolayers</title>
<p>After 8-10 days of culturing, NRVM monolayers were optically mapped using the voltage-sensitive dye di-4-ANBDQBS (52.5 <italic>μ</italic>M final concentration; ITK diagnostics, Uithoorn, the Netherlands) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feola et al.

The field of view was 16 × 16 mm resulting in a spatial resolution of 160 <italic>μ</italic>m/pixel. For targeted illumination of monolayers the setup was optically conjugated to a digitally controlled micro-mirror device (DMD), the Polygon 400 (Mightex Systems, Toronto, ON), with a high power blue (470 nm) LED (BLS-LCS-0470-50-22-H, Mightex Systems). Before starting the actual experiments, all monolayers were mapped during 1-Hz electrical point stimulation to check baseline conditions. Electrical stimulation was performed by applying 10-ms-long rectangular electrical pulses with an amplitude of 8 V to a bipolar platinum electrode with a spacing of 1.5 mm between anode and cathode. Only cultures with an action potential duration (APD) at 80% repolarization (APD<sub>80</sub>) below 350 <italic>ms</italic> and a conduction velocity (CV) above 18 <italic>cm/s</italic> were used for further experiments. Stimuli were applied in trains that varied in number and period. Whenever the outcome was reproducible three consecutive times in a single monolayer, it was counted as successful and included as one measurement in the total dataset. The constant light intensity was varied in the range of (0.03125-0.25 <italic>mW /mm</italic><sup>2</sup>) to search the critical value for the bi-stable regime. For experiments in which the light intensity was varied the rectangular-shaped area of illumination was in the range of 4 × 4 to 6 × 6 mm. The highest achievable irradiation intensity (0.3125 <italic>mW /mm</italic><sup>2</sup>) was used to perform size modulation experiments.

<p>The forward Euler method was used to integrate the equations with a time step Δ<italic>t</italic> = 0.01<italic>ms</italic> and a centered finite-differencing scheme to discretise the Laplacian with a space step of Δ<italic>x</italic> = 0.0625<italic>mm</italic>. The total computational domain size was 256 × 256 grid points while the square with the “background” current consisted of 80 × 80 grid points. To create stationary initial conditions, the model was integrated for 2 minutes before a train of stimuli was applied from the upper border of the domain.</p>

The agreement between computational models and experimental observations provides a <bold>convincing</bold> level of evidence that wave train-induced pacemaker activity can originate in continuously depolarized tissue, with the limitation that there may be differences between depolarization arising from constant optogenetic stimulation, as opposed to pathophysiological tissue depolarization.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Teplenin and coworkers assesses the combined effects of localized depolarization and excitatory electrical stimulation in myocardial monolayers. They study the electrophysiological behaviour of cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes expressing the light-gated cation channel Cheriff, allowing them to induce local depolarization of varying area and amplitude, the latter titrated by the applied light intensity. In addition, they used computational modeling to screen for critical parameters determining state transitions, and for dissecting the underlying mechanisms. Two stable states, thus bistability, could be induced upon local depolarization and electrical stimulation, one state characterized by a constant membrane voltage and a second spontaneously firing, thus oscillatory state. The resulting 'state' of the monolayer was dependent on the duration and frequency of electrical stimuli, as well as the size of the illuminated area and the applied light intensity determining the degree of depolarization as well as the steepness of the local voltage gradient. In addition to the induction of oscillatory behaviour, they also tested frequency-dependent termination of induced oscillations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data from optogenetic experiments and computational modelling provide quantitative insights into the parameter space determining the induction of spontaneous excitation in the monolayer. The most important findings can also be reproduced using a strongly reduced computational model, suggesting that the observed phenomena might be more generally applicable.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the study is thoroughly performed and provides interesting mechanistic insights into scenarios of ventricular arrhythmogenesis in the presence of localized depolarized tissue areas, the translational perspective of the study remains relatively vague. In addition, the chosen theoretical approach and the way the data is presented might make it difficult for the wider community of cardiac researchers to understand the significance of the study.</p>

<p>The provided revisions address some of the raised concerns, but they do not change my general assessment of the paper, including its strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>In the presented manuscript, Teplenin and colleagues use both electrical pacing and optogenetic stimulation to create a reproducible, controllable source of ectopy in cardiomyocyte monolayers. To accomplish this, they use a careful calibration of electrical pacing characteristics (i.e., frequency, number of pulses) and illumination characteristics (i.e., light intensity, surface area) to show that there exists a &quot;sweet spot&quot; where oscillatory excitations can emerge proximal to the optogenetically depolarized region following electrical pacing cessation, akin to pacemaker cells. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that a high-frequency electrical wave-train can be used to terminate these oscillatory excitations. The authors observed this oscillatory phenomenon both in vitro (using neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocyte monolayers) and in silico (using a computational action potential model of the same cell type). These are surprising findings and provide a novel approach for studying triggered activity in cardiac tissue.</p>
<p>The study is extremely thorough and one of the more memorable and grounded applications of cardiac optogenetics in the past decade. One of the benefits of the authors' &quot;two-prong&quot; approach of experimental preps and computational models is that they could probe the number of potential variable combinations much deeper than through in vitro experiments alone. The strong similarities between the real-life and computational findings suggest that these oscillatory excitations are consistent, reproducible, and controllable.</p>
<p>Triggered activity, which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac sudden death, has been largely contributed to sub-cellular phenomena, such as early or delayed afterdepolarizations, and thus to date has largely been studied in isolated single cardiomyocytes. However, these findings have been difficult to translate to tissue- and organ-scale experiments, as well-coupled cardiac tissue has notably different electrical properties. This underscores the significance of the study's methodological advances: use of a constant depolarizing current in a subset of (illuminated) cells to reliably result in triggered activity could facilitate the more consistent evaluation of triggered activity at various scales. An experimental prep that is both repeatable and controllable (i.e., both initiated and terminated through the same means) is a boon for further inquiry.</p>
<p>The authors also substantially explored phase space and single cell analyses to document how this &quot;hidden&quot; bi-stable phenomenon can be uncovered during emergent collective tissue behavior. Calibration and testing of different aspects (e.g.: light intensity, illuminated surface area, electrical pulse frequency, electrical pulse count) and other deeper analyses, as illustrated in Figures S3-S8 and Video S1, are significant and commendable.</p>
<p>Given the study is computational, it is surprising that the authors did not replicate their findings using well-validated adult ventricular cardiomyocyte action potential models, such ten Tusscher 2006 or O'Hara 2011. This may have felt out-of-scope, given the nice alignment of rat cardiomyocyte data between in vitro and in silico experiments. However, it would have been helpful peace-of-mind validation, given the significant ionic current differences between neonatal rat and adult ventricular tissue. It is not fully clear whether the pulse trains could have resulted in the same bi-stable oscillatory behavior, given the longer APD of humans relative to rats. The observed phenomenon certainly would be frequency-dependent and would have required tedious calibration for a new cell type, albeit partially mitigated by the relative ease of in silico experiments.</p>
<p>There are likely also mechanistic differences between this optogenetically-tied oscillatory behavior and triggered activity observed in other studies. This is because the constant light-elicited depolarizing current is disrupting the typical resting cardiomyocyte state, thereby altering the balance between depolarizing ionic currents (such as Na+ and Ca2+) and repolarizing ionic currents (such as K+ and Ca2+). The oscillatory excitations appear to later emerge at the border of the illuminated region and non-stimulated surrounding tissue, which is likely an area of high source-sink mismatch. The authors appear to acknowledge differences in this oscillatory behavior and previous sub-cellular triggered activity research in their discussion of ectopic pacemaker activity, which are canonically observed in genetic, pharmacologic, or pathological ionic conditions. Regardless, it is exciting to see new ground being broken in this difficult-to-characterize experimental space, even if the method illustrated here may not necessarily be broadly applicable.</p>

<p>I have read the authors' rebuttal to our earlier comments and do not have any further questions or comments. Thank you for implementing the minor improvements to Figure visualizations and for creating Video S1 to accompany the article.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback, as well as for recognizing the conceptual and technical strengths of our work. We are especially pleased that our integrated use of optogenetics, electrical pacing, and computational modelling was seen as a rigorous and innovative approach to investigating spontaneous excitability in cardiac tissue.</p>
<p>At the core of our study was the decision to focus exclusively on neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. This ensured a tightly controlled and consistent environment across experimental and computational settings, allowing for direct comparison and deeper mechanistic insight. While extending our findings to adult or human cardiomyocytes would enhance translational relevance, such efforts are complicated by the distinct ionic properties and action potential dynamics of these cells, as also noted by Reviewer #2. For this foundational study, we chose to prioritize depth and clarity over breadth.</p>
<p>Our computational domain was designed to faithfully reflect the experimental system. The strong agreement between both domains is encouraging and supports the robustness of our framework. Although some degree of theoretical abstraction was necessary (thereby sometimes making it a bit harder to read), it reflects the intrinsic complexity of the collective behaviours we aimed to capture such as emergent bi-stability. To make these ideas more accessible, we included simplified illustrations, a reduced model, and extensive supplementary material.</p>
<p>A key insight from our work is the emergence of oscillatory behaviour through interaction of illuminated and non-illuminated regions. Rather than replicating classical sub-cellular triggered activity, this behaviour arises from systems-level dynamics shaped by the imposed depolarizing current and surrounding electrotonic environment. By tuning illumination and local pacing parameters, we could reproducibly induce and suppress these oscillations, thereby providing a controllable platform to study ectopy as a manifestation of spatial heterogeneity and collective dynamics.</p>
<p>Altogether, our aim was to build a clear and versatile model system for investigating how spatial structure and pacing influence the conditions under which bistability becomes apparent in cardiac tissue. We believe this platform lays strong groundwork for future extensions into more physiologically and clinically relevant contexts.</p>
<p>In revising the manuscript, we carefully addressed all points raised by the reviewers. We have also responded to each of their specific comments in detail, which are provided below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the Authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Please find my specific comments and suggestions below:</p>
<p>(1) Line 64: When first introduced, the concept of 'emergent bi-stability' may not be clear to the reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur that the full breadth of the concept of emergent bi-stability may not be immediately clear upon first mention. Nonetheless, its components have been introduced separately: “emergent” was linked to multicellular behaviour in line 63, while “bi-stability” was described in detail in lines 39–56. We therefore believe that readers could form an intuitive understanding of the combined term, which will be further clarified as the manuscript develops. To further ease comprehension of the reader, we have added the following clarification to line 64:</p>
<p>“Within this dynamic system of cardiomyocytes, we investigated emergent bi-stability (a concept that will be explained more thoroughly later on) in cell monolayers under the influence of spatial depolarization patterns.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Lines 67-80: While the introduction until line 66 is extremely well written, the introduction of both cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac optogenetics could be improved. It is especially surprising that miniSOG is first mentioned as a tool for optogenetic depolarisation of cardiomyocytes, as the authors would probably agree that Channelrhodopsins are by far the most commonly applied tools for optogenetic depolarisation (please also refer to the literature by others in this respect). In addition, miniSOG has side effects other than depolarisation, and thus cannot be the tool of choice when not directly studying the effects of oxidative stress or damage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is absolutely correct in noting that channelrhodopsins are the most commonly applied tools for optogenetic depolarisation. We introduced miniSOG primarily for historical context: the effects of specific depolarization patterns on collective pacemaker activity were first observed with this tool (Teplenin et al., 2018). In that paper, we also reported ultralong action potentials, occurring as a side effect of cumulative miniSOG-induced ROS damage. In the following paragraph (starting at line 81), we emphasize that membrane potential can be controlled much better using channelrhodopsins, which is why we employed them in the present study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 78: I appreciate the concept of 'high curvature', but please always state which parameter(s) you are referring to (membrane voltage in space/time, etc?).</p>

<p>(5) Line 84-85: 'these ion channels allow the cells to respond' - please describe the channel used; and please correct: the channels respond to light, not the cells. Re-ordering this paragraph may help, because first you introduce channels for depolarization, then you go back to both de- and hyperpolarization. On the same note, which channels can be used for hyperpolarization of cardiomyocytes? I am not aware of any, even WiChR shows depolarizing effects in cardiomyocytes during prolonged activation (Vierock et al. 2022). Please delete: 'through a direct pathway' (Channelrhodopsins a directly light-gated channels, there are no pathways involved).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We realised that the confusion arose from our use of incorrect terminology: we mistakenly wrote hyperpolarisation instead of repolarisation. In addition to channelrhodopsins such as WiChR, other tools can also induce a repolarising effect, including light-activatable chloride pumps (e.g., JAWS). However, to improve clarity, we recognize that repolarisation is not relevant to our manuscript and therefore decided to remove its mention (see below). Regarding the reported depolarising effects of WiChR in Vierock et al. (2022), we speculate that these may arise either from the specific phenotype of the cardiomyocytes used in the study, i.e. human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial myocytes (aCMs), or from the particular ionic conditions applied during patch-clamp recordings (e.g., a bath solution containing 1 mM KCl). Notably, even after prolonged WiChR activation, the aCMs maintained a strongly negative maximum diastolic potential of approximately –55 mV.</p>
<p>“Although effects of illuminating miniSOG with light might lead to formation of depolarised areas, it is difficult to control the process precisely since it depolarises cardiomyocytes indirectly. Therefore, in this manuscript, we used light-sensitive ion channels to obtain more refined control over cardiomyocyte depolarisation. These ion channels allow the cells to respond to specific wavelengths of light, facilitating direct depolarisation (Ördög et al. (2021, 2023)). By inducing cardiomyocyte depolarisation only in the illuminated areas, optogenetics enables precise spatiotemporal control of cardiac excitability, an attribute we exploit in this manuscript (Appendix 2 Figure 1).”</p>

<p>(6) Figure 1: What would be the y-axis of the 'energy-like curves' in B? What exactly did you plot here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The graphs in Figure 1B are schematic representations intended to clarify the phenomenon for the reader. They do not depict actual data from any simulation or experiment. We clarified this misunderstanding by specifying that Figure 1B is a schematic representation of the effects at play in this paper.</p>
<p>“(B) Schematic representation showing how light intensity influences collective behaviour of excitable systems, transitioning between a stationary state (STA) at low illumination intensities and an oscillatory state (OSC) at high illumination intensities. Bi-stability occurs at intermediate light intensities, where transitions between states are dependent on periodic wave train properties. TR. OSC, transient oscillations.”</p>
<p>To expand slightly beyond the paper: our schematic representation was inspired by a common visualization in dynamical systems used to illustrate bi-stability (for an example, see Fig. 3 in Schleimer, J. H., Hesse, J., Contreras, S. A., &amp; Schreiber, S. (2021). Firing statistics in the bistable regime of neurons with homoclinic spike generation. Physical Review E, 103(1), 012407.). In this framework, the y-axis can indeed be interpreted as an energy landscape, which is related to a probability measure through the Boltzmann distribution: <inline-formula id="sa3equ1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-107072-sa3-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>. Here, p denotes the probability of occupying a particular state (STA or OSC). This probability can be estimated from the area (BCL × number of pulses) falling within each state, as shown in Fig. 4C. Since an attractor corresponds to a high-probability state, it naturally appears as a potential well in the landscape.</p>

<p>We would like to clarify that optical maps were recorded for every experiment, and all experimental traces of cardiac monolayer activity were derived from these maps. We agree with the reviewer that the voltage dynamics in the transition zone are particularly interesting. However, we selected the data representations that, in our view, best highlight the main mechanisms. When we analysed full voltage profiles, they didn’t add extra insights to this main mechanism.

<p>(10) Lines 156-157: Why was the model not adapted to match the biophysical properties (e.g., kinetics, ion selectivity, light sensitivity) of Cheriff?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The model was not adapted to the biophysical properties of Cheriff, because this would entail a whole new study involving extensive patch-clamping experiments, fitting, and calibration to model the correct properties of the ion channel. Beyond considerations of time efficiency, incorporating more specific modelling parameters would not change the essence of our findings. While numeric parameter ranges might shift, the core results would remain unchanged. This is a result of our experimental design where we applied constant illumination of long duration (6s or longer), thus making a difference in kinetical properties of an optogenetic tool irrelevant. In addition, we were able to observe qualitatively similar phenomena using many other depolarising optogenetic tools (e.g. ChR2, ReaChR, CatCh and more) in our <italic>in-vitro experiments.</italic> We ended up with Cheriff as our optotool-of-choice for the practical reasons of good light-sensitivity and a non-overlapping spectrum with our fluorescent dyes.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We did not aim for quantitative correspondence between the computational model and the biological experiments, but rather for qualitative agreement and mechanistic insight (see line 157). Qualitative comparisons are computationally obtained in a whole range of different intensities, as demonstrated in the 3D diagram of Fig. 4C. We wanted to demonstrate that at one fixed light intensity (chosen to be 1.7124 mW/mm^2 for the most clear effect), it was possible for all three states (STA, OSC. TR. OSC.) to coexist depending on the number of pulses and their period.

<p>We appreciate this comment, which prompted us to revisit on our text. We realised that some sections could be worded more clearly, and we also identified an error in the legend of Supplementary Figure 7. The corresponding corrections are provided below:</p>
<p>“However, repolarisation reserve does have an influence, prolonging the transition when it is reduced (Appendix 2 Figure 7). This effect can be observed either by moving further from the boundary of the illuminated region, where the electrotonic influence from the non-illuminated region is weaker, or by introducing ionic changes, such as a reduction in I<sub>Ks</sub> and/or I<sub>to</sub>. For example, because the electrotonic influence is weaker in the center of the illuminated region, the voltage there is not pulled down toward the resting membrane potential as quickly as in cells at the border of the illuminated zone.”</p>

<p>“Figure 7. The effect of ionic changes on the termination of pacemaker activity.

<p>Our choice of parameters was guided by the dynamical properties of the illuminated cells as well as by illustrative purposes. The value of –58 mV corresponds to the stimulation threshold of the model. The values of 50 mV and –20 mV match those used for single-cell stimulation (Figure 8C2, right panel), producing excitable and bistable dynamics, respectively.

<p>(22) Line 344 and elsewhere: 'diffusion current' - This is probably not the correct terminology for gap-junction mediated currents. Please rephrase.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A diffusion current is a mathematical formulation for a gap junction mediated current here, so , depending on the background of the reader, one of the terms might be used focusing on different aspects of the results. In a mathematical modelling context one often refers to a diffusion current because cardiomyocytes monolayers and tissues can be modelled using a reaction-diffusion equation. From the context of fine-grain biological and biophysical details, one uses the term gap-junction mediated current. Our choice is motivated by the main target audience we have in mind, namely interdisciplinary researchers with a core background in the mathematics/physics/computer science fields.</p>
<p>However, to not exclude our secondary target audience of biological and medical readers we now clarified the terminology, drawing the parallel between the different fields of study at line 79:</p>
<p>“These waves resulted from the interplay between the diffusion current (also known in biology/biophysics as the gap junction mediated current) and the bi-stable state that was induced in the illuminated region.”</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Coupling currents are indeed small compared to cellular currents. This can be inferred from the I-V curve shown in Figure 8C1, which dips below 0 and creates bi-stability only because of the small coupling current. If the coupling current were larger, the system would revert to a monostable regime. To make this more concrete, we have now provided the exact value of the coupling current used in Figure 8C1.</p>
<p>“Otherwise, if the hills and dips of the N-shaped steady-state IV curve were large (Figure 8C-1), they would have similar magnitudes as the large currents of fast ion channels, preventing the subtle interaction between these strong ionic cell currents and the small repolarising coupling currents (-0.103649 ≈ 0.1 pA).”</p>

<p>We would like to refer the reviewer to our response to comment (20) regarding how we model voltage shocks. In the context of line 426, a typical voltage shock corresponds to a tissue-wide stimulus of 50 mV.

<p>(26) Lines 429 ff: 0.2pA/pF would correspond to 20 pA for a small cardiomyocyte of 100 pF, this current should be measurable using patch-clamp recordings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In trying to be succinct, we may have caused some confusion. The difference between the dips (<italic>≈</italic>-0.07 pA/pF) and hills (_≈_0.11 pA/pF) is approximately 0.18 pA/pF. For a small cardiomyocyte, this corresponds to deviations from zero of roughly ±10 pA. Considering that typical RMS noise levels in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings range from 2-10 pA , it is understandable that detecting these peaks and dips in an I-V curve (average current after holding a voltage for an extended period)  is difficult. Achieving statistical significance would therefore require patching a large number of cells.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Given the deluge of conditions to consider, there are several areas of improvement possible in communicating the authors' findings. I have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) Please change &quot;pulse train&quot; straight pink bar OR add stimulation marks (such as &quot;*&quot;, or individual pulse icons) to provide better visual clarity that the applied stimuli are &quot;short ON, long OFF&quot; electrical pulses. I had significant initial difficulty understanding what the pulse bars represented in Figures 2, 3, 4A-B, etc. This may be partially because stimuli here could be either light (either continuous or pulsed) or electrical (likely pulsed only). To me, a solid &amp; unbroken line intuitively denotes a continuous stimulation. I understand now that the pink bar represents the entire pulse-train duration, but I think readers would be better served with an improvement to this indicator in some fashion. For instance, the &quot;phases&quot; were much clearer in Figures 7C and 8D because of how colour was used on the Vm(t) traces. (How you implement this is up to you, though!)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have addressed the reviewer’s concern and updated the figures by marking each external pulse with a small vertical line (see below).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Please label the electrical stimulation location (akin to the labelled stimulation marker in circle 2 state in Figure 1A) in at least Figures 2 and 4A, and at most throughout the manuscript. It is unclear which &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;pixel&quot; the pulse-train is originating from, although I've assumed it's the left edge of the 2D tissue (both in vitro and silico). This would help readers compare the relative timing of dark blue vs. orange optical signal tracings and to understand how the activation wavefront transverses the tissue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We indicated the pacing electrode in the optical voltage recordings with a grey asterisk. For the <italic>in silico</italic> simulations, the electrode was assumed to be far away, and the excitation was modelled as a parallel wave originating from the top boundary, indicated with a grey zone.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Given the prevalence of computational experiments in this study, I suggest considering making a straightforward video demonstrating basic examples of STA, OSC, and TR.OSC states. I believe that a video visualizing these states would be visually clarifying to and greatly appreciated by readers. Appendix 2 Figure 3 would be the no-motion visualization of the examples I'm thinking of (i.e., a corresponding stitched video could be generated for this). However, this video-generation comment is a suggestion and not a request.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included a video showing all relevant states, which is now part of the Supplementary Material.</p>
<p>(4) Please fix several typos that I found in the manuscript:</p>
<p>(4A) Line 279: a comma is needed after i.e. when used in: &quot;peculiar, i.e. a standard&quot;. However, this is possibly stylistic (discard suggestion if you are consistent in the manuscript).</p>

<p>(4C) Line 501: two periods at end of sentence &quot;scientific purposes..&quot; .</p>
