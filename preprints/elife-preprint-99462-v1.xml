<title>Abstract</title><p>Accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the hippocampus triggers cognitive memory decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The incidence and mortality of sporadic AD were tightly associated with diabetes and hyperlipidemia, while the exact linked molecular is uncertain. Here, we reported that serum Kallistatin concentrations were meaningfully higher in AD patients, with a higher concentration of fasting blood glucose and triglyceride. In addition, the constructed Kallistatin-transgenic (KAL-TG) mice defined its cognitive memory impairment phenotype and lower LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons accompanied by increased Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Kallistatin could directly bind to the Notch1 receptor and thereby upregulate BACE1 expression by inhibiting PPARγ signaling, resulting in Aβ cleavage and production. Besides, Kallistatin could promote the phosphorylation of tau by activating GSK-3β. Fenofibrate, a hypolipidemic drug, could alleviate cognitive memory impairment by down-regulating Aβ and tau phosphorylation of KAL-TG mice. Collectively, our data clarified a novel mechanism for Aβ accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation regulation by Kallistatin, which might play a crucial role in linking metabolic syndromes and cognitive memory deterioration, and suggested that fenofibrate might have the potential for treating metabolism-related AD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common irreversible neurodegenerative disease involving dementia in the elderly, is characterized by progressive deterioration of cognitive memory. Pathologically, the characteristic hallmarks of AD are extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Aβ cascade and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein are two main hypotheses related to AD. The Aβ cascade hypothesis dominates that overproduction of Aβ changes the normal cellular state, resulting in synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation, eventually causing memory loss in AD and dementia patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Aβ peptides are produced from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1) and γ-secretase, therefore this cleavage step contributes heavily to AD pathology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. BACE1 is one of the most potential therapeutic targets. Some potent BACE1 inhibitors have advanced to late stages in clinical trials, highlighting the significance of BACE1 in the Aβ generation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Tau is a protein found in microtubules. It exists physiologically in axons and regulates microtubule dynamics and axonal transport <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Tau goes through a multi-step process in AD, transitioning from a natively unfolded monomer to massive aggregated aggregates like NFTs, another hallmark of AD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. One of the central kinases responsible for initiating tau phosphorylation is glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and Wnt signaling play a vital role in activating GSK-3β and GSK-3β-mediated tau phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The physiological mechanisms governing their relationship are still poorly understood.</p>
<p>There has been a close relationship between metabolic disorders and cognitive impairment across the AD spectrum <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Accounting for nearly 95% of AD patients were categorized as sporadic ones, whose increasing incidence and mortality were tightly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, and hyperlipidemia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. There was about 37 percent comorbidity between AD and diabetes reported by the Alzheimer’s Association Report <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. As a result of the strong association and share mechanism between AD and T2DM, AD was termed “Type 3 Diabetes” by some researchers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Several studies demonstrate that diabetes confers a 1.6-fold increased risk of developing dementia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Similarly, central obesity and high body mass index (BMI) during middle age have about 3.5 times increased risk of dementia later in life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, control of blood glucose and lipids is expected to be a strategy for preventing or moderating cognitive decline in aging. Nevertheless, the exact link and key associated regulator between metabolic abnormalities and AD is still unclear.</p>
<p>Kallistatin was a serine proteinase inhibitor, previously identified as a tissue kallikrein-binding protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. It was predominantly produced in the liver and widely expressed in the body tissues and conferred anti-angiogenesis, anti-fibrosis, anti-oxidative stress, and anti-tumor growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Kallistatin was found increased in patients with obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The concentration of Kallistatin was positively correlated with the triglyceride glucose index <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, which was proven to be an independent risk factor for dementia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In addition, our previous study revealed that the concentration of serum Kallistatin in T2DM patients was significantly increased and further clarified that Kallistatin suspended wound healing in T2DM patients by promoting local inflammation, which suggested that Kallistatin played a critical role in the progression of T2DM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our recent research has found that kallistatin can cause memory and cognitive dysfunction by disrupting the glutamate-glutamine cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>According to the relationship between T2DM, AD and Kallistatin, we constructed Kallistatin transgenic (KAL-TG) mice to explore whether it could cause cognitive impairment through up-regulation of Aβ production. Taken together, our results suggest that a novel regulatory mechanism of Aβ production and tau protein hyperphosphorylation by Kallistatin is involved in the progression of metabolic abnormalities-related AD.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Kallistatin was increased in AD patients and AD model mice</title>
<p>To explore the relevance of AD in T2DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A</xref>), we first performed a GAD disease enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in neurons of T2DM and normal controls, and found AD was closely related to T2DM (GSE161355). We further identified enrichment of the Serpin family protein domain using PFAM analysis on the David database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1B</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>). Our previous studies found that Kallistatin (serpin family a member 4) was elevated in the serum of T2DM patients and caused an adverse prognosis of diabetes complications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. We have collected 11 serum samples of dementia patients from Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital and found that the concentration of Kallistatin was higher compared to the normal control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Here, we enrolled 56 AD patients and 61 healthy controls from four hospitals in Guangdong province to further explore the potential relevance of Kallistatin and AD. The Clinical and biochemical characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">S2</xref>. In addition, we measured the serum Kallistatin (12.78±2.80 μg/ml) content in patients with AD was higher than in normal controls (9.78±1.93 μg/ml) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Likewise, the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and triglyceride (TG) were more elevated in AD patients than in healthy human (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We further grouped all the AD patients according to whether they had diabetes, then found Kallistatin (13.79±3.05 μg/ml) and TG content were further elevated in AD patients with diabetes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>). Similarly, Kallistatin expression was increased in AD model mouse SAMP8 compared with its control mouse SAMR1 in hippocampus tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1C-D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that Kallistatin concentration was increased in metabolic abnormalities-related AD patients.</p>

<title>Kallistatin could impair cognitive memory in mice</title>
<p>The above experiments proved that Kallistatin increased in AD patients and AD model mice. Then, we constructed KAL-TG mice and assessed their behavioral performance through the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests. Notably, the latency to escape platform was increased, and crossing platform times, time in percent, and spontaneous alternation were significantly decreased in KAL-TG mice compared with age-matched WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-I</xref>). Furthermore, long-term potentiation (LTP) was measured by whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of CA1 neurons in acute hippocampal slices of KAL-TG and WT mice to determine the changes in hippocampal synapses. LTP of KAL-TG mice was significantly lower than WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). These results showed Kallistatin could impair cognitive memory in mice.</p>

<title>Kallistatin promoted Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation</title>
<p>We evaluated Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation in these experimental mice hippocampus tissues by immunohistochemistry staining and western blot. Predictably, the plaque density and tau phosphorylation of KAL-TG mice were much higher than age-matched WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>, 3A-D). Consistent with this result, ELISA detection of Aβ42 contents in hippocampus tissue showed that Aβ production was extraordinarily increased in KAL-TG mice compared to WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). These results suggested that Kallistatin promoted Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation.</p>

Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) undergoes proteolytic processing to generate peptide fragments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase, composed of presenilin 1 (PS1), nicastrin, and Pen-2, were crucial enzymes for Aβ generation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. We determined the levels of APP, BACE1, and PS1 in hippocampus tissue. BACE1 protein and mRNA accumulate to higher levels in KAL-TG mice compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>, S2D, whereas no significant difference appeared in APP, PS1, and α-secretases (ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM17) expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, S2E). Consistent with the above results, the activity of BACE1 was increased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), while PS1 activity was not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2F</xref>). Similarly, the expression and activity of BACE1 were further determined to increase in primary mouse neurons, and HT22 cells transfected with Kallistatin adenovirus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>-C, S3A-C), and PS1 expression and activity were still not changed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, 5D, S3A). Furthermore, the effect of Kallistatin was attenuated by the BACE1 inhibitor (verubecestat) or siBACE1 03, the most effective one (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E-F</xref>, S3D). Therefore, these results indicated that Kallistatin could promote Aβ generation through upregulating BACE1 expression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that Kallistatin is a novel regulator of amyloid-β plaque accumulation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and metabolic abnormalities-related cognitive memory impairment. We proved that Kallistatin was increased in the serum of AD and diabetes-related AD patients and the hippocampus of AD model mice. In addition, the constructed KAL-TG mice defined its cognitive memory impairment phenotype and lower LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons accompanied by increased Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Kallistatin transcriptionally upregulates BACE1 expression by suppressing the transcriptional repressor PPARγ, resulting in Aβ cleavage and production. Most importantly, our studies proved Kallistatin could bind to the Notch1 receptor directly and activate the Notch1/HES1 pathway, causing the decrease of PPARγ, overproduction of BACE1, and elevated Aβ42 generation. Moreover, Kallistatin could induce tau phosphorylation by activating GSK-3β, which result from the inhibition of LRP6. Finally, prolonged stimulation with high concentrations of Kallistatin could impair cognitive memory in mice. Lastly, the hypolipidemic drug-fenofibrate decreasing of Aβ expression, phosphorylation of tau, and the serum Kallistatin level of KAL-TG mice, causing alleviating memory and cognitive impairment. For the first time, these observations established an association between high Kallistatin levels and metabolic abnormalities-related AD, and provided a new drug candidate (fenofibrate) for AD patients with metabolic syndromes.</p>
<p>Growing shreds of evidence suggest that Diabetes mellitus and AD are closely linked. Approximately 80% of AD subjects are insulin resistant or T2DM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>; additionally, the T2DM patients had a higher risk of up to 73% of dementia than the healthy control population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In line with these observations, the process of cognitive decline in T2DM patients appears to begin in the prediabetic phase of insulin resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. We performed a GAD disease enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in neurons of T2DM and normal controls, which showed AD is closely related to T2DM, besides identified enrichment of the Serpin family protein domain using PFAM analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A, B</xref>). We and other researchers found that Kallistatin (which belongs to the Serpin family) was increased in T2DM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Although the interrelationship between Kallistatin and AD has not been reported to date, we have enough reason to speculate Kallistatin might be one of the critical molecules which could establish the relationship between Alzheimer’s disease and Diabetes. Our data suggested that AD patients indeed have metabolic disorders and elevated Kalllistatin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>-D, S1C-D). In addition, memory cognitive function and synaptic plasticity of KAL-TG mice were impaired (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>-J). These results suggested that Kallistatin was a new link between AD and diabetes.</p>
<p>A hallmark of AD is the aggregation of Aβ into amyloid plaques and tau phosphorylation in patients’ brains. Aβ, a small peptide with a high propensity to form aggregates, is widely believed to be central and initial to the pathogenesis of the disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Correspondingly, we discovered Kallistatin could lead to Aβ overproduction through Notch1/HES1/PPARγ/BACE1 signaling pathway. GSK-3β, a vital kinase regulating the process of tau phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, could be activated by inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway. Kallistatin was already promoted as a competitive inhibitor of LRP6, the Wnt receptor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous reports, Kallistatin could increase tau phosphorylation by activating GSK-3β. We demonstrated for the first time that Kallistatin could promote AD by increasing Aβ production and tau phosphorylation in the central nervous system.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that Notch signaling is closely related to AD. For example, NOTCH mutation was reported to cause AD-like pathology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. And Notch1 was found to increase in AD patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Besides, the Notch1/HES1 signaling pathway was reported to suppress the expression of PPARγ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Our previous studies proved that Kallistatin could activate Notch1 signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Consequently, we detect Notch1 in our animal and cell models. Indeed, Notch1 was upregulated by Kallistatin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, S4), as well as Aβ deposition. Notch signaling is initiated by receptor-ligand interaction at the cell surface. In mammals, there are five ligands encoded by JAG1, JAG2, DLL1, DLL3, and DLL4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Here, our results found that Kallistatin could activate Notch1 by binding to it directly, which means Kallistatin was a new ligand of the Notch1 receptor.</p>
<p>Treatment of AD has always been a hot and challenging problem in neurology. Multiple strategies have been proposed to reduce the pathogenicity of Aβ and tau. Unfortunately, several Aβ-targeted therapies tested in the phase III clinical trials have failed as they have not been able to slow down cognitive decline, although they could effectively reduce the Aβ load <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. BACE1 inhibitors were failed to improve the cognitive function of AD patients but also resulted in clinical deterioration and impairment of liver function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Here are two possible reasons for the failure of of clinical trials with the BACE1 inhibitor. First, the reduction of BACE1 activity could lead to an accumulation of full-length APP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Second, the size of the BACE1 active site is relatively large; the use of a small molecule may not be sufficient to occupy the active site <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Therefore, synaptic damage caused by BACE1 inhibitors or the insufficient effect of BACE1 inhibitors may lead to the failure of clinical trials. Therapeutic strategies targeting tau include tau aggregation blockers (TRx0014, TRx0237), antibody vaccine therapy (e.g., RO7105705, BIIB092), inhibition of tau phosphorylation (Anavex2-73), and microtubule stabilizers (Anavex2-73) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Some of the aforementioned drugs have been partially stopped, while others are still undergoing a clinical test and shown protective benefits. There are still several obstacles to the commercialization of tau treatments when they reach maturity.</p>
<p>Because of the failures of clinical trials, some researchers propose an alternative option for AD therapeutics to address the modifiable risk factors for developing AD, such as type 2 diabetes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Our previous study proved that Kallistatin is a multifunctional protein strongly associated with diabetes, and Kallistatin neutralizing antibody improves diabetic wound healing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. This study demonstrated that Kallistatin induced memory cognitive dysfunction by promoting Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation. Thus, we speculate the increased Kallistatin is a decent candidate for T2DM-related AD therapy. PPARγ is a ligand-activated transcription factor and a master modulator of glucose and lipid metabolism, organelle differentiation, and inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Growing evidence revealed that PPARγ agonists (rosiglitazone) could rescue memory impairment of AD model mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. In clinical trials, it is controversial whether rosiglitazone has a protective effect on memory cognitive function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. In this study, although Aβ expression had a downward trend, the memory and cognition of KAL-TG mice were unchanged after treatment with rosiglitazone for a month (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This might be caused by insufficient treatment time and the unchanged Kallistatin level.</p>
<p>Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative for clinically lowering blood lipids, mainly triglycerides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. Studies showed that fenofibrate could prevent memory disturbances, maintain hippocampal neurogenesis, and protect against Parkinson’s disease (PD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. Specifically, fenofibrate has a neuroprotective effect on memory impairment induced by Aβ through targeting α- and β-secretase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. Recently, our study proved that the fenofibrate could repair the disrupted glutamine-glutamate cycle by upregulating glutamine synthetase, while there is currently no fenofibrate treatment of AD in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In this study, we proved fenofibrate was beneficial for memory and cognitive impairment of KAL-TG mice. In addition, Aβ, BACE1, phosphorylated tau and serum Kallistatin level of KAL-TG mice could be downregulated after the treatment of fenofibrate. All of these suggested that fenofibrate might be helpful for metabolic abnormalities-related AD patients. Therefore, fenofibrate administration in patients with metabolic syndrome play an early role in preventing and treating AD.</p>
<p>In summary, we affirmed that Kallistatin concentrations were increased in diabetes-related AD patients. In addition, our study demonstrated for the first time that Kallistatin positively regulated Aβ42 through Notch1/HES1/PPARγ/BACE1, and increased phosphorylated tau through inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway. Kallistatin might play a crucial role in linking diabetes and cognitive memory deterioration. Moreover, fenofibrate could decrease the serum Kallistatin level, BACE1, Aβ, and phosphorylated tau of KAL-TG mice, leading to alleviating memory and cognitive impairment. These findings might provide new insight into AD and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<title>Experimental Animals and Protocols</title>
<p>All animal experiment procedures were carried out in an environment without specific pathogens (Specific pathogen free, SPF) with the approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-sen University (approval ID: SYXK 2015-0107). The wild type mice (WT, C57BL/6) were purchased from the Animal Center of Guangdong Province (Production license No.: SCXK 2013-0002, Guangzhou, China). The SAMR1 and SAMP8 mice (7 months old) were purchased from Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Tianjin, China). Kallistatin transgenic mice (KAL-TG) were C57BL/6 strain provided by Dr. Jianxing Ma (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. The KAL-TG mice genotype was identified by PCR technology (forward primer: 5’-AGGGAAG-ATTGTGGATTTGG-3’, reverse primer: 5’-ATGAAGATACCAGTGATGCTC-3’). KAL-TG mice aged 6 months were randomly divided into three groups: control group (KAL-TG), fenofibrate-treated group (KAL-TG-Feno, 0.3 g/kg/d), and rosiglitazone-treated group (KAL-TG-RSG, 0.005 g/kg/d). Fenofibrate (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. F6020) and rosiglitazone (Selleck, cat. no. S2556) were administered to mice by oral gavage. In three groups, the serum Kallistatin were examined in the 0 week and 4 week after drug treatment from the blood taken from mouse orbit. In addition, the Morris water maze and Y-maze test were performed one week after the second blood collection.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Morris water maze (MWM)</title>
<p>The KAL-TG and WT mice were employed for the Morris water maze test including the behavioral test, latency experiment (for 6 days), and the probe test (the 7th day). In addition, the MWM was performed as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Mice were brought into the testing room and handled for 1 day before the training experiment. In the 6-day training experiment, each mouse was trained with four daily trials. The mice facing the wall were placed into the maze, exploring the maze from different directions (east, south, west, and north). This trial was completed as soon as the mouse found the platform, or 90 s elapsed. If the mice could discover and climb the submerged platform within 90 s, the system would automatically record the latency time and path immediately, and then the mouse was guided to and placed on the submerged platform for extra 20 s. On day 7, the platform was removed, and a probe test was performed to examine the strength and integrity of the animal spatial memory 24 h after the last testing trial. During the probe test, the mice were gently brought into the water from the fixed monitoring point, and the mice were allowed to swim for 90 s without the platform. Finally, all of the measured behavioral parameters were analyzed using SMART software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Y-maze test</title>
<p>A Y maze test was performed to assess the mice’s spatial memory. The Y maze was separated by 120°, consisting of three identical arms (30 cm long, 7 cm wide, and 15 cm high) made of blue PVC. The mice were placed first in one of the arms, and over the next 10 minutes, the sequence and number of their entry into the three arms were monitored. An alternation is defined when a mouse visits three straight arms (namely, ABC, BCA, or CAB, but not ABA, BAB, or CAC). Spontaneous alternation (%) = [(number of alternations)/(total number of arms−2)]× 100.</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Hippocampal slices (300-400 μm) from KAL-TG and WT mice were cut as described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Coronal slices from hippocampus (400 μm thick) were prepared from different age groups KAL-TG mice and their WT littermates using a tissue slicer (Vibratome 3000; Vibratome) in ice-cold dissection buffer containing the following (in mM): 212.7 sucrose, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 10 dextrose, bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The slices were immediately transferred to ACSF at 35 °C for 30 min before recordings. The recipe of ACSF was similar to the dissection buffer, except that sucrose was replaced with 124 mM NaCl, and the concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> were changed to 1 mM and 2 mM, respectively. All recordings were performed at 28-30 °C. Pyramidal cells in CA1 areas were identified visually under infrared differential interference contrast optics based on their pyramidal somata and prominent apical dendrites. Whole-cell was performed using an Integrated Patch-Clamp Amplifier (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA) controlled by Igor 7 software (WaveMetrics, Portland, OR, USA) filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. Igor 7 software was also used for acquisition and analysis. Only cells with series resistance &lt;20 MΩ and input resistance &gt;100 MΩ were studied. Cells were excluded if input resistance changed &gt;15% or series resistance changed &gt;10% over the experiment. A concentric bipolar stimulating electrode with a tip diameter of 125 μm (FHC) was placed in the stratum radiatum. The recording and stimulating electrode distances were kept at 50-100 μm. Patch pipettes (2-4MΩ) were filled with the internal solution consisting of the following (in mM): 120 Cs-methylsulfonate, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 4 ATP, 5 lidocaine N-ethyl bromide (QX-314), 0.5 GTP; the pH of the solution was 7.2–7.3, and the osmolarity was 270-285 mOsm.</p>
<p>To induce LTP, a pairing protocol was applied. In brief, conditioning stimulation consisted of 360 pulses at 2 Hz paired with continuous postsynaptic depolarization (180 s) to 0 mV. 50 μM picrotoxin was added to the recording bath to suppress excessive polysynaptic activity, and the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> was elevated to 4 mM to reduce the recruitment of polysynaptic responses. A test pulse was delivered at 0.067 Hz to monitor baseline amplitude for 10 min before and 30 min following paired stimulation. To calculate LTP, the EPSC amplitude was normalized to the mean baseline amplitude during 10 min baseline. Potentiation was defined as the mean normalized EPSC amplitude 25–40 min after paired stimulation.</p>

<title><italic/>ELISA</title>
<p>To quantify serum Kallistatin, the collected samples were centrifuged at 4 ℃ for 10min at 5000 rpm. It was detected using the KBP ELISA kit (#DY1669, R&amp;D systems, MN, USA) as per the instructions of the manufacturer. The levels of Aβ42 in brain tissue produced from mouse primary neuron cells and HT22 cells were measured with a mouse Aβ42 Elisa Kit (27721, IBL, Germany). To measure Aβ42 in brain tissue, 0.05 g of mouse brain tissues were weighed and homogenized using 2ml PBS with a protease inhibitor (cocktail). After centrifugalization at 4 ℃ for 30 min at 12000 g, the extracts’ supernatants were analyzed using the ELISA method after total protein quantification. To quantify levels of Aβ42 produced from primary neuron cells, the cell supernatants were ultrafiltrated with an Ultrafiltration tube (4-kD Millipore), centrifugalization, and testing. Cell homogenate was prepared in 1ml PBS with a protease inhibitor (cocktail) and quantified using the BCA method before being measured by ELISA.</p>

<title>Primary culture of hippocampal neurons</title>
<p>Primary neurons were obtained from the hippocampus of C57/BL6J mice at age 1-3 days. Before culturing, the newborn pup was euthanized and dipped into 70% ethanol for 3 min. First, the infant pup hippocampus was isolated with eye tweezers observed under the stereomicroscope, and excess soft tissue was removed. Second, hippocampal tissue in PBS buffer was cut up with scissors gently and blown with a 1ml pipette until it was not visible. Next, the cell suspension was transferred to a 15ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. Cell precipitation was suspended and cultured with 2-3mL primary neural stem cell (NSC) suspension (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21103049) in a 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> cell incubator for 3 days, changing half medium every 2 days. After 7 days, the cell suspension was transferred to a 15ml centrifuge tube, centrifuged, and recultured with neurobasal, 10%FBS, 1:50 B27(Thermo Fisher Scientific, A3582801), and 1:100 bFGF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #RP-8626). One day later, the medium was changed to neurobasal (2%FBS, 1:50 B27, and 1:100 bFGF), culturing for 21 more days. The immunofluorescence technique was used with the neuron-specific marker (MAP2, #4542, Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, USA) to determine the purity of neurons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Qi and colleagues investigated the role of the Kallistatin pathway in increasing hippocampal amyloid-β plaque accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease, linking the increased Kallistatin level in diabetic patients with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease development. A Kallistatin-overexpressing animal model was utilized, and memory impairment was assessed using Morris water maze and Y-maze. Kallistatin-related pathway protein levels were measured in the hippocampus, and phenotypes were rescued using fenofibrate and rosiglitazone. The current study provides evidence of a novel molecular mechanism linking diabetes and Alzheimer's disease and suggests the potential use of fenofibrate to alleviate memory impairment. However, several issues need to be addressed before further consideration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings of this study are novel. The findings will have great impacts on diabetes and AD research. The studies were well conducted, and the results were convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The mechanism by which fenofibrate rescues memory loss in Kallistatin-transgenic mice is unclear. As a PPARalpha agonist, does fenofibrate target the Kallistatin pathway directly or indirectly? Please provide a discussion based on literature supporting either possibility.</p>
<p>(2) The current study exclusively investigated the hippocampus. What about other cognitive memory-related regions, such as the prefrontal cortex? Including data from these regions or discussing the possibility of their involvement could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of Kallistatin in memory impairment.</p>
<p>(3) Fenofibrate rescued phenotypes in Kallistatin-transgenic mice while rosiglitazone, a PPARgamma agonist, did not. This result contradicts the manuscript's emphasis on a PPARgamma-associated mechanism. Please address this inconsistency.</p>
<p>(4) Most of the immunohistochemistry images are unclear. Inserts have similar magnification to the original representative images, making judgments difficult. Please provide larger inserts with higher resolution.</p>
<p>(5) The immunohistochemistry images in different figures were taken from different hippocampal subregions with different magnifications. Please maintain consistency, or explain why CA1, CA3, or DG was analyzed in each experiment.</p>
<p>(6) Figure 5B is missing a title. Please add a title to maintain consistency with other graphs.</p>
<p>(7) Please list statistical methods used in the figure legends, such as t-test or One-way ANOVA with post-hoc tests.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study links Alzheimer's disease (AD) with metabolic disorders through elevated Kallistatin levels in AD patients. Kallistatin-overexpressing mice show cognitive decline, increased Aβ and tau pathology, and impaired hippocampal function. Mechanistically, Kallistatin enhances Aβ production via Notch1 and promotes tau phosphorylation through GSK-3β activation. Fenofibrate improves cognitive deficits by reducing Aβ and tau phosphorylation in these mice, suggesting therapeutic potential in AD linked to metabolic syndromes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study presents novel insights into AD pathogenesis and provides strong evidence about the mechanistic roles of Kallistatin, and the therapeutic potential of fenofibrate in AD.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It was suggested that Kallistatin is primarily produced by the liver. The study demonstrates increased Kallistatin levels in the hippocampus tissue of AD mice. It would be valuable to clarify if Kallistatin is also increased in the liver of AD mice, providing a comprehensive understanding of its distribution in disease states.</p>
<p>Does Kallistatin interact directly with Notch1 ligands? Clarifying this interaction mechanism would enhance understanding of how Kallistatin influences Notch1 signaling in AD pathology.</p>
<p>Is there any observed difference in AD phenotype between male and female Kallistatin-transgenic (KAL-TG) mice? Including this information would address potential gender-specific effects on cognitive decline and pathology.</p>
<p>It is recommended to include molecular size markers in Western blots for clarity and accuracy in protein size determination.</p>
<p>The language should be revised for enhanced readability and clarity, ensuring that complex scientific concepts are communicated effectively to a broader audience.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated the role of kallistatin in metabolic abnormalities associated with AD. They found that Kallistatin promotes Aβ production by binding to the Notch1 receptor and upregulating BACE1 expression. They identified that Kallistatin is a key player that mediates Aβ accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation in AD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript not only provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of AD, but also indicates that the hypolipidemic drug fenofibrate attenuates AD-like pathology in Kallistatin transgenic mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors did not illustrate whether the protective effect of fenofibrate against AD depends on kallistatin.</p>
<p>The conclusions are supported by the results, but the quality of some results should be improved.</p>
