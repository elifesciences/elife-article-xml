<title>Abstract</title><p>The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that controls the expression of hundreds of genes. Emerging evidence suggests that the p53-induced RNA-binding protein ZMAT3 is a key splicing regulator that functions in p53-dependent tumor suppression <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the mechanism by which ZMAT3 functions in the p53 pathway is largely unclear. Here, we discovered a function of ZMAT3 in inhibiting transcription of <italic>HKDC1</italic>, a hexokinase that regulates glucose metabolism and mitochondrial respiration. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified HKDC1 as the most significantly upregulated protein in <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-depleted colorectal cancer cells. <italic>ZMAT3</italic> depletion results in increased mitochondrial respiration that was rescued upon depletion of <italic>HKDC1</italic>, suggesting that HKDC1 is a critical downstream effector of <italic>ZMAT3</italic>. Unexpectedly, ZMAT3 did not bind to the <italic>HKDC1</italic> RNA or DNA but the identification of the ZMAT3-interactome uncovered its interaction with the oncogenic transcription factor JUN. ZMAT3 depletion resulted in increased JUN binding at the <italic>HKDC1</italic> promoter and increased <italic>HKDC1</italic> transcription that was rescued upon JUN depletion, suggesting that JUN activates <italic>HKDC1</italic> transcription in ZMAT3-depleted cells. Collectively, these data reveal a mechanism by which ZMAT3 regulates transcription and demonstrates that <italic>HKDC1</italic> is a key component of the ZMAT3-regulated transcriptome in the context of mitochondrial respiration regulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>TP53</italic> is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer and functions as a major tumor suppressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. <italic>TP53</italic> mutations in the germline of Li Fraumeni patients and in sporadic cancer, are mostly missense mutations that occur in the DNA-binding domain resulting in loss of tumor suppressor function and in some cases, gain of oncogenic functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Deletion of the <italic>Trp53</italic> gene in mice results in spontaneous tumor development within 6 months of age at 100% penetrance, underscoring the importance of p53 as a tumor suppressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Mechanistically, p53 functions as a sequence-specific transcription factor activating the expression of hundreds of genes that control diverse cellular processes including but not limited to, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence and DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Despite the undisputed role of p53 in tumor suppression, our understanding of how p53 target genes mediate the effects of p53 is not fully understood.</p>
<p>Among the p53 target genes, some such as <italic>p21</italic> (<italic>CDKN1A</italic>) control p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, whereas <italic>PUMA</italic> and <italic>NOXA</italic> are critical in inducing apoptosis downstream of p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies in mice have demonstrated that <italic>Abca1</italic>, <italic>Gls2</italic>, <italic>Mlh1</italic>, <italic>Padi4</italic> and <italic>Zmat3</italic> play key roles in mediating the tumor suppressor effects of p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. However, triple knockout mice lacking <italic>p21</italic>, <italic>Puma</italic> and <italic>Noxa</italic>, which are regulators of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the p53 pathway, do not develop tumors spontaneously, unlike p53 null mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. This has led to search for new mechanisms and effectors of p53-mediated tumor suppression.</p>
<p>An emerging potent mediator of p53 is the p53 target gene <italic>ZMAT3</italic>, which functions as an RNA-binding protein and studies in mice strongly implicate <italic>Zmat3</italic> as a tumor suppressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Mechanistically, using transcriptome-wide approaches from crosslinked cells, we and others recently reported that ZMAT3 directly binds to intronic sequences in thousands of pre-mRNAs and regulates alternative splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. ZMAT3 has also been shown to interact with AU-rich elements in the 3′ untranslated regions (UTR) of target mRNAs either stabilizing its targets or promoting their decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which ZMAT3 functions is necessary to better understand how ZMAT3 functions in p53-mediated tumor suppression.</p>
<p>Here, to better understand the function of ZMAT3, we identified the ZMAT3-interactome and the proteins regulated by ZMAT3. Unexpectedly, this approach revealed that ZMAT3 inhibits mitochondrial respiration by interacting with the transcription factor JUN (c-Jun) to inhibit transcription of the hexokinase <italic>HKDC1</italic> (hexokinase domain containing 1). We chose to focus on <italic>HKDC1</italic> because by quantitative proteomics, HKDC1 was the most strongly up-regulated protein in ZMAT3-depleted colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Hexokinases are the first rate-limiting enzymes in the glucose metabolic pathway that phosphorylate glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and thereby modulate glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and the pentose phosphate pathway. There are four classic hexokinases (HK1-4), and recently HKDC1 was identified as the fifth hexokinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Besides its hexokinase function, HKDC1 also interacts with the mitochondrial membrane to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and plays an important role in preventing cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Although, HKDC1 is reported to be overexpressed in many cancers and high HKDC1 expression is associated with poor clinical outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, how HKDC1 expression is regulated remains largely unclear. Our findings provide novel insights on the regulation and function of HKDC1 in the p53 pathway via transcriptional inhibition by a ZMAT3/JUN axis.</p>

<title>The hexokinase HKDC1 is the most strongly upregulated protein in ZMAT3-knockout cells</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism by which ZMAT3 promotes growth suppression, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout <italic>ZMAT3</italic> in HCT116 cells (CRC) using two sgRNAs flanking the p53 response element in the second intron of the <italic>ZMAT3</italic>. Although this approach did not completely delete the region spanning the two sgRNAs, a ∼57 bp region near sgRNA#1 was deleted resulting in &gt;75% decrease in <italic>ZMAT3</italic> mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref>). At the protein level, ZMAT3 was strongly induced only in <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-WT (wild-type) cells upon treatment with Nutlin, a small molecule that upregulates p53 and its target genes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). As expected, upon Nutlin treatment, p53 and its known target p21, were induced in both <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-WT and isogenic <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO (knockout) cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). Depletion of ZMAT3 resulted in increased proliferation and clonogenicity, consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>To identify the genes regulated by ZMAT3, we next performed RNA-seq from biological triplicates of <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-WT and <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO HCT116 cells. As expected, <italic>ZMAT3</italic> mRNA levels markedly decreased (∼7.5-fold) in <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO cells (Table S1); the recently identified direct ZMAT3 target gene <italic>MDM4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> was modestly but significantly upregulated in <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO cells (Table S1). Transcriptome-wide, upon loss of ZMAT3, 606 genes were significantly up-regulated (adj. p&lt;0.05 and 1.5-fold change) and 552 were down-regulated with a median fold change of 1.76 and 0.55 for the up- and downregulated genes, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and Table S1). Because we and others recently reported that ZMAT3 directly regulates alternative splicing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, we reasoned that ZMAT3-dependent changes in splicing could lead to altered protein levels without altering mRNA levels. We therefore performed quantitative proteomics from <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-WT and <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO HCT116 cells. At the protein level 228 proteins were significantly (p&lt;0.05) up-regulated and 108 were down-regulated upon loss of ZMAT3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) (Table S2).</p>
<p>ZMAT3 directly binds to intronic sequences in pre-mRNAs and can inhibit inclusion of the neighboring exon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Depletion of ZMAT3 can therefore result in increased target gene expression. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for the proteins upregulated in <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO cells revealed glycolysis as the most significantly overrepresented biological process (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). GSEA analysis from our RNA-seq data showed that glycolysis was among the top 10 overrepresented biological processes for the mRNAs upregulated in <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>). Interestingly, the protein that was most strongly upregulated (∼3.4-fold, p&lt;0.05) in <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO cells was the hexokinase HKDC1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, G</xref> and Table S2). The increase in HKDC1 expression was also observed at the mRNA level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1C</xref> and Table S1); as expected, <italic>ZMAT3</italic> mRNA levels were decreased in the <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO cells. We therefore chose to focus on <italic>HKDC1</italic> because it was the most strongly upregulated protein upon loss of ZMAT3 and is directly involved in regulating glucose metabolism and mitochondrial respiration that are cellular processes not been previously associated with ZMAT3.</p>

<title>ZMAT3 inhibition of <italic>HKDC1</italic> expression is conserved and observed in diverse cell types</title>
<p>To validate inhibition of <italic>HKDC1</italic> expression by ZMAT3, we next performed RT-qPCR from <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-WT and <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO HCT116 cells. We observed ∼4-fold upregulation of <italic>HKDC1</italic> mRNA upon ZMAT3 depletion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The increase in HKDC1 expression was further confirmed at the protein level by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Because these experiments were conducted from a single <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO clone, we next analyzed our recently published RNA-seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> conducted in biological triplicates from HCT116 cells transfected with a control siRNA (siCTRL) or ZMAT3 siRNAs (SMARTpool of 4 siRNAs). <italic>ZMAT3</italic> mRNA was strongly down-regulated, and <italic>HKDC1</italic> was modestly but significantly up-regulated (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref> and Table S3), a result that was validated by RT-qPCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). GSEA analysis for the mRNAs up-regulated upon ZMAT3 knockdown showed that glycolysis was among the top 10 overrepresented biological processes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). Additionally, comparison of the RNA-seq data from the <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-WT vs <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO and CTRL siRNA vs ZMAT3 siRNA transfected HCT116 cells, indicated that 1023 genes were commonly up-regulated, and 1042 genes were commonly down-regulated upon loss of ZMAT3 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), suggesting that ZMAT3 depletion results in altered expression of thousands of genes. GSEA analysis for the top 500 mRNAs up-regulated upon ZMAT3 knockdown showed that glycolysis was among the top 10 overrepresented biological processes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that ZMAT3 inhibits the expression of genes that play important roles in glycolysis.</p>

<p>To determine if ZMAT3 inhibits <italic>HKDC1</italic> expression in multiple cell lines, we performed RT-qPCR after ZMAT3 knockdown in SW1222 (CRC cells), HCEC-1CT (immortalized human colonic epithelial cells), and HepG2 (liver cancer cells). We observed significant increase in <italic>HKDC1</italic> mRNA levels upon ZMAT3 knockdown in these cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). At the protein level, we observed modest increase in HKDC1 levels upon knockdown of ZMAT3 in HCT116 and HepG2 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, we explored recently published RNA-seq data from <italic>Zmat3</italic> knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. <italic>Hkdc1</italic> mRNA was significantly up-regulated (∼6-fold) in <italic>Zmat3</italic>-KO MEFs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). And we also observed the expected upregulation of its target gene <italic>Mdm4</italic> while no changes in <italic>Trp53</italic> mRNA expression were observed.</p>
<p>In the context of human CRC, in the TCGA colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) cohort, <italic>HKDC1</italic> mRNA levels were significantly higher in tumors as compared to normal tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Further analysis of the TCGA COAD data showed that as compared to p53 wild-type tumors, mutant p53 tumors exhibited significantly higher <italic>HKDC1</italic> mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). As expected for the p53 target ZMAT3 and as shown previously in other cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, ZMAT3 mRNA levels were significantly lower in the mutant p53 tumors as compared to p53 wild-type tumors (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2F</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Furthermore, RNA-seq from <italic>Trp53</italic> knockout MEFs from the same study mentioned above<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> showed significant upregulation (∼8.6-fold) of <italic>Hkdc1</italic> mRNA, and down-regulation of its target genes <italic>Zmat3</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>).

<title>ZMAT3 inhibits mitochondrial respiration by downregulating HKDC1</title>
<p>Previous studies suggest that HKDC1 plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism and cell proliferation in various cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. To determine whether ZMAT3 regulates glucose metabolism and/or proliferation by regulating HKDC1 expression, we performed glucose metabolic assays. Since HKDC1 is a hexokinase and can regulate phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate when it enters the cells, we began with measuring changes in hexokinase activity upon ZMAT3 loss. We incubated the cells with the non-catabolic glucose analog 2-deoxy glucose (2-DG) for a short period of time and quantified the conversion of 2-DG to 2-DG6P using a luminescence-based assay. We observed a significant increase in relative 2-DG6P levels in <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO cells compared to WT cells. Interestingly, this increase was reversed when we knocked down HKDC1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of ZMAT3 in SW1222 and HEPG2 also showed a similar increase in hexokinase activity and the effect was reversed upon concurrent knockdown of ZMAT3 and HKDC1, suggesting that ZMAT3 inhibits glucose uptake, and this effect is HKDC1-dependent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We then investigated whether increased hexokinase activity upon ZMAT3 knockdown leads to increased glycolysis in cells. To measure this, we performed Seahorse assays, measured extracellular acidification rate and calculated the glycolysis proton efflux. It should be noted that the proton efflux rate measured with Seahorse is reflecting the lactate production from glycolysis more than the pyruvate end point of glycolysis that fueled the mitochondria. Thus, we also measured mitochondria activity. Knockdown of ZMAT3 or HKDC1 by siRNAs resulted in modest increase in basal glycolysis but it was not significant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Recent studies suggest that HKDC1 plays a significant role in regulating mitochondrial respiration, and depletion of HKDC1 results in mitochondrial dysfunction and senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. We therefore determined a potential function of ZMAT3 in regulation of basal mitochondrial respiration by regulating HKDC1 expression. We conducted Seahorse assays, and to measure OCR (oxygen consumption rate) upon knockdown of HKDC1 or ZMAT3 or both. Interestingly, we found that ZMAT3 knockdown results in significantly increased basal mitochondrial respiration, and simultaneous ZMAT3 and HKDC1 knockdown rescues this effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) and this, without affecting the oxygen consumption that could occur along cellular pathways that are not involving mitochondria. We did not observe any changes in non-mitochondrial respiration(<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). Because these phenotypes can be associated with proliferation, we next asked whether HKDC1 regulates proliferation and whether it is an effector of ZMAT3. Live cell proliferation assays and CCK8 cell viability assays suggested that knocking down HKDC1 in both ZMAT3-WT and KO cells resulted in decreased cell proliferation. However, the effect of HKDC1 knockdown was more significant in <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO cells suggesting that HKDC1 plays a key role in promoting proliferation downstream of ZMAT3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D and E</xref>).</p>

<title>The p53/ZMAT3 axis inhibits HKDC1 expression</title>
<p>Because <italic>ZMAT3</italic> transcription is activated by p53, we next examined if the p53 pathway inhibits <italic>HKDC1</italic> expression. We therefore performed RNA-seq from HCT116 cells transfected with siCTRL or sip53 (SMARTpool of 4 siRNAs). Interestingly, <italic>HKDC1</italic> mRNA was significantly up-regulated (∼2.25-fold) upon p53 knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref> and Table S4).

<p>Since p53 knockdown resulted in increased HKDC1 expression, we next asked if inducing p53 would result in down-regulation of HKDC1. Indeed, when we looked at RNA-seq data, we observed ∼40% reduction in <italic>HKDC1</italic> mRNA levels upon Nutlin treatment of siCTRL transfected HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and Table S3). As expected for a direct p53 target gene, upon p53 activation by Nutlin, <italic>ZMAT3</italic> and <italic>p21</italic> mRNAs were upregulated ∼2.5- and ∼6-fold, respectively; p53 mRNA levels didn’t change because Nutlin is known to specifically induce p53 protein levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). At the protein level, p53 activation by Nutlin resulted in decreased HKDC1 levels and increased ZMAT3 and p21 levels in <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-WT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). In <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO cells, there was a modest increase in basal HKDC1 levels and a modest decrease upon Nutlin treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Moreover, we generated doxycycline-inducible ZMAT3-FLAG-HA expressing HCT116 cells to overexpress ZMAT3. After 48 hours of doxycycline treatment ZMAT3-HA induction was confirmed by RT-qPCR and immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of p53 in these cells resulted in significant increase in both mRNA and protein levels of HKDC1 in untreated cells. Importantly, upon inducing ZMAT3 levels using doxycycline, the upregulation of HKDC1 mRNA and protein associated with p53 knockdown was not observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>). Collectively these data suggest that the p53/ZMAT3 signaling axis plays a critical role in the regulation of HKDC1 expression, where ZMAT3 operates downstream of p53 to inhibit HKDC1 expression.</p>

<title>ZMAT3 inhibits HKDC1 transcription by interacting with the transcription activator JUN</title>
<p>ZMAT3 is an RNA-binding protein that regulates alternative splicing. We therefore hypothesized that ZMAT3 directly binds to the <italic>HKDC1</italic> pre-mRNA and regulates its splicing. However, when we looked at our ZMAT3 PAR-CLIP data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> we did not identify binding for ZMAT3 to <italic>HKDC1</italic> pre-mRNA (data not shown). Since the ZMAT3 protein has three C2H2-zinc-finger motifs it has the potential to bind to DNA (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. A recent report suggested ZMAT3 and other zinc finger proteins as DRBPs (DNA-RNA binding proteins)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. To examine if ZMAT3 binds to DNA and regulates HKDC1 expression directly at the transcriptional level we conducted ZMAT3-HA Cut&amp;Run-seq and ChIP-seq in three biological replicates using anti-HA or anti-FLAG or anti-ZMAT3 antibody. However, we did not observe reproducible binding of ZMAT3 to the <italic>HKDC1</italic> locus or other regions of the genome in HCT116 cells (data not shown).</p>
<p>We therefore hypothesized that ZMAT3 inhibits HKDC1 expression by interacting with a specific transcription factor. To identify the proteins that interact with ZMAT3 we performed IPs using an anti-FLAG antibody followed by mass spectrometry from whole cell lysates of untreated or doxycycline-treated ZMAT3-FLAG-HA HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5B</xref>. After removing common contaminants (&lt;10% in Crapome), this unbiased approach identified 21 ZMAT3-interacting proteins highlighted in red (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and Supplemental Table S5). As expected, ZMAT3 was the most strongly enriched protein (∼36,000-fold).

<p>Interestingly, the transcription factor JUN (c-Jun) was strongly enriched in the ZMAT3-FLAG pulldowns (∼8,500-fold). JUN is a proto-oncogene and has previously been implicated in glucose metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> and p53 function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. We next utilized publicly available JUN ChIP-seq data from various cell lines from ENCODE, with a focus on JUN binding at the HKDC1 promoter. Notably, in 3 cell lines, we found a JUN ChIP-seq peak having consensus JUN binding motif in the <italic>HKDC1</italic> intron 1. This peak coincided with ChIP-seq peaks for POLR2A, H3K27Ac and H3K4Me3 in HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). We validated the interaction between ZMAT3 and JUN proteins by ZMAT3-FLAG IP and immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Importantly, knockdown of JUN resulted in decreased <italic>HKDC1</italic> mRNA levels in ZMAT3-WT cells and rescued the elevated <italic>HKDC1</italic> mRNA and protein levels in ZMAT3-KO cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E and F</xref>). To determine if ZMAT3 inhibits JUN binding to the <italic>HKDC1</italic> locus we conducted ChIP-qPCR for JUN from <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-WT and KO cells. JUN exhibited significantly enhanced binding at the <italic>HKDC1</italic> intron 1 in <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-WT cells compared to the IgG control, and the enrichment of JUN to the <italic>HKDC1</italic> promoter was significantly increased in <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-KO cells, indicating that ZMAT3 inhibits the ability of JUN to bind to the <italic>HKDC1</italic> promoter. We next cloned a ∼700 bp DNA fragment that encompassed the JUN and POLR2A binding peaks within the <italic>HKDC1</italic> promoter into the pGL4 basic luciferase reporter vector, designated as pGL4 HKDC1-promoter. Remarkably, knockdown of JUN in HCT116 cells resulted in a significant decrease in luciferase activity of the pGL4 HKDC1-promoter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). Conversely, ZMAT3 knockdown resulted in a marked increase in luciferase activity relative to control and simultaneous knockdown of ZMAT3 and JUN rescued the increase in reporter activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these data suggest that ZMAT3 plays a crucial role in controlling mitochondrial respiration and cell proliferation by suppressing <italic>HKDC1</italic> transcription. We propose a model according to which in <italic>ZMAT3</italic>-WT cells p53 drives ZMAT3 transcription, ZMAT3 protein binds to the HKDC1 transcription activator JUN thereby inhibiting its binding with <italic>HKDC1</italic> promoter which leads to transcriptional repression of HKDC1 thereby controlled mitochondrial respiration and controlled cell proliferation. In the absence of ZMAT3, JUN binds to the HKDC1 promoter and upregulates its expression, resulting in increased mitochondrial respiration and increased cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent studies suggest that ZMAT3 significantly contributes to the tumor suppressive effects of p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. At the molecular level, ZMAT3 functions as an RNA-binding protein that acts as a key splicing factor and regulates mRNA stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Here, we unexpectedly found that the transcription of <italic>HKDC1</italic>, the gene that is most strongly upregulated at the protein level in ZMAT3-deficient cells, is indirectly repressed by ZMAT3 via interaction with the key transcription factor, JUN, thereby inhibiting JUN’s binding to the <italic>HKDC1</italic> promoter. Consistent with the well-established function of HKDC1 in glucose metabolism and mitochondrial respiration, we observed increased mitochondrial respiration upon upregulation of HKDC1 in ZMAT3-depleted cells and this phenotype was rescued upon concurrent knockdown of ZMAT3 and HKDC1, suggesting that HKDC1 is a key downstream effector of ZMAT3.</p>
<p>ZMAT3 has been known as a p53 target gene for more than two decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, but its physiological function and role in tumor suppression are only beginning to be understood. ZMAT3 belongs to zinc finger family of proteins that play crucial role in regulating gene expression through specific recognition of DNA sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Although they are primarily known for their involvement in transcription regulation, these proteins have also been found to interact with RNA and proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Among them, ZMAT3 is a member of the ZMAT domain-containing family that has three zinc fingers of C2H2-type zinc fingers motif <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. These domains play crucial roles transcriptional regulation by specifically binding to target molecules such as DNA and RNA. A recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> revealed ZMAT3 as a DRBP (DNA- and RNA-binding protein), but in our hands using Cut&amp;Run-seq and ChIP-seq, we did not observe specific binding of ZMAT3-FLAG or endogenous ZMAT3 to DNA (data not shown). In these experiments Cut&amp;Run-seq and ChIP-seq for p53 worked exceedingly well (data not shown), demonstrating that there was no technical flaw. It may be that ZMAT3 binding to DNA is cell-type specific, or upon DNA damage but this needs further investigation.</p>
<p>Our findings that ZMAT3 interacts with and inhibits binding of JUN to the HKDC1 locus provides mechanistic insights on how ZMAT3, without directly interacting with DNA regulates HKDC1 transcription. JUN is a protooncogene that plays a crucial role in both normal physiological processes and tumorigenesis by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, senescence and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. It is a transcription factor function as a key component of AP-1 complex and promote RNA polymerase II mediated transcription of target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. It would be interesting to determine which ZMAT3 regulated genes are regulated via JUN. Future investigations are also needed to determine the domains of JUN that interact with ZMAT3 and what ZMAT3 does to JUN.</p>
<p>Because ZMAT3 regulates alternative splicing which can lead to changes in protein levels without altering mRNA levels, in this study we integrated quantitative proteomics data with RNA-seq data from ZMAT3-WT and isogenic ZMAT3-KO CRC cells. Furthermore, we integrated these data with RNA-seq from HCT116 cells upon ZMAT3 or p53 knockdown using siRNAs, to make sure that the findings from the isogenic cell lines were not restricted to a single KO clone and to determine the role of the p53/ZMAT3 axis in regulating these genes. This approach identified HKDC1 as the most strongly protein upon ZMAT3 depletion. HKDC1 is emerging as an important regulator of tumor progression and is frequently upregulated in several cancers including CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Besides its hexokinase activity, HKDC1 interacts with the mitochondrial membrane and plays an essential role in mitochondrial function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. We further demonstrated that ZMAT3 suppresses glucose uptake and basal mitochondrial respiration by inhibiting HKDC1 expression leading to suppression of cell proliferation in CRC cells.</p>
<p>Our data also demonstrates that p53 negatively regulates <italic>HKDC1</italic> expression and this effect is ZMAT3-dependent, suggesting that the p53/ZMAT3/HKDC1 axis may be an important component of the p53 network, in the context of mitochondrial respiration and proliferation. The ability of p53 to induce cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death is important for tumor suppressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. However, p53 has several other functions that recent data strongly implicate in tumor suppression, particularly regarding the control of metabolism such as glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and ferroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer cells, which plays a pivotal role in cancer progression by providing energy and a wide variety of substrates for biosynthesis to support the rapid proliferation and survival of cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. p53 has been reported to play an important role in suppressing tumor development by regulating the expression and function of metabolic genes, directly <italic>(GLUT1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, <italic>GLUT4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, <italic>PFKFB3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> and <italic>PFKFB4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>) or indirectly (<italic>HK2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup><italic>, HIF1</italic>α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> and <italic>G6PD</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>). Our data uncovers HKDC1 as an indirect p53 target gene that is negatively regulated via ZMAT3. Collectively, our findings provide key insights into the diverse functions of ZMAT3 and their involvement in gene regulation in the p53 pathway.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors investigate the role of ZMAT3, a p53 target gene, in tumor suppression and RNA splicing regulation. Using quantitative proteomics, the authors uncover that ZMAT3 knockout leads to upregulation of HKDC1, a gene linked to mitochondrial respiration, and that ZMAT3 suppresses HKDC1 expression by inhibiting c-JUN-mediated transcription. This set of <bold>convincing</bold> evidence reveals a <bold>fundamental</bold> mechanism by which ZMAT3 contributes to p53-driven tumor suppression by regulating mitochondrial respiration.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>ZMAT3 is a p53 target gene that the Lal group and others have shown is important for p53-mediated tumor suppression, and which plays a role in the control of RNA splicing. In this manuscript, Lal and colleagues perform quantitative proteomics of cells with ZMAT3 knockout and show that the enzyme hexokinase HKDC1 is the most upregulated protein. Mechanistically, the authors show that ZMAT3 does not appear to directly regulate the expression of HKDC1; rather, they show that the transcription factor c-JUN was strongly enriched in ZMAT3 pull-downs in IP-mass spec experiments, and they perform IP-western to demonstrate an interaction between c-JUN and ZMAT3. Importantly, the authors demonstrate, using ChIP-qPCR, that JUN is present at the HKDC1 gene (intron 1) in ZMAT3 WT cells and shows markedly enhanced binding in ZMAT3 KO cells. The data best fit a model whereby p53 transactivates ZMAT3, leading to decreased JUN binding to the HKDC1 promoter, and altered mitochondrial respiration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use multiple orthogonal approaches to test the majority of their findings.</p>
<p>The authors offer a potentially new activity of ZMAT3 in tumor suppression by p53: the control of mitochondrial respiration.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some indication as to whether other c-JUN target genes are also regulated by ZMAT3 would improve the broad relevance of the authors' findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study elucidates the role of the recently discovered mediator of p53 tumor suppressive activity, ZMAT3. Specifically, the authors find that ZMAT3 negatively regulates HKDC1, a gene involved in the control of mitochondrial respiration and cell proliferation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Mechanistically, ZMAT3 suppresses HKDC1 transcription by sequestering JUN and preventing its binding to the HKDC1 promoter, resulting in reduced HKDC1 expression. Conversely, p53 mutation leads to ZMAT3 downregulation and HKDC1 overexpression, thereby promoting increased mitochondrial respiration and proliferation. This mechanism is novel; however, the authors should address several points.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors conduct mechanistic experiments (e.g., transcript and protein quantification, luciferase assays) to demonstrate regulatory interactions between p53, ZMAT3, JUN, and HKDC1. These findings should be supported with functional assays, such as proliferation, apoptosis, or mitochondrial respiration analyses.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, Kumar et al. investigate the mechanisms underlying the tumor suppressive function of the RNA binding protein ZMAT3, a previously described tumor suppressor in the p53 pathway. To this end, they use RNA-sequencing and proteomics to characterize changes in ZMAT3-deficient cells, leading them to identify the hexokinase HKDC1 as upregulated with ZMAT3 deficiency first in colorectal cancer cells, then in other cell types of both mouse and human origin. This increase in HKDC1 is associated with increased mitochondrial respiration. As ZMAT3 has been reported as an RNA-binding and DNA-binding protein, the authors investigated this via PAR-CLIP and ChIP-seq but did not observe ZMAT3 binding to HKDC1 pre-mRNA or DNA. Thus, to better understand how ZMAT3 regulates HKDC1, the authors used quantitative proteomics to identify ZMAT3-interacting proteins. They identified the transcription factor JUN as a ZMAT3-interacting protein and showed that JUN promotes the increased HKDC1 RNA expression seen with ZMAT3 inactivation. They propose that ZMAT3 inhibits JUN-mediated transcriptional induction of HKDC1 as a mechanism of tumor suppression. This work uncovers novel aspects of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This novel work sheds light on one of the most well-established yet understudied p53 target genes, ZMAT3, and how it contributes to p53's tumor suppressive functions. Overall, this story establishes a p53-ZMAT3-HKDC1 tumor suppressive axis, which has been strongly substantiated using a variety of orthogonal approaches, in different cell lines and with different data sets.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the role of p53 and ZMAT3 in repressing HKDC1 is well substantiated, there is a gap in understanding how ZMAT3 acts to repress JUN-driven activation of the HKDC1 locus. How does ZMAT3 inhibit JUN binding to HKDC1? Can targeted ChIP experiments or RIP experiments be used to make a more definitive model? Can ZMAT3 mutants help to understand the mechanisms? Future work can further establish the mechanisms underlying how ZMAT3 represses JUN activity.</p>
