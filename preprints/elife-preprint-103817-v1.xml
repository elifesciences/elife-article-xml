<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) infection of the lungs, besides producing prolonged cough with mucus, also causes progressive fatigue and cachexia with debilitating loss of muscle mass. While anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug therapy is directed toward eliminating bacilli, the treatment regimen ignores the systemic pathogenic derailments that probably dictate TB-associated mortality and morbidity. Presently, it is not understood whether Mtb spreads to metabolic organs and brings about these impairments. Here we show that Mtb creates a replication-conducive milieu of lipid droplets in hepatocytes by upregulating transcription factor PPARγ and scavenging lipids from the host cells. In hepatocytes, Mtb shields itself against the common anti-TB drugs by inducing drug-metabolizing enzymes. Infection of the hepatocytes in the <italic>in vivo</italic> aerosol mice model can be consistently observed post-week 4 along with enhanced expression of PPARγ and drug-metabolizing enzymes. Moreover, histopathological analysis indeed shows the presence of Mtb in hepatocytes along with granuloma-like structures in human biopsied liver sections. Hepatotropism of Mtb during the chronic infectious cycle results in immuno-metabolic dysregulation that could magnify local and systemic pathogenicity, altering clinical presentations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), the causative agent of human tuberculosis, remains the leading infectious killer globally with an estimated death of 1.3 million in 2022[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Despite progressive work on designing new anti-TB therapeutics and implementing vaccination programs in TB-endemic countries, it has a high global case fatality rate and a poor treatment success rate, along with a rising number of drug-resistant infections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Emerging paradigms in infectious diseases advocate tackling pathogen-driven ailments as one-dimensional problems, where the entire emphasis is given to pathogen elimination. A holistic understanding of how the host systems respond to the infection, vaccination, and treatment is key to TB management programs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Recent widespread and severe physiological derangements associated with COVID-19 patients, even after the elimination of the virus, have brought back the focus on identifying novel strategies that are inclusive of modulating the host immune-metabolic axis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The clinical symptoms of pulmonary TB encompass localized manifestations like prolonged cough with mucus, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, and lung damage. Besides, systemic outcomes like cachexia, progressive fatigue, oxidative stress, altered microbiota and glucose intolerance result in organ-wide disruptions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Pulmonary TB patients often suffer from progressive and debilitating loss of muscle mass and function with severe weight loss, this TB-associated cachexia cannot be reversed by conventional nutritional support[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Besides, numerous epidemiological studies indicate that hyperglycemia may occur during active tuberculosis, which can compromise insulin resistance and glucose tolerance, although the mechanisms are unclear[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Both the localized and systemic pathophysiology of TB infection indicate an alteration in the host immuno-metabolic axis. It is somewhat bewildering that the engagement of the liver during the Mtb infection cycle is not considered, despite its central role in balancing the immune and metabolic functions of the body[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. The crosstalk between the liver and lung has been largely overlooked in tuberculosis (TB), even though acute phase proteins (APPs) are used as predictive biomarkers in pulmonary tuberculosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. A robust hepatic APR response in mice, mediated by key hepatocyte transcription factors, STAT3 and NF-κB/RelA, has been known to trigger pulmonary host defenses for survival during pneumonia and sepsis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. In TB, the active phase of the disease is associated with heightened expression of various genes that modulate flux in the lipid metabolic pathways[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>The liver is involved in a wide variety of functions – synthesis of plasma proteins, secretion of various hepatokines, degradation of xenobiotic compounds, and storage of lipids, glucose, vitamins, and minerals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. De-novo lipogenesis, secretion of acute phase proteins, hepatokine production, etc. are all directly or indirectly controlled by the hepatocytes, thereby communicating with almost all the organs of the body[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Moreover, the liver is actively involved in triacylglycerol synthesis and storage under the intricate regulation of various hormones like insulin, glucagon, and thyroid hormone[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. All these functions uniquely position the liver as the central regulator of lipid metabolism. To avert organ damage, the liver maintains tolerogenic properties rendering it an attractive target for various pathogenic microorganisms. Although several studies have indicated the role of both -Mtb virulence components and host factors (immune activation, nitric oxide, IFNγ, intracellular pH and hypoxia) in the generation of Mtb drug tolerance, the role of liver, being the principal center for xenobiotic metabolism needs careful investigation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Liver is the hub of both phase I and phase II drug modifying enzymes (DMEs). The levels as well as the activity of both type of DMEs play significant roles in determining the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of various drugs across multiple diseases, from infection to malignancy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate the active involvement of the liver in a murine aerosol TB infection model during the chronic phase and establish hepatocytes as a new replicative niche for Mtb. Using a variety of <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>ex vivo</italic>, and <italic>in vitro</italic> techniques we show how Mtb perturbs biological functions within hepatocytes remodeling intracellular growth, localization, and drug sensitivity. Cellular and mass spectrometric studies demonstrate Mtb infection-mediated enhanced fatty acid biogenesis and TAG biosynthesis in the hepatocytes regulated by PPARγ. We propose that infection of hepatocytes by Mtb during the chronic phase can contribute to significant changes in disease progression, TB treatment, and development of infection-induced metabolic diseases.</p>

<title>Human pulmonary tuberculosis patients harbor Mtb in the liver</title>
<p>Mtb infects lungs, and other organs like lymph nodes, pleura, bones, and meninges. There are also isolated case reports of hepatic TB, without providing many pathophysiological consequences[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. To gain further insights into the involvement of the liver in Mtb infections, we acquired human autopsied liver samples from individuals with miliary tuberculosis and analyzed them for the presence of Mtb bacilli. Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining showed the presence of distinct immune cell infiltration and granuloma-like structures in the infected samples <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref><bold> and Fig S1C)</bold>. We examined the liver specimens with Mtb specific Ziehl-Nielsen (Z-N) acid-fast and auramine O-rhodamine B stain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B, C</xref>). Both these stains showed distinct positive signals with characteristic rod-shaped bacilli that could be visualized by the acid-fast staining (as indicated by arrows) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). We further corroborated our findings by performing fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) using Mtb-specific 16s rRNA probes, where specific signals were observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). The specific staining in FISH eliminates the possibility of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTMs) in the tissue specimen and confirms the presence of Mtb infection in the liver. Similar staining in the uninfected liver sections from other individuals did not show any signal. <bold>(Fig S1 A, B</bold>). Although hepatic granuloma is the characteristic histological feature for both local and miliary forms of hepatic TB, the precise involvement of the different cells like Kupffer cells, hepatocytes, stellate cell, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and other cell types have not been studied in detail[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Multiplex immunostaining with β-actin antibody and Mtb-specific Ag85B antibody shows the presence of Ag85B signals within the human hepatocytes further confirming the presence of Mtb within hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref><bold> and Fig S1D)</bold>, indicated with yellow arrows). Hepatocytes are morphologically distinct, large polygonal cells (20-30 µm) with round nuclei, many of which are double-nucleated and mainly positioned at the center of the cytoplasm[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. The presence of Ag85B signals near the nucleus, as depicted in (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref><bold> and S1 D)</bold>, further supports our assertion. Moreover, hepatic granulomas in the human samples showed localized clustering of the immune cells <bold>(Fig S1D).</bold> Furthermore, to establish a correlation between liver Mtb load and Mtb burden at the primary infection site, the lung, we conducted H&amp;E staining and acid-fast staining on lung sections from the same individuals. H&amp;E staining revealed distinct granulomas, while acid-fast staining confirmed an elevated bacterial load, both indicative of a high degree of infection <bold>(Fig S1E, F).</bold> Using auramine O-rhodamine B, Ziehl-Nielsen acid-fast staining, and FISH, Mtb presence was detected in several lung specimens <bold>(Fig S1G).</bold> These results indicate Mtb infection in the liver of human subjects and suggest the localization of Mtb within hepatocytes. These findings are quite intriguing considering very few studies have discussed the lung-liver cross talk or the involvement of liver in pulmonary TB.</p>

<title>Mtb infection of mice via the aerosol route leads to significant infection of the liver and primary hepatocytes</title>
<p>To investigate whether the liver harbors Mtb during mice aerosol infection, we infected C57BL/6 mice with 200 CFU of Mtb <italic>H37Rv</italic> and scored for the bacterial load in the conventional niche- the lung as well as in the liver. Mtb could be detected in the liver consistently across several experiments in 4 weeks post-infection and the bacterial load increased till week 10 <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref><bold>).</bold> Consistent with the Mtb burden, phalloidin and hematoxylin, and eosin (H and E) staining of the infected liver at 8 weeks post-infection showed localized cellular aggregation forming ectopic granulomas forming a granuloma-like structure <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref><bold> and S2C).</bold> Further staining the liver sections with CD45.2 antibody shows clustering of immune cells in Mtb infected mice liver <bold>(Fig S2D).</bold> To assess whether liver infection leads to deranged liver function in the aerosol model, we analyzed the levels of liver functional enzymes like albumin aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) in the sera. Till week 10 post-infection, sera levels of these markers remain almost unchanged at the different time points post-infection <bold>(Fig S2B).</bold> Since hepatocytes, the principal parenchymal cells of the liver constitute 70-80 percent of the liver by weight, we hypothesized whether hepatocytes could harbor Mtb, in the murine model of infection. To this end, we isolated primary hepatocytes from the mice at different time points post-infection. The purity of the isolated hepatocytes was validated by multiple methods-morphologically hepatocytes can be identified by their distinct hexagonal architecture, round nucleus, some of which are binucleated as observed in Alexa fluor phalloidin 488 and DAPI stained hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Flow cytometry staining with antibody against hepatocyte specific marker asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGR1) protein, confirmed that almost 100 perfect of the isolated cells are primary hepatocytes as seen in (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). It was further validated by confocal microscopy as all the cultured cells specifically stained for ASGR1 protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>). After thorough confirmation of the identity and the purity of the hepatocytes, the cells were lysed and plated. Like the whole liver CFU, Mtb infected PHCs at 4 weeks post-infection with substantial bacterial load at week 6 and week 8 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>). Staining with antibody for Mtb-specific Ag85B protein in both the infected tissue sections and cultured hepatocytes isolated from the <italic>in vivo</italic> infected mice revealed the presence of Mtb within hepatocytes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref><bold>)</bold>. Besides the aerosol route, infection intraperitoneally also led to hepatocyte infection, also led to hepatocyte infection as early as day 10 <bold>(Fig S2A).</bold> Further, to prove the spread of Mtb to the liver in other model organisms, we infected guinea pigs with 200 CFU of Mtb and analyzed the bacterial load in the lung, liver, and spleen at week 4 and week 8 post-infection <bold>(Fig S3A)</bold>. At both the time points we could observe robust liver infection with granulomatous structure in the liver, proving that the dissemination of Mtb to the liver occurs across multiple model animals <bold>(Fig S3B).</bold></p>

<title>Hepatocytes provide a replicative niche to Mtb</title>
<p>Consistent data from human TB patients and aerosol murine model prompted us to develop an in vitro model of Mtb-hepatocyte. We examined Mtb infection in several hepatocyte cell lines of mouse and human origin along with primary murine hepatocytes. Infection studies with fluorescently labeled Mtb <italic>H37Rv</italic> were carried out with primary murine hepatocyte cells (PHCs), HepG2, Huh-7, and AML-12 <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A, B</xref><bold>, and </bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref><bold>).</bold> The multiplicity of infection was titrated both in PHCs and HepG2 with the MOI of 1, 2.5, 5, and 10. MOI 10 consistently showed an infectivity of more than 60% in both HepG2 and PHCs <bold>(Fig S4 A, B, and C).</bold> While we acknowledge that MOI 10 is moderately high, several well-cited studies have used MOI 10 for various conventional phagocytes and other non-conventional cell types like mesenchymal stem cells, adipocytes and human lymphatic endothelial cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Hence MOI 10 was selected for further experiments Macrophage cell lines RAW 264.7, THP-1, and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were used as positive controls. Even though PHCs, HepG2, Huh-7, and AML-12 are not considered to be classical phagocytic cells, all cells showed infectivity of more than 60 percent after 24 hours, comparable to RAW 264.7, THP-1 and BMDMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A, B</xref>). Analysis of bacterial load in the PHCs post-infection showed colony-forming units (CFU) like RAW 264.7, THP-1, and BMDMs, supporting microscopic observations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Mtb in macrophages is known to remodel the intracellular environment to survive within phagosomes. We studied Mtb growth kinetics within hepatocytes using GFP-labeled Mtb <italic>H37Rv</italic> in PHCs and HepG2 <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">F</xref><bold>).</bold> Mean fluorescent intensity measurements showed a consistent increase in GFP intensity in both PHCs and HepG2 with increasing time <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">G</xref><bold>).</bold> Fold change in replication dynamics with respect to 5 HPI showed that, while bacterial growth in macrophages plateaus after 48 hours post-infection, Mtb continues to grow in both HepG2 and PHCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>). Our studies thus establish that hepatocytes, besides being robustly infected by Mtb, also provide a favorable replicative niche for Mtb.</p>

<title>Transcriptomics of infected hepatocytes reveal significant changes in key metabolic pathways</title>
<p>To understand Mtb-induced changes in the hepatocytes and the underlying mechanisms of how hepatocytes provide a favorable environment to the pathogen, we performed transcriptomic analysis of the infected and sorted HepG2 cells at 0 hours (5 hours post incubation) and 48 hours post-infection. Sorting before RNA isolation specifically enriches the infected cellular population thus eliminating cellular RNA from uninfected cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Unsupervised clustering segregated the data into 4 distinct groups on the PC1 with a variance of 27 percent, showing good concordance within the replicates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). The close spatial clustering for the two 0-hour time points corresponding to uninfected and infected is indicative of relatively less transcriptomic changes. On the other hand, the spatial segregation of the 48 hours datasets suggests clear differences between the RNA transcripts of uninfected and infected cells. The differentially expressed genes were calculated using DE seqR with fold change &gt;0.5 and a false discovery rate of &lt;0.2. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for the differentially regulated pathways at both the early (0 hours) and the late (48 hours) infection time points is shown in (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). At 0 hours post-infection, the immediate stress response pathway of the cell, involving ROS generation, intracellular receptor signaling pathways, and response to xenobiotic stresses got activated, while at a late time point, Mtb modulated some of the key immuno-metabolic pathways like macroautophagy, cellular respiration, proteasomal degradation pathway, response to type I interferon, IκB kinase/NF-κB signaling, etc (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Major alterations in the vacuolar and vesicular transport at 48 hours are indicative of the dynamic changes in the phagosome maturation pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Volcano plot analysis showed greater relative changes in the gene expression pattern at 48 hours compared to 0 hours, with many genes like <italic>CXCL10, CXCL11, IDO, CCL5</italic> etc being greatly upregulated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E, 4F</xref>). Interestingly, our RNA sequencing data indicated major changes in various facets of lipid metabolic pathways like fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis pathways, etc. Several key genes like <italic>FASN, DGAT1, DGAT2</italic>, <italic>HMGCR</italic>, etc. were upregulated, indicating the possibility of greater synthesis of neutral lipids. Thus, transcriptomic studies shed light on several of the key Mtb-induced changes in the hepatocytes.</p>

<p>To understand the difference and similarities between the pathways that get affected in macrophages compared to hepatocytes during Mtb infection, we compared the gene expression analysis data from Mtb-infected HepG2, 48 hours post-infection with THP-1 infected macrophages, 48 post-infection, taken from Kalam et al.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] <bold>(Fig S5 A, B).</bold> The comparison provides insights regarding how Mtb modulates different pathways depending on the type of the host cell infected. In THP-1, most of the altered pathways are related to mounting an effective immune response to the bacteria like type 1 interferon signalling pathway, regulation of cytokine secretion, leukocyte chemotaxis, response to zinc, etc while in HepG2 the pathways that are getting altered are related to metabolism like response to xenobiotic stimulus, macroautophagy, glycerophospholipid and glycerolipid metabolism, and cellular respiration. This comparative analysis is indicative of Mtb’s ability to harness the metabolic richness of hepatocytes probably as a source for nutrients. Moreover, being a non-immune cell type hepatocytes might lack a robust innate immune pathway like the macrophages and hence be less likely to clear mycobacterial infection.</p>

<p>Mass-spectrometric analysis of the infected and uninfected HepG2 cells at 24 hours post-infection, showed an increase in both TAGs and DAGs and CEs with a decrease in the levels of free cholesterols, indicating Mtb-induced changes in the neutral lipid biosynthesis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). To understand whether Mtb utilizes host lipid droplets as a source of nutrients in hepatocytes, we treated Mtb-infected hepatocytes with specific inhibitors of de-novo fatty acid biosynthesis (C75) and TAG biosynthesis (T863) <bold>(Fig S6 A).</bold> Interestingly, inhibiting both de-novo fatty acid biosynthesis as well as TAG biosynthesis reduced the bacterial load in both PHCs and HepG2 by almost 1.0-1.5 log fold <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">H</xref><bold>)</bold>. In THP-1 macrophage, although C75 reduced bacterial load by 0.5 log fold but T863 did not affect the bacterial load (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5I</xref>). To get better insights into the nutritional dependency of intracellular Mtb on hepatocyte lipid source, we metabolically labelled HepG2 with 7.5 μg/ml of fluorescently tagged fatty acid (BODIPY 558/568 C<sub>12</sub>) which subsequently accumulated into host lipid droplets. After 16-20 hours, the labelled cells were treated with T863 and C75. Although T863 significantly reduced the load of the intracellular TAGs, C75 had little effect on the level of accumulated TAGs and showed a phenotype like the DMSO control <bold>(Fig S6 C and D).</bold> We infected these three set of cells with Mtb (MOI:10) for 24 hours. The Mtb isolated from DMSO and C75 treated HepG2 became distinctly labelled with highly fluorescent lipid bodies, but the fluorescence signal in Mtb derived from T863 treated cells was quite low and sparse <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref><bold> and S7 A).</bold> Considering that host-derived fatty acids are converted to triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the bacterial cytoplasm as a source of carbon and energy, we wanted to check whether the TAG synthesis machinery was modulated in the hepatocyte-infected Mtb. To this end, we isolated Mtb from HepG2, 48 hours post-infection, and analysed for key genes involved in TAG biosynthesis. Mtb grown in DMEM was used as a control. Interestingly, <italic>Tgs1, Tgs4, Rv 1760</italic>, etc were upregulated by 6-8-fold, indicating an active Mtb transcriptional change in Mtb to utilize and store host-derived lipids <bold>(Fig S6 B).</bold> Cumulatively, our studies thus demonstrate fatty acid biosynthesis and TAG formation to be important for Mtb growth in hepatocytes.</p>
<p>To assess the status of the neutral lipids in the liver, BODIPY staining was conducted in the liver cryosections of uninfected and infected mice (8 weeks post-infection). The liver of Mtb-infected mice bears more lipid bodies <bold>(Fig S8 A).</bold> Co-immunostaining of BODIPY and Ag85B also indicated a certain degree of colocalization of Mtb and Lipid bodies in the liver <bold>(Fig S8 B).</bold> Next, we stained the liver of Mtb-infected mice at 2-, 4- and 8-weeks post-infection with LipidTOX neutral red dye. Surprisingly we found an elevated signal intensity of the dye at 8 weeks post-infection. This shows that in mice, Lipid droplets might correlate with Mtb burden <bold>(Fig S8 C, D).</bold> Our data comprehensively establishes infection-induced lipid droplet accumulation as a pathogenic outcome of Mtb involvement in the liver during the chronic stage of infection.</p>

<title>PPARγ upregulation in Mtb-infected hepatocytes leads to augmented lipid biogenesis</title>
<p>To understand the molecular mechanism behind the accumulation of lipid droplets in the Mtb-infected liver at 8 weeks post-infection, we investigated the expression patterns of the transcription factors involved in the regulation of the genes of lipid biogenesis in our RNA-seq data. At 48 hours post-infection, the transcript levels of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) were upregulated by 5-6-fold. To validate, that we performed quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the <italic>PPAR γ</italic> gene in the infected HepG2 at 48 hours post-infection. With respect to the uninfected control, <italic>PPAR γ</italic> was upregulated by 3-4-fold. Besides, downstream adipogenic genes that are directly or indirectly controlled by <italic>PPARγ</italic> like <italic>MGAT1</italic>, <italic>FSP27</italic>, <italic>FASN</italic>, <italic>DGAT1</italic>, <italic>DGAT2</italic>, <italic>ACAT1, ACAT2, ADIPSIN</italic> etc were all upregulated by more than 2-fold in the infected cells. <bold>(Fig S9 A).</bold> Immunoblot also revealed a greater level of PPARγ protein in primary mouse hepatocytes at 24 hours and 48 hours post-infection in the Mtb infected cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C, D</xref>). In the in-vivo Mtb aerosol infection model, <italic>Pparγ</italic> expression levels showed an intriguing trend, at week post-infection, the expression level was comparable to the uninfected control, while at week 4 post-infection, the expression level spiked to 1.5-2-fold, reaching 3-4 fold at week 8 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). The pattern of expression of <italic>Pparγ</italic> in the infected liver correlated with the bacterial load in the liver, where we see the induction at week 4 when Mtb reaches the liver and maximum expression at week 8 when the load of Mtb is considerably high. Besides, PPARγ, some of the critical enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, TAG biosynthesis, cholesterol esterification like <italic>Fasn, Dgat1, Dgat2, Mgat1, Acat1, Acat2</italic> etc showed a temporal increase in expression levels at the later time points post-infection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). We then used a specific inhibitor of PPARγ, GW9662 (20 µM) and agonist of PPARγ, rosiglitazone (20µM) in infected HepG2 and quantified the bacterial load after 48 hours. Surprisingly, inhibition of PPARγ decreased the bacterial load by almost 2-fold, while chemically inducing PPARγ increased the bacterial load considerably <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6 E</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">F</xref><bold>, and S9B)</bold>. Moreover, LD number in cells also directly correlated with the levels of PPARγ <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">H</xref><bold>).</bold> To investigate whether, PPARγ expression was also induced in the liver of infected mice, we examined PPARγ in the liver post infection. Interestingly, we found enhanced expression PPARγ in the liver of the mice at 8 weeks post infection <bold>(Fig S9 C and D).</bold> Moreover, PPAR-γ intensity in hepatoctyte was also high in the infected liver <bold>(Fig S9 E).</bold> Thus, PPARγ activation resulting in lipid droplets formation by Mtb might be a mechanism of prolonging survival within hepatocytes.</p>

<title>Hepatocyte resident Mtb displays a drug-tolerant phenotype</title>
<p>The success of Mtb as a pathogen is partially attributed to its ability to survive and adapt to antibiotics[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Again Mtb-induced lipid accumulation in the liver might influence the activity of the various anti-TB drugs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Hepatocytes contain both phase I and phase II drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs). Further, the pharmacological potency of lipophilic drugs is determined by the rate at which these drugs are metabolized to inactive products[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (cyp450s) system is the key phase I DMEs and known to interact with rifampicin. We therefore analysed whether Mtb infection influences the cyp genes in hepatocytes. <italic>CYP3A4</italic> and <italic>CYP3A43</italic> respectively, both of which metabolize anti-TB drug rifampicin were upregulated in Mtb infected HepG2 by approximately 4-fold and 2-fold respectively <bold>(Fig S10A).</bold> Moreover, <italic>NAT2</italic> gene responsible for N-acetylation of isoniazid was also upregulated in the Mtb infected HepG2 by almost 2-fold) <bold>(Figure S10 A).</bold> We therefore argued that hepatocyte resident Mtb may display higher tolerance to rifampicin. Towards this, we treated Mtb-infected HepG2 and PHCs with different concentrations of Rifampicin (0.1, 0.5, 5 µg/ml) for 24 hours and CFU enumerated the bacterial after lysis. RAW 264.7 was kept as macrophage control with the similar experimental setup. The percentage of bacteria which survived the drugs was the drug tolerant population. Both HepG2 and PHCs resident Mtb were significantly tolerant to (25-30%) to rifampicin, as compared to the macrophages <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">B</xref><bold>).</bold> Almost 10 percent of the bacterial population in HepG2 display a tolerogenic phenotype at the highest antibiotic concentration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>

<p>We also examined Mtb susceptibility to isoniazid (INH), which is predominantly metabolized (50–90%) via N-acetylation of its hydrazine functionality by arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (<italic>NAT2</italic>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Interestingly, KEGG analysis of transcriptomic data suggested several genes in this pathway to be upregulated in hepatocytes infected with Mtb <bold>(Fig S10 B).</bold> Experimental studies indeed showed higher tolerance of Mtb to INH in both primary hepatocytes and HepG2 at different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 5 µg/ml) <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">C</xref><bold>).</bold> Moreover, transcript levels of some of the key DMEs (were upregulated in the liver of the infected mice, 8 weeks post-infection like <italic>Nat2, Cyp2e1, Slco1b2</italic>, <italic>Ces1, Ces2, and Aadac</italic> (upregulated by almost 2-3-fold) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>). To corroborate the CFU data, we repeated the same experiment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>) and looked at the bacterial load within each PHC/BMDM using high-resolution confocal microscopy. Mouse BMDMs were as a macrophage control. Here also we have calculated the % tolerance as a ratio by measuring the mean fluorescent intensity of GFP-Mtb per hepatocyte treated with drug to MFI of GFP-Mtb per hepatocyte treated with DMSO (control). Extensive analysis of more than 200 cells showed distinctly presence of more Mtb within PHCs treated with both rifampicin and isoniazid than in BMDMs treated with the same concentration of the drugs <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D, E</xref><bold> and S11A).</bold></p>
<p>Drug tolerance is the phenomenon of Mtb surviving drug treatment for longer durations in the absence of any resistance mechanisms. It is a bacterial property influenced by both bacterial and host-induced factors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. To check whether Mtb derived from hepatocytes, post-drug exposure has altered drug sensitivity or not, we conducted a resazurin microtitre assay with different dilutions of both rifampicin and isoniazid with Mtb derived from PHCs treated with DMSO, Mtb derived from PHCs post-exposure to rifampicin and Mtb derived from PHCs post-exposure to isoniazid. Mtb from all three different setups did not show any alterations in their MIC values, displaying no change in drug sensitivity (<bold>Fig S12 A</bold>). The increased tolerance of Mtb within the hepatocytes can also be attributed to the increased activity of the drug efflux pumps. Drug efflux pumps like Rv1258c, Rv1410, and Rv1819c are known to get upregulated under drug stress conditions, preventing the accumulation of the drugs and thereby decreasing drug sensitivity. To this end, we isolated intracellular Mtb RNA from HepG2 treated with DMSO, 0.5 μg/ml rifampicin, and 0.5 μg/ml isoniazid and checked for the expression of key drug efflux pumps like <italic>Rv 1258c. Rv1410, Rv1819</italic> etc in these three Mtb populations <bold>(Fig S12 B, C and D).</bold> Interestingly, quantitative RT-PCR analyses of these Mtb genes did not show any upregulation of these transporters in Mtb derived from HepG2 exposed to rifampicin and isoniazid, indicating that drug tolerance phenotype can be better attributed to host intrinsic factors rather than Mtb efflux pumps. Our data show that Mtb-infection of hepatocytes induces DMEs, and this host-specific extrinsic activation may result in decreased bioavailability or increased inactivation of anti-TB drugs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Over the years, various anatomical and cellular environments conducive to Mtb infection have been identified, particularly concerning its latency[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Pulmonary TB typically presents with classical symptoms such as persistent coughing and mucus production due to lung involvement[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. While systemic manifestations like weight loss, fatigue, and loss of appetite are commonly linked to TB progression, the underlying factors driving these metabolic derangements remain unexplored. Our study sheds light on hepatocytes as a previously unrecognized site for Mtb survival and replication. We have observed that Mtb infection disrupts hepatocyte lipid metabolism via PPARγ, leading to increased levels of fatty acids and triglycerides that the bacteria utilize for sustenance and proliferation. We hypothesize that liver involvement in chronic TB, characterized by lipid imbalance, may contribute to TB-associated metabolic complications. Intriguingly, a recent investigation demonstrated that hepatic PPARγ activation induces the expression of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a crucial regulator of weight loss observed in ketogenic diets[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>].</p>
<p>In a chronic disease like tuberculosis (TB), which persists over an extended period, it is quite surprising that Mtb infection of hepatocytes has been ignored thus far. While previous research has explored liver infection by Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) using an intra-venous model in mice, the bacilli were predominantly found within tissue-resident macrophages or Kupffer cells at 15 minutes and 2 days post-infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. However, our study consistently identified the presence of Mtb within hepatocytes in a murine aerosol infection model after the fourth week. Similarly, in a guinea pig aerosol infection model, liver infection was evident, marked by distinct granulomas by week 4. Furthermore, analysis of human biopsy liver samples from pulmonary TB patients revealed ectopic granuloma-like structures within the liver hepatocytes, with the presence of Mtb-specific Ag85B signals within hepatocytes. Together, these findings underscore hepatocytes as a novel niche for Mtb persistence, shedding new light on the pathogenesis of TB. Interestingly, in infected armadillos, <italic>M. leprae</italic> is shown to infect hepatocytes and hijack liver homeostatic, regeneration pathways to promote <italic>de novo</italic> organogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>].</p>
<p>The increased expression of PPARγ induced by Mtb in hepatocytes results in elevated levels of cholesterol esters (CE 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1), diacylglycerols (DAGs 36:1, 36:2, and 34:1), and triacylglycerols (TAGs 18:1/36:2, 18:0/36:2, and 18:0/36:1), leading to enhanced lipid droplets. Alongside the colocalization of labeled Mtb with lipid droplets in primary hepatocytes, the upregulation of key TAG biosynthesis genes such as <italic>Tgs1</italic>, <italic>Tgs4</italic>, and <italic>Rv1760</italic> in Mtb residing within hepatocytes underscores a transcriptional rewiring within the pathogen to assimilate lipids. Using PPARγ agonists and antagonists, corresponding decreases or increases in bacterial burden were observed, underscoring the pivotal role of PPARγ in Mtb survival within hepatocytes. The lipid remodeling induced by Mtb infection in hepatocytes is recapitulated in the murine aerosol model, where an increased number of lipid droplets was observed at week 8, accompanied by localized accumulation of immune cells and granuloma-like structures.</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that Mtb-infected macrophage populations can induce PPARγ expression through the mannose receptor-dependent pathway leading to enhanced lipid biosynthesis, production of anti-inflammatory mediators, and prevention of host cell apoptosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Recent findings have further underscored heightened levels of PPARγ in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from TB patients with elevated cortisol levels and increased disease severity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Moreover, what distinguishes hepatocytes is their pivotal role in systemic lipid metabolism by regulating de novo fatty acid synthesis, TAG synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and the regulation of LDL and VLDL[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Mtb-mediated perturbation of these vital processes can lead to a sequela of metabolic disorders such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Accumulation of lipids within hepatocytes offers advantageous conditions for Mtb survival. In macrophages, heightened intracellular lipid levels have been observed to impede autophagy and the acidification of phagolysosomes, both crucial for bacterial eradication[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Despite these parallels, comparative transcriptomic analyses of infected HepG2 cells with THP1 cells highlight differences in pathways such as vacuolar and vesicular transport, xenobiotic metabolism, macroautophagy, and cellular respiration. Furthermore, hepatocytes secrete hepatokines, a class of proteins serving as signaling molecules, with diverse roles in metabolism, inflammation, and energy homeostasis, thereby influencing the host-pathogen interplay[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Additionally, we suggest that Mtb infection of hepatocytes creates a drug-tolerant environment in the liver due to activation of DMEs, many of which are earlier shown to metabolize the two frontline drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. Moreover, lipid accumulation in the liver might also indirectly alter the levels of the drug metabolizing enzymes as reported in previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Upregulation of transcripts is not only observed in infected cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, but also in the livers of mice eight weeks after Mtb infection. Particularly noteworthy is the upregulation of NAT-2, which controls the rate-limiting step of acetylating isoniazid into acetylisoniazid. This metabolite is further processed into acetylhydrazine and isonicotinic acid, ultimately reducing the drug’s effectiveness against Mtb. Similarly, key rifampicin-metabolizing esterase genes such as Ces1, Ces2, Aadac, and transporter Slco1b2 exhibit upregulation, potentially influencing the drug’s distribution and metabolism in the body. The activation of DMEs can significantly modify the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-TB medications, resulting in suboptimal drug concentrations and the emergence of drug-resistant strains[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>].</p>
<p>Although animal models offer valuable insights into Mtb infection and TB pathology, they fall short of fully replicating the complexities of human TB. Several recent studies in COVID-19 patients have shown that hepatocytes get infected with SARs-CoV-2, thereby increasing gluconeogenesis and hyperglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>].) With compelling reports associating hepatic steatosis with the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we speculate that TB-induced perturbations in lipid metabolism might predispose chronic TB patients to T2DM and vice versa[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Through our investigation, we propose that future studies in human TB patients might scrutinize this metabolically rich hepatocyte niche to understand multiple organ-wide derangements in TB pathogenesis.</p>

<title>qRT-PCR of intracellular Mtb isolated from hepatocytes</title>
<p>HepG2 cells were infected with Mtb at a MOI of 10 and at the respective time points post-infection, the intracellular Mtb was isolated. In all experiments, the cells were treated with amikacin to remove the extracellular bacteria, followed by subsequent washing by 1X PBS. 4M Guanidine isocyanate was added to the flasks in equal amount to the media and the cells were scrapped. The suspension was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 7 minutes and the pellet was resuspended in 350 μl of the RNA Lysis buffer of MN Kit (740955.250), followed by beat beating. RNA was isolated as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Isolated RNA was treated with Dnase (PGM052, Puregene) for 1 hour to remove genomic DNA contamination. RNA integrity was checked by running it on a 2% agarose gel with RNA loading dye.</p>
<p>1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the Takara cDNA synthesis kit (6110A) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression analysis by quantitative real-time PCR was performed PowerUp SYBR Green PCR (Thermo fischer scientific, (A25742) master mix in ABI 7500 FAST instrument. 16S rRNA was used as the normalizing control and comparative Ct method was used for quantification.</p>

<title>Fluorescent fatty acid labelling of HepG2 and isolation</title>
<p>HepG2 cells were incubated with 7.5 μg/ml of fluorescently tagged fatty acid (BODIPY 558/568 C<sub>12</sub>) for 24 hours. The unincorporated fatty acids were removed by washing it with 1X PBS, three times. After that the cells were treated with DMSO or inhibitors (T863 and C75) for 24 hours, followed by infection with Mtb at a MOI of 10, following the standardized protocol of infection. A separate set of cells before infection were analysed for the effect of the inhibitors on LD formation by microscopy.</p>
<p>After, 48 hours post infection, the cells were washed with 1X PBS and treated with Triton X-100 (0.05% v/v in water), probe sonicated, and Mtb from the cells were isolated by centrifuging at 3500 RPM for 8 minutes. Isolated Mtb cells were washed with 1X PBS and fixed with 4% PFA and stained with DAPI (1mg/ml). The cells were mounted on poly-L-lysine coated slides with antifade agent. The cells were visualised in Zeiss 980 LSM confocal microscope at 100X, magnification.</p>

<title>RNA isolation</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from HepG2, PHCs and liver sections using the MN-NucleoSpin RNA isolation kit (740955.250) following the manufacturer’s protocol. For RNA sequencing, an equal number of cells was used during isolation. For Liver tissue, approximately 10mg was tissue was used. The quality of the RNA was verified by running it on a 1.5% agarose gel and by monitoring 260/280 ratios. All the RNA samples were frozen together in −80°C. For RNA sequencing, 3-5 ug of RNA was shipped in sodium acetate buffer (3 M Sodium acetate, pH 5.2) with 100% Ethanol. 4 biological replicates from each time point were sent for sequencing. The RNA samples with RNA integrity number (RIN &gt; 8.5) were used for library preparation.</p>
<p>RNA samples (for four biological replicates) were subjected to pair-end RNA sequencing after rRNA depletion on the Illumina platform Novaseq-6000 at CCMB, Hyderabad, India. Quality control and sequence trimming was performed using fastp (v0.23.2). The trimmed paired-end reads were aligned to the human genome (GRCh38) using the HISAT2 (v2.2.1) pipeline. Reads were assembled into transcripts using StringTie (v2.2.1). Annotation was conducted using aligned sequences and a GTF annotation file. The mapped reads were then used for generating the count table using StringTie (v2.2.1), genes lacking an Ensembl ID annotation were excluded. We arrived at a list of 62694 genes which were used for further analysis <bold>(available through GEO accession-GSE256184).</bold> The differential count was performed by DEseq2 (R package) using the uninfected samples of respective time points. Pathway enrichment was performed using the GO database and clusters were visualized using the R package ClusterProfiler. Further pathways of interest were analysed by GAGE and visualized using Pathview in KEGG view.</p>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> study examines infection of the liver and hepatocytes during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection using different systems including aerosol infection of mice and guinea pigs to demonstrate appreciable infection of the liver as well as the lung. The authors present <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that hepatocyte infection leads to metabolic dysfunction that promotes M. tuberculosis growth, in part potentially mediated by a nuclear receptor called PPARg. Overall, this is an interesting paper on an area of tuberculosis research which has been understudied, representing a significant advancement in the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors showed the presence of Mtb in human liver biopsy samples of TB patients and reported that chronic infection of Mtb causes immune-metabolic dysregulation. Authors showed that Mtb replicates in hepatocytes in a lipid rich environment created by up regulating transcription factor PPARγ. Authors also reported that Mtb protects itself from anti-TB drugs by inducing drug metabolising enzymes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It has been shown that Mtb induces storage of triacylglycerol in macrophages by induction of WNT6/ACC2 which helps in its replication and intracellular survival, however, creation of favorable replicative niche in hepatocytes by Mtb is not reported. It is known that Mtb infects macrophages and induces formation of lipid-laden foamy macrophages which eventually causes tissue destruction in TB patients. In a recent article it has been reported that &quot;A terpene nucleoside from M. tuberculosis induces lysosomal lipid storage in foamy macrophages&quot; that shows how Mtb manipulates host defense mechanisms for its survival. In this manuscript, authors reported the enhancement of lipid droplets in Mtb infected hepatocytes and convincingly showed that fatty acid synthesis and triacylglycerol formation is important for growth of Mtb in hepatocytes. The authors also showed the molecular mechanism for accumulation of lipid and showed that the transcription factor associated with lipid biogenesis, PPARγ and adipogenic genes were upregulated in Mtb infected cells.</p>
<p>The comparison of gene expression data between macrophages and hepatocytes by authors is important which indicates that Mtb modulates different pathways in different cell type as in macrophages it is related to immune response whereas, in hepatocytes it is related to metabolic pathways.</p>
<p>Authors also reported that Mtb residing in hepatocytes showed drug tolerance phenotype due to up regulation of enzymes involved in drug metabolism and showed that cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that metabolize rifampicin and NAT2 gene responsible for N-acetylation of isoniazid were up regulated in Mtb infected cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are reports of hepatic tuberculosis in pulmonary TB patients especially in immune-compromised patients, therefore finding granuloma in human liver biopsy samples is not surprising.</p>
<p>
Mtb infected hepatic cells showed induced DME and NAT and this could lead to enhanced metabolism of drug by hepatic cells as a result Mtb in side HepG2 cells get exposed to reduced drug concentration and show higher tolerance to drug. The authors mentioned that &quot; hepatocyte resident Mtb may display higher tolerance to rifampicin&quot;. In my opinion higher tolerance to drugs is possible only when DME of Mtb inside is up regulated or the target is modified. Although, in the end authors mentioned that drug tolerance phenotype can be better attributed to host intrinsic factors rather than Mtb efflux pumps. It may be better if the Drug tolerant phenotype section can be rewritten to clarify the facts.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Sarkar et al has demonstrated the infection of liver cells/hepatocytes with Mtb and the significance of liver cells in the replication of Mtb by reprogramming lipid metabolism during tuberculosis. Besides, the present study shows that similar to Mtb infection of macrophages (reviewed in Chen et al., 2024; Toobian et al., 2021), Mtb infects liver cells but with a greater multiplication owing to consumption of enhanced lipid resources mediated by PPARg that could be cleared by its inhibitors. The strength of the study lies in the clinical evaluation of the presence of Mtb in human autopsied liver samples from individuals with miliary tuberculosis and the presence of a clear granuloma-like structure. The interesting observation is of granuloma-like structure in liver which prompts further investigations in the field.</p>
<p>The modulation of lipid synthesis during Mtb infection, such as PPARg upregulation, appears generic to different cell types including both liver cells and macrophage cells. It is also known that infection affect PPARγ expression and activity in hepatocytes. It is also known that this can lead to lipid droplet accumulation in the liver and the development of fatty liver disease (as shown for HCV). This study is in a similar line for M.tb infection. As the liver is the main site for lipid regulation, the availability of lipid resources is greater and higher is the replication rate. In short, the observations from the study confirm the earlier studies with these additional cell types. It is known that higher the lipid content, the greater are Lipid Droplet-positive Mtb and higher is the drug resistance (Mekonnen et al., 2021). The DMEs of liver cells add further to the phenotype.</p>

<p>This manuscript by Sarkar et al. examines the infection of the liver and hepatocytes during M. tuberculosis infection. They demonstrate that aerosol infection of mice and guinea pigs leads to appreciable infection of the liver as well as the lung. Transcriptomic analysis of HepG2 cells showed differential regulation of metabolic pathways including fatty acid metabolic processing. Hepatocyte infection is assisted by fatty acid synthesis in the liver and inhibiting this caused reduced Mtb growth. The nuclear receptor PPARg was upregulated by Mtb infection and inhibition or agonism of its activity caused a reduction or increase in Mtb growth, respectively, supporting data published elsewhere about the role of PPARg in lung macrophage Mtb infection. Finally, the authors show that Mtb infection of hepatocytes can cause upregulation of enzymes that metabolize antibiotics, resulting in increased tolerance of these drugs by Mtb in the liver.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting paper on an area of TB research where we lack understanding. However, some additions to the experiments and figures are needed to improve the rigor of the paper and further support the findings. Most importantly, although the authors show that Mtb can infect hepatocytes in vitro, they fail to describe how bacteria get from the lungs to the liver in an aerosolized infection. They also claim that &quot;PPARg activation resulting in lipid droplets formation by Mtb might be a mechanism of prolonging survival within hepatocytes&quot; but do not show a direct interaction between PPARg activation and lipid droplet formation and lipid metabolism, only that PPARg promotes Mtb growth. Thus, the correlations with PPARg appear to be there but causation, implied in the abstract and discussion, is not proven.</p>
<p>The human photomicrographs are important and overall well done (lung and liver from the same individuals is excellent). However, in lines 120-121, the authors comment on the absence of studies on the precise involvement of different cells in the liver. In this study there is no attempt to immunophenotype the nature of the cells harboring Mtb in these samples (esp. hepatocytes). Proving that hepatocytes specifically harbor the bacteria in these human samples would add significant rigor to the conclusions made.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors showed the presence of Mtb in human liver biopsy samples of TB patients and reported that chronic infection of Mtb causes immune-metabolic dysregulation. Authors showed that Mtb replicates in hepatocytes in a lipid rich environment created by up regulating transcription factor PPARγ. Authors also reported that Mtb protects itself from anti-TB drugs by inducing drug metabolising enzymes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It has been shown that Mtb induces storage of triacylglycerol in macrophages by induction of WNT6/ACC2 which helps in its replication and intracellular survival, however, creation of favorable replicative niche in hepatocytes by Mtb is not reported. It is known that Mtb infects macrophages and induces formation of lipid-laden foamy macrophages which eventually causes tissue destruction in TB patients. In a recent article it has been reported that &quot;A terpene nucleoside from M. tuberculosis induces lysosomal lipid storage in foamy macrophages&quot; that shows how Mtb manipulates host defense mechanisms for its survival. In this manuscript, authors reported the enhancement of lipid droplets in Mtb infected hepatocytes and convincingly showed that fatty acid synthesis and triacylglycerol formation is important for growth of Mtb in hepatocytes. The authors also showed the molecular mechanism for accumulation of lipid and showed that the transcription factor associated with lipid biogenesis, PPARγ and adipogenic genes were upregulated in Mtb infected cells.</p>
<p>The comparison of gene expression data between macrophages and hepatocytes by authors is important which indicates that Mtb modulates different pathways in different cell type as in macrophages it is related to immune response whereas, in hepatocytes it is related to metabolic pathways.</p>
<p>Authors also reported that Mtb residing in hepatocytes showed drug tolerance phenotype due to up regulation of enzymes involved in drug metabolism and showed that cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that metabolize rifampicin and NAT2 gene responsible for N-acetylation of isoniazid were up regulated in Mtb infected cells.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are reports of hepatic tuberculosis in pulmonary TB patients especially in immune-compromised patients, therefore finding granuloma in human liver biopsy samples is not surprising.</p>
<p>Mtb infected hepatic cells showed induced DME and NAT and this could lead to enhanced metabolism of drug by hepatic cells as a result Mtb in side HepG2 cells get exposed to reduced drug concentration and show higher tolerance to drug. The authors mentioned that &quot; hepatocyte resident Mtb may display higher tolerance to rifampicin&quot;. In my opinion higher tolerance to drugs is possible only when DME of Mtb inside is up regulated or the target is modified. Although, in the end authors mentioned that drug tolerance phenotype can be better attributed to host intrinsic factors rather than Mtb efflux pumps. It may be better if the Drug tolerant phenotype section can be rewritten to clarify the facts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that several case studies regarding liver infection in pulmonary TB patients have been reported in the literature, however this report is the first comprehensive study that establishes hepatocytes to be a favourable niche for Mtb survival and growth.</p>
<p>Drug tolerance is a phenomenon that is exhibited by the bacteria and in the course of host-pathogen interactions, can be influenced by both intrinsic (bacterial) and extrinsic (host-mediated) factors. Multiple examples of tolerance being attributed to host driven factors can be found in literature (PMID 32546788, PMID: 28659799, PMID: 32846197). Our studies demonstrate that Mtb infected hepatocytes create a drug tolerant environment by modulating the expression of Drug modifying enzymes (DMEs) in the hepatocytes.</p>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer we will rewrite the drug tolerant phenotype section.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Sarkar et al has demonstrated the infection of liver cells/hepatocytes with Mtb and the significance of liver cells in the replication of Mtb by reprogramming lipid metabolism during tuberculosis. Besides, the present study shows that similar to Mtb infection of macrophages (reviewed in Chen et al., 2024; Toobian et al., 2021), Mtb infects liver cells but with a greater multiplication owing to consumption of enhanced lipid resources mediated by PPARg that could be cleared by its inhibitors. The strength of the study lies in the clinical evaluation of the presence of Mtb in human autopsied liver samples from individuals with miliary tuberculosis and the presence of a clear granuloma-like structure. The interesting observation is of granuloma-like structure in liver which prompts further investigations in the field.</p>
<p>The modulation of lipid synthesis during Mtb infection, such as PPARg upregulation, appears generic to different cell types including both liver cells and macrophage cells. It is also known that infection affect PPARγ expression and activity in hepatocytes. It is also known that this can lead to lipid droplet accumulation in the liver and the development of fatty liver disease (as shown for HCV). This study is in a similar line for M.tb infection. As the liver is the main site for lipid regulation, the availability of lipid resources is greater and higher is the replication rate. In short, the observations from the study confirm the earlier studies with these additional cell types. It is known that higher the lipid content, the greater are Lipid Droplet-positive Mtb and higher is the drug resistance (Mekonnen et al., 2021). The DMEs of liver cells add further to the phenotype.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript by Sarkar et al. examines the infection of the liver and hepatocytes during M. tuberculosis infection. They demonstrate that aerosol infection of mice and guinea pigs leads to appreciable infection of the liver as well as the lung. Transcriptomic analysis of HepG2 cells showed differential regulation of metabolic pathways including fatty acid metabolic processing. Hepatocyte infection is assisted by fatty acid synthesis in the liver and inhibiting this caused reduced Mtb growth. The nuclear receptor PPARg was upregulated by Mtb infection and inhibition or agonism of its activity caused a reduction or increase in Mtb growth, respectively, supporting data published elsewhere about the role of PPARg in lung macrophage Mtb infection. Finally, the authors show that Mtb infection of hepatocytes can cause upregulation of enzymes that metabolize antibiotics, resulting in increased tolerance of these drugs by Mtb in the liver.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting paper on an area of TB research where we lack understanding. However, some additions to the experiments and figures are needed to improve the rigor of the paper and further support the findings. Most importantly, although the authors show that Mtb can infect hepatocytes in vitro, they fail to describe how bacteria get from the lungs to the liver in an aerosolized infection. They also claim that &quot;PPARg activation resulting in lipid droplets formation by Mtb might be a mechanism of prolonging survival within hepatocytes&quot; but do not show a direct interaction between PPARg activation and lipid droplet formation and lipid metabolism, only that PPARg promotes Mtb growth. Thus, the correlations with PPARg appear to be there but causation, implied in the abstract and discussion, is not proven.</p>
<p>The human photomicrographs are important and overall, well done (lung and liver from the same individuals is excellent). However, in lines 120-121, the authors comment on the absence of studies on the precise involvement of different cells in the liver. In this study there is no attempt to immunophenotype the nature of the cells harboring Mtb in these samples (esp. hepatocytes). Proving that hepatocytes specifically harbor the bacteria in these human samples would add significant rigor to the conclusions made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for nicely summarizing our manuscript.</p>
<p>Our study establishes the involvement of liver and hepatocytes in pulmonary TB infection in mice. Understanding the mechanism of bacterial dissemination from the lung to the liver in aerosol infections demands a detailed separate study.</p>
<p>Figure 6E and 6F shows how PPARγ agonist and antagonist modulate (increase and decrease respectively) bacterial growth in hepatocytes (further supported by the CFU data in Supplementary Figure 9B). Again, the number of lipid droplets in hepatocytes increase and decrease with the application of PPARγ agonist and antagonist respectively as shown in Figure 6G and 6H. Collectively, these studies provide strong evidence that PPARγ activation leads to more lipid droplets that support better Mtb growth.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for finding our human photomicrographs convincing. In the manuscript, we provide evidence for the direct involvement of the hepatocytes (and liver) in Mtb infection. We perform detailed immunophenotyping of hepatocyte cells in the mice model with ASPGR1 (asialoglycoprotein receptor 1) and in the revised version of record, we will further stain the infected hepatocytes with anti-albumin antibody.</p>
