<title>Abstract</title><p>The protein translocon at the endoplasmic reticulum comprises the Sec61 translocation channel and numerous accessory factors that collectively facilitate the biogenesis of secretory and membrane proteins. Here, we leveraged recent advances in cryo-EM and structure prediction to derive insights into several novel configurations of the ribosome-translocon complex. We show how a transmembrane domain (TMD) in a looped configuration passes through the Sec61 lateral gate during membrane insertion; how a nascent chain can bind and constrain the conformation of ribosomal protein uL22; and how the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex can adjust its position during different stages of protein biogenesis. Most unexpectedly, we find that a large proportion of translocon complexes contains RAMP4 intercalated into Sec61’s lateral gate, widening Sec61’s central pore and contributing to its hydrophilic interior. These structures lead to mechanistic hypotheses for translocon function and highlight a remarkably plastic machinery whose conformations and composition adjust dynamically to its diverse range of substrates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most eukaryotic secretory and membrane proteins are translocated co-translationally across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane at a ribosome-translocon complex (RTC). The central component of this translocon is the Sec61 complex, a heterotrimer containing a channel-forming α subunit and peripheral β and γ subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. In prokaryotes, the homologous SecYEG complex mediates translocation across the plasma membrane. In all organisms, this central channel associates dynamically with a variety of partners and accessory factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The structure and function of some accessory factors, such as the oligosaccharyl transferase complex (OST), are well established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, whereas many others are poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Although these various translocon components have long been speculated to engage in a context-and substrate-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, the rules governing their coordination are largely unclear and only now beginning to emerge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Sec61α is a pseudosymmetric channel that can open axially across the membrane and is laterally gated toward the lipid bilayer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. In its closed state, the axial channel’s pore is constricted, blocked by a short helix known as the plug, and the lateral gate is closed. Transport of hydrophilic polypeptide segments through Sec61 can be initiated by a flanking hydrophobic α-helix. These hydrophobic helices act as signal sequences that bind to Sec61’s lateral gate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This binding is thought to widen the central pore, destabilise the plug, and thread one of the signal’s hydrophilic flanking regions into the channel to initiate translocation. A set of hydrophobic residues, known as the pore ring, lines the narrowest part of the channel and form a gasket-like seal that maintains the permeability barrier during translocation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>This model of channel opening is derived from structures of a cleavable signal peptide (SP) bound to the mammalian Sec61 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> or bacterial SecYEG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Most membrane proteins lack an N-terminal SP and instead initiate translocation using their first TMD, often termed a signal anchor (SA). Although it has long been thought an SA initiates flanking domain translocation the same way as an SP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, direct evidence for this idea is sparse and somewhat contradictory. Furthermore, the route an SP or SA takes to the lateral gate remains speculative. One model posits that they all access the lateral gate from the channel interior, displacing the plug <italic>en route</italic>. Alternatively, a hydrophobic helix could slide along the lipid-facing side of the lateral gate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, or use a member of the Oxa1 family for insertion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Structures of TMD insertion intermediates would help resolve these and other crucial mechanistic issues in membrane protein biogenesis.</p>
<p>Beyond the Sec61 channel, a number of accessory factors co-translationally modify the polypeptide, facilitate membrane protein biogenesis, or facilitate secretion through Sec61. The two major modification factors are OST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and the signal peptidase complex (SPC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Based on recent structural and functional studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and consistent with genetic co-dependency analysis across more than a thousand cancer cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, four protein complexes are now assigned to co-translational membrane protein biogenesis: EMC, PAT, GEL, and BOS. EMC, whose core EMC3 subunit is a member of the Oxa1 family of insertases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, mediates insertion of SAs in the N<sub>exo</sub> topology (N-terminus facing the exoplasmic side of the membrane)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. The other three complexes are recruited to the ribosome-Sec61 complex at a later stage of multipass biogenesis to form the multipass translocon (MPT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The MPT is thought to facilitate insertion of pairs of downstream TMDs connected by a short translocated loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. This insertion might be facilitated by the GEL complex, whose TMCO1 subunit is another member of the Oxa1 family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and does not seem to rely on the lateral gate of the Sec61 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Three factors are linked to co-translational Sec61-mediated secretion: TRAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, TRAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, and RAMP4 (also called SERP1, known as Ysy6 in yeast)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Both TRAP and RAMP4 are tightly associated near-stoichiometrically with ER-localized ribosome-Sec61 complexes from pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, an exceptionally secretory tissue. TRAM, although not tightly associated with ribosomes, can be crosslinked to SPs and TMDs at a point when they are at Sec61’s lateral gate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Depletion of TRAM or TRAP reduces the capability of some SPs to successfully initiate translocation through Sec61 <italic>in vitro</italic>, placing their function at an early gating step<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The role of RAMP4 is largely unclear, but it can be crosslinked to nascent chains translocating through Sec61<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, shows secretion defects in knockout cells and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> and it is induced by ER stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. The mechanisms by which any of these factors impacts secretion are unclear, but would be aided by structural information on how they engage the ribosome-Sec61 translocon.</p>
<p>In this study, we have taken advantage of the heterogeneity of most stalled protein biogenesis intermediates assembled in vitro. Whereas substrates at certain key steps might have uniform and stable interactions with the biogenesis machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, others probably sample multiple states dynamically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. For example, both OST and MPT factors dynamically and heterogeneously associate at their overlapping sites behind Sec61. TMDs sample multiple environments such as the lateral gate, intramembrane chaperones, and the surrounding lipid. Hence, a substrate stalled at a single point during elongation can form multiple ribosome-translocon complexes. Improvements in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) imaging and particle classification now allow sample heterogeneity to be resolved into multiple discrete density maps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. When combined with rapid advances in structure prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, these maps can be fitted with reliable models. Using this approach, we present structures of a TMD insertion intermediate at Sec61’s lateral gate, RAMP4 and TRAP within ribosome-translocon complexes, and a new configuration of ribosomal protein uL22 that forms contacts with Sec61 and the nascent substrate.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>We performed a thorough single-particle cryo-EM analysis of a previous dataset of RTCs engaged in biogenesis of the multipass membrane protein rhodopsin (Rho)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The construct is termed Rho<sup>ext</sup> because it contains the first two TMDs of Rho and is extended at its N-terminus by fusion to an SP and an epitope tag (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The Rho<sup>ext</sup> intermediate in this sample has elongated to the point where the SP has been removed after directing translocation of the N-terminal domain across the membrane, RhoTM1 has inserted into the membrane, and RhoTM2 has emerged from the ribosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. At this critical chain length, the nascent chain is poised at a point where it can potentially form several different RTCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-E</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>), only one of which was analyzed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Crosslinking and co-association experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> show that the nascent chain is just long enough for RhoTM1 to begin recruiting the PAT complex and initiate assembly of the MPT. Analysis of this subset of RTCs previously showed how the PAT complex latches Sec61 shut and redirects RhoTM2 toward the just-assembling MPT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Because PAT complex recruitment and MPT assembly are just beginning, the dataset also contains multiple PAT-free complexes. We now analyze these particles via extensive classification (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>) and find that without PAT, Sec61 is either closed, opened by RhoTM2, or opened by an unexpected factor, RAMP4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>). The closed structure is similar to the previously reported PAT-bound structure, so we focus on RhoTM2-and RAMP4-bound structures. We then compare various available structures, together with structure predictions and modelling, to reveal new insights into the structural dynamic of RTCs.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>The structure of Sec61 inserting a membrane protein</title>
<p>In the absence of the PAT complex, the Sec61 complex is free to open. In the intermediate being analyzed, RhoTM2, whose eventual topology in the final protein would be N<sub>cyt</sub> (i.e., the N-terminal flanking domain facing the cytosol), has just fully emerged from the ribosome with a 33 amino acid downstream tether to the P site tRNA. This is long enough for the first half of RhoTM2 to begin engaging the Sec61 complex, and a subset of RTCs displayed this event (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref>). We find that the N-terminal half of RhoTM2 binds to Sec61 very similarly to the previously characterized hydrophobic helix (h-region) of a signal peptide (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Thus, both kinds of N<sub>cyt</sub> substrate, SPs and TMDs, can bind Sec61 in the same way, despite TMDs having much longer hydrophobic helices than SPs do. The extra length of this TMD is passing through the channel pore, as will be discussed below.</p>

<p>Bound in this position, the N-terminal end of the hydrophobic region of the SP or TMD is only 11 Å (∼3 aa) from the tip of 28S rRNA helix 59 (H59) and the adjacent polyacidic tail of eL22 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The backbone phosphates and the exposed aromatic rings of U2707-8 in H59, and the acidic residues of eL22, are potential binding sites for basic side chains. Importantly, basic resides are sharply enriched ∼3-5 aa from the hydrophobic helix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Thus, H59 and eL22 are well positioned to engage cationic residues flanking a signal and retain them in the cytosol, a phenomenon called the positive-inside rule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Notably, the next nearest rRNA, H47, is too far to serve this role (32 Å, ∼9 aa). Earlier lower resolution maps of a bacterial RTC similarly noted the proximity of H59 to the membrane and SecY’s lateral gate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Given that H59 is also near the N-terminus of a SP bound to bacterial and mammalian signal recognition particle (SRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, H59 may contribute to the positive-inside rule throughout both targeting by SRP and insertion by Sec61.</p>
<p>To accommodate the TMD, the N-half of Sec61 has rotated out of the membrane plane toward the ribosome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). It is striking that the open conformation induced by the TMD is indistinguishable from that induced by an SP (Cα RMSD 0.691 Å; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), despite their dissimilar sequences and despite Sec61’s continuous flexibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. As an explanation for this bistable behaviour, we observe that the open conformation is stabilised by contacts between the N-half of Sec61α and the ribosome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The N-half and ribosome have been thought to be isolated from one another, but we find that Sec61 residues 21-27 contact the 28S rRNA helix 24 and uL24, including a particularly well-resolved cation-π interaction between Sec61α R24 and 28S A389. Bacterial SecY lacks this entire loop, perhaps because bacterial secretion is driven by SecA, which competes with ribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Archaeal SecY, however, does conserve this loop’s structure (Cα RMSD 0.67 Å with <italic>M. jannaschii</italic>) and consensus sequence (euk. KPE<underline>R</underline>KIQ vs arc. KPE<underline>R</underline>KVSL, with the cation-π arginine underlined). Stabilising interactions with this widely conserved motif may help Sec61 respond to its diverse substrates with a consistent open state.</p>
<p>Whereas the N-terminal half of RhoTM2 is helical, its C-terminal half loops back through the Sec61 pore in an unfolded conformation similar to the segment of polypeptide downstream of a SP during secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. This is accommodated by the plug helix moving toward the lumenal tip of Sec61γ, effectively becoming part of the channel’s lumenal funnel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), as previously seen with the bacterial plug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Our observation that different segments of a TMD can simultaneously occupy the lateral gate and central channel is consistent with the through-pore model of insertion, rather than the sliding model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, at least for this substrate. The through-pore translocation may be favoured because the ribosome exit tunnel’s mouth holds an emerging TMD closer to the Sec61 pore than to the lateral gate. Moreover, the free energy cost of passing a hydrophobic TMD through the hydrophilic pore could be mitigated by the hydrophobic pore ring and partly hydrophilic TMD.</p>
<p>Prior structures of ribosome-bound, open Sec61 disagreed on the structure of the channel pore due to differences in how the rotations of core helices were modelled (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. With ∼3.7 Å resolution (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>) and 1.8-3.5 Å predicted aligned error (PAE) restraints from the AlphaFold2 (AF2) prediction of Sec61, we find that the pore is ringed by four aliphatic residues: V85, I183, I292, and L449. Nearby residues F42, I81, I84, L89, I179, I187, I289, and I453 extend hydrophobic patches outward from the pore ring (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). The four pore ring residues identified here are homologous to the four pore ring residues of bacterial SecY<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, and adopt similar positions as in the open SecY structure (Cα RMSD 1.1 Å)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. These four residues are pseudosymmetric and likely inherited from SecY’s dimeric ancestor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Thus this structure shows that the likely ancestral pore architecture is universally conserved across the SecY family.</p>
<p>The structure of RhoTM2 trapped during insertion via the central channel of Sec61 represents a paradigm for insertion of N<sub>cyt</sub> signal anchors and the subset of N<sub>cyt</sub> TMDs in multipass membrane proteins followed by a long (&gt;100 aa) translocated loop. Both types of substrates are potently inhibited by Sec61 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> whose binding site at the lateral gate is mutually exclusive with the position of the TMD observed in our structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. In the case of N<sub>cyt</sub> TMDs followed by a short (&lt;50 aa) translocated loop and another TMD, insertion is thought to occur as a TMD-pair via an Oxa1 family member such as the GEL complex within the MPT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Given that Rho biogenesis is not sensitive to Sec61 lateral gate inhibitors, RhoTM2 seems to normally be inserted together with RhoTM3 via the GEL complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Although the structure seen here probably represents an alternative route captured due to ribosome stalling, it nonetheless proved to be an illuminating paradigm.</p>

<title>RAMP4 occupies the Sec61 gate</title>
<p>Alongside a RhoTM2-bound map, image classification yielded a map in which Sec61 is bound to a different and unexpected density. This density consists of a kinked TMD bound to the Sec61 lateral gate and a ribosome-binding domain (RBD; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The resolution of the RBD density was sufficient for de novo modelling, identifying the sequence as RAMP4. The location, structure, and function of RAMP4 has long been unclear.</p>

</fig>
<p>RAMP4’s RBD is hook-shaped (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Its N-terminus is comprised of an α-helix (residues 5-15) flanked by 3<sub>10</sub>-helices (3-7,13-20). Subsequent residues then loop back along the helix. The hook is stabilised by an intramolecular hydrogen bond (K13-S28) and a dense network of intermolecular contacts with the ribosome. Specifically, the RBD binds the 28S rRNA’s helices 47, 57 and 59 and ribosomal proteins eL19, 22, and 31, via electrostatic interactions and via hydrophobic interactions with pockets on each of the three ribosomal proteins. The only other factor known to bind in this region is the nascent polypeptide-associated complex subunit β (NACβ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, whose anchor domain has a very different structure but would partly clash with the RAMP4 RBD.</p>
<p>RAMP4’s RBD is connected by a flexible linker to the kinked TMD. This region is less well resolved, so to inform modelling we used AF2 to predict the structure of the Sec61•RAMP4 complex. The resulting prediction is confident (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>) and agrees with the density map. To check that this prediction was specific to RAMP4, we used AF2 to screen a diverse panel of other TMDs and SPs, and found that RAMP4 was indeed the only protein predicted to bind Sec61 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>). Thus our model of the RAMP4 TMD is supported by both the density map and a confident, specific structure prediction.</p>
<p>The cytoplasmic half of the RAMP4 TMD is hydrophobic and binds the open Sec61 gate as if it were a TMD or SP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Bound here, RAMP4 holds the Sec61 pore ring wide, just as SPs and TMDs do (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Unlike an SP or TMD, however, RAMP4 does not displace the plug helix. Instead, the plug moves together with the widening pore ring, keeping it plugged. This observation contrasts with prior speculation that pore widening is sufficient to trigger plug displacement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Pore widening and unplugging do indeed occur together when the gate is opened by an SP or TMD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), but RAMP4 shows that widening can occur without unplugging. This implies that unplugging occurs when an SP or TMD pulls a flanking segment of nascent chain through the channel pore, and this necessarily displaces the plug. RAMP4, being a tail-anchored protein, threads nothing through the pore, and thus does not clash with the plug.</p>
<p>At its midpoint, the TMD of RAMP4 is kinked 40° at a conserved glycine, and the lumenal half of the TMD is amphipathic. The TMD’s hydrophilic face is oriented toward the channel interior and completes the hydrophilic lumenal funnel of Sec61α (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). RAMP4’s integral contribution to forming the Sec61 channel explains why it, and not the more peripheral Sec61β or γ subunits, crosslinks with nascent chain-encoded photoprobes in the Sec61 channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Comparing different classes of particles, we see that RAMP4 competes with other factors. RAMP4 is partially or completely depleted from classes in which the gate is closed, occupied by RhoTM2, or latched shut by the PAT complex (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). By competing with RAMP4’s TMD, RhoTM2 and PAT also reduce the occupancy of its RBD, which indicates that the RBD alone binds too weakly to be retained during extraction, purification and grid preparation. This is consistent with biochemical evidence that RAMP4’s association is detergent-sensitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Together, these factors explain why RAMP4’s occupancy in prior cryo-EM maps was low enough to be overlooked, although in hindsight seems to be visible in several<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To assess the abundance of Sec61•RAMP4 complexes in native membranes, we examined the best native maps currently available, from the subtomogram averages of ribosomes from human cell-derived microsomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. This dataset was separated into four classes of RTCs: 70% Sec61•TRAP•OSTA, 12% Sec61•MPT, 10% Sec61•TRAP, and 9% Sec61•TRAP•MPT. Examining each class average for the RAMP4 RBD, we find that it is present in the classes without MPT and absent from the classes with MPT, consistent with our single-particle analysis. We then estimated the occupancy of RAMP4 using OccuPy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, and found that it is present in ∼85% of Sec61•TRAP•OSTA RTCs and ∼53% of Sec61•TRAP RTCs (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>), which equals ∼81% of the non-MPT RTCs. Thus, RAMP4 is absent from MPT-containing RTCs and seems to be present in almost all non-MPT RTCs.</p>
<p>Alongside the RAMP4 RBD, the subtomogram averages also show density for RAMP4’s kinked TMD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Previously, this TMD density had been speculated to represent SPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. But the helical density observed is ∼25 aa long, like RAMP4’s TMD, whereas the helices of SPs are only 7-15 aa long<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Moreover, the occupancy of this TMD is high, even after hours of translation inhibition (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, when SP occupancy should be low due to their co-translational dissociation and subsequent processing and degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. We therefore assign the kinked TMD density in these earlier maps to RAMP4, implying that most co-translational translocation normally occurs through Sec61•RAMP4 channels.</p>
<p>Having described the structure of mammalian RAMP4, we briefly consider how widely conserved this structure may be. Examining representative model organisms (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>), we find that in both cases RAMP4 is confidently predicted to bind Sec61 like animal RAMP4 does (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>). Especially conserved is the region surrounding RAMP4’s glycine kink and Sec61 N300 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F,G</xref>), which is part of Sec61’s polar cluster that is important for gating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. To assess when RAMP4 arose in evolution, we searched for homologs in several early-branching eukaryotic taxa (Discoba, Metamonada, Malawimonada) and found it to be largely absent from those groups, suggesting an origin more recent than the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Thus RAMP4, although not ubiquitous, is present across the major eukaryotic kingdoms and forms a dynamically associating part of the Sec61 channel.</p>

<title>uL22’s C-tail switches to contact Sec61 and the nascent chain</title>
<p>In our non-MPT maps, we were surprised to observe density for the C-tail of ribosomal protein uL22 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). This tail has not been described in any prior structural studies. Here, we find it stretched across the ribosome’s membrane-facing surface toward Sec61 and the nascent chain, contacting eL31 and several RNA helices along the way (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Density for the C-terminal helix (CTH) is moderately strong (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>) and similar in each class of particles, indicating that it is not strongly correlated with TRAP or RAMP4 occupancy, nor Sec61 conformation or nascent chain binding to Sec61.

<graphic xlink:href="572959v1_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Having seen that uL22 can adopt an engaged or displaced state in different ribosome-translocon complexes, we then compared these states to a map of cytoplasmic ribosomes without bound translocons (EMD-40205, the best-resolved mammalian map available)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. The cytoplasmic ribosome displays clear density for the uL22 tail up to the point where it binds H24/47, but the following CTH is diffuse, indicating that it is flexibly anchored to H24/47. Anchored here, the CTH would be well-positioned to scan emerging nascent chains and sense when Sec61 binds.</p>
<p>To judge how common uL22 engagement is, we re-examined publicly available RTC maps for previously overlooked uL22 density. We found clear uL22 CTH density in maps from several recent studies (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. Most importantly, it is present in subtomogram averages of RTCs transporting diverse endogenous nascent chains through intact microsomal membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and the uL22 CTH density in those maps is just as strong as in the present dataset (∼40% occupancy; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref>). This indicates that uL22 engagement is common in native translocons. It is unclear why it is not visible in earlier maps; it may be present and not well-resolved, or absent due to a preference for specific nascent chain features.</p>
<p>Comparing the uL22 tail across species, we find that it is conserved by the earliest branches of the animal tree, but not by the nearest non-animal branches (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Although fungi have an elongated uL22 tail, it is unlike the animal tail in sequence, and appears to have arisen independently. Indeed structures show that the fungal uL22 tail binds to an entirely different site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>, and does so constitutively instead of dynamically. Taken together, this suggests that the animal uL22 tail structure was acquired during the evolution of the first animals. Among animals, the uL22 tail’s conservation suggests that it is functionally important. Particularly well-conserved is the SXKK motif that initiates the CTH and binds H24/47 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The tip of the CTH that would contact nascent chains typically contains a mix of basic, acidic, and hydrophobic residues, and this complexity makes it difficult to predict what if any nascent chain features it may recognise.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that when engaged, the uL22 CTH blocks a gap between the ribosome and Sec61 that would otherwise allow the nascent chain to exit the channel vestibule and enter the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). This gate-side exit is one of two such exits, with the other being on the Sec61 hinge side, where multipass proteins exit for insertion by the MPT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. While uL22 blocks the gate-side exit, the hinge-side exit would remain open. The functional consequences of this change are currently unclear.</p>

<title>Structure of the TRAP-calnexin complex</title>
<p>The occupancy of the hetero-tetrameric TRAP complex (comprised of α, β, γ, and δ subunits) in the all-particle map was low, so we performed focused classification on this region and obtained two well-resolved TRAP classes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>). TRAP in these two classes adopts slightly different tilts with respect to the ribosome, which we call conformations 1 and 2, although the true range of TRAP conformations is presumably continuous rather than discrete. The TRAP maps were well fit by a predicted model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) after minor adjustments. One additional protein density was observed in TRAP class 1, consisting of a TMD and cytoplasmic helix bound to TRAPγ. We provisionally assign this density to Calnexin because it is by far the major TRAP-binding protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup> and it is known to bind TRAP via its TMD. The TRAP-calnexin interaction was not detected by AF2, perhaps because Calnexin di-palmitoylation, which AF2 ignores, is crucial for TRAP interaction with Calnexin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. Anchoring of Calnexin at this position would explain how its elongated lumenal domain interacts co-translationally with nascent chains as they are translocated by RTCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>The TMDs of TRAPβγδ and calnexin all bundle together, but not the TMD of TRAPα. Instead, the TRAPα TMD binds the lumenal hinge loop of Sec61α, as does the TRAPα lumenal domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B.3</xref>). While making those lumenal contacts, the TRAPα TMD tilts its cytoplasmic end away from Sec61α, allowing conserved basic residues flanking its TMD to contact the tip of 5.8S rRNA helix 7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B.4</xref>). Strikingly, this rRNA segment has undergone a dramatic rearrangement from its cytoplasmic state, which puts C81, U85, and U86 in contact with the membrane and the basic residues in TRAP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B.5</xref>). From there, the C-tail of TRAPα continues along the ribosome surface and binds tightly at a site contacting uL23, uL29, and 5.8S rRNA helix 9 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B.6</xref>).

<title>TRAP competes and cooperates with different translocon subunits</title>
<p>The TRAPδ Ig-like domain contains a helical hairpin between β-strands 6 and 7. No similar hairpin appears in any other domain in the AFDB50 database queried by Foldseek<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7A</xref>). This unique hairpin is isolated in our Sec61-TRAP structure, but in Sec61-TRAP-OSTA structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, it extends toward OST-A subunit RPN2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). A basic patch on TRAPδ is separated by less than 5 Å from an acidic patch on RPN2, indicating that they would share an electrostatic attraction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, inset). Each partner presents three conserved charges, and the closest pair (K117 on TRAPδ and D386 on RPN2) is the most conserved, indicating that their attraction is functionally important. OSTA’s attraction to TRAPδ is weak compared to its binding to the ribosome, but TRAPδ may nonetheless help recruit OSTA, since TRAPδ would attract OSTA from most possible angles of approach, whereas OSTA’s ribosome contacts are stereospecific. The TRAPδ-OSTA interaction may explain why TRAPδ defects cause congenital disorders of glycosylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Comparing the TRAP structure to the MPT structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, we find that TRAP would clash with part of the MPT, namely the BOS complex comprised of TMEM147, Nicalin and NOMO. The prior BOS model omitted NOMO, so to fully characterise this clash we ran a prediction of the full BOS complex structure, obtaining a high-confidence prediction that fits a previously reported subtomogram average<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). As an aside, it is noteworthy that the first pre-albumin-like domain (PLD1) in NOMO is predicted to bind PLD10 and PLD11, suggesting that its reported ability to regulate the spacing between ER sheets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup> results from it forming antiparallel homodimers across the ER lumen (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7B</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparing the TRAP and BOS structures, TRAPα competes with BOS subunit TMEM147 for the same binding sites on the hinge loop of Sec61α and the 5.8S rRNA’s helix 7, while PLD12 of NOMO would clash to a more limited degree with the lumenal domain of TRAPβ. When TRAP is displaced by BOS, its interactions with Sec61 are disrupted and its transmembrane bundle (which is no longer visible in the cryo-EM map) evidently pivots toward the still-bound TRAPα C-tail RBD, causing a pronounced shift in the shape of the detergent micelle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). This extensive competition explains why prior studies found TRAP in only 40% of MPT complexes, but at high occupancy at all other RTCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Additional functionally relevant TRAP features</title>
<p>The above analysis shows that TRAP binds together ribosomes, OSTA, and Sec61, but competes with the MPT, whose presence inhibits Sec61. In principle, these activities could suffice to explain TRAP’s observed functions as a stimulator of Sec61-dependent secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and OSTA-dependent glycosylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>. However, we observe four additional TRAP features that appear functionally relevant and are therefore noteworthy.</p>
<p>First, TRAPα presents a conserved patch to the nascent chain where it first emerges from Sec61 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). This patch could potentially bind the nascent chain or redirect it toward the active site of OSTA. Second, by binding the C-half of Sec61, TRAP can potentially influence the opening of the lateral gate (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). If TRAP caused the C-half to favour opening, this would explain in part why it stimulates the recognition of weakly-gating signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The combined effect could explain its overall stimulatory role in translocation.</p>
<p>Third, TRAP prefers a membrane plane tilted 20° relative to Sec61’s, and imposes this curvature on the surrounding micelle (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). The same tilt is observed in Sec61-TRAP maps from intact membranes, but it is unclear whether TRAP imposed this curvature on the membrane, since it is the same degree of curvature found in native ER tubes and sheet edges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. Thus while it is possible that TRAP modulates Sec61 activity by disrupting the local membrane, it may instead have adapted to reside in and sense pre-existing membrane deformations.</p>
<p>Fourth, the lumenal domain of TRAPα near the Sec61 channel has an extraordinarily long and acidic N-tail anchored tipped by hydrophobic residues (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). This could interact with any lumenal part of the translocon or nascent chain. No data is available on this tail’s function, aside from the fact that it and calnexin each bind far more calcium than any other protein in ER membrane extracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup> as expected for its exceptional charge and abundance.</p>

<title>TRAP conservation across eukaryotes and archaea</title>
<p>Having described the features of metazoan TRAP, here we briefly contrast it with TRAP in representative model organisms from plantae (<italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>), fungi (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), and excavates (<italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>), a group of early-branching eukaryotes. <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> has already been shown by subtomogram averaging to contain TRAPαβ-like density at its translocons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>. Indeed we find that its genome contains TRAPαβ but not γδ, and the predicted structure of <italic>Cr</italic> TRAPαβ-Sec61 fits the tomographic density with minor adjustments (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). <italic>Cr</italic> TRAP conserves animal TRAP’s predicted binding to the Sec61 hinge and its C-tail RBD. However, whereas animal TRAP binds to the ribosome at eL38 via TRAPγ, <italic>Cr</italic> TRAP is predicted to bind this same ribosomal protein via TRAPβ (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, inset). Thus the <italic>Cr</italic> and animal complexes share the similar ribosome-binding sites despite their differences in composition. As an aside, it is noteworthy that the <italic>Cr</italic> TRAPβ TMD is too hydrophilic to insert on its own (Δ<italic>G<sub>pred</sub></italic> = 1.824, i.e. 5% insertion), suggesting that it is bound and stabilised by an unidentified protein functionally analogous to TRAPγ.</p>
<p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has no annotated TRAP genes, and indeed it has been suggested that most fungi lack TRAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>. However, we find that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> contains a previously unidentified gene for TRAPα (Irc22, HHpred E = 10<sup>-35</sup>). This suggests TRAP’s prevalence in fungi has been underestimated. <italic>Sc</italic> TRAPα conserves animal TRAPα’s predicted binding to the Sec61 hinge and its C-tail RBD (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). No other TRAP subunits were detected in <italic>cerevisiae</italic> by sequence-or structure-based searches (HHpred, Foldseek). Thus TRAP’s links to co-translational translocation may be conserved in fungi, but its complexity is dramatically reduced.</p>
<p>The early-branching excavate <italic>T. brucei</italic> has TRAPα, β, and γ, but no δ (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). <italic>Tb</italic> TRAPαγ conserve the same predicted interactions as their homologs in fungi, plants, and animals (where found). Overall, the observed distribution and conservation of features suggest that the original eukaryotic TRAP consisted of TRAPαβγ, bound the Sec61 hinge loop via TRAPα, bound the ribosome flexibly via the TRAPα C-tail RBD and the TRAPγ N-tail, and also contacted the ribosome via the TRAPβγ bundle.</p>
<p>If TRAPαβγ were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor, they may have been inherited from archaea, which are the ancestors of eukaryotes. Structural queries of eukaryotes’ archaeal sister group (Heimdallarchaeota) identified candidate homologs of TRAPα (E = 9.95×10<sup>-8</sup>), β (E = 5.15×10<sup>-10</sup>), possibly TRAPγ (E = 1.84), and not TRAPδ, as expected. To test whether these candidates are also similar to TRAPαβγ in sequence, we used them to perform reciprocal HHpred queries of the human proteome, and in each case the corresponding human TRAP protein was the top hit (E = 0.031 for TRAPα, 9.4×10<sup>-14</sup> for TRAP β, and 110 for TRAPγ).</p>
<p>We then queried AF2 to see whether the top-scoring archaeal TRAPαβγ hits were predicted to form a complex with each other or with SecY. No contacts among the top hits were detected, but this could be an artefact of how few sequences AF2 could collect to constrain the prediction (as few as 5). By contrast, contacts were confidently predicted between archaeal TRAPα and SecY, forming a dimer similar to the eukaryotic TRAPα-Sec61 dimer (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). This similarity was predicted even though no eukaryotic TRAPα were included in the input alignment or training set, and thus it was based on archaeal TRAPα alone.</p>
<p>While performing sequence searches with TRAPα and β, we were surprised to find that they are much more similar in sequence than we had expected (HHpred <italic>p</italic> = 2×10<sup>-7</sup>), suggesting that they share a common ancestor. In fact they are more similar to one another than to any other human proteins (HHpred), including other Ig-like domains. By contrast, TRAPδ is quite dissimilar (HHpred α <italic>p</italic> = 0.64, β 0.66). Thus although TRAP’s three lumenal domains all have Ig-like folds, it appears that two of them, TRAPα and β, originated when an archaeal proto-TRAP protein duplicated, whereas TRAPδ is evolutionarily unrelated (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). If proto-TRAP formed dimers, it would presumably resemble a homomeric version of the heterodimeric TRAPαβ complex found in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Toward understanding TRAP’s mechanism, it is noteworthy that although its affinity for the ribosome and Sec61 are conserved, at least two of the four other functionally relevant features highlighted above are not conserved: yeast TRAP’s single TMD is unlikely to deform membranes, and TRAP from many organisms does not have a polyacidic lumenal domain. The other two features, allosteric effects on gating and a putative substrate-binding activity, could plausibly be conserved together with the TRAPα-Sec61 structure.</p>

<title>Conclusions and perspective</title>
<p>The most striking finding of this work is that the Sec61 protein secretion channel essentially has a fourth subunit, RAMP4, which is present in about 80% of non-MPT ribosome-translocon complexes. Our structure shows that RAMP4 binds to Sec61 like a SP, thereby blocking the channel’s lateral gate, holding wide its central pore, and completing its lumenal funnel. For these reasons, we speculate that RAMP4 acts as a surrogate SP. It is possible that once a secretory protein’s SP dissociates from the lateral gate, the central channel would narrow, thereby impeding translocation speed or efficiency. By binding the lateral gate during these later stages of translocation, RAMP4 could smooth transport through the channel for certain types of sequences. Such a role would explain why RAMP4 seems to be present during the vast majority of co-translational translocation through Sec61. Although RAMP4 appears to be eukaryote-specific, other proteins may serve similar functions in some prokaryotes. For example, the first TMD of <italic>E. coli</italic> YidC invades the lateral gate of SecYEG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>, as does the TMD of PpiD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>, a periplasmic chaperone.</p>
<p>A second noteworthy advance in this work is a relatively clear view of how an N<sub>cyt</sub> TMD initially engages Sec61, revealing a mode of interaction very similar to SPs. In both cases, the positive-inside rule may be enforced in part by interactions with rRNA helix 59 and the anionic C-tail of eL22. The difference is that the TMD is more than twice as long as the hydrophobic region of an SP. Hence, while the N-terminal part of the TMD binds like an SP, its C-terminal part loops back through the channel pore similar to the mature domain downstream of an SP. This finding supports the through-pore model for TMD insertion rather than the sliding model, in which TMDs would instead translocate through the lipid phase at the lateral gate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. It remains to be seen whether this model also applies to N<sub>exo</sub> TMDs, which unlike N<sub>cyt</sub> TMDs, are highly refractory to inhibitors that block Sec61’s lateral gate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The third major area of insight concerns the TRAP-Calnexin complex, adding to and refining recent structural models of the TRAP complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup>. We describe the extensive network of contacts with the ribosome and Sec61, potentially responsible for TRAP’s effects on secretion. We show how a unique hairpin on the lumenal domain of TRAPδ forms a bridge to RPN2 in OSTA, potentially explaining why TRAP deficiency causes glycosylation defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>. Unlike this TRAP-OSTA cooperation, we observe competition between TRAP and the BOS complex for the same binding site on Sec61 and the ribosome, explaining why TRAP is depleted and disordered in MPT-containing RTCs. Our sequence analysis and structure predictions for TRAP complexes in taxa beyond mammals reveal conserved features indicating that the original eukaryotic TRAP complex was similar to mammalian TRAPαβγ, which probably evolved from a predecessor in archaea.</p>
<p>These three major areas of insight, together with a number of additional findings regarding Sec61-ribosome interactions, the Sec61 pore ring, the dynamic tail of uL22, and a marked conformational change in 5.8S rRNA on translocon binding collectively lead to a wealth of new hypotheses regarding protein translocation at the ER. A major theme emerging from this and other studies in recent years is that the translocon is not static in either its composition or conformation. Instead, various factors and domains are often mutually exclusive, requiring dynamic reorganisation in ways small and large. Understanding how different types of substrates drive such reorganisation to facilitate their biogenesis remains a major challenge. This problem is analogous to the cytosol where multiple factors must dynamically access the ribosome exit tunnel to triage the nascent protein toward different fates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup>. Our analysis of various new translocon configurations sheds light on how this complex machinery facilitates secretory and membrane protein biogenesis.</p>

<title>Sample preparation and electron microscopy</title>
<p>Sample preparation and electron microscopy was described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In brief, the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reaction used a PCR-generated template containing the SP6 promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>. The transcription reactions were for 1 hour at 37°C. The resulting transcript was used without further purification and was diluted 1:20 in the IVT reaction, which was carried out in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>. The reaction was supplemented with canine rough microsomes (cRMs) prepared and used as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>. The translation reaction was incubated for 30 min at 32°C, then halted by transferring the samples to ice. All further steps were performed at 0-4°C, unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>A 2 ml translation reaction was divided in four, and each aliquot layered on a 500 µl cushion of 20% sucrose in 1x RNC buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 200 mM KOAc, 5 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>). The microsomes were sedimented by centrifugation at 4°C in the TLA-55 rotor (Beckman) at 55,000 rpm for 20 min. The cRM pellets were each resuspended in 25 μl of RNC buffer and pooled. The sample was incubated with 250 μM BMH on ice for 15 min and quenched with 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The microsomes were diluted with 400 μl of solubilisation buffer (RNC buffer containing 1.5% digitonin) and incubated for 10 min on ice. The digitonin was obtained from Calbiochem and further purified as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The sample was centrifuged at 20,000 × <italic>g</italic> and 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a tube containing 20 μl of StrepTactin High Performance Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and incubated for 1.5 h at 4°C. The resin was then washed five times with 0.5 ml RNC buffer containing 0.25% digitonin and eluted by incubation for 1 h on ice with 40 μl of RNC buffer containing 0.25% digitonin and 50 mM biotin. The absorbance of the eluate for both samples was 3.4 at 260 nm.</p>
<p>The affinity-purified RNCs were vitrified on UltrAuFoil R 1.2/1.3 300-mesh grids (Quantifoil) coated with graphene oxide (Sigma-Aldrich). In a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4°C and 100% ambient humidity, each grid was loaded with 3 μl of sample, blotted 4 sec with Whatman filter papers at a blot force of -15, and plunge frozen in liquid ethane at 92 K. Automated data collection was performed on a Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an XFEG source operating at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Defocus was programmed to range between 2.7 and 1.9 μm. Movies were captured using a K3 Bioquantum direct electron detector (Gatan) operating in super-resolution mode. Movies were dose-fractionated into 54 frames covering a total dose of 54 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>. 17,540 images were collected.</p>

<title>Image processing</title>
<p>Movie frames were motion-corrected using MotionCor2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup> with 7×5 patches and dose-weighting, and their contrast transfer functions (CTFs) were fit using CTFFIND 4.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup>. After manual curation, 285 of 12,540 micrographs (2.3%) were discarded due to poor CTF fits or thick ice. Subsequent steps were performed in RELION-4.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref></sup>. Manual picking on 20 randomly selected micrographs yielded 2,745 particles, which were used to train the automatic particle-picker Topaz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup>. Topaz was run on all micrographs and picks assigned a figure of merit (FOM) above -3 were retained. This cutoff was chosen based on a histogram of pick FOMs, which was approximately normal above -3 but displayed a long lower-FOM tail, and subsequently checked against the micrographs to verify sensible results. Picked particles were extracted in 412 px boxes (1.34 Å/px), binned to 128 px (4.31 Å/px), and classified in 2-D with a 300-Å diameter mask, 200 classes <italic>k</italic> and a regularisation parameter <italic>T</italic> of 2. 80 2-D classes showing clear molecular features were retained, encompassing 1,188,459 particles. These particles’ coordinates were used to retrain Topaz. The retrained Topaz model picked 1,389,410 particles at FOM ≥ -1, a cutoff selected by the same criterion as above.</p>
<p>The picked particles were extracted in 412 px boxes, binned to 128 px, and refined in 3-D against a mammalian ribosome reference map lowpass-filtered at 70 Å, yielding a Nyquist-limited (8.62 Å) map. With fixed alignments from this refinement, particles were classified in 3-D (<italic>k</italic> = 20, <italic>T =</italic> 4), yielding 80S (38%), 80S ratcheted (15%), 60S (10%), poorly resolved (36%), and ten noise (1%) classes, as well as 6 empty classes. The 875,065 well-resolved ribosomal particles were combined, re-extracted in 420 px boxes without binning, and refined in 3-D to obtain a 2.86 Å map, which improved to 2.68 Å after CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing. This is the all-particle map.</p>
<p>The aligned particles were then subclassified without realignment using three different masks for residual signal subtraction: a tight mask surrounding the mobile parts of Sec61 and RAMP4, a tight mask surrounding the TRAP complex, and a loose mask encompassing both Sec61•RAMP4 and TRAP. The loose masking did not clearly separate most classes, but did provide the clearest view of TRAPα’s TMD, which crosses the boundary between the tighter masks. The resulting classes are shown in the processing flowchart (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>). The well-resolved TRAP classes were further subclassified to obtain maps where Sec61 was also more homogeneous. This second subclassification yielded noisier classes because the particle numbers are much smaller, but the TRAP and Rho-bound Sec61 classes yielded clear density. After reconstruction, density maps’ local scale and occupancy were estimated using OccuPy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Maps were postprocessed using Relion’s MTF-correction and automated B-factor sharpening, and were also lowpass-filtered where indicated. Some maps were in parallel postprocessed using DeepEMhancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup> for use in rendering figures.</p>

<title>Molecular modelling</title>
<p>The 60S subunit and P-site tRNA from PDB 7tm3 were used as an initial model for the rabbit ribosome. An initial model for uL22 was fetched from the ΑlphaFold DB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup>. For the Sec61-RAMP4 complex and TRAP complex, initial models were generated using colabfold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup> with ΑlphaFold2-Multimer v3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Default options were used, except that the top-scoring models were refined by AMBER relaxation to avoid clashes that would interfere with subsequent simulations. Separate multimer predictions were also generated for the interactions of TRAP with Sec61α, TRAPγ with eL38, and TRAPα with uL23/29, for use as references for modelling restraints. All sequences were fetched from UniProt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The initial models for these complexes were fit to density using ISOLDE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup> molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) with adaptive pLDDT-and PAE-dependent restraints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup>. Segments that were not confidently predicted, as indicated by high PAE or low pLDDT scores, were omitted unless they could be built based on the cryo-EM density alone. Final real-space refinements were performed using PHENIX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref></sup>. Three rounds of global minimisation and group B-factor refinement were performed, with tight secondary structure, reference model, rotamer, and Ramachandran restraints applied. Secondary structure-and reference model restraints were determined from the starting models. Hydrogen-bonding and base-pair and stacking parallelity restraints were applied to the rRNA. Final model statistics are provided in table S1. Models were rendered using ChimeraX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>No refinements were performed for the BOS complex model, nor the four non-mammalian TRAP•Sec61 models. The <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> TRAP model predicted by AF2 was fitted to the tomographic density map EMD-4145 in ISOLDE using its ribosome interactions as anchor points (the Sec61-ribosome binding site and predicted TRAPβ-eL38 binding site). For each non-mammalian TRAP•Sec61 model, separate predictions were run to probe for interactions with eL38 or uL29. For the panel of multimeric predictions used to test whether RAMP4’s predicted interaction with Sec61 was a positive outlier, a separate prediction was run for Sec61 with each of the other sequences in the panel. The resulting predictions were checked visually to confirm that none besides RAMP4 engaged the lateral gate, and a Python script was used to gather the intersubunit PAEs and generate a violin plot of their distribution.</p>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> study offers new structural insights into the form and functions of the ribosome-translocon complex. Through a combination of in vitro translation, cryoEM imaging, and comprehensive AlphaFold comparative modeling, the authors offer <bold>convincing</bold> support for the lateral gate model of co-translational ER protein biogenesis, including the location of RAMP4 near the Sec61 lateral gate and the plausible role of helix 59 of the 28S ribosomal RNA as a determinant of the positive-inside rule. While the reviewers identified minor limitations, such as the need to validate RAMP4 presence with orthogonal measures, these results will be broadly impactful.</p>

<p>The paper 'Structural Analysis of the Dynamic Ribosome-Translocon Complex,' authored by Lewis et al., meticulously explores various conformations and states of the ribosome-translocon complex. Employing advanced techniques such as cryoEM structural determination and AlphaFold modeling, the study delves into the dynamic nature of the ribosome-translocon complex. The findings from these analyses unveil crucial insights, significantly advancing our understanding of the co-translational translocation process in cellular mechanisms.</p>
<p>To begin with, the authors employed a construct comprising the first two transmembrane domains of rhodopsin as a model for studying protein translocation. They conducted in vitro translation, followed by the purification of the ribosome-translocon complex, and determined its cryoEM structures. An in-depth analysis of their ribosome-translocon complex structure revealed that the nascent chain can pass through the lateral gate of translocon Sec61, akin to the behavior of a Signaling Peptide. Additionally, Sec61 was found to interact with 28S rRNA helix 24 and the ribosomal protein uL24. In summary, their structural model aligns with the through-pore model of insertion, contradicting the sliding model.</p>
<p>Secondly, the authors successfully identified RAMP4 in their ribosome-translocon complex structure. Notably, the transmembrane domain of RAMP4 mimics the binding of a Signaling Peptide at the lateral gate of Sec61, albeit without unplugging. Intriguingly, RAMP4 is exclusively present in the non-multipass translocon ribosome-translocon complex, not in those containing multipass translocon. This observation suggests that co-translational translocation specifically occurs in the Sec61 channel that includes bound RAMP4. Additionally, the authors discovered an interaction between the C-tail of ribosomal proteins uL22 and the translocon Sec61, providing valuable insights into the nascent chain's behavior.</p>
<p>Moving on to the third point, the focused classification unveiled TRAP complex interactions with various components. The authors propose that the extra density observed in their novel ribosome-translocon complex can be attributed to calnexin, a major binder of TRAP according to previous studies. Furthermore, the new structure reveals a TRAP-OSTA interaction. This newly identified TRAP-OSTA interaction offers a potential explanation for why patients with TRAP delta defects exhibit congenital disorders of glycosylation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this paper presents a robust contribution to the field with its thorough structural and modeling analyses. The significance of the findings is evident, providing valuable insights into the intricate mechanisms of protein co-translational translocation. The well-crafted writing, meticulous analyses, and clear figures collectively contribute to the overall strength of the paper.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) The identification of RAMP4 is a pivotal discovery in this paper. The sophisticated AlphaFold prediction, de novo model building of RAMP4's RBD domain, and sequence analyses provide strong evidence supporting the inclusion of RAMP4 in the ribosome-translocon complex structure.</p>
<p>However, it is crucial to ensure the presence of RAMP4 in the purified sample. Particularly, a validation step such as western blotting for RAMP4 in the purified samples would strengthen the assertion that the ribosome-translocon complex indeed contains RAMP4. This is especially important given the purification steps involving stringent membrane solubilization and affinity column pull-down.</p>
<p>(2) Despite the comprehensive analyses conducted by the authors, it is challenging to accept the assertion that the extra density observed in TRAP class 1 corresponds to calnexin. The additional density in TRAP class 1 appears to be less well-resolved, and the evidence for assigning it as calnexin is insufficient. The extra density there can be any proteins that bind to TRAP. It is recommended that the authors examine the density on the ER lumen side. An investigation into whether calnexin's N-globular domain and P-domain are present in the ER lumen in TRAP class 1 would provide a clearer understanding.</p>
<p>(3) In the section titled 'TRAP competes and cooperates with different translocon subunits,' the authors present a compelling explanation for why TRAP delta defects can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation. To enhance this explanation, it would be valuable if the authors could provide additional analyses based on mutations mentioned in the references. Specifically, examining whether these mutations align with the TRAP delta-OSTA structure models would strengthen the link between TRAP delta defects and the observed congenital disorders of glycosylation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript 'Structural analysis of the dynamic ribosome-translocon complex' Lewis and Hegde present a structural study of the ribosome-bound multipass translocon (MPT) based on re-analysis of cryo-EM single particle data of ribosome-MPTs processing the multipass transmembrane substrate RhoTM2 from a previous publication (Smalinskaité et al, Nature 2022) and AlphaFold2 multimer modeling. Detailed analysis of the laterally open Sec61 is obtained from PAT-less particles.</p>
<p>The following major claims are made:</p>
<p>- TMs can bind similarly to the Sec61 lateral gate as signal peptides.</p>
<p>- Ribosomal H59 is in immediate proximity to basic residues of TMs and signal peptides, suggesting it may contribute to the positive-inside rule.</p>
<p>- RAMP4/SERP1 binds to the Sec61 lateral gate and the ribosome near 28S rRNA's helices 47, 57, and 59 as well as eL19, eL22, and eL31.</p>
<p>- uL22 C-terminal tail binds H24/47 blocking a potential escape route for nascent peptides to the cytosol.</p>
<p>- TRAP and BOS compete for binding to Sec61 hinge.</p>
<p>- Calnexin TM binds to TRAPg.</p>
<p>- NOMO wedges between TRAP and MPT.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript contains numerous novel new structural analyses and their potential functional implications. While all findings are exciting, the highlight is the discovery of RAMP4/SERP1 near the Sec61 lateral gate. Overall, the strength is the thorough and extensive structural analysis of the different high-resolution RTC classes as well as the expert bioinformatic evolutionary analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A minor downside of the manuscript is the sheer volume of analyses and mechanistic hypotheses, which makes it sometimes difficult to follow. The authors might consider offloading some analyses based on weaker evidence to the supplement to maximize impact.</p>

<p>Factual error in the eLife assessment to be corrected:</p>
<p>In the eLife assessment, &quot;ribosomal protein H59&quot; should be changed to &quot;helix 59 of the 28S ribosomal RNA&quot; to make this factually correct.</p>
<p>Provisional author response</p>
<p>We thank the reviewers for their thorough and thoughtful readings of the manuscript. Our responses to the four suggestions made in their public reviews are below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) The identification of RAMP4 is a pivotal discovery in this paper. The sophisticated AlphaFold prediction, de novo model building of RAMP4's RBD domain, and sequence analyses provide strong evidence supporting the inclusion of RAMP4 in the ribosome-translocon complex structure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>However, it is crucial to ensure the presence of RAMP4 in the purified sample. Particularly, a validation step such as western blotting for RAMP4 in the purified samples would strengthen the assertion that the ribosome-translocon complex indeed contains RAMP4. This is especially important given the purification steps involving stringent membrane solubilization and affinity column pull-down.</p>
<p>As suggested, we will revise the manuscript to include Western blots showing that RAMP4 is retained at secretory translocons (and not multipass translocons) after solubilisation, affinity purification, and recovery of ribosome-translocon complexes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Despite the comprehensive analyses conducted by the authors, it is challenging to accept the assertion that the extra density observed in TRAP class 1 corresponds to calnexin. The additional density in TRAP class 1 appears to be less well-resolved, and the evidence for assigning it as calnexin is insufficient. The extra density there can be any proteins that bind to TRAP. It is recommended that the authors examine the density on the ER lumen side. An investigation into whether calnexin's N-globular domain and P-domain are present in the ER lumen in TRAP class 1 would provide a clearer understanding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the Calnexin assignment is less confident than the other assignments in this manuscript, and that further support would be ideal. We have exhaustively searched our maps for any unexplained density connected with the putative Calnexin TMD, and have found none. This is consistent with Calnexin's lumenal domain being flexibly linked to its TMD, and thus would not be resolved in a ribosome-aligned reconstruction.</p>
<p>Our assignment of this TMD to Calnexin was based on existing biochemical data (referenced in the paper) favouring this as the best working hypothesis by far: Calnexin is TRAP’s only abundant co-purifying factor, and their interaction is sensitive to point mutations in the Calnexin TMD. Recognising that this is not conclusive, we will ensure that the text and figures consistently describe this assignment as provisional or putative.</p>

<p>(3) In the section titled 'TRAP competes and cooperates with different translocon subunits,' the authors present a compelling explanation for why TRAP delta defects can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation. To enhance this explanation, it would be valuable if the authors could provide additional analyses based on mutations mentioned in the references. Specifically, examining whether these mutations align with the TRAP delta-OSTA structure models would strengthen the link between TRAP delta defects and the observed congenital disorders of glycosylation.</p>

<p>We agree that mapping disease-causing point mutants to the TRAP delta structure could be potentially informative. Unfortunately, the referenced TRAP delta disease mutants act by simply impairing TRAP delta expression, and thus admit no such fine-grained analyses. However, sequence conservation is our next best guide to mutant function. We note in the text that the contact site charges on TRAP delta and RPN2 are conserved, and that the closest-juxtaposed interaction pair (K117 on TRAPδ and D386 on RPN2) is also the most conserved.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript contains numerous novel new structural analyses and their potential functional implications. While all findings are exciting, the highlight is the discovery of RAMP4/SERP1 near the Sec61 lateral gate. Overall, the strength is the thorough and extensive structural analysis of the different high-resolution RTC classes as well as the expert bioinformatic evolutionary analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A minor downside of the manuscript is the sheer volume of analyses and mechanistic hypotheses, which makes it sometimes difficult to follow. The authors might consider offloading some analyses based on weaker evidence to the supplement to maximize impact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the manuscript is long, and we will seek ways to streamline it in revision while avoiding the undesirable side effect of making important findings undiscoverable via literature searches (an unfortunate consequence of many supplemental data). Indeed, we chose eLife for its flexibility regarding article length and suitability for extended and detailed analyses.</p>
