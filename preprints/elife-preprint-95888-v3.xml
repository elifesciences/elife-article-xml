<title>Abstract</title><p>Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) proteins are a highly conserved ion channel family consisting of eight members (TMC1–TMC8) in mammals. TMC1/2 are components of the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells, and mutations of TMC1/2 cause deafness in humans and mice. However, the physiological roles of other TMC proteins remain largely unknown. Here, we show that <italic>Tmc7</italic> is specifically expressed in the testis and that it is required for acrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis. <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited abnormal sperm head, disorganized mitochondrial sheaths, and reduced number of elongating spermatids, similar to human oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia. We further demonstrate that TMC7 is colocalized with GM130 at the cis-Golgi region in round spermatids. TMC7 deficiency leads to aberrant Golgi morphology and impaired fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles to the developing acrosome. Moreover, upon loss of TMC7 intracellular ion homeostasis is impaired and ROS levels are increased, which in turn causes Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Taken together, these results suggest that TMC7 is required to maintain pH and ion homeostasis, which is needed for acrosome biogenesis. Our findings unveil a novel role for TMC7 in acrosome biogenesis during spermiogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spermiogenesis is the post-meiotic phase of male germ cell development during which the haploid spermatids differentiate into mature spermatozoa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Mouse spermiogenesis consists of 16 steps characterized by morphological changes in acrosome formation, nuclear condensation and elongation, flagellum formation, and cytoplasm removal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Acrosome biogenesis is one of the key events of spermiogenesis, and it begins with the initial stage of spermatid development. The acrosome is a specialized organelle with a cap-like structure covering the anterior part of the mature spermatozoon head and is indispensable for the fertilization process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Although acrosome biogenesis is thought to be derived from the Golgi complex in early spermatids, growing evidence suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomes are involved in acrosome biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Defects in acrosome biogenesis can result in subfertility or infertility.</p>
<p>Acrosome biogenesis is generally classified into four successive phases, namely the Golgi, cap, acrosome, and maturation phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> A number of ER and Golgi-associated proteins have been shown to be involved in acrosome biogenesis. Heat shock protein 90B1 (HSP90B1) is an ER molecular chaperone that has been shown to be a testis-specific protein, and HSP90B1 deficiency leads to a globozoospermia-syndrome like phenotype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> GM130 (Golgi matrix protein 130) localize on the cis surface of the Golgi apparatus, and loss of GM130 causes acrosome malformations and results in male infertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. GOPC (Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing) is a trans-Golgi-associated protein that plays a role in vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus. GOPC deficiency leads to vesicle transport failure, which in turn results in malformation of the acrosome and to infertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Other vesicle transport proteins including PICK1, ICA1l, and VPS13b are involved in proacrosomal vesicle trafficking during acrosome formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Recent evidence suggests that autophagy is involved in proacrosomal vesicle fusion and transport to form the acrosome, and disruption of ATG7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> or ATG5 causes aberrant acrosome formation and male infertility or subfertility. Despite these findings, further studies are needed to better understand the complexity of acrosome biogenesis.</p>
<p>Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) proteins are highly conserved ion channel-like proteins, with eight family members (TMC1–TMC8) identified in humans and mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. TMC proteins are predicted to have 6–10 transmembrane domains, and all protein members contain a conserved 120 amino acid TMC domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure shows that TMC1 assembles as dimers and that each monomer contains 10 transmembrane domains with four domains (S4–S7) that line the channel pore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Tmc1 and 2 are mechano-electrical transducer (MET) channels in cochlear hair cells, and mutations in <italic>Tmc1/2</italic> cause deafness in humans and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> by disrupting hair cell mechanoelectrical transduction, and <italic>Tmc</italic> gene therapy can restore auditory function and balance in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Germline mutations in <italic>Tmc6</italic> and <italic>Tmc8</italic> are associated with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, which leads to increased susceptibility to HPV infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Among the eight TMC protein members, TMC1 and TMC2 are well studied due to their role in hearing conduction, and understanding the physiological and functional roles of other TMC family members remains a major challenge.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that <italic>Tmc7</italic> begins to be expressed in diplotene spermatocytes and that it is expressed at high levels in round spermatids in mouse testes. By generating <italic>Tmc7</italic> conventional knockout mice (<italic>Tmc7<sup>−/−</sup></italic>), we demonstrate that TMC7 deficiency leads to aberrant Golgi morphology and impaired fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles to the acrosome, thus resulting in male infertility with an oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia (OAT) phenotype. Our findings provide new insights into the physiological role of TMC family members in spermiogenesis.</p>

<title><italic>Tmc7</italic> expression is confined to the testis, and deletion of <italic>Tmc7</italic> leads to male infertility</title>
<p>To explore the roles of <italic>Tmc</italic> family members during spermatogenesis, we analyzed the expression of <italic>Tmc1</italic>–<italic>Tmc8</italic> using the mouse developmental transcriptome (E-MTAB-6798)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Among the eight <italic>Tmc</italic> family members, we found that only <italic>Tmc5</italic> and <italic>Tmc7</italic> exhibited elevated expression in the testis during development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). <italic>Tmc7</italic> caught our great interest because <italic>Tmc7</italic> was expressed at higher levels than <italic>Tmc5</italic> in the testis during development. We next analyzed <italic>Tmc7</italic> expression in different tissues using single-cell transcriptomic data from the Mouse Cell Atlas database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We found that <italic>Tmc7</italic> was predominantly expressed in the testis when compared with all other analyzed tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Further, we analyzed <italic>Tmc7</italic> in different stages of germ cell development using single-cell sequencing data of male-specific tissues and organs in mice and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>Tmc7</italic> began to be expressed in diplotene spermatocytes and was expressed at high levels in round spermatids in mouse testes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c, d</xref>). The <italic>Tmc7</italic> expression pattern was confirmed by RT-PCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e, f</xref>), and <italic>Tmc7</italic> was again found to be highly expressed in round spermatids of human testis (Fig. S1a, b). The distinct expression pattern in the testis indicates the potential role of <italic>Tmc7</italic> in spermatogenesis.</p>

<p>We generated <italic>Tmc7</italic>-deficient mice (<italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) by partial deletion of exon 2 (the first 241 bp) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). <italic>Tmc7<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were confirmed by PCR-based genotyping and immunoblotting of the separated cytoplasmic and membrane testis proteins (Fig. S1c, d). We then examined the phenotypes and found that <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were viable and had a normal appearance and exhibited a normal metabolic rate (Fig. S1e-j). However, <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> male mice showed smaller testes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h, i</xref>) and a reduced testis/body weight ratio (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>) compared to control mice. Moreover, <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> male mice exhibited complete infertility (Table S1). No difference in the number of tubules per testicle or in the number of Sertoli cells was seen when comparing <italic>Tmc7<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and WT mice; Sertoli cell were identified by immunofluorescence staining of the Sertoli cell marker SOX9 (Fig. S1k, i). These findings suggest that TMC7 is essential for spermatogenesis and thus for male fertility.</p>

<title>TMC7 deficiency leads to severe defects in spermiogenesis</title>
<p>To determine the cause of infertility in <italic>Tmc7<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, we examined the composition of cell types in seminiferous tubules and cauda epididymis sections using hematoxylin staining in mouse testes at different developmental stages. In seminiferous tubules, the populations of germ cells were comparable between wild type (WT) and <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice at postnatal day (PD)14 and PD21. Intriguingly, the number of elongating spermatids in <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice decreased significantly compared with WT mice at PD28 (Fig. S2a). We next examined the testis and cauda epididymis sections of 9-week-old WT and <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. We observed spermiogenesis defects in <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice as evidenced by the reduced number of elongating spermatids, the increased number of sloughed germ cells, and large vacuoles in the seminiferous tubules and cauda epididymis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). The vacuolation became more serious with increasing age (Fig. S2a). The total number of sperm in the cauda epididymis was drastically decreased in <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (∼0.15 × 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> cells) compared to wild type (WT) mice (∼8.0 × 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> cells) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). The morphological assessment of spermatozoa from the caudal epididymis revealed that a large proportion of spermatozoa (∼70%) in <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited abnormal head morphology, similar to human OAT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, e</xref>). In parallel with this, periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining indicated that a large number of spermatids failed to differentiate into elongated spermatids with sickle-shaped heads and instead exhibited abnormal head morphology. The total number of spermatids began to significantly decrease at steps 9–12 of spermiogenesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f, g</xref>), and we performed Mito-tracker staining and found shortened or disorganized mitochondrial sheaths in <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> spermatozoa collected from the cauda epididymis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>).

<title>Acrosome biogenesis is impaired starting from the Golgi phase in <italic>Tmc7<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatids</title>
<p>Acrosome biogenesis is one of the key events of spermiogenesis. To investigate whether TMC7 is required for the proper formation of the acrosome, FITC-labelled peanut agglutinin (PNA) was used to assess the acrosomal status of spermatids in 9-week-old WT and <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. The spermatids of WT mice had normal structures in the Golgi, cap, acrosome, and maturation phases, while spermatids in <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited abnormal acrosome morphology as early as the Golgi phase. Fragmented and malformed acrosomes were observed in all four phases of spermatids in the <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Absent or fragmented acrosomes were also found in <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> spermatids collected from the cauda epididymis (Fig. S4a). To better understand the morphologic defects of the acrosome in greater detail, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to analyze the acrosome structure in WT and <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. We found that large vesicles accumulated adjacent to developing acrosomes in all phases of acrosome biogenesis, starting from the Golgi phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, left panel) in the spermatids of <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Additionally, abnormal acrosome structures and defective nuclear condensation were observed in <italic>Tmc7<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, right panels). Further investigation revealed that knockout of <italic>Tmc7</italic> resulted in Golgi apparatus fragmentation and disorganization, as determined by TEM and immunofluorescence staining of the Golgi marker GM130 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b-c</xref>). The aspect ratio (height over width) of the Golgi apparatuses in <italic>Tmc7<sup>−/−</sup></italic>spermatids (R = ∼2.9) based on TEM images were also significantly smaller than in WT spermatids (R = ∼4.9) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Meanwhile, we found that the Golgi body failed to correctly orient toward the acrosome (Fig. S4b). We further performed immunoblotting to measure Golgi stress markers, HSP47 and TFE3 in 3 and 9-week-old <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> testes compared with WT testes. The results showed that the protein levels of HSP47 and TFE3 were significantly increased upon loss of TMC7, indicating the occurrence of Golgi stress (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, Fig. S4c). GOPC is localized in the trans-Golgi network and is involved in the transport and fusion of the proacrosomal vesicles with the acrosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. By immunostaining for GOPC and PNA, we found that GOPC staining (red) was colocalized with PNA (green) in WT spermatids. In contrast, colocalized GOPC and PNA spermatids were significantly decreased in <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). Together these findings suggest that TMC7 is required for proacrosomal vesicle trafficking and fusion during acrosome biogenesis.</p>

<p>To further delineate the role of TMC7 in acrosome formation, we next sought to determine the subcellular localization of TMC7 in the testis.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Among the eight TMC protein members, TMC1 and TMC2 are localized to the site of MET channels at the tips of the shorter stereocilia of cochlear hair cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. However, TMC1 and TMC2 expressed in heterologous cell lines remain in the ER and fail to localize to the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. TMC4 is a voltage-dependent chloride channel that is predominantly expressed in the taste buds in the posterior region of the tongue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. TMC6 and TMC8 are localized to the ER and play crucial roles in zinc transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, the physiological function of TMC7 has not been defined. In this study, we demonstrated that <italic>Tmc7</italic> was predominantly expressed in testes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>), and by generating knockout mice lacking TMC7 we found that TMC7 deficiency resulted in complete male infertility with an OAT-like phenotype. <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed various defects, such as abnormal sperm head, disorganized mitochondrial sheaths, and reduced number of elongating spermatids. Interestingly, we found that TMC7 co-localized with GM130, but not with TGN46 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c</xref>), as illustrated by the immunofluorescence co-staining assay, indicating that TMC7 located on the cis side of the Golgi apparatus.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate the critical role of TMC7 during the formation of the acrosome. The acrosome is thought to be derived from the Golgi apparatus, so we speculated that TMC7 deficiency might cause defects in acrosome formation because TMC7 localized on the Golgi apparatus. We observed fragmented and malformed acrosomes and proacrosomal vesicles were found to accumulate around the acrosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Similarly, TMC1 deficiency leads to membrane blebbing and PS externalization at the apical region of hair cells. TMC1 is not only an ion channel but also a lipid scramblase, which is required to maintain homeostasis in hair cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. TMC7 has similar amino acid sequence and predicted structure with TMC1/2 (Fig. S7a, b), suggesting TMC7 might function as a lipid scramblase and an ion channel. Further investigations are required to verify the potential functions of TMC7 as a lipid scramblase and an ion channel in spermatid.</p>
<p>In accordance with our findings, other proteins that localize on the Golgi apparatus have also been reported to be involved in acrosome biogenesis. GM130 deficiency results in acrosome biogenesis failure and male infertility because proacrosomal vesicles are unable to fuse to form acrosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Our findings showed that TMC7 was co-localized with GM130 and that TMC7 depletion significantly reduced the protein level of GM130. GOPC deficiency leads to defective fusion of Golgi-derived transport vesicles to the acrosomal cap and to a complete lack of acrosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Colocalized GOPC and PNA spermatids were significantly decreased in <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> spermatids compared to WT spermatids. Further, GOLGA3, PICK1, and several other Golgi proteins are also required for acrosome biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Our work, combined with previous studies, broadens our understanding of role the Golgi apparatus plays in the formation of acrosomes.</p>
<p>Our findings highlight the role of TMC7 in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Upon TMC7 depletion, the Golgi apparatus undergoes significant disorganization and is unable to correctly orient toward the acrosome. The mechanism behind this is that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations decreased while the pH value was increased in <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> germ cells compared to WT germ cells, suggesting that TMC7 is essential for maintaining the intracellular pH and ion homeostasis. Our findings further revealed that TMC7 deficiency led to increased ROS levels, Golgi and ER stress, ultimately resulting in apoptosis of spermatids. The Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE8 is involved in the maintenance of intracellular pH and ion homeostasis, and NHE8 deficiency leads to Golgi-derived vesicles failing to form large acrosomal granules and the acrosomal cap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. SLC9A3 is another Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger, and it is expressed in the acrosomal region of spermatids and loss of SLC9A3 causes severe acrosomal defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. These studies, together with our current findings, support the hypothesis that TMC7 is essential for maintaining the intracellular pH and ion homeostasis, which is needed for the proper progression of acrosome biogenesis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings show that TMC7 localizes to the cis-Golgi region in spermatids and that this is essential for acrosome biogenesis and for male fertility. In the absence of TMC7, intracellular pH and ion homeostasis is disrupted, and this leads to Golgi disorganization and failure to correctly orientate to the acrosome. Subsequently, Golgi-derived proacrosomal vesicles are unable to fuse with the developing acrosome and acrosome biogenesis is severely impaired, and thus TMC7-deficent male mice are completely infertile. Our study highlights the physiological role of TMC family members in spermatogenesis.</p>

Primary antibodies included anti-TMC7 (1:200 dilution, Abcam, ab191521), anti-SOX9 (1:500 dilution, Sigma, AB5535), anti-GOPC (1:200 dilution, Proteintech, 12163-1-AP), anti-SYCP3 (1:500 dilution, Santa Cruz, sc-33195), anti-H2AX (1:500 dilution, Millipore, 05-636-1), anti-GM130 (1:100 dilution, 610822, BD Biosciences), anti-P115 (1:200 dilution, Proteintech, 13509-1-AP), and anti-GRASP65 (1:200 dilution, Proteintech, 10747-2-AP). The next day they were incubated with the secondary antibody (1:500 dilution, Thermo, A-11070 and A-11012) for 1 h at room temperature. The Alexa Fluor 488 conjugates of lectin PNA (1:500 dilution, Thermo, L21409), anti-GM130 (1:200 dilution, Proteintech, CL488-11308), and anti-TGN46 (1:200 dilution, Proteintech, CL488-13573) were used as secondary antibodies. For the staining of Mito-track (1:5000 dilution, Beyotime, C1048), the sperm released from the caudal epididymis were directly stained for 30 min at 37 °C. The sperm were then spread on the slide and observed.</p>
<p>A TUNEL assay was performed using a one-step TUNEL Apoptosis Assay Kit (KeyGEN BioTECH, KGA7072) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the slide was deparaffinized and antigen retrieval was performed. dUTP was used to label the cells, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI (Abcam, ab285390). Fluorescent images were captured on a Dragonfly 200 confocal microscopy system (Andor Technology).</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>The membrane and cytoplasmic proteins of the testis were obtained using a membrane protein extraction kit (Abmart, A1008) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total protein in the testis was obtained by grinding in a tissue grinder in RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, P0013B), and the concentration of protein was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, P0009). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in 5 % non-fat milk and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies included anti-TMC7 (Dia-an Biotech), anti-ATP1A1 (Proteintech, 14418-1-AP), anti-GAPDH (Proteintech, 60004-1-1g), anti-Cleaved-CASPASE3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9661), anti-CASPASE3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9662), anti-BAX (Cell Signaling Technology, 41162), anti-BCL2 (Cell Signaling Technology, 17447), anti-α-TUBULIN (Proteintech,11224-1-AP), anti-P-EIF2α (ABclonal, AP0745), anti-EIF2α (ABclonal, A0764), anti-GRP78 (Proteintech, 11587-1-AP), anti-CHOP (Proteintech, 15204-1-AP), anti-P115 (Proteintech, 13509-1-AP), and anti-GRASP65 (Proteintech, 10747-2-AP). All antibodies were diluted 1:1000. The next day, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour, and the protein was detected using an ECL system (Vazyme, E412-02). The quantitation was performed in Image J. Additional replicates of the western blots have been included in revised Fig. S8.</p>

<p>This study reports an <bold>important</bold> discovery highlighting the essential role of the putative ion channel, TMC7, in acrosome formation during sperm development and thus male fertility. The evidence for the requirement of TMC7 in acrosome biogenesis and sperm function is <bold>convincing</bold>, although its function as an ion channel remains to be further determined. Overall, this work will be of great interest to developmental biologists and ion channel physiologists alike.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>TMC7 knockout mice were generated by the authors and the phenotype was analyzed. They found that Tmc7 is localized to Golgi and is needed for acrosome biogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The phenotype of infertility is clear, and the results of TMC7 localization and the failed acrosome formation are highly reliable. In this respect, they made a significant discovery regarding spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>In the original version, I pointed out the gap between their pH/calcium imaging data and the hypothesis of ion channel function of TMC7 in the Golgi. Now the author agrees and has changed the description to be reasonable. Additional experiments were also performed, and I can say that they have answered my concern adequately.</p>
<p>I would say it is good to add any presumed mechanism for the observed changes in pH and calcium concentration in the cytoplasm this time.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents a significant finding that enhances our understanding of spermatogenesis. TMC7 belongs to a family of transmembrane channel-like proteins (TMC1-8), primarily known for their role in the ear. Mutations to TMC1/2 are linked to deafness in humans and mice and were originally characterized as auditory mechanosensitive ion channels. However, the function of the other TMC family members remains poorly characterized. In this study, the authors begin to elucidate the function of TMC7 in acrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis. Through analysis of transcriptomics datasets, they elevated levels of TMC7 in round spermatids in both mouse and human testis. They then generate Tmc7-/- mice and find that male mice exhibit smaller testes and complete infertility. Examination of different developmental stages reveals spermatogenesis defects, including with reduced sperm count, elongated spermatids and large vacuoles. Additionally, abnormal acrosome morphology are observed beginning at the early-stage Golgi phase, indicating TMC7's involvement in proacrosomal vesicle trafficking and fusion. They observed localization of TMC7 in the cis-Golgi and suggest that its presence is required for maintaining Golgi integrity, with Tmc7-/- leading to reduced intracellular Ca2+, elevated pH and increased ROS levels, likely resulting in spermatid apoptosis. Overall, the work delineates a new function of TMC7 in spermatogenesis and the authors propose that its ion channel and/or scramblase activity is likely important for Golgi homeostasis. This work is of significant interest to the community and is of high quality.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The biggest strength of the paper is the phenotypic characterization of the TMC7-/- mouse model, which has clear acrosome biogenesis/spermatogenesis defects. This is the main claim of the paper and it is supported with the data that are presented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It isn't clear whether TMC7 functions as an ion channel from the current data presented in this paper, but the authors are careful in their interpretation and present this merely as a hypothesis supporting this idea.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Wang et al. have demonstrated that TMC7, a testis-enriched multipass transmembrane protein, is essential for male reproduction in mice. Tmc7 KO male mice are sterile due to reduced sperm count and abnormal sperm morphology. TMC7 co-localizes with GM130, a cis-Golgi marker, in round spermatids. The absence of TMC7 results in reduced levels of Golgi proteins, elevated abundance of ER stress markers, as well as changes of Ca2+ and pH levels in the KO testis. However, further confirmation is required because the analyses were performed with whole testis samples in spite of the differences in the germ cell composition in WT and KO testis. In addition, the causal relationships between the reported anomalies await thorough interrogation</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>By using PD21 testes, the revised assays have consolidated that depletion of TMC7 leads to a reduced level of Ca2+ and an elevated level of ROS in the male germ cells. The immunohistochemistry analyses have clearly indicated the reduced abundance of GM130, P115, and GRASP65 in the knockout testis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Future studies are required to decipher how TMC7 stabilizes Golgi structure, coordinates vesicle transport, and maintains the germ cell homeostasis.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>TMC7 knockout mice were generated by the authors and the phenotype was analyzed. They found that Tmc7 is localized to Golgi and is needed for acrosome biogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The phenotype of infertility is clear, and the results of TMC7 localization and the failed acrosome formation are highly reliable. In this respect, they made a significant discovery regarding spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>In the original version, I pointed out the gap between their pH/calcium imaging data and the hypothesis of ion channel function of TMC7 in the Golgi. Now the author agrees and has changed the description to be reasonable. Additional experiments were also performed, and I can say that they have answered my concern adequately.</p>
<p>I would say it is good to add any presumed mechanism for the observed changes in pH and calcium concentration in the cytoplasm this time.</p>

<p>We appreciate your positive comments on our revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents a significant finding that enhances our understanding of spermatogenesis. TMC7 belongs to a family of transmembrane channel-like proteins (TMC1-8), primarily known for their role in the ear. Mutations to TMC1/2 are linked to deafness in humans and mice and were originally characterized as auditory mechanosensitive ion channels. However, the function of the other TMC family members remains poorly characterized. In this study, the authors begin to elucidate the function of TMC7 in acrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis. Through analysis of transcriptomics datasets, they identify TMC7 as a transmembrane channel-like protein with elevated transcript levels in round spermatids in both mouse and human testis. They then generate Tmc7-/- mice and find that male mice exhibit smaller testes and complete infertility. Examination of different developmental stages reveals spermatogenesis defects, including reduced sperm count, elongated spermatids, and large vacuoles. Additionally, abnormal acrosome morphology is observed beginning at the early-stage Golgi phase, indicating TMC7's involvement in proacrosomal vesicle trafficking and fusion. They observed localization of TMC7 in the cis-Golgi and suggest that its presence is required for maintaining Golgi integrity, with Tmc7-/- leading to reduced intracellular Ca2+, elevated pH, and increased ROS levels, likely resulting in spermatid apoptosis. Overall, the work delineates a new function of TMC7 in spermatogenesis and the authors suggest that its ion channel activity is likely important for Golgi homeostasis. This work is of significant interest to the community and is of high quality.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The biggest strength of the paper is the phenotypic characterization of the TMC7-/- mouse model, which has clear acrosome biogenesis/spermatogenesis defects. This is the main claim of the paper and it is supported by the data that are presented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The claim is that TMC7 functions as an ion channel. It is reasonable to assume this given what has been previously published on the more well-characterized TMCs (TMC1/2), but the data supporting this is preliminary here, and more needs to be done to solidify this hypothesis. The authors are careful in their interpretation and present this merely as a hypothesis supporting this idea.</p>

<p>The Discussion section contains sentences reiterating the Introduction and Results of this manuscript (e.g., Lines 79-85 and 231-236; Lines 175-179 and 259-263). Those read repetitive and can be removed.</p>
