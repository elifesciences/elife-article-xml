<title>Abstract</title><p>Neurogenesis occurs in the adult brain in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, an area that contains neurons which are vulnerable to insults and injury, such as severe seizures. Previous studies showed that increasing adult neurogenesis reduced neuronal damage after these seizures. Because the damage typically is followed by chronic life-long seizures (epilepsy), we asked if increasing adult neurogenesis would prevent epilepsy. Adult neurogenesis was selectively increased by deleting the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>Bax</italic> from Nestin-expressing progenitors. Tamoxifen was administered at 6 weeks of age to conditionally delete <italic>Bax</italic> in Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup><italic>Bax</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Six weeks after tamoxifen administration, severe seizures (status epilepticus; SE) were induced by injection of the convulsant pilocarpine. Mice with increased adult neurogenesis exhibited fewer chronic seizures. Postictal depression was reduced also. These results were primarily female mice, possibly because they were the more affected by <italic>Bax</italic> deletion than males, consistent with sex differences in <italic>Bax</italic> in development. The female mice with enhanced adult neurogenesis also showed less neuronal loss of hilar mossy cells and hilar somatostatin-expressing neurons than wild type females or males, which is notable because these two cell types are implicated in epileptogenesis. The results suggest that increasing adult neurogenesis in the normal adult brain can reduce experimental epilepsy, and the effect shows a striking sex difference. The results are surprising in light of past studies showing that suppressing adult-born neurons can also reduce chronic seizures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It has been shown that neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) during adult life of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Taupin 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Gage et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Altman 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Kempermann 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Kazanis 2013</xref>). It is important to note that this idea was challenged recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Paredes et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Sorrells et al. 2018</xref>) but afterwards more studies provided support for the original idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Boldrini et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Kempermann et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Tartt et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Moreno-Jimenez et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Tobin et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In the DG, adult-born neurons are born in the subgranular zone (SGZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Altman &amp; Das 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Kaplan &amp; Hinds 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Altman 2011</xref>). Upon maturation, newborn neurons migrate to the granule cell layer (GCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cameron et al. 1993</xref>), develop almost exclusively into GCs, and integrate into the DG circuitry like other GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Ramirez-Amaya et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Kempermann et al. 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior studies suggest that the immature adult-born GCs can inhibit the other GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ash et al. 2023</xref>) especially when they are up to 6 weeks-old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Drew et al. 2016</xref>). By inhibition of the GC population, adult-born GCs could support DG functions that require GCs to restrict action potential (AP) discharge, such as pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sahay et al. 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Sahay et al. 2011b</xref>). Indeed suppressing adult neurogenesis in mice appears to weaken pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Clelland et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Nakashiba et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Niibori et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Tronel et al. 2012</xref>) and increasing adult neurogenesis improves it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sahay et al. 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, inhibition of the GC population by young adult-born GCs could limit excessive excitation from glutamatergic input and protect the cells in the DG hilus and hippocampus that are vulnerable to excitotoxicity. Thus, strong excitation of GCs can cause excitotoxicity of these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Scharfman &amp; Schwartzkroin 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Sloviter 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Scharfman 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Sloviter et al. 2003</xref>). Indeed, increasing adult-born neurons protects hilar neurons, CA3 and CA1 from neuronal loss 3 days after pilocarpine-induced seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The seizures induced by kainic acid or pilocarpine are severe, continuous, and lasted several hours, a condition called status epilepticus (SE). The neuronal injury in hippocampus after SE has been suggested to be important because it is typically followed by chronic seizures (epilepsy) in rodents and humans, and therefore has been suggested to contribute to the development of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Falconer et al. 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Sloviter 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cavalheiro et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Herman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Mathern et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Dudek &amp; Staley 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Dingledine et al. 2014</xref>). Chronic seizures involve the temporal lobe, so the type of epilepsy is called temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In the current study we asked if increasing adult neurogenesis can protect from chronic seizures in an animal model of TLE. We used a very common method to induce a TLE-like syndrome, which involves injection of the muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine at a dose that elicits SE. Several weeks later, spontaneous intermittent seizures begin and continue for the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Scorza et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Botterill et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Levesque et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Whitebirch et al. 2022</xref>). Seizure frequency, duration, and severity were measured by continuous video-EEG with 4 electrodes to monitor the hippocampus and cortex bilaterally.</p>
<p>It is known that SE increases adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Parent &amp; Kron 2012</xref>). SE triggers a proliferation of progenitors immediately after SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Parent et al. 1997</xref>). Although many GCs that are born in the days after SE die in subsequent weeks by apoptosis, some survive. Young neurons that arise after SE and migrate into the GCL may suppress seizures by supporting inhibition of GCs because adult-born GCs in the normal brain inhibit GCs when they are young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Drew et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ash et al. 2023</xref>). In addition, after SE, the newborn GCs in the GCL can exhibit low excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Jakubs et al. 2006</xref>). However, some neurons born after SE mismigrate to ectopic locations such as the hilus, where they can contribute to recurrent excitatory circuits that promote seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Scharfman et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Parent &amp; Lowenstein 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Scharfman 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Scharfman &amp; Hen 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Parent &amp; Murphy 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Scharfman &amp; McCloskey 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Zhan et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Myers et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Cho et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Althaus et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Zhou et al. 2019</xref>). Since the hilar ectopic GCs are potential contributors to epileptogenesis, we also studied whether enhancing adult neurogenesis would alter the number of hilar ectopic GCs.</p>
<p>Mossy cells are a major subset of hilar neurons which are vulnerable to excitotoxicity after SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Scharfman 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Sloviter et al. 2003</xref>). During SE, mossy cells may contribute to the activity that ultimately leads to widespread neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Botterill et al., 2019</xref>). However, surviving mossy cells can be beneficial after SE because they inhibit spontaneous chronic seizures in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Bui et al. 2018</xref>). Another large subset of vulnerable hilar neurons co-express GABA and somatostatin (SOM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Sloviter 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">de Lanerolle et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Freund et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Sun et al. 2007</xref>) and correspond to so-called HIPP cells (neurons with <bold><italic><underline>hi</underline></italic></bold>lar cell bodies and axons that project to the terminal zone of the <bold><italic><underline>p</underline></italic></bold>erforant <bold><italic><underline>p</underline></italic></bold>ath; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Han et al. 1993</xref>)). HIPP cells are important because they normally inhibit GCs and therefore have the potential to prevent seizures. Therefore, we studied mossy cells and SOM cells in the current study.</p>
<p>The results showed that increasing adult neurogenesis protects mossy cells and hilar SOM cells and reduces chronic seizures. Remarkably, the preservation of hilar mossy cells and SOM cells, and the reduction in chronic seizures, was found in females only. The sex difference may have been due to a greater ability to increase adult neurogenesis in females than males, consistent with sex differences in <italic>Bax</italic>- and caspase-dependent cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Forger et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Siegel &amp; McCullough 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The results are surprising because prior studies that suppressed neurogenesis led to reduced chronic seizures. Therefore, taken together with the results presented here, both increasing and suppressing adult-born neurons appear to reduce chronic seizures. How could this be? Past studies suggested that suppressing adult-born neurons led to a reduction in chronic seizures because there were fewer ectopic granule cells. In the current study, increasing adult-born neurons may have reduced chronic seizures for another reason, possibly by increasing the neurons in the GCL that support GC inhibition. Other possibilities also exist and are discussed. Regardless, the present data suggest a novel and surprising series of findings which suggest that adult-neurogenesis can be targeted in multiple ways to reduce chronic seizures in epilepsy.</p>

<p>The first experiment addressed the effect of increasing adult neurogenesis on pilocarpine-induced SE in Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup><italic>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (called &quot;Cre+&quot;, below). To produce NestinCreER<sup>T2</sup><italic>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, hemizygous NestinCreER<sup>T2</sup> mice were bred with homozygous <italic>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. Littermates of Cre+ mice that lacked Cre (called &quot;Cre-&quot;, below) were also treated with tamoxifen and were controls.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A1</xref> shows the experimental timeline. Tamoxifen was injected s.c. once per day for 5 days to delete <italic>Bax</italic> from Nestin-expressing progenitors.

<p>The latency to the first seizure after pilocarpine injection was measured for all mice (with and without EEG electrodes; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) or just those that had EEG electrodes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).

<p>The total number of seizures was quantified until 2 hr after pilocarpine injection because at that time diazepam was administered to decrease the severity SE. The total number of seizures were similar in both genotypes (Cre-: 3.0 Â± 0.2 seizures; Cre+: 2.8 Â± 0.1 seizures; Studentâs t-test, t(54) = 0.9, p=0.377; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D2</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, when sexes were separated, Cre+ females had a shorter latency to the first seizure than all other groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D3</xref>). Thus, a two-way ANOVA with genotype (Cre- and Cre+) and sex (female and male) as main factors showed a main effect of sex (F(1, 51) = 4.3; p=0.043) with Cre+ females exhibiting a shorter latency compared to Cre+ males (Cre+ females, 34.3 Â± 3.4 min, n=15; Cre+ males, 57.9 Â± 5.6 min, n=13; Bonferroniâs test, p = 0.026) but not other groups (Cre-female, 46.7 Â± 9.3 min, n=12; Cre-males, 47.4 Â± 4.4 min, n=15; Bonferroniâs tests, all p &gt; 0.344; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D3</xref>). There was no effect of genotype (F(1,49) = 0.8; p=0.305) or sex (F(1,49) = 0.6; p = 0.436) on the total number of seizures by two-way ANOVA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D4</xref>).</p>
<p>When adult neurogenesis was suppressed by thymidine kinase activation in GFAP-expressing progenitors, the severity of the first seizure was worse, meaning it was often convulsive rather than non-convulsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Iyengar et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore we examined the severity of the first seizure. These analyses were conducted only with mice implanted with electrodes because only with the EEG can one determine if a seizure is non-convulsive. A non-convulsive seizure was defined as an EEG seizure without movement. When sexes were pooled, the proportion of mice with a non-convulsive first seizure was not different (Cre-: 18.2%, 2/11 mice; Cre+: 28.6%, 4/14 mice Chi-square test, p&gt;0.999; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E1</xref>). However, when sexes were separated, the first seizure was non-convulsive in 60% of Cre+ females (3/5 mice) whereas only 25% of Cre-females had a first seizure that was nonconvulsive (1/4 mice), 14% of Cre-males (1/7 mice), and 11% of Cre+ males (1/9 mice; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E3</xref>). Although the percentages suggest differences, i.e., Cre+ females were protected from an initial severe seizure, the differences were not significantly different (Fisherâs exact test, p = 0.166; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E3</xref>).</p>

<label>C.</label><title>Significant effects of increasing young adult-born neurons on SE duration</title>
<p>The duration of SE was shorter in Cre+ mice compared to Cre-mice (Cre-: 280.5 Â± 14.6 min, n=11; Cre+: 211.4 Â± 17.2 min, n=14; Studentâs t-test, t(23) = 0.30, p=0.007; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E2</xref>). When sexes were separated, effects of genotype were modest. A two-way ANOVA showed that the duration of SE was significantly affected by genotype (F(1,21) = 6.7; p=0.017) but not sex (F(1,21) = 5.0; p = 0.487). Cre+ males showed a trend for a shorter SE duration compared to Cre-males (Cre-males: 280.1 Â± 22.8 min, n=7; Cre+ males: 199.1 Â± 24.1 min, n=9; Bonferroniâs test, p = 0.078; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E4</xref>). Cre+ females had a mean SE duration that was shorter than Cre-females, but it was not a significant difference (Cre-females: 281.0 Â± 11.8 min, n=4; Cre+ females: 233.4 Â± 20.5 min, n=5; Bonferroniâs test, p = 0.485; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E4</xref>). More females would have been useful, but the incidence of SE in females was only 42.8% if they were implanted with EEG electrodes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). In contrast, the incidence of SE in the unimplanted females was 100%, a significant difference by Fisherâs exact test (p &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). In males the incidence of SE was also significantly different in implanted and unimplanted mice (implanted males, 70.4%; unimplanted males, 100%; Fisherâs exact test, p=0.016, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<p>We also investigated power during SE (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The baseline was measured, and then power was assessed for 5 hrs, at which time SE had ended. Power was assessed in 20 min consecutive bins. Females were used in this analysis (Cre-and Cre+). Two-way RMANOVA with genotype and time as main factors showed no effect of genotype for any frequency range: delta (1-4 Hz, F(1,7) = 1.5; p= 0.253); theta (4-8 Hz, F(1,7) = 1.5; p = 0.264); beta (8-30 Hz, F(1,7) = 1.2; p = 0.304); low gamma (80 Hz, F(1,7) = 2.3; p = 0.174); high gamma (80-100 Hz, F(1,7) = 0.2; p = 0.689). There was a significant effect of time for all bands (delta, p = 0.003; theta, p = 0.002, beta, low gamma and high gamma, p &lt; 0.001), which is consistent with the declining power in SE with time.</p>
<p>In summary, Cre+ mice did not show extensive differences in SE except for SE duration, which was shorter. The data are consistent with prior studies showing that reduced adult-born neurons worsens SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Iyengar et al. 2015</xref>).</p>

<p>Data were then segregated based on sex and a two-way ANOVA was conducted with genotype and sex as main factors. There was a main effect of genotype (F(1,32) = 4.2; p=0.047) and sex (F(1,32) = 12.5; p=0.001) on the total number of chronic seizures and a significant interaction between sex and genotype (F(1,32) = 8.5; p=0.006). Bonferroniâs post-hoc tests showed that Cre+ females had â¼half the chronic seizures of Cre-females (Cre-female: 44.6 Â± 10.2 seizures, n=7; Cre+ female: 22.6 Â± 2.0 seizures, n=9; p=0.004; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).

<label>B.</label><title>Additional analyses</title>
<p>While reviewing the data for each mouse plotted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C2</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D2</xref>, one point appeared spurious in the Cre-females, potentially influencing the comparison. The seizures in this mouse were more than 2x the standard deviation of the mean. Although not an outlier using the ROUT method (see Methods), we were curious if removing the data of this mouse would lead to a difference in the statistical results. There was still a main effect of sex (F(1,31) = 16.0; p&lt;0.001) with a significant interaction between sex and genotype (F(1,31) = 9.2; p = 0.005) and Cre+ female had significantly fewer seizures than Cre-female mice (Bonferroniâs test, p = 0.008). Cre+ female seizure frequency was also less than Cre-females (Bonferroniâs test, p = 0.008). These data suggest that spurious data point was not the reason for the results.</p>
<p>All mice were included in the analyses above, both those implanted and unimplanted during SE. Mice which were unimplanted prior to SE were implanted at approximately 2-3 weeks after pilocarpine to study chronic seizures. Because implantation affected the incidence of SE (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), we asked if chronic seizures were different in implanted and unimplanted mice. The total number of chronic seizures (F(1,17) = 1.3, p=0.265) and seizure frequency (F(1,17) = 1.3, p=0.276) were similar, suggesting that implantation did not influence the results (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>There were no significant differences in mortality associated with SE or chronic seizures. For quantification, we examined mortality during SE and the subsequent 3 days, 3 days until the end of the 3 week-long EEG recording period, or both <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). Graphs of mouse numbers (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>) or percentages of mice (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5C</xref>) were similar: groups (Cre-females, Cre+ females, Cre-males, Cre+ males) were not significantly different (Chi-Sq. test, p&gt;0.999).</p>

<sec id="s2b3">
<label>C.</label><title>Duration of chronic seizures</title>
<p>To evaluate the duration of individual seizures at the time mice were epileptic, two measurements were made. First, durations of each seizure of a given mouse were averaged, and then the averages for Cre-mice were compared to the averages for Cre+ mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E1</xref>). There was no difference in the genotypes (Cre-: 46.8 Â± 2.9 sec, n=17; Cre+: 43.4 Â± 2.5 sec, n=16; Studentâs t-test, t(31) = 0.9, p=0.379; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E1</xref>).</p>
<p>When separated by sex, a two-way ANOVA showed that female seizure durations were shorter than males (F(1,29) = 12.4; p = 0.001). However, this was a sex difference, not an effect of genotype (F(1,29) = 0.003; p = 0.856; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E2</xref>), with Cre-female seizure duration shorter than Cre-male seizure duration (Bonferroni post-hoc test, p = 0.015), and the same for Cre+ females compared to Cre+ males (Bonferroni post-hoc test, p = 0.037; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E2</xref>). One reason for the sex difference could be related to the greater incidence of postictal depression in females (see below), because that suggests spreading depolarizations truncated the seizures in females but not males.</p>
<p>The second method to compare seizure durations compared the duration of every seizure of every Cre- and Cre+ mouse. In the previous comparison (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E1</xref>), every mouse was a data point, whereas here every seizure was a data point (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F1</xref>). The data were similar between genotypes (Cre-: 41.9 Â± 0.9 sec; Cre+: 36.8 Â± 0.7 sec; Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, p=0.079; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F1</xref>). When sexes were separated, a Kruskal-Wallis test showed that Cre+ females had longer seizure durations than Cre-females (Dunnâs post-hoc test, Cre-female: 33.2 Â± 0.7 sec; Cre+ female: 39.3 Â± 0.6 sec, p&lt;0.001; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F2</xref>). Cre+ females may have had longer seizures because they were protected from spreading depolarizations that truncated seizures in Cre-females. Seizure durations were not significantly different in males (Cre-male: 51.4 Â± 1.7 sec; Cre+ male: 44.0 Â± 1.3 sec, p=0.298; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F2</xref>).</p>

<label>D.</label><title>Postictal depression</title>
<p>Postictal depression is a debilitating condition in humans where individuals suffer fatigue, confusion and cognitive impairment after a seizure. In the EEG, it is exhibited by a decrease in the EEG amplitude immediately after a seizure ends relative to baseline. In recent years the advent of DC amplifiers made it possible to show that postictal depression is often associated with spreading depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Ssentongo et al. 2017</xref>), a large depolarization shift that is accompanied by depolarization block. As action potentials are blocked there are large decreases in input resistance leading to cessation of synaptic responses. As ion pumps are activated to restore equilibrium, there is recovery and the EEG returns to normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Somjen 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Hartings et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Herreras &amp; Makarova 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Lu &amp; Scharfman 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that males had little evidence of postictal depression but it was common in females (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), a sex difference that is consistent with greater spreading depolarization in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Eikermann-Haerter et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bolay et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Kudo et al. 2023</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A1</xref>, a male showed a robust spontaneous seizure (selected from the 3 week-long recording period when mice are epileptic). However, the end of the seizure did not exhibit a decrease in the amplitude of the EEG relative to baseline. The EEG before and immediately after the seizure is expanded in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A2</xref> to show the EEG amplitude is similar. In contrast, the seizure from the female in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B1-2</xref> shows a large reduction in the EEG immediately after the seizure. For quantification, the mean peak-to-trough amplitude of the EEG 25-30 sec before the seizure was compared to the mean amplitude for the EEG during the maximal depression of the EEG after the seizure. If the depression was more than half, the animal was said to have had postictal depression.</p>

There also was no effect of genotype (F(1,32) = 2.8, p=0.100) or sex F(1,32) = 0.5, p=0.471) on seizure-free interval (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B4</xref>).</p>
<p>Clustering is commonly manifested by consecutive days with frequent seizures. Clusters of seizures can have a substantial impact on the quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Haut 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Jafarpour et al. 2019</xref>) so they are important. In humans, clusters are defined as at least 3 seizures within 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Goffin et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Jafarpour et al. 2019</xref>). Therefore, we defined clusters as &gt;1 consecutive day with â¥ 3 seizures/day (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The duration of clusters were similar between genotypes (Cre-: 3.8 Â± 0.7 days, n=19; Cre+: 3.0 Â± 0.3 days, n=18; Mann-Whitneyâs <italic>U</italic> test, p=0.723; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D1</xref>). Next, we calculated the number of days between clusters, which we call the intercluster interval. Genotypes were similar (Cre-: 7.2 Â± 0.8 days, n=13; Cre+: 9.2 Â± 0.8 days, n=9; Studentâs t-test, t(20) = 1.7, p=0.104; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D2</xref>).</p>
<p>Two-way ANOVA was then performed on the sex-separated data. For cluster duration, there was no effect of genotype (F(1,33) = 3.4, p=0.076) but there was a main effect of sex (F(1,33) = 7.6, p=0.009) and a significant interaction of genotype and sex (F(1,33) = 7.6, p=0.009). Cre+ females had fewer days with â¥3 seizures than Cre-females (Cre-females: 6.3 Â± 1.4 days; Cre+ females: 3.0 Â± 0.4 days; Bonferroniâs test, p=0.009; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D3</xref>). These data suggest Cre+ females were protected from the peak of a cluster, when seizures increase above 3/day.</p>
<p>There was no effect of genotype (F(1,17) = 2.7, p=0.117) or sex (F(1,17) = 2.7, p=0.117) on the intercluster interval (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D4</xref>). However, this result may have underestimated effects because Cre+ females often had such a long interval that it was not captured in the 3 week-long recording period. That led to fewer Cre+ females that were included in the measurement of intercluster interval. In 5 out of 9 (i.e., 55%) Cre+ females, there was only one cluster in 3 weeks, so intercluster interval was too long to capture. Of those mice where intercluster interval could be measured, Cre-females had an interval of 5.7 Â± 1.0 days (n=7) and Cre+ females had a 9.0 Â± 1.1 day interval (n=4). That difference was not significant.</p>
<p>In summary, Cre+ females had fewer seizures, fewer days with â¥3 seizures, reduced postictal depression, and appeared to have a long period between clusters of seizures.</p>

<sec id="s2c1">
<label>A.</label><title>Prior to SE</title>
<p>We first confirmed that prior to pilocarpine treatment, Cre+ mice had more young adult-born neurons compared to Cre-mice. To that end, we quantified the adult-born GCs associated with the GCL/SGZ in both Cre+ and Cre-mice. DCX was used as a marker because it is highly expressed in immature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Brown et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Couillard-Despres et al. 2005</xref>). The area of the GCL/SGZ that exhibited DCX-ir was calculated and expressed as a percent of the total area of the GCL/SGZ.</p>
<p>One-way ANOVA showed that Cre+ females had significant more DCX in the GCL/SGZ than Cre-females (Cre-female: 4.4 Â± 0.09%, n=4; Cre+ female: 5.8 Â± 0.1%, n=3; Bonferroniâs test, p=0.004; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6A1-2</xref>) and Cre-males (Cre-male: 4.6% Â± 0.3, n=3; Bonferroniâs test, p=0.014; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6A1-2</xref>). Prior studies using the same methods showed already that Cre+ males have more DCX compared to Cre-males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>). These data suggest that Cre+ mice had more young adult-born neurons than Cre-mice at the time of SE.</p>

<sec id="s2c2">
<label>B.</label><title>After SE</title>
<p>We also quantified DCX at the time when epilepsy had developed, after SE and chronic seizures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).

<p>To investigate a sex difference, a two-way ANOVA was conducted with genotype and sex as main factors. There was a significant effect of genotype (F(1,33) = 12.6, p=0.001) and sex (F(1,33) = 11.7, p=0.002), with Cre+ females having more DCX than Cre-females (Cre-female: 1.8 Â± 0.3, n=7; Cre+ female: 3.8 Â± 0.4, n=9; Bonferroniâs test, p=0.001; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D2</xref>). In contrast, DCX levels were similar between Cre+ and Cre-male mice (p=0.498, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D2</xref>). Therefore, elevated DCX persisted after SE and chronic seizures in Cre+ mice but the effect was limited to females.</p>
<p>Because Cre+ females had increased young-adult-born neurons relative to Cre-females, the results are consistent with the idea that female Cre+ mice had reduced chronic seizures because of enhanced neurogenesis. Along the same lines, the lack of a persistent increase in young adult-born neurons in Cre+ males might explain why the chronic seizures were similar in Cre+ and Cre-male mice.</p>

<sec id="s2c3">
<label>C.</label><title>Sex differences in DCX of Cre-mice</title>
<p>Interestingly, the DCX levels showed Cre-female and male mice were similar before SE (Cre-female: 4.4 Â± 0.09%, n=4; Cre-male: 4.6 Â± 0.3%, n=3; p&gt;0.999; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6A2</xref>). However, after SE and chronic seizures, Cre-females had significantly less DCX than Cre-male mice (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6B2</xref>).</p>
<p>One explanation is based on the work of Parent et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Parent et al. 1997</xref>) who was the first to show that pilocarpine-induced SE increases proliferation within days of SE, and many of the new cells die in the weeks. If one assumes that new cells die of programmed cell death after SE, then the female Cre-mice appear to have had more programmed cell death than Cre-males (modeled in <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6C</xref>). If true, the deletion of <italic>Bax</italic> in Cre+ females would increase survival more than Cre+ males. The ability of new neurons to resist apoptosis in Cre+ females may explain their persistent increase in adult-born neurons and their protection.</p>

<p>Based on the literature showing that reducing hilar ectopic GCs decreases chronic seizures after pilocarpine-induced SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Cho et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized that female Cre+ mice would have fewer hilar ectopic GCs than female Cre-mice.</p>

<title>V. Increased neurogenesis preserves mossy cells and hilar SOM interneurons but has little effect on parvalbumin interneurons</title>
<p>It has been suggested that epileptogenesis after a brain insult like SE is due to the hippocampal damage caused by the insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cavalheiro et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Herman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Mathern et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Dudek &amp; Staley 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Dingledine et al. 2014</xref>). Therefore, one of the reasons why increasing adult neurogenesis reduced chronic seizures could be that it reduced neuronal damage after SE. Indeed, that has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>). Here we examined the loss of vulnerable hilar mossy cells and SOM cells because they have been suggested to be critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Sloviter 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Cavazos &amp; Sutula 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cavazos et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Henshall &amp; Meldrum 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Huusko et al. 2015</xref>).

<p>The results showed that Cre+ mice had more GluR2/3-expressing hilar cells/section than Cre-mice (Cre-: 10.0 Â± 1.8 cells, n=10; Cre+: 17.0 Â± 2.0 cells, n=13; Studentâs t-test, t(21) = 2.4, p=0.022; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A1-3</xref>). We confirmed that the GluR2/3+ hilar cells were not double-labeled with Prox1, suggesting they corresponded to mossy cells, not hilar ectopic GCs (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8A</xref>). To investigate sex differences, a two-way ANOVA was conducted with genotype and sex as main factors. There was a significant effect of genotype (F(1,18) = 4.9, p=0.039) with Cre+ females having more GluR2/3 cells than Cre-females (Cre-female: 8.0 Â± 2.0 cells, n=6; Cre+ female: 19.1 Â± 2.7 cells, n=8; Bonferroniâs test, p=0.011; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A4</xref>). GluR2/3-ir hilar cells were similar in males (Cre-male: 13.0 Â± 3.0 cells, n=4; Cre+ male: 13.6 Â± 2.5 cells, n=5; Bonferroniâs test, p=0.915; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A4</xref>). These results in dorsal DG also were obtained in ventral DG (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8B-C</xref>). The data suggest that having more GluR2/3-ir mossy cells could be a mechanism that allowed Cre+ females to have reduced chronic seizures compared to Cre-females. Equal numbers of GluR2/3 mossy cells in Cre+ and Cre-males could relate to their lack of protection against chronic seizures.</p>
<p>Next, we measured SOM hilar cells in pooled data (females and males together). These results were analogous to the data for GluR2/3, showing that Cre+ mice had more hilar SOM cells than Cre-mice (Cre-: 2.1 Â± 0.5 cells, n=9; Cre+: 4.6 Â± 0.6 cells, n=11; Studentâs t-test, t(18) = 2.9, p=0.008; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B1-3</xref>). When sexes were separated, a two-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of genotype (F(1,16) = 5.1, p=0.038) and no effect of sex (F(1,18) = 0.9, p=0.346). However, Cre+ females had more SOM cells than Cre-females (Cre-female: 2.2 Â± 0.6 cells, n=6; Cre+ female: 5.1 Â± 0.6 cells, n=8; Bonferroniâs test, p=0.019; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B4</xref>), although only in dorsal DG (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B4</xref>) not ventral DG (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8C</xref>). Numbers of SOM cells were similar in males (Cre-male: 2.2 Â± 0.7 cells, n=3; Cre+ male: 3.3 Â± 1.8 cells, n=3; Bonferroniâs test, p=0.897; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B4</xref>) in both dorsal and ventral DG (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8B-C</xref>). Therefore, the ability to preserve more mossy cells and SOM hilar cells in Cre+ females could be a mechanism by which Cre+ females were protected from chronic seizures.</p>
<p>Parvalbumin-ir cells were not significantly different between genotypes (Studentâs test, t(19) = 1.7, p=0.095; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C1-3</xref>). A two-way ANOVA showed no effect of genotype (F(1,17) = 3.1, p=0.096) or sex (F(1,17) = 0.2, p=0.616) on the numbers of parvalbumin cells. The results were the same in dorsal and ventral DG (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8B-C</xref>). These data are consistent with the idea that loss of parvalbumin-expressing cells has not been considered to play a substantial in epileptogenesis in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Sloviter 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">1994</xref>). However, it should be noted that subsequent research has shown that the topic is complicated because parvalbumin expression may decline even if the cells do not die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Andre et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Sun et al. 2007</xref>) and data vary depending on the animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">van Vliet et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Huusko et al. 2015</xref>).</p>

<label>VI.</label><title>Increased adult neurogenesis decreased neuronal damage after SE</title>
<p>In our previous study of Cre+ and Cre-mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>), tamoxifen was administered at 6 weeks and SE was induced at 12 weeks (like the current study). We examined neuronal loss 3 days after SE, when neuronal loss in the hilus and area CA3 is robust. There is also some neuronal loss in CA1. We found less neuronal loss in Cre+ mice in these three areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>). In the current study we examined 10 days after SE because at this time delayed neuronal loss occurs, mainly in CA1 and the subiculum. The intent was to determine if Cre+ mice exhibited less neuronal loss or not.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A-C</xref>, there was less Fluorojade-C staining in Cre+ mice. We only studied females because the primary seizure-protective effect of Cre+ mice was in females. To quantify Fluorojade-C in CA1 and the subiculum, ROIs were drawn digitally around the pyramidal cell layers (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D1</xref>). The area of the ROI that showed Fluorojade C-positive cells was calculated as area fraction and expressed as %. For subiculum, Cre+ mice had a smaller area fraction than Cre-mice (Mann Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, p = 0.032) and there was a trend for the same effect in CA1 (Mann Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, p = 0.060; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D2</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study showed that conditional deletion of <italic>Bax</italic> from Nestin-expressing progenitors increased young adult-born neurons in the DG, and when pilocarpine was used to induce SE when these young neurons were no more than 6 weeks-old, the chronic seizures (epilepsy) were reduced in frequency by about 50%. This is very important to establish that increasing young adult-born neurons can protect against epilepsy.</p>
<p>Increasing young adult-born neurons has been shown to protect the hippocampus from SE-induced neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>) which is a major contributor to epileptogenesis. Therefore, by protecting against SE-induced neuronal loss the young adult-born neurons could have reduced the severity of epilepsy. Indeed, we showed that the Cre+ female mice that had reduced chronic seizures had preservation of hilar mossy cells and SOM cells, two populations that are lost in SE-induced epilepsy and considered to contribute to epileptogenesis.</p>
<p>There were major surprises in the current study. First, the results are unexpected because suppressing adult-born neurons was shown to reduce chronic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Cho et al., 2015</xref>). Here, increasing adult-born neurons did not have the opposite effect. It was also unanticipated that only females with <italic>Bax</italic> deletion showed a significant increase in young adult-born neurons and a significant reduction in chronic seizures. The larger effect of increasing adult neurogenesis in female mice may be attributable to sex differences in Bax (discussed below). The other remarkable finding relates to hilar ectopic GCs. These GCs have been suggested to promote epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Scharfman 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Jung et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Scharfman et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Parent &amp; Murphy 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Hester &amp; Danzer 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Cho et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Zhou et al. 2019</xref>), but hilar ectopic GCs increased in females with reduced seizures. While expected that increasing neurogenesis would increase hilar ectopic GCs, the association of more hilar ectopic GCs with fewer chronic seizures was unexpected. Possible explanations include the idea that hilar ectopic GCs do not promote seizures if the SE-induced neuronal loss is reduced.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Effects of increasing adult neurogenesis on SE</title>
<p>In past studies, suppressing adult neurogenesis made kainic acid-induced SE worse, and pilocarpine-induced SE was also worse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Iyengar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, SE was affected also. The duration of SE was reduced in Cre+ mice. In the Cre+ females, the first seizure after pilocarpine injection was often less severe, and power showed a tendency to be reduced during SE. Although not significant, SE might have been less severe in the Cre+ females, and this could have contributed to reduced neuronal loss and chronic seizures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Chronic seizures</title>
<p>It is remarkable that increasing adult neurogenesis for 6 weeks was sufficient to reduce seizures long-term. It is consistent with the idea that normally the young adult-born neurons inhibit other GCs, which supports pattern separation normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sahay et al. 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Sahay et al. 2011b</xref>) and the DG gate function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Hsu 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Drew et al. 2016</xref>). This gate has been suggested to be an inhibitory barrier to entry of seizures from cortex into hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Coulter &amp; Carlson 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Hsu 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Krook-Magnuson et al. 2015</xref>).That entry is deleterious because seizures that pass from entorhinal cortex to the GCs and then CA3 are likely to continue to CA1 and back to cortex, causing reverberatory (long-lasting, severe) seizures. The reason for the relatively ease of reverberation once past the DG gate is that the synapses between GCs and CA3, CA1 and cortex are excitatory. The GCs have especially powerful excitatory synapses on CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Henze et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Scharfman &amp; MacLusky 2014</xref>), although these are normally mitigated by GABAergic circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acsady et al. 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>These data are consistent with the demonstration that adult-born neurons protect against other pathological conditions such as Alzheimerâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Choi et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Choi &amp; Tanzi 2019</xref>). However, it is important to note that all effects are unlikely to be mediated only by the DG. The olfactory bulb and other areas also have adult-born neurons and they could contribute to epilepsy, especially those epilepsy syndromes with mechanisms that may be extrahippocampal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Clusters of seizures</title>
<p>There were fewer days with &gt; 3 seizures in Cre+ female mice which is another way that Cre+ females were protected from chronic seizures. These findings are valuable because clusters in humans have a significantly negative impact on health and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Haut 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Jafarpour et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The results may have underestimated the effects on clusters because we did not measure the interval between clusters in many Cre+ female mice. The reason is that the interval between clusters increased in some mice so they only had one cluster in 3 weeks. Thus intercluster interval appeared to lengthen in Cre+ females but animals with only one cluster had to be excluded. In the end, the results were not statistically significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>Sex differences</title>
<p>Females showed more of an effect of conditional <italic>Bax</italic> deletion than males. Insight into this sex difference came when the same assessments were made before SE and 6 weeks after SE. Before SE, there was no sex difference. Cre+ females had more adult-born neurons than Cre-females and Cre+ males had more than Cre-males. In addition, the levels of DCX were similar in Cre+ females and Cre+ males. Therefore, the degree neurogenesis increased was similar in females and males.</p>
<p>However, after SE and chronic seizures, there was a sex difference. Cre-females had less DCX than Cre-males, so they may have had less SE-induced proliferation than males. In support of that idea, cell birth is greater in males in developing hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Sisk et al. 2016</xref>). Given SE may rekindle developmental programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ben-Ari &amp; Holmes 2006</xref>), there may have been more proliferation after SE in males than females.</p>
<p>Another possibility is females and males had similar proliferation after SE but females had more programmed cell death of progenitors in the subsequent weeks. The latter is an attractive possibility because it would explain why Cre+ female mice had more adult-born neurons than Cre-female mice, but the same was not true for males. Indeed during development, females had more apoptotic profiles than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Forger et al. 2004</xref>). Sex differences in cell number were abolished by <italic>Bax</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Forger et al. 2004</xref>). In ischemia, females show caspase-dependent cell death whereas males exhibit a caspase-independent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Siegel &amp; McCullough 2011</xref>). This is the first report of a sex difference in the effects of <italic>Bax</italic> after SE.</p>

<sec id="s3e">
<title>Hilar ectopic GCs</title>
<p>In the normal brain, adult-born neurons in the DG are thought to arise mainly from the SGZ and migrate to the GCL. After SE, there is a surge in proliferation in the SGZ and neurons either migrate correctly to the GCL or aberrantly in the hilus.</p>
<p>These hilar ectopic GCs are thought to contribute to seizure generation in the epileptic brain because they are innervated by residual CA3 neurons, and project to GCs, making a major contribution to mossy fiber innervation of GCs in the inner molecular layer. When epileptiform activity occurs in CA3 in slices of epileptic rats, CA3 evokes discharges in hilar ectopic GCs that in turn excite GCs in the GCL. Consistent with the idea that hilar ectopic GCs promote seizures, the numbers of hilar ectopic GCs are correlated with chronic seizure frequency in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">McCloskey et al. 2006</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Hester &amp; Danzer 2013</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Zhou et al. 2019</xref>). Furthermore, suppressing hilar ectopic GC formation reduces chronic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Jung et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Cho et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Hosford et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, this is the first study to our knowledge showing that increased hilar ectopic GCs were found in mice that had reduced seizures. Therefore, suppressing neurogenesis reduced hilar ectopic GCs and decreased chronic seizures, but increasing hilar ectopic GCs reduced seizure burden as well, at least in females.</p>
<p>One potential explanation is that SE-induced damage was reduced in Cre+ females with high numbers of hilar ectopic GCs. Therefore, the circuitry of the DG would be very different compared to past studies of hilar ectopic GCs where neuronal loss was severe (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The presence of mossy cells is one way the circuitry would be different. MCs normally support the young adult-born GCs that migrate to the GCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Piatti &amp; Schinder 2018</xref>). Mossy cells provide an important activator of newborn GCs when they are young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Chancey et al. 2014</xref>). Therefore, mossy cells would strengthen the inhibition of GCs by young adult-born neurons. Mossy cells also innervate hilar ectopic GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Pierce et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another explanation is that experimental suppression of adult neurogenesis exerted its protection against chronic seizures by reducing <italic>hilar</italic> ectopic GCs, and increasing adult-born neurons improved chronic seizures by increasing adult-born neurons <italic>in the GCL</italic>. This explanation is based on past studies suggesting that neurons that migrate correctly to the GCL serve to inhibit GCs, whereas neurons that migrate to the hilus excite GCs (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3f">
<title>Additional considerations</title>
<p>Diazepam was administered earlier in females during SE than males, and this could have influenced the results. However, it is hard to argue that this influenced SE because diazepam did not have a large effect on the EEG during SE. Also, diazepam should have protected Cre+ and Cre-females similarly but only the Cre+ females were protected.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the past, suppressing adult neurogenesis before SE reduced hilar ectopic GCs and reduced chronic seizures. Here, we show the opposite did not occur. Increasing adult neurogenesis increased hilar ectopic GCs but chronic seizures were not increased - they were reduced. Therefore, other mechanisms must be invoked to help explain the results. We suggest that protection of the hilar neurons from SE-induced excitotoxicity led to persistence of the normal inhibitory functions of these neurons, protecting against long-term seizures. Additionally, because protection was in females but not males, and females had more DCX during chronic epilepsy, sex differences in <italic>Bax</italic> is likely to have played an important role.</p>
<p>Regardless of mechanisms, the results show that enhancing neurogenesis of young adult-born neurons prior to SE leads to reduced chronic seizures in female mice. The findings do not negate the previous reports that suppressing adult neurogenesis before SE can improve outcomes, but suggest instead that increasing <italic>normal</italic> adult-born neurons or reducing <italic>abnormal</italic> adult-born neurons are both strategies to treat epilepsy.</p>

<p>Animal care and use was approved by the Nathan Kline Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and met the regulations of the National Institute of Health and the New York State Department of Health. Mice were housed in standard mouse cages, with a 12 hr light/dark cycle and food (Laboratory rodent diet 5001; W.F. Fisher &amp; Sons) and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. During gestation and until weaning, mice were fed chow formulated for breeding (Formulab diet 5008; W.F. Fisher &amp; Sons).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<label>II.</label><title>Increasing adult neurogenesis</title>
<p>To enhance neurogenesis, a method was used that depends on deletion of <italic>Bax</italic>, the major regulator of programmed cell death in adult-born neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Sun et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sahay et al. 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ikrar et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adlaf et al. 2017</xref>). Enhancement of neurogenesis was induced by conditional deletion of <italic>Bax</italic> from Nestin-expressing progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sahay et al. 2011a</xref>). These mice were created by crossing mice that have <italic>loxP</italic> sites flanking the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>Bax</italic> (<italic>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) with a Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mouse line in which tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (CreER<sup>T2</sup>) is expressed under the control of the rat Nestin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sahay et al. 2011a</xref>). The Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup><italic>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mouse line was kindly provided by Drs. Amar Sahay and Rene Hen and used and described previously by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bermudez-Hernandez et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Starting at 6 weeks of age, mice were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with tamoxifen (dose 100 mg/kg, 1/day for 5 days; Cat# T5648, Sigma-Aldrich). Tamoxifen was administered from a stock solution (20 mg/ml in corn oil, containing 10% absolute alcohol; Cat# C8267, Sigma-Aldrich). Tamoxifen is light-sensitive so it was stored at 4Â°C in an aluminum foil-wrapped container for the duration of treatment (5 days).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<label>III.</label><title>Pilocarpine-induced SE</title>
<p>Six weeks after the last dose of tamoxifen injection, mice were injected with pilocarpine to induce SE. Methods were similar to those used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>). On the day of pilocarpine injection, there were 2 initial injections of pre-treatments and then one injection of pilocarpine. The first injection of pre-treatments was a solution of ethosuximide (150 mg/kg of 84 mg/ml in phosphate buffered saline, s.c.; Cat# E;7138, Sigma-Aldrich). Ethosuximide was used because the background strain, C57BL6/J, is susceptible to respiratory arrest during a severe seizure and ethosuximide decreases the susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Iyengar et al. 2015</xref>). The second injection of pre-treatments was a solution of scopolamine methyl nitrate (1 mg/kg of 0.2 mg/ml in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution, s.c.; Cat# 2250, Sigma-Aldrich) and terbutaline hemisulfate (1 mg/kg of 0.2 mg/ml in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution, s.c.; Cat# T2528, Sigma-Aldrich). Scopolamine is a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist and when injected as methyl nitrate it does not cross the blood brain barrier. Therefore, scopolamine decreased peripheral cholinergic side effects of pilocarpine without interfering with central actions of pilocarpine. Terbutaline was used to keep airways patent during severe seizures, minimizing mortality. Ethosuximide had to be administered separately because it precipitates when mixed with scopolamine and terbutaline.</p>
<p>Thirty min after the pre-treatments, pilocarpine hydrochloride was injected (260-280 mg/kg of 50 mg/ml in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution, s.c.; Cat# P6503; Sigma-Aldrich). Different doses were used because different batches of pilocarpine had different ability to elicit SE.</p>
<p>The severity of SE was decreased by administering the benzodiazepine diazepam (10 mg/kg of 5 mg/ml stock solution, s.c.; NDC# 0409-3213-12, Hospira, Inc.) 2 hr after pilocarpine injection. In females, diazepam was injected earlier, 40 minutes after the onset of first seizure, because in the first group of females in which diazepam was injected 2 hr after pilocarpine, there was severe brain damage. While sedated with diazepam, animals were injected with warm (31Â°C) lactated Ringerâs solution (s.c.; NDC# 07-893-1389, Aspen Veterinary Resources). At the end of the day, mice were injected with ethosuximide using the same dose as before pilocarpine. For the next 3 days, chow was provided that was moistened with water. The cage was placed on a heating blanket to maintain cage temperature at 31Â°C.</p>

Prior to surgery, the analgesic Buprenex (Buprenorphine hydrochloride; NDC# 1296-0757-5; Reckitt Benckheiser) was diluted in sterile saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution) to yield a 0.03 mg/ml stock solution and 0.2 mg/kg was injected s.c.

<label>B.</label><title>Implantation of EEG electrodes</title>
<p>Before electrode implantation, hair over the skull was shaved and then the scalp was cleaned with 70% ethanol. A midline incision was made to expose the skull with a sterile scalpel. To implant subdural screw electrodes (0.10â stainless steel screws, Cat# 8209, Pinnacle Technology), 6 holes were drilled over the exposed skull. The coordinates were: right occipital cortex (anterior-posterior or AP â3.5 mm from Bregma, medio-lateral or ML, 2.0 mm from the midline); left frontal cortex (Lt FC, AP â0.5 mm; ML â1.5 mm); left hippocampus (AP â2.5 mm; ML â2.0 mm) and right hippocampus (AP â2.5 mm; ML 2.0 mm). An additional screw was placed over the right olfactory bulb as ground (AP 2.3 mm; ML 1.8 mm) and another screw over the cerebellum at the midline as reference (relative to Lambda: AP â1.5 mm; ML â0.5 mm). Here, âgroundâ refers to the earth ground and âreferenceâ refers to the reference for all 4 screw electrode recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Moyer et al. 2017</xref>). An 8-pin connector (Cat# ED85100-ND, Digi-Key Corporation) was placed over the skull and secured with dental cement (Cat# 51459, Dental Cement Kit; Stoelting Co.).</p>
<p>After surgery, mice were injected with 50 ml/kg warm (31Â°C) lactated Ringerâs solution (s.c.; NDC# 09355000476, Aspen Veterinary Resources). Mice were housed a clean cage on a heating blanket for 24 hr. Moistened food pellets were placed at the base of the cage to encourage food intake. Afterwards mice were housed individually because group housing leads to disturbance of the implant by other mice in the cage.</p>

<p>Mice were allowed 3 weeks to recover from surgery. During this time, mice were housed in the room where video-EEG equipment are placed so that mice could acclimate to the recording environment. To record video-EEG, the pin connector on the head of the mouse was attached to a preamplifier (Cat# 8406, Pinnacle Technology) which was attached to a commutator (Cat# 8408, Mouse Swivel/Commutator, 4-channel, Pinnacle Technology) to allow freedom of movement. Signals were acquired at a 500 Hz sampling rate, and band-pass filtered at 1-100 Hz using Sirenia Acquisition software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pinnaclet.com">https://www.pinnaclet.com</ext-link>, RRID:SCR_016183). Video was captured with a high-intensity infrared LED camera (Cat# PE-605EH, Pecham) and was synchronized to the EEG record.</p>
<p>To monitor pilocarpine-induced SE, video-EEG was recorded for hour before ad 24 hr after pilocarpine injection. Approximately 5-6 weeks after pilocarpine-induced SE, video-EEG was recorded to measure spontaneous recurrent seizures. Video-EEG was recorded continuously for 3 weeks.</p>

<label>B.</label><title>Video-EEG analysis</title>
<p>EEG was analyzed offline with Sirenia Seizure Pro, V2.0.7 (Pinnacle Technology, RRID:SCR_016184).

Seizures were rated as convulsive if an electrographic seizure was accompanied by a behavioral convulsion (observed by video playback), defined as stages 3-5 using the Racine scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Racine 1972</xref>) where stage 3 is unilateral forelimb clonus, stage 4 is bilateral forelimb clonus with rearing, and stage 5 is bilateral forelimb clonus followed by rearing and falling. A seizure was defined as non-convulsive when there was electrographic evidence of a seizure but there were no stage 3-5 behavior.</p>
<p>SE was defined as continuous seizures for &gt;5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chen &amp; Wasterlain 2006</xref>) and EEG amplitude in all 4 channels &gt;3x the baseline mean. For mice without EEG, SE was defined by stage 3-5 seizures that did not stop with a resumption of normal behavior. Often stage 3-5 seizures heralded the onset of SE and then occurred intermittently for hours. In between convulsive behavior mice had twitching of their body, typically in a prone position. The definition to SE duration was described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>To access the severity of chronic seizures, frequency and duration of seizures were measured during the 3 weeks of EEG recording. Inter-cluster interval was defined as the maximum number of days between two clusters.</p>

After loss of a reflex to a tail pinch, and loss of a righting reflex, consistent with deep anesthesia, the heart cavity was opened, and a 25-gauge needle inserted into the heart, followed by perfusion with 10 ml saline (0.9% sodium chloride in double-distilled water (ddH<sub>2</sub>O) using a peristaltic pump (Minipuls 1; Gilson) followed by 30 ml of cold (4Â°C) 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Cat# 19210, Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4). The brains were removed immediately, hemisected, and post-fixed for at least 24 hr in 4% PFA at 4Â°C. After post-fixation, one hemisphere was cut in the coronal plane and the other in the horizontal plane (50 Î¼m-thick sections) using a vibratome (Cat# TPI-3000, Vibratome Co.).

First, free floating sections were washed in 0.1 M Tris buffer (TB, 3 Ã 5 min). Sections were then incubated in sodium citrate (Cat# S4641, Sigma-Aldrich) buffer (2.94 mg/ml in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, pH 6.0 adjusted with HCl) in a preheated water bath at 85Â°C for 30 min. Sections were washed with 0.1 M TB (3 Ã 5 min), blocked in 5% goat serum (Cat# S-1000, RRID:AB_2336615, Vector Laboratories) in 0.1 M TB with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Cat# X-100, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 hr. Next, sections were incubated overnight with primary antibody (1:1000 diluted in blocking serum, monoclonal anti-rabbit DCX; Cat#4604S, Cell Signaling Technology) on a shaker (Model# BDRAA115S, Stovall Life Science Inc.) at room temperature.</p>
<p>On the next day, sections were washed in 0.1 M TB (3 Ã 5 min), treated with 2.5% hydrogen peroxide (Cat# 216763, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min to block endogenous peroxide, and washed with 0.1 M TB (3 Ã 5 min). Next, sections were incubated in secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:500, Vector Laboratories) for 1 hr in 0.1 M TB, followed by washes with 0.1 M TB (3 Ã 5 min). Sections were then incubated in avidin-biotin complex (1:500 in 0.1 M Tris buffer; Cat# PK-6100, Vector) for 2 hr, washed in 0.1 M TB (1 Ã 5 min) and then in 0.175 M sodium acetate (14.36 mg/ml in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, pH 6.8, adjusted with glacial acetic acid, 2 Ã 5 min; Cat# S8750, Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were reacted in 0.5 mg/ml 3, 3â²-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Cat# D5905, Sigma-Aldrich) with 40 Âµg/ml ammonium chloride (Cat# A4514, Sigma-Aldrich), 3 Âµg/ml glucose oxidase (Cat# G2133, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mg/ml (D+)-glucose (Cat# G5767, Sigma-Aldrich) and 25 mg/ml ammonium nickel sulfate (Cat# A1827, Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.175 M sodium acetate. Sections were washed in 0.175 M sodium acetate (2 Ã 5 min) and 0.1 M TB (5 min), mounted on gelatin-coated slides (1% bovine gelatin; Cat# G9391, Sigma-Aldrich), and dried overnight at room temperature.</p>
<p>On the next day, sections were dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol, cleared in Xylene (Cat# 534-56, Sigma-Aldrich), and coverslipped with Permount (Cat# 17986-01, Electron Microscopy Sciences).

<label>2)</label><title>DCX Analysis</title>
<p>DCX was quantified by first defining a region of interest (ROI) that included the adult-born cells and the majority of their DCX-labeled dendrites: the SGZ, GCL, and inner molecular layer. The SGZ was defined as a region that extended from the GCL into the hilus for a width of 100 Âµm because this region included the vast majority of the DCX immunoreactivity. The inner molecular layer was defined as the 100 Î¼m immediately above the GCL. Next, a threshold was selected where DCX-immunoreactive (ir) cells were above, but the background was below threshold, as described in more detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>This measurement is referred to as area fraction in the Results and expressed as a percent. For a given animal, the area fraction was determined for 3 coronal sections in the dorsal hippocampus between AP â1.94 to â2.06 mm and 3-4 horizontal sections in the ventral hippocampus between DV 0.84 to 1.08 mm, with sections spaced 300 Î¼m apart. These area fractions were averaged so that a mean area fraction was defined for each animal. For these and other analyses described below, the investigator was blinded.</p>

To stain for Prox1, free-floating sections were washed in 0.1 M TB pH 7.4, 3Ã5 min). Sections were then incubated in 0.1 M TB with 0.25%Triton X-100 for 30 min followed by a 10 min-long wash in 0.1 M TB with 0.1%Triton X-100 (referred to as Tris A). Next, sections were treated with 1% hydrogen peroxide in Tris A for 5 min followed by a 5 min-long wash in Tris A. Sections were blocked in 10% normal horse serum (Cat# S-2000, RRID:AB_2336617, Vector) in Tris A for 1 hr followed by a 10 min-long wash in Tris A and then 0.1 M TB with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.005% bovine serum albumin (referred to as Tris B).

<p>Prox1 was quantified in the hilus, defined based on zone 4 of Amaral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Amaral 1978</xref>). The definition of Amaral was modified to exclude 20 Î¼m below the GCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Winawer et al. 2007</xref>). The GCL boundary was defined as the location where GCs stopped being contiguous. Practically that meant there was no GC with more than a cell body width of cell-free space around it. A cell body width was 10 Î¼m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Claiborne et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Amaral et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>CA3c was included in the ROI but hilar Prox1 cells have not been detected in the CA3c layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Scharfman et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Winawer et al. 2007</xref>).

<p>In ImageJ, a ROI was traced in the image taken at 20x magnification and then a threshold was selected where Prox1-immunoreactivity was above the background threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>). Then Prox1 cells were counted using the Analyzed particle plugin where a particle with an area â¥ 10 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> was counted. The following criteria were used to define a hilar Prox1-ir cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bermudez-Hernandez et al. 2017</xref>): (1) the hilar cell had sufficient Prox1-ir to reach a threshold equal to the average level of Prox1-ir of GCs in the adjacent GC layer, (2) All hilar Prox-ir cells were complete, i.e., not cut at the edge of the ROI. When hilar Prox1-ir cells were in clusters, although not many (typically 2â3 per 50 Î¼m section), cells were counted manually. For each animal 3 coronal sections in the dorsal hippocampus and 3-4 horizontal sections in the ventral hippocampus, with sections spaced 300 Î¼m apart were chosen.</p>

<p>Fluorojade-C (FJ) is a fluorescent dye that is the âgold standardâ to stain degenerating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Schmued &amp; Hopkins 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Schmued et al. 2005</xref>). First, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides (1% porcine gelatin in ddH2O; Cat# G1890, Sigma-Aldrich) and dried on a hot plate at 50â55Â°C for 1 hr. Then slides were placed in a staining rack and immersed in a 100% ethanol solution for 5 min, then in 70% ethanol for 2 min, followed by a 1 min wash in ddH2O.</p>
<p>Slides were then incubated in 0.06% potassium permanganate (Cat# P-279, Fisher Scientific) solution for 10 min on a shaker (described above) with gentle agitation, followed by washes in ddH2O (2 Ã 1 min). Slides were then incubated for 20 min in a 0.0002% solution of FJ in ddH2O with 0.1% acetic acid in the dark. The stock solution of FJ was 0.01% in ddH2O and was stored at 4Â°C for up to 3 months. To prepare a working solution, 6 ml of stock solution was added to 294 mL of 0.1% acetic acid (Cat# UN2789, Fisher Scientific) in ddH2O and used within 10 min of preparation. Slides were subsequently protected from direct light. They were washed in ddH2O (3 Ã 1 min) and dried overnight at room temperature. On the next day, slides were cleared in Xylene (2 Ã 3 min) and coverslipped with DPX mounting medium (Cat# 44581, Sigma-Aldrich).

<p>We measured the FJ in the cell layers of CA1 and CA3. Manual counting of FJ-positive (FJ+) cells was not possible in these cell layers because there could be so many FJ+ cells that were overlapping. Instead, FJ staining in cell layers was quantified by first outlining the cell layer as a ROI at 10Ã magnification in ImageJ as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>To outline the CA1 cell layer, the border with CA2 was defined as the point where the cell layer changed width, a sudden change that could be appreciated by the background in FJ-stained sections and confirmed by cresyl violet-stained sections. The border of CA1 and the subiculum was defined as the location where the normally compact CA1 cell layer suddenly dispersed. To outline CA3, the border with CA2 and CA3 was defined by the point where stratum lucidum of CA3 terminated. This location was distinct in its background in FJ-stained sections. The border of CA3 and the hilus was defined according to zone 4 of Amaral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Amaral 1978</xref>). This location was also possible to detect in FJ-stained sections because the background in the hilus was relatively dark compared to area CA3.</p>
<p>After defining ROIs, a threshold fluorescence level was selected so that all cells that had very bright immunofluorescence were above threshold but other cells that were similar in fluorescence to background staining were not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Iyengar et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>). ImageJ was then used to calculate the area within the ROI and this measurement is referred to as area fraction in the Results and expressed as a percent. For a given animal, the area fraction was determined for three coronal sections in the dorsal hippocampus between AP â1.94 and â2.06 mm and 3â4 horizontal sections in the ventral hippocampus between DV 0.84 and 1.08 mm, with sections spaced 300 Î¼m apart. These area fractions were averaged so that a mean area fraction was defined for each animal.</p>

<p>Data are presented as the mean Â± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/">https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/</ext-link>, RRID: SCR_002798). Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Robust regression and Outlier removal (ROUT) method was used to remove outliers with ROUT coefficient Q set at 1%. Parametric tests were used when data fit a normal distribution, determined by the DâAgostino and Pearson or Shapiro-Wilkâs normality tests, and there was homoscedasticity of variance (confirmed by a F-test). A Studentâs unpaired two-tailed t-test was used to assess differences between two groups. A Welchâs test was used instead of a Studentâs t-test when there was heteroscedasity of variance. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), two-way ANOVA, and three-way ANOVA were performed when there were multiple groups and were followed by Bonferroniâs multiple comparison post-hoc test (Bonferroniâs test). The main factors for two-way ANOVA were genotype and sex; region was added as another factor for three-way ANOVA. Interaction between factors is reported in the Results if it was significant. A Fisherâs exact test was used for comparing proportions of binary data (yes/no). Pearsonâs Correlation was used to assess the association between 2 variables.</p>
<p>For data that did not follow a normal distribution, typically some data had a 0 value. In these cases, non-parametric tests were selected. The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to compare two groups, and a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post-hoc Dunnâs test was used for multiple groups comparison.</p>

<list-item><p>Data are shown from <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> to compare mice after SE next to mice before SE (left, A2). Cre-female mice after SE had reduced DCX-ir compared to before SE (â¼2 after vs. â¼4% before). Cre-males did not show this reduction (â¼4% before and after SE). Therefore, there was an inherent difference in sexes in that Cre-females lost DCX-ir in chronic epilepsy but males did not. If loss of DCX-ir is reflects loss of immature GCs, Cre-females may have had more loss of young GCs after SE than males. If the death was due to a Bax-dependent process (apoptosis), the results could be explained by a greater effect of <italic>Bax</italic> deletion in the females than males.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A model is used to illustrate the suggested explanation for data in A2 and B2. Before SE, all Cre-mice had similar DCX-ir. Area fraction was â¼4% so 4 cells are shown for simplicity. Only young-adult born neurons are shown (blue circles, each reflecting 1%). After SE, there is proliferation of new cells so 6 cells are shown instead of 4. It is assumed that SE-induced proliferation is similar in females and males because the data reported to date have not suggested any sex difference to our knowledge. After chronic epilepsy, the data in B2 show that Cre-females had reduced DCX-ir (â¼2%) relative to Cre-males (â¼4%). This could be due to programmed cell death of some of the neurons that proliferated after SE, which has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Parent et al., 1997</xref>). Based on these assumptions, more cells died of apoptosis after SE in female Cre-females than Cre-males, a sex difference. Black is used to indicate the young-adult-born neurons that died. This greater sensitivity to apoptosis, a <italic>Bax</italic> dependent process, may explain why Cre+ females with <italic>Bax</italic> deletion showed more DCX-ir after SE than Cre-females, but males did not.</p></list-item>

Indeed hilar ectopic GCs do form such connections(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Scharfman et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Pierce et al. 2005</xref>). GCL GCs form dense synapses on hilar ectopic GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Pierce et al. 2005</xref>). These new excitatory feedback circuits could contribute to more seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Scharfman &amp; Hen 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Parent &amp; Murphy 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Scharfman &amp; McCloskey 2009</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In mice with suppressed adult neurogenesis, few immature cells are in the GCL.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>After SE, there are fewer hilar GCs. There is loss of hilar ectopic GCs according to studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Cho et al. (2015)</xref>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hypothesis: With few hilar ectopic GCs there are fewer recurrent excitatory circuits and therefore fewer seizures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In mice with deletion of <italic>Bax</italic> in Nestin-expressing progenitors, there are more immature GCs in the GCL, reflected by DCX. The data are from the present study.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>After SE, there are more hilar GCs, reflected by hilar Prox1. Hilar mossy and SOM cells are preserved based on hilar GluR2/3 and SOM immunofluorescence. There may be little seizure-promoting effect of hilar GCs in light of mossy and SOM cell preservation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hypothesis: There are fewer seizures because less hilar damage, there is less available space for axons to find new targets. This hypothesis is based in part on long-standing notions that axonal innervation is a competitive process, and on prior studies considered hilar cell loss a stimulus for GCL GCs to sprout new axon collaterals (mossy fiber sprouting) in animal models of epilepsy and TLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Isokawa et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Buckmaster 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Schmeiser et al. 2017</xref>).</p></list-item>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
As adult-born granule neurons have been shown to play diverse roles, both positive and negative, to modulate hippocampal circuitry and function in epilepsy, understanding the mechanisms by which altered neurogenesis contributes to seizures is important for future therapeutic strategies. The work by Jain et al. demonstrates that increasing adult neurogenesis before status epilepticus (SE) leads to a suppression of chronic seizures in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This work is potentially interesting because previous studies showed suppressing neurogenesis led to reduced chronic seizures.</p>
<p>To increase neurogenesis, the authors conditionally delete the pro-apoptotic gene Bax using a tamoxifen-inducible Nestin-CreERT2 which has been previously published to increase proliferation and survival of adult-born neurons by Sahay et al. After 6 weeks of tamoxifen injection, the authors subjected male and female mice to pilocarpine-induced SE. In the first study, at 2 hours after pilocarpine, the authors examine latency to the first seizure, severity and total number of acute seizures, and power during SE. In the second study in a separate group of mice, at 3 weeks after pilocarpine, the authors examine chronic seizure number and frequency, seizure duration, postictal depression, and seizure distribution/cluster seizures. Overall, the study concludes that increasing adult neurogenesis in the normal adult brain can reduce epilepsy in females specifically. However, important BrdU birthdating experiments in both male and female mice need to be included to support the conclusions made by the authors. Furthermore, speculative mechanisms lacking direct evidence reduce enthusiasm for the findings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. The study is sex-matched and reveals differences in response to increasing adult neurogenesis in chronic seizures between males and females.</p>
<p>2. The EEG recording parameters are stringent, and the analysis of chronic seizures is comprehensive. In two separate experiments, the electrodes were implanted to record EEG from the cortex as well as the hippocampus. The recording was done for 10 hours post pilocarpine to analyze acute seizures, and for 3 weeks continuous video EEG recording was done to analyze chronic seizures.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. Cells generated during acute seizures have different properties to cells generated in chronic seizures. In this study, the authors employ two bouts of neurogenesis stimuli (Bax deletion dependent and SE dependent), with two phases of epilepsy (acute and chronic). There are multiple confounding variables to effectively conclude that conditionally deleting Bax in Nestin-Cre+ cells leads to increased neurogenesis and hilar ectopic granule cells, thereby reducing chronic seizures.</p>
<p>2. Related to this is the degree of neurogenesis between Cre+ and Cre- mice and the nature of the sex differences. It is crucial to know the rate/fold change of increased neurogenesis before pilocarpine treatment and whether it is different between male and female mice.</p>
<p>3. The authors observe more hilar Prox1 cells in Cre+ mice compared to Cre- mice. The authors should confirm the source of the hilar Prox1+ cells.</p>
<p>4. The biggest weakness is the lack of mechanism. The authors postulate a hypothetical mechanism to reconcile how increasing and decreasing adult-born neurons in GCL and hilus and loss of hilar mossy and SOM cells would lead to opposite effects - more or fewer seizures. The authors suggest the reason could be due to rewiring or no rewiring of hilar ectopic GCs, respectively, but do not provide clear-cut evidence.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, Jain et al explore whether increasing adult neurogenesis is protective against status epilepticus (SE) and the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (chronic epilepsy) in a mouse pilocarpine model of TLE. The authors increase adult neurogenesis via conditional deletion of Bax, a pro-apoptotic gene, in Nestin-CreERT2Baxfl/fl mice. Cre- littermates are used as controls for comparisons. In addition to characterizing seizure phenotypes, the authors also compare the abundance of hilar ectopic granule cells, mossy cells, hilar SOM interneurons, and the degree of neuronal damage between mice with increased neurogenesis (Cre+) vs Cre- controls. The authors find less severe SE and a reduction in chronic seizures in female mice with pre-insult increased adult-born neurons. Immunolabeling experiments show these females also have preservation of hilar mossy cells and somatostatin interneurons, suggesting the pre-insult increase in adult neurogenesis is protective.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. The finding that female mice with increased neurogenesis at the time of pilocarpine exposure have fewer seizures despite having increased hilar ectopic granule cells is very interesting.</p>
<p>
2. The work builds nicely on the group's prior studies.</p>
<p>
3. Apparent sex differences are a potentially important finding.</p>
<p>
4, The immunohistochemistry data are compelling.</p>
<p>
5. Good controls for EEG electrode implantation effects.</p>
<p>
6. Nice analysis of most of the SE EEG data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. In addition to the Cre- littermate controls, a no Tamoxifen treatment group is necessary to control for both insertional effects and leaky expression of the Nestin-CreERT2 transgene.</p>
<p>2. The authors suggest sex differences; however, experimental procedures differed between male and female mice (as the authors note). Female mice received diazepam 40 minutes after the first pilocarpine-induced seizure onset, whereas male mice did not receive diazepam until 2 hours post-onset. The former would likely lessen the effects of SE on the female mice. Therefore, sex differences cannot be accurately assessed by comparing these two groups, and instead, should be compared between mice with matching diazepam time courses. Additionally, the authors state that female mice that received diazepam 2 hours post-onset had severe brain damage. This is concerning as it would suggest that SE is more severe in the female than in the male mice.</p>
<p>3. Some sample sizes are low, particularly when sex and genotypes are split (n=3-5), which could cause a type II statistical error.</p>
<p>4. Several figures show a datapoint in the sex and genotype-separated graphs that is missing from the corresponding male and female pooled graphs (Figs. 2C, 2D, 4B).</p>
<p>5. In Suppl Figs. 1B &amp; 1C, subsections 1c and 2c, the EEG trace recording is described as the end of SE; however, SE appears to still be ongoing in these traces in the form of periodic discharges in the EEG.</p>
<p>6. In Results section II.D and associated Fig.3, what the authors refer to as &quot;postictal EEG depression&quot; is more appropriately termed &quot;postictal EEG suppression&quot;. Also, postictal EEG suppression has established criteria to define it that should be used. The example traces in Fig. 3A and B should also be expanded to better show this potential phenomenon.</p>
<p>7. In Fig.5D, the area fraction of DCX in Cre+ female mice is comparable to that of Cre- and Cre+ male mice. Is it possible that there is a ceiling effect in DCX expression that may explain why male Cre+ mice do not have a significant increase compared to male Cre- mice?</p>
<p>8. In Suppl. Fig 6, the authors should include DCX immunolabeling quantification from conditional Cre+ male mice used in this study, rather than showing data from a previous publication.</p>
<p>9. In Fig 8, please also include Fluorojade-C staining and quantification for male mice.</p>
<p>10. Page 13: Please specify in the first paragraph of the discussion that findings were specific to female mice with pre-insult increases in adult-born neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>
11. In Fig. 1 and suppl. figure 1, please clarify whether traces are from male or female mice.</p>
<p>12. Please be consistent with indicating whether immunolabeling images are from female or male mice.</p>
