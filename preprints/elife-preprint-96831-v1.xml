<title>Abstract</title><p>Cilia defects lead to scoliosis in zebrafish, but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood and may diverge depending on the mutated gene. We dissected the mechanisms of scoliosis onset in a zebrafish mutant for the <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> gene encoding a ciliary transition zone protein. <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant fish developed scoliosis with near-total penetrance but asynchronous onset in juveniles. Taking advantage of this asynchrony, we found that curvature onset was preceded by brain ventricle dilations and concomitant to the perturbation of Reissner fiber polymerization and to the loss of multicilia tufts around the subcommissural organ. Rescue experiments showed that Rpgrip1l was exclusively required in <italic>foxj1a</italic>-expressing cells to prevent axis curvature. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies identified neuroinflammation associated with increased Annexin levels as a potential mechanism of scoliosis development in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> juveniles. Investigating the cell types associated with <italic>annexin2</italic> over-expression, we uncovered astrogliosis, arising in glial cells surrounding the diencephalic and rhombencephalic ventricles just before scoliosis onset and increasing with time in severity. Anti-inflammatory drug treatment reduced scoliosis penetrance and severity and this correlated with both reduced astrogliosis and macrophage/microglia enrichment around the diencephalic ventricle. Mutation of the <italic>cep290</italic> gene encoding another transition zone protein also associated astrogliosis with scoliosis. Thus, we propose that the onset of a feed-forward loop between astrogliosis, induced by perturbed ventricular homeostasis, and immune cells recruitment as a novel pathogenic mechanism of zebrafish scoliosis in ciliary transition zone mutants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is a 3D rotation of the spine without vertebral anomalies that affects about 3% of adolescents worldwide. Its etiology remained mysterious, mainly because of the lack of appropriate animal models and the complexity of its inheritance profile in large families presenting a severe scoliosis trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Since the description of the first IS model in the zebrafish <italic>ptk7</italic> gene mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), a number of mutants for genes encoding ciliary proteins were shown to develop scoliosis at late larval and juvenile stage (4 to 12 weeks post-fertilization, wpf) without any vertebral fusion or fracture, highlighting the link between cilia function and straight axis maintenance in that species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Cilia are microtubular organelles with sensory and/or motile functions. Zebrafish mutants in genes involved in cilia motility or in intraflagellar transport display severe embryonic axis curvature and are usually not viable beyond larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). In contrast, mutants in genes implicated in ciliary gating or ciliary trafficking encoding respectively components of the transition zone (TZ) or the BBsome complex survive to adult stage and develop scoliosis with variable penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). The molecular basis for these differences is still poorly understood, even if progress has been made in our understanding of zebrafish scoliosis. Cilia-driven movements of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are involved in zebrafish axis straightness, both in embryos and juveniles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) and are tightly linked to the assembly and maintenance of the Reissner fiber (RF), a SCO-spondin polymer secreted by the subcommissural organ (SCO) and running down the brain and spinal cord CSF-filled cavities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). RF loss at embryonic stage in null <italic>sspo</italic> mutants is lethal while its loss at juvenile stage in hypomorphic <italic>sspo</italic> mutants triggers scoliosis with full penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Signaling downstream of the RF in embryos implicates Urp1 and Urp2, two neuropeptides of the Urotensin 2 family expressed in ventral CSF-contacting neurons (CSF-cNs), which trigger dorsal muscle contraction in embryos and larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Their combined mutations or the mutation of their receptor gene <italic>uts2r3</italic> lead to scoliosis at adult stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). However, whether RF maintenance and Urp1/2 signaling are perturbed in juvenile scoliotic mutants of genes encoding TZ proteins (“TZ mutants”) and how these perturbations are linked to scoliosis is unknown, especially because TZ mutants do not display any sign of embryonic or larval cilia motility defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Moreover, two scoliotic models develop axial curvature while maintaining a RF showing that their curvature onset occurs independently of RF loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Finally, neuro-inflammation has been described in a small subset of zebrafish IS models for which anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant treatments (with NAC or NACET) partially rescue scoliosis penetrance and severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper we dissect the mechanisms of scoliosis appearance in a novel deletion allele of the zebrafish TZ <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> gene, which is viable and develops an axis curvature phenotype at juvenile stages with nearly full penetrance. Using a variety of approaches, we show that i) Rpgrip1l is required in ciliated cells surrounding ventricular cavities for maintaining a straight axis; ii) at juvenile stages, <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants develop cilia defects associated with ventricular dilations and loss of the RF; iii) increased <italic>urp1/2</italic> expression in rpgrip1l mutants does not account for spine curvature defects; and iv) a pervasive astrogliosis process associated with neuroinflammation participates in scoliosis onset and progression. Finally, we show that astrogliosis is conserved in another zebrafish ciliary TZ mutant, <italic>cep290</italic>, identifying a novel mechanism associated with scoliosis upon ciliary dysfunction.</p>

<title>Rpgrip1l <sup>-/-</sup> fish develop scoliosis asynchronously at juvenile stage</title>
<p>To study the mechanisms of scoliosis appearance upon ciliary dysfunction in zebrafish, we made use of a viable zebrafish deletion mutant in the <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> gene encoding a ciliary transition zone protein (<italic>rpgrip1l</italic><sup>Δ<italic>4-25</italic></sup>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>, (thereafter called <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-</sup></italic>). 90-100% of <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos and larvae were straight (0-10%, depending on the clutch, displayed a sigmoid curvature). They did not display any additional defects found in many ciliary mutant embryos or larvae such as randomized left-right asymmetry, kidney cysts or retinal anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). Another allele with a frameshift mutation in exon 4 (<italic>rpgrip1l<sup>ex4</sup></italic>) showed a similar phenotype (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">supplementary Figure S1A, B</xref>). <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals developed scoliosis during juvenile stages. Scoliosis appearance was asynchronous between clutches, from 4 weeks post fertilization (wpf) (around 1 cm length) to 11 wpf (1,8-2,3 cm), and also within a clutch. It started with slight upward bending of the tail (the <italic>tail-up</italic> phenotype) and progressed toward severe curvature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>) with 90% penetrance in adults (100% in females and 80% in males) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Micro-computed tomography (μCT) at two different stages (5 wpf and 23 wpf) confirmed that spine curvature was three-dimensional and showed no evidence of vertebral fusion, malformation or fracture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-G</xref> and Supplementary Movie 1).</p>

<p>Thus, the ciliary <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant shows almost totally penetrant juvenile scoliosis without vertebral anomalies, making it a valuable model for studying the etiology of human idiopathic scoliosis. Furthermore, the asynchronous onset of curvature is an asset for studying the chronology of early defects leading to scoliosis.</p>

<title>Reintroducing <italic>RPGRIP1L</italic> in foxj1a lineages rescues scoliosis in rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup> fish</title>
<p>Since <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> is ubiquitously expressed in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), scoliosis could have different tissue origins, including a neurological origin as shown for the <italic>ptk7</italic> and <italic>ktnb1</italic> scoliotic fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Indeed, no tissue-specific rescue has been performed yet in zebrafish ciliary gene mutants. We tested if introducing by transgenesis a tagged human RPGRIP1L protein under the control of the <italic>col2a1a</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>) or <italic>foxj1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) enhancers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>) would reduce scoliosis penetrance and severity. The <italic>foxj1a</italic> enhancer drives expression in motile ciliated cells, among which ependymal cells lining CNS cavities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), while the <italic>col2a1a</italic> regulatory region drives expression in cartilage cells including intervertebral disks and semi-circular canals, tissues that have been proposed to be defective in mammalian scoliosis models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). After having selected F1 transgenic fish that expressed the Myc-tagged RPGRIP1L protein in the targeted tissue at 2.5 dpf, we introduced one copy of each transgene into the <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background. The Foxj1a:5XMycRPGRIP1L transgene was sufficient to fully rescue scoliosis in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish: none of the transgenic <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fish became scoliotic while virtually all the non-transgenic <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>siblings did (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I,J</xref>). In contrast, RPGRIP1L expression triggered by the <italic>col2a1a</italic> promoter did not have any beneficial effect on scoliosis penetrance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I, J</xref>). In conclusion, <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> expression in <italic>foxj1a</italic>-expressing cells is sufficient to maintain a straight axis.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup> adult fish display cilia defects along CNS cavities</title>
<p>We observed normal cilia at embryonic stages in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>embryos neural tube (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). In adults, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at the level of the rhombencephalic ventricle (RhV) showed cilia tuft of multiciliated ependymal cells (MCC) lining the ventricle in controls (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1F, F</xref>’). In scoliotic <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish, cilia tufts were sparse and disorganized (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1H, H</xref>’), whereas those of a straight <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fish were morphologically normal but less dense (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1G, G</xref>’). Cilia of mono-ciliated ependymal cells showed abnormal, irregular structures in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish compared to controls, with either bulged or thinner parts (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, compare F” with G’’, H’’ and H’’’).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>MCC defects at SCO level correlate with scoliosis appearance at juvenile stages</title>
<p>We then took advantage of the asynchrony in scoliosis onset to correlate, at a given stage, cilia defects at different levels of the CNS cavities with the spine curvature status (straight or curved) of <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> juveniles. We analyzed cilia defects in three CNS regions implicated in scoliosis appearance: the spinal cord central canal (since scoliosis develops in the spine), the forebrain choroid plexus (fChP) whose cilia defects have been associated to scoliosis in <italic>katnb1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) and the subcommissural organ (SCO), which secretes SCO-spondin whose absence leads to scoliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>
<p>In the spinal cord central canal of 8 wpf juvenile fish, cilia density was reduced to the same extent in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish irrespective of the fish curvature status (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 A, C</xref>). In addition, cilia length was increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 A, B</xref>) and Arl13b content was severely reduced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 A</xref>). In the fChP, mono- and multi-ciliated cell populations were observed with a specific distribution along the anterior-posterior axis, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). At the level of the habenula nuclei, cells of dorsal and ventral midline territories were monociliated, while lateral cells presented multicilia tufts (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2 G-G</xref>’’). <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> juveniles presented an incomplete penetrance of ciliary defects in the fChP, with no correlation between cilia defects and the curvature status (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2, H-K</xref>’’).</p>

<p>The SCO lies at the dorsal midline of the diencephalic ventricle (DiV). CiIia in and around the SCO have not been described previously in zebrafish. We showed that, in control animals, SCO-spondin secreting cells varied in number along SCO length, from 24 cells anteriorly to 6-8 cells posteriorly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L, O</xref>) and were monociliated at all anteroposterior levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-F</xref>). Conversely, MCCs lateral to the SCO-spondin secreting cells were more numerous and prominent towards posterior (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), as observed in the rat brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Monocilia of SCO-spondin secreting cells were still present but appeared longer in straight <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>juveniles and could not be individualized anymore at anterior SCO level in scoliotic fish: we observed a weaker and denser acetylated and glutamylated tubulin staining that likely corresponded to longer intertwined cilia.

<p>Thus, <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants develop both monocilia and multicilia defects at juvenile stages, but cilia defects in the spinal cord and in the fChP do not correlate with axis curvature status of the fish. By contrast, the loss of MCC cilia at the SCO strictly correlates with scoliosis onset, suggesting a causal relationship.</p>

<title>Rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup> juveniles show ventricular dilations and loss of the Reissner fiber at scoliosis onset</title>
<p>Ciliary beating is an essential actor of CSF flow and of ventricular development in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Thus, ciliary defects in the brain and spinal cord of <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish could lead to abnormal ventricular and central canal volume and content. In the spinal cord, the lumen of the central canal was enlarged at thoracic and lumbar levels in all <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant juveniles, with no correlation to the axis curvature status (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> A1-A3; D). To determine the timing of brain ventricular dilations relative to scoliosis, we analyzed ventricular volume at the onset of spine curvature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-G</xref>). Ventricular reconstruction was performed on cleared brains of 4 control and 4 <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-</sup></italic><sup>/-</sup> (3 tail-up and 1 straight) fish at 5 wpf, stained with ZO1 to highlight the ventricular border and with DiI to outline brain shape, focusing on the RhV at the level of the posterior midbrain and hindbrain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>). We identified a significant increase in ventricle volume in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish compared to controls, that was restricted to the ventral regions of the RhV in regions ROI4.4 (green sphere in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) and ROI6 (green sphere in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), as confirmed by numerical sections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, G</xref>). Ventricle dilations were also present, although to a lesser extent, in the RhV of the unique straight <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish of this study (green squares and triangle in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F, G</xref>).</p>
<p>Defective ependymal ciliogenesis has been associated with abnormal CSF flow and defective Reissner Fiber (RF) maintenance in several scoliotic zebrafish models(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The RF is mainly composed of SCO-spondin secreted by the SCO and floor plate (FP) and its loss at juvenile stages triggers scoliosis in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). To visualize the RF, we used an antiserum that labels the RF in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) and we confirmed the results by introducing one copy of the <italic>sspo-GFP</italic> knock-in allele by genetic cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) into <italic>rpgrip1l <sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals. The RF formed normally in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos, as expected given the absence of embryonic curvature (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1 C</xref>). To study its maintenance in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> juveniles, we immunostained spinal cord longitudinal sections of 7-8 wpf curved or straight fish of the same clutch. The RF was visualized as a 1 μm diameter rod in the central canal of the neural tube and few dots were present in the apical cytoplasm of FP cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>) as well as in the SCO of all controls (n=8, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L, O</xref>). The RF was also present in all <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> straight fish (n=9, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tail-up and scoliotic fish, the RF was absent at all axis levels and a few SCO-spondin-positive debris were present in the central canal (n=8, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Transverse sections at the level of the SCO revealed abnormally packed material in the ventricle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N, Q</xref>). We also observed that SCO-spondin aggregates spread anteriorly into the diencephalic ventricle (DiV) at fChP level in scoliotic juveniles (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2C, F</xref>; n=7/7), a situation never observed in controls (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A, D</xref> n=0/6) or in straight juveniles (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B, E</xref>, n=0/5).</p>
<p>Thus, our study uncovers a strict temporal correlation between the loss of MCC at posterior SCO level, impaired RF polymerization and scoliosis onset in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>juvenile fish.</p>

<p>In scoliotic fish where the RF is not maintained at juvenile stage, <italic>urp1</italic> and <italic>urp2</italic> levels are downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). <italic>urp1</italic> and <italic>urp2</italic> encode peptides of the Urotensin 2 family, expressed in ventral spinal CSF-cNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>).

<p>Given the early and long-lasting upregulation of <italic>urp1/2</italic> in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish, we attempted to rescue axis curvature by decreasing global Urp1/2 production via genetic means by downregulating <italic>urp2</italic> expression level. To that end, we generated double (<italic>rpgrip1l<sup>+/-</sup>; urp2<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) heterozygous fish using the recently generated <italic>urp2</italic> deletion allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) and crossed them to produce double mutants. Using a curvature quantification method on whole fish (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3I</xref> and methods), we observed that the removal of one or two <italic>urp2</italic> functional allele(s) in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish did not lower their curvature index (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), neither at two mpf (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3 F</xref>) nor at four mpf (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3 G-H</xref>). We observed that <italic>urp2</italic> mRNA amounts were reduced by removing one or two functional copies of <italic>urp2</italic>, probably as a consequence of mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>)(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).

<p>Thus, lowering global Urp1/2 expression level in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants did not have any beneficial effect on the axis curvature phenotype, ruling out altered <italic>urp1/2</italic> signaling as a main driver of scoliosis in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants.</p>

<title>Regulators of motile ciliogenesis, inflammation genes and annexins are upregulated in rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup> juveniles</title>
<p>To get further insight into the early mechanisms driving spine curvature in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants, we obtained the transcriptome of the brain and dorsal trunk of 7 <italic>rpgrip1l</italic><sup>-/-</sup> juveniles at scoliosis onset (6 tail-up and 1 straight 5 wpf juveniles) and 5 control siblings (2 <italic>rgprip1l<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) and 3 <italic>rgprip1l<sup>+/-</sup></italic>). Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed with DSEQ2 software within the Galaxy environment. A complete annotated gene list is displayed in Supplementary Table 1(Trunk) and Table 2 (Brain). Filtering the gene list to select for P-adj &lt; 0.05 and Log2 FC &gt; 0.75 or &lt; -0.75 recovered a vast majority of upregulated genes in the dorsal trunk (75 downregulated vs 614 upregulated genes) and, to a lesser extent, in the brain (1 downregulated vs 60 upregulated genes) as illustrated on the volcano plots from DGE analysis of the brain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) and trunk (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). 54 out of 60 genes upregulated in the brain were also upregulated in the trunk, suggesting that, in the trunk, these genes were specific to the CNS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). In both the brain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) and the trunk (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>), the most upregulated biological processes in GO term analysis included cilium movement and cilium assembly. Among the 20 most significant GO terms found for upregulated genes in the trunk, 8 were related to ciliary movement/assembly (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>).

<p>In order to confirm these results and to identify processes affected at the post-transcriptional level in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants, we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry of brains from 5 <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> adult fish and 5 control siblings. This analysis detected 5706 proteins present in at least 4 over the 5 replicates, of which 172 are associated with a P value &lt; 0.05 and a Log2FC &gt;to +0.75 and &lt;of -0.75. 127 proteins were present in higher and 45 in lower quantity, as illustrated on the volcano plot (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref> and supplementary Table 4). Pathways enriched in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> brains included regulation of vesicular trafficking and membrane repair processes, as well as proteolysis and catabolic processes, suggesting profound perturbation of cellular homeostasis (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>).

We therefore investigated in which cell type(s) Anxa2, the most upregulated protein in the <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> brain proteome, was expressed. Immunostaining of brain sections revealed a strong Anxa2 staining on cells lining brain ventricles, such as SCO cells and ventral ependymal cells of the rhombencephalic ventricle (RhV) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6 B’-D’</xref>) in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> adult fish, which was barely detectable in controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 A’-C’</xref>), and to a lesser extent on other brain regions (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 5 D</xref>’-F’), suggesting a deregulation of ependymal cell homeostasis. In mutants, Anxa2 staining spread over long cellular extensions reaching the pial surface of the rhombencephalon (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 D’</xref>). This cell shape is characteristic of radial glial cells, a cell type that behaves as neural and glial progenitors and also plays astrocytic functions in zebrafish, as anamniote brains are devoid of stellate astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). To confirm the glial nature of Anxa2-positive cells around brain ventricles in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fish, we double-labeled brain sections with GFAP, a glial cell marker, and Anxa2. In adult <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish, SCO cells were strongly double-positive for Anxa2 and GFAP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6 B, B</xref>’), while controls displayed much weaker labeling for GFAP in the SCO and no labeling for Anxa2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6 A, A’</xref>). We made similar observations at rhombencephalic ventricle (RhV) level: most ventral ependymal cells of this territory were positive for Anxa2 and strongly positive for GFAP, and GFAP labeling was much higher in mutants than in controls (Compare <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6 D, D</xref>’ with <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6 C, C</xref>’). GFAP overexpression is a hallmark of astrogliosis, a process in which astroglial cells react to the perturbed environment, as shown during brain infection, injury, ischemia or neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Thus, the strong increase of GFAP staining combined with Anxa2 overexpression in brain ependymal cells of <italic>rpgrip1<sup>l-/-</sup></italic> adult fish strongly suggests that these cells undergo astrogliosis as observed in other animal models following CNS injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>).</p>

<p>To assay whether an astrogliosis-like phenotype was already present at scoliotic onset, we immunostained GFAP on juvenile brain sections of straight and tail-up mutants and controls. Tail-up juveniles (n=3/3) presented a strong GFAP staining in almost all cells of the SCO and along the ventral rhombencephalic ventricle, higher than control levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 E, I, H, L, M</xref>) while the phenotype of straight fish was heterogeneous: two out of four juveniles presented GFAP-positive cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G, K</xref> and red dots on <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref> graph), while the two other did not (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref> and green dots on <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref> graph) as confirmed by cell quantification (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref>).

<title>Immune cell enrichment around the SCO and within tectum parenchyma is detected prior to scoliosis onset</title>
<p>Astrogliosis may be reinforced or induced by an inflammatory environment containing cytokines released by microglia or macrophages or the presence of high levels of ROS and NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>).

We found that the scoliotic fish presented a higher number of LCP1-positive cells of ameboid shape within SCO cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6Q, Q’, R</xref>).

In the optic tectum, where resident LCP1-positive macrophages/microglia were present in controls, a two-fold increase in the number of ramified LCP1<sup>+</sup> cells was observed in straight <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> juveniles compared to controls (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5H-I</xref>’’).

<p>Our data thus uncovers an early astrogliosis process initiated asynchronously at the SCO and RhV levels of straight <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish, favored by a transient inflammatory state, and preceding the loss of multiciliated tufts around the SCO and that of the RF, only detected in curved <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fish.

<p>Our data suggest that astrogliosis and neuro-inflammation could play a role in triggering scoliosis in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants.

At 4 wpf, the SCO had not reached its final adult width (14 versus 24 cells wide in the anterior SCO), and each of its cells harbored a short monocillium labeled by glutamylated tubulin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A-C</xref>). Multicilia tufts on SCO lateral walls were not as clearly visible as in adults (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) but patches of glutamylated tubulin staining were detected on both sides of the posterior SCO (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B-C</xref>’).

<p>To test for the presence of astrogliosis, we quantified the number of SCO cells presenting high GFAP labeling on several sections along the A/P extent of the SCO in 3 control and 3 <italic>cep290<sup>-/-</sup></italic> brains. 50% of SCO cells presented strong GFAP staining in fully scoliotic juveniles, which was not detectable in controls (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H-K</xref>, N=2/3), while a lower proportion (22%) of SCO cells was GFAP positive in the juvenile with a milder curvature (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> M N=1/3).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we dissected the mechanisms of scoliosis appearance in a zebrafish mutant for the TZ gene <italic>rpgrip1l</italic>, taking advantage of its asynchronous onset to decipher the chronology of events leading to spine torsion. Transcriptome analysis of the brain and trunk at scoliosis onset in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish compared to control siblings revealed increased expression of <italic>urp1/2</italic>, <italic>foxj1a</italic> and its target genes, as well as immune response genes. Genetic experiments ruled out an involvement of increased Urp1/2 signaling in scoliosis development. Cilia defects appeared asynchronously in different CNS regions, while RF loss strictly coincided with scoliosis onset. Strikingly, we observed a strong increase of Annexin2 and GFAP staining along the diencephalic and rhombencephalic ventricles, indicative of astrogliosis. This astrogliosis just preceded scoliosis onset and then spread posteriorly and increased in severity. In the region of the SCO, the appearance of astrogliosis and neuroinflammation coincided temporally, just preceding the onset of RF depolymerization and spine torsion. NACET treatment which reduces both astrogliosis and inflammation diminishes the penetrance and severity of scoliosis in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fish. Finally, we showed that another TZ gene mutant, <italic>cep290</italic>, also displayed astrogliosis at the time of scoliosis onset. Thus, the cascade of events uncovered in the <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant led us to propose a feed-forward loop between astrogliosis along CNS ventricles and immune cell recruitment as the origin of zebrafish scoliosis caused by ciliary TZ defects.</p>
<p>Cilia motility defects lead to RF loss and to scoliosis in several zebrafish mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>)). <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic> encodes a TZ protein important for cilia integrity and function in many eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Our data show that <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> deficiency in zebrafish affects cilia maintenance differentially depending on the CNS territory and the developmental stage, raising the question of which ciliated cells are responsible for RF loss and scoliosis initiation in this mutant. The full rescue observed after re-introducing RPGRIP1L in <italic>Foxj1a</italic>-expressing cells points towards a crucial function of the protein in cells lining CNS cavities. Foxj1a-positive cell populations encompass both monociliated and multiciliated ependymal cells, radial glial progenitors, glial cells of the SCO and the ChP, as well as CSF-contacting sensory neurons in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Recent work suggested that impairment of ciliogenesis in the fChP of the <italic>katnb1</italic> mutant could play a role in inducing axis curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). In the case of the <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant, we temporally uncorrelated fChP cilia defects from scoliosis onset. This, combined with the fact that the total loss of multicilia in the fChP of (<italic>foxj1b<sup>-/-</sup>, gmnc</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) double mutants does not trigger axis curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) suggests that another <italic>foxj1a</italic>-expressing population is crucial for axis straightness. Our results strongly suggest that cilia defects in the SCO trigger axis curvature in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants. Two cilia populations were affected in the SCO of <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant juveniles at the onset of scoliosis: cilia of monociliated glial cells that secrete SCO-spondin, which appeared longer in mutants than in controls, and multiciliated tufts at SCO exit, which were lost in mutants. Both defects could be responsible for the phenotype, by perturbing CSF flow and content (presence of SCO-spondin aggregates in ventricles) and leading to ventricular dilations. However, our observation that multiciliated cells were not yet fully differentiated in <italic>cep290</italic> mutants at scoliosis onset is in favor of a prominent role of monocilia in early-onset scoliotic models. Indeed, most ciliary mutant models develop axis curvature at 3-4 weeks, a stage when brain multiciliated cells are not yet differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Still, as scoliosis in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant appears after 5 weeks, MCC loss at SCO exit may contribute to defective RF polymerization in this late-onset scoliotic model. Alternatively, MCC loss observed at late juvenile stage in most scoliotic models as in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant may be a secondary event induced by inflammatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>) or defective CSF flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>).</p>
<p>Our transcriptome analysis and qRT-PCR data challenges a model proposed for axis straightness of zebrafish embryos in which the loss of RF leads to a down-regulation of <italic>urp2</italic> and <italic>urp1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) since we observed an upregulation of both genes before and after RF loss. As forced expression of <italic>urp1/2</italic> induces a tail-up phenotype in embryos and juveniles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), we attempted to rescue <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> axis curvature by down-regulating <italic>urp1/2</italic> expression. No beneficial effect on scoliosis penetrance or severity was observed, indicating that increased <italic>urp1/2</italic> expression level does not significantly contribute to axis curvature in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish.</p>
<p>In this study, we found an unexpected and spectacular defect characterized by enhanced expression of GFAP and Anxa2, which we identified as astrogliosis (also called reactive astrogliosis). Astrogliosis is a reaction of astroglial cells to perturbed homeostasis of the CNS, characterized by molecular and phenotypic changes in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). In zebrafish, radial glial cells are endowed with both neurogenic and astrocytic functions, and are thus also called astroglial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Astrogliosis in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants arose in a subdomain of Foxj1a-positive cells, within the DiV and ventral ependymal cells lining the RhV. The observation of astrogliosis in some straight juvenile mutants suggests an early role of this defect in scoliosis onset.</p>
<p>Astrogliosis along ventricular cavities could arise in response to local mechanical or chemical perturbations caused by cilia motility defects, abnormal CSF flow and content and ventricular dilations. In two murine models of primary ciliary dyskinesia, decreased CSF flow was associated with gliosis at juvenile stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). A response to CSF defects in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants is also suggested by the strong upregulation of Foxj1a and its target genes. <italic>foxj1a</italic> is also upregulated in the CNS of three other scoliotic models in addition to <italic>rpgrip1l</italic>, <italic>ptk7, sspo</italic> and <italic>katnb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), suggesting that it constitutes a common response to similar ventricular and CSF defects. Interestingly, <italic>foxj1a</italic> expression is also upregulated upon zebrafish embryonic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) or adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) spinal cord injury. The up-regulation in the <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant proteome of the membrane repair module Anxa2-S100a10-Ahnak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) together with the Foxj1-induced motility module may indicate ongoing reparation attempts of CNS ventricles and associated neural tissues.</p>
<p>Moreover, the presence of few Lcp1+ cells around the mutant SCO suggests that microglia/macrophages could participate in astrogliosis establishment and reinforcement. This dialogue between immune Lcp1+ cells and astroglial cells is evidenced during early stages of regeneration after acute injury or cellular damages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). In our bulk RNAseq analysis performed at scoliosis onset, we have indications of the upregulation of microglia and macrophage markers (<italic>p2ry12</italic> and <italic>mpeg1</italic>) at trunk levels and of numerous markers of activated astrocytes characterized in several mammalian astrogliosis models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). A similar dialogue is evidenced in polycystic kidney disease models where compromised primary cilia signalling leads to uncontrolled cytokines secretion by epithelial cells, a situation that favor local immune cells recruitment and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>).</p>
<p>What are the intracellular mechanisms involved in astrogliosis induction in ciliated ventricular cells? Candidate pathways emerge from our multi-omics studies. Proteomic data showed a 2.4-fold increase in GSK3bb amount in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant brains (P value &lt; 0.001, Supplementary Table 3). In several neurodegenerative murine animal models, GSK3b enzymatic activity was shown to promote inflammation and gliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). Another potential trigger of astrogliosis may be a defective mitochondrial activity as the amounts of four proteins involved in electron transport chain activity (<italic>gpd1b, mt-nd6, pdia5 and dmgdh</italic>) were reduced by 40% to 86% in the analysis of mutant brain proteome (Supplementary Table 4). We think this is of particular interest in light of a recent report demonstrating that impaired mitochondrial activity within ciliated astrocytes leads to the induction of the Foxj1 ciliary motility program, the elongation and distortion of astrocyte primary cilia as well as reactive astrogliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>), three phenotypes also observed in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> brains.</p>
<p>Finally, our observation of widespread astrogliosis in two TZ gene mutants, <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> and <italic>cep290</italic>, suggests that a feed-forward loop between astrogliosis and immune cell recruitment could represent a general mechanism involved in scoliosis downstream of cilia dysfunction. Of note, astrogliosis markers such as <italic>glast/slc1a3b</italic>, <italic>vim</italic>, <italic>s100b</italic>, <italic>c4</italic>, <italic>timp2b</italic>, <italic>gfap</italic> and <italic>ctssb.2</italic>, are also upregulated in the transcriptome of <italic>ptk7 mutants</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). We propose that sustained astrogliosis might impair neuronal survival and activity, crucial for proper interoception and locomotor control, thus leading to axis curvature in the context of a rapidly growing axial skeleton. A similar context of astrocytosis associated with spinal cord dilation has been observed in human patients with syringomyelia. This population with a high incidence of scoliosis can present hyper-signals on T2 MRI scans, which were proposed to reflect local astrocytosis and could be validated by biopsies in rare cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Further imaging studies will need to be performed to validate a potential link between developing astrogliosis and the onset and progression of idiopathic scoliosis in humans.</p>

Volumes, which were open to the environment were artificially closed with minimal surfaces by connecting the distal-most points of their surface to the contralaterally corresponding points using straight edges. Due to the biologic variability of the sample population the overall size of the specimens needed to be normalized to keep the measured volumes comparable. For this spatial normalization one of the specimens was randomly selected from the wildtype population as template (1664, grey) and the ‘Registration’ module in Amira was used to compute region-specific rigid registrations for the other specimens, allowing for isotropic scaling only [details in supp. mat.].

<p>Raw files were converted to.mgf peaklists using DataAnalysis (version 5.3, Bruker Daltonics) and were submitted to Mascot database searches (version 2.5.1, MatrixScience, London, UK) against a <italic>Danio rerio</italic> protein sequence database downloaded from UniProtKB-SwissProt (2022_05_18, 61 732 entries, taxonomy ID: 7955), to which common contaminants and decoy sequences were added. Spectra were searched with a mass tolerance of 15 ppm in MS mode and 0.05 Da in MS/MS mode. One trypsin missed cleavage was tolerated. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine residues and acetylation of proteins’ n-termini were set as variable modifications. Identification results were imported into the Proline software (version 2.1.2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proline.profiproteomics.fr">http://proline.profiproteomics.fr</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>) for validation. Peptide Spectrum Matches (PSM) with pretty ranks equal to one were retained. False Discovery Rate (FDR) was then optimized to be below 1% at PSM level using Mascot Adjusted E-value and below 1% at protein level using Mascot Mudpit score. For label free quantification, peptide abundances were extracted without cross assignment between the samples. Protein abundances were computed using the sum of the unique peptide abundances normalized at the peptide level using the median.</p>
<p>To be considered, proteins must be identified in at least four out of the five replicates in at least one condition. Imputation of the missing values and differential data analysis were performed using the open-source ProStaR software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). Imputation of missing values was done using the approximation of the lower limit of quantification by the 2.5% lower quantile of each replicate intensity distribution (“det quantile”). A Limma moderated <italic>t</italic>-test was applied on the dataset to perform differential analysis. The adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to adjust the p-values and FDR. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>), with the dataset identifier PXD042283.</p>

<title>Embryos drug treatment</title>
<p>27 hpf embryos from <italic>dnaaf1</italic><sup>tm317b/+</sup> incross were dechorionated manually. N-acetyl cysteine ethyl ester (NACET) (BIOLLA Chemicals #59587-09-6) was prepared extemporaneously at the final concentration of 3 mM in pure water (pH: 7.2; conductivity 650 µS). Embryos were treated between 27 hpf to 60 hpf and embryos were anesthetized before being imaged laterally.</p>

<title>Juvenile drug treatment and preparation of treated samples</title>
<p>Two hundred larvae were housed off-system in 1.8 liter tanks with 20 fish per tank, being fed twice a day throughout the experiment. 100 were treated with NACET (BIOLLA Chemicals #59587-09-6), which was prepared extemporaneously at 1.5 mM (286.5mg/L) in fish water (pH 7.2, Conductivity 650 µS) which was changed once per day. Fish were treated from 30 dpf to 84 dpf and monitored for curvature onset once per week. At 85 dpf, fish were euthanized, imaged to measure the curvature index. Half of the fish were fixed for histology analysis in zamboni fixative [35 ml PFA 4 %, 15 ml saturated picric acid (1.2 %)] overnight at 4°C under agitation, while the other half was processed for RT-qPCR analysis. To prepare dorsal trunk RNA, internal organs were removed in cold PBS 1X, and the remaining tissue was cut in small pieces before lysis in QIAzol (QIAGEN). Homogenization was achieved using plunger pistons and passages through 1ml syringes.</p>

<title>Transgenesis</title>
<p>The <italic>Tol2 -5.2foxj1a:5xmyc-RPGRIP1L</italic> plasmid was produced using the Gateway system by combining four plasmids. P5E-foxj1a enhancer was kindly donated by [3]. 5xmyc-RPGRIP1L cDNA was amplified from the plasmid pCS2-5xmyc-RPGRIP1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) using CloneAmp HiFi PCR Premix (Takara # 639298) using primers : forward 5’-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAGCAGGCTGCAGGATCCCATCGATTTAAAGCT-3’ and reverse 5’ GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTCCGAGCTCGGTTCAAGCCTCCA AGTCATCTCTGT-3. The PCR product was gel purified using QIAEX II gel extraction kit (QIAGEN, #20021). BP recombination (Invitrogren “Gateway BP Clonase II Enzyme Mix” #11789-020) was performed into pDONR221 #218 to generate pMe-5xmyc-RPGRIP1L. The 3’ entry polyadenylation signal plasmid was the one described in [61]. The 3 plasmids were shuttled into the backbone containing the cmcl2:GFP selection cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>) using the LR recombination (Invitrogen “Gateway LR Clonase II Plus Enzyme Mix” #12538-120). <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>+/-</sup></italic> X AB embryos outcrosses were injected at the one cell stage with 1nl of a mix containing 20 ng/µl plasmid and 25 ng/µl Tol2 transposase RNA and screened at 48 hpf for GFP expression in the heart. Some F0 founders produced F1 zebrafish carrying one copy of the transgene that were further checked for RPGRIP1L specific expression in <italic>foxj1a</italic> territory, using Myc labelling at the base of FP cilia in 2,5 dpf embryos.</p>
<p>The Tol2-1.7kb col2a1a:5xMyc-RPGRIP1L plasmid was produced using the Gateway System by combining four plasmids. Col2a1a enhancer was amplified from the plasmid -1.7kbcol2a1a:EGFP-CAAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) using CloneAmp HiFi premix (Takara #639298) with the primers: forward 5’-GGG GAC AAC TTT GTA TAG AAA AGT TGG CCC TCT GAC ACC TGA TGC CAA TTG C-3’ and reverse 5’-GGG GAC TGC TTT TTT GTA CAA ACT TGC TTG CAG GTC CTA AGG GGT GAA AGT CG-. The PCR product was gel purified and BP recombination was performed into pDONR_P4-P1R-#219. The middle entry plasmid and the 3’ plasmid were the same as those used to generate the Tol-5.2foxj1a: 5xmyc-RPGRIP1L plasmid. F1 transgenic were first selected for GFP expression in the heart and then on Myc labelling within notochordal cells at 2,5 dpf within their embryonic progeny.</p>

<title>Skeletal preparations, Alizarin staining and imaging</title>
<p>Animals were euthanized using a lethal concentration of MS222 (0.28 mg/mL), skin was removed and fixation was performed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C. After evisceration, samples were incubated in borax 5%, rinsed several times in 1% KOH and incubated in solution composed with Alizarin 0.01% (Sigma, A5533) and KOH 1% during 2 days. Fish were rinsed several times in KOH 1% and incubated in trypsin 1% and borax 2% for 2 days until cleared. Samples were rinsed several times in distilled water and transferred in glycerol 80% (in KOH 1%) using progressive dilutions. Samples were kept in glycerol 80% until imaging.</p>

<title>Cobb angles measurements</title>
<p>To quantitatively evaluate the severity of spine curvature in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>+/-</sup>; urp2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> incrosses, we used the zebrafish skeletal preparations stained with Alizarin. We drew parallel lines to the top and bottom most displaced vertebrae on lateral and dorsal views. The Cobb angle was then measured as the angle of intersection between lines drawn perpendicular to the original 2 lines. This was conducted using FIJI software. For each fish, the total Cobb angle was calculated by summing all Cobb angles.</p>

<sec id="s4c9">
<title>Curvature index measurements</title>
<p>We implemented a novel procedure to quantify curvatures on both axes by drawing a line along the body of the fish as shown in Figure <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">supplementary 4I</xref> and curvature was calculated in MATLAB (code available on demand). We decomposed the line in a series of equidistant points and we measured the curvature at each of these points using the LineCurvature2D function. We then added the absolute values of these measures, which are expressed as an angle (in radian) per unit of length. The higher the sum is for a given line, the more this line is curvated. We verified the accurancy of this metric by comparing it with the visual assessment of curvatures by 3 independent observers. For <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>+/-</sup>; urp2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> incross and NACET experiment, a line following the body deformation was drawn from the mouth to the base of the tail following the midline of the fish in lateral position and another one along the dorsal axis. Curvature index of both curves were summed for each fish. Curvature analysis was performed blinded to fish genotype. <italic>rpgri1l</italic><sup>+/+</sup> or <italic>rpgrip1l</italic><sup>+/-</sup> siblings were used as controls.</p>

<title>Data acquisition for body-curvature analysis at embryonic stage</title>
<p>Zebrafish embryos were anesthetized and imaged laterally with the head pointing to the left. The angle between the line connecting the center of the eye to the center of the yolk and the line connecting the center of the yolk to the tip of the tail was measured to evaluate the body curvature of the embryos. For quantitative analysis, the angles of each embryo were put in the same concentric circles represented with a Roseplot, with 0° pointing to the right and 90° pointing to the top. Each triangle represents a 30° quadrant, and its height indicates the number of embryos within the same quadrant.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study analyzes the role of the ciliary transition zone protein rpgrip1l in the development of the scoliotic phenotype in zebrafish. Through <bold>convincing</bold> proteomic and experimental validation in vivo, the authors demonstrated increased Annexin A2 expression in the brain and increased LCP1+ immune cell infiltration in scoliosis fish. These findings provide additional evidence for the previously proposed role of neuroinflammation in the development of idiopathic scoliosis in zebrafish.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Djebar et al. perform a comprehensive analysis of mutant phenotypes associated with the onset and progression of scoliosis in zebrafish ciliary transition zone mutants rpgrip1l and cep290. They determine that rpgrip1l is required in foxj1a-expressing cells for normal spine development, and that scoliosis is associated with brain ventricle dilations, loss of Reissner fiber polymerization, and the loss of 'tufts' of multi-cilia surrounding the subcommissural organ (the source of Reissner substance). Informed by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, they identify a neuroinflammatory response in rpgrip1l and cep290 mutants that is associated with astrogliosis and CNS macrophage/microglia recruitment. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory drug treatment reduced scoliosis penetrance and severity in rpgrip1l mutants. Based on their data, the authors propose a feed-forward loop between astrogliosis, induced by perturbed ventricular homeostasis, and immune cell recruitment as a novel pathogenic mechanism of scoliosis in zebrafish ciliary transition zone mutants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Comprehensive characterization of the causes of scoliosis in ciliary transition zone mutants rpgrip1l and cep290.</p>
<p>(2) Comparison of rpgrip1l mutants pre- and post-scoliosis onset allowed authors to identify specific phenotypes as being correlated with spine curvature, including brain ventricle dilations, loss of Reissner fiber, and loss of cilia in proximity to the sub-commissural organ.</p>
<p>(3) Elegant genetic demonstration that increased urotensin peptide levels do not account for spinal curvature in rpgrip1l mutants.</p>
<p>(4) The identification of astrogliosis and Annexin over-expression in glial cells surrounding diencephalic and rhombencephalic ventricles as being correlated with scoliosis onset and severe curve progression is a very interesting finding, which may ultimately inform pathogenic mechanisms driving spine curvature</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The fact that cilia loss/dysfunction and Reissner fiber defects cause scoliosis in zebrafish is already well established in the literature, as is the requirement for cilia in foxj1a-expressing cells.</p>
<p>(2) Neuroinflammation has already been identified as the underlying pathogenic mechanism in at least 2 previously published scoliosis models (zebrafish ptk7a and sspo mutants).</p>
<p>(3) Anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin, NAC, and NACET have also previously been demonstrated to suppress scoliosis onset and severe curve progression in these models.</p>
<p>Therefore, although similar observations in rpgrip1l and cep290 mutants (as reported here) add to a growing body of literature that supports a common biological mechanism underlying spine curvature in zebrafish, the novelty of reported findings is diminished.</p>
<p>(4) Although authors demonstrate that astrogliosis and/or macrophage or microglia cell recruitment are correlated with scoliosis, they do not formally demonstrate that these events are sufficient to drive spine curvature. Thus, the functional consequences of astrogliosis and microglia infiltration remain uncertain.</p>
<p>(5) The authors do not investigate the effect of anti-inflammatory treatments on other phenotypes they have correlated with spinal curve onset (like ventricle dilation, Reissner fiber loss, and multi-cilia loss around the subcommissural organ). This would help to identify causal events in scoliosis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Djebar et al investigated the role and the underlying mechanism of the ciliary transition zone protein Rpgrip1l in zebrafish spinal alignment. They showed that rpgrip1l mutant zebrafish develop a nearly full penetrance of body curvature at juvenile stages. The mutant fish have cilia defects associated with ventricular dilations and loss of the Reissner fibers. Scoliosis onset and progression are also strongly associated with astrogliosis and neuroinflammation, and anti-inflammatory drug treatment prevents scoliosis in mutant zebrafish, suggesting a novel pathogenic mechanism for human idiopathic scoliosis. This study is quite comprehensive with high-quality data, and the manuscript is well written, providing important information on how the ciliary transition zone protein functions in maintaining the zebrafish body axis straightness.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Very clear and comprehensive analysis of the mutant zebrafish.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In Figures 1D-G, magnified high-resolution pictures are required to show there are indeed no vertebral malformations.</p>
<p>(2) Are the transcriptome data and proteomic data consistent? Consistent targets in both analyses should be highlighted.</p>
<p>(3) What is the role of Anxa2 in neuroinflammation? Is increased Anxa2 expression in rpgrip1l mutant zebrafish reduced after anti-inflammatory drug treatment? What is the expression level of anxa2 in cep290 mutant zebrafish?</p>
<p>(4) More background about Rpgrip1l should be provided in the introduction, particularly the past studies of the mammalian homolog of Rpgrip11, if there are any.</p>
<p>(5) Is there any human disease associated with Rpgrip1l? Do these patients have scoliosis phenotype?</p>
<p>(6) A summary diagram at the end would be helpful for understanding the main findings.</p>
