<title>Abstract</title><p>Congenital malformations can originate from numerous genetic or non-genetic factors but in most cases the causes are unknown. Genetic disruption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis causes multiple malformations, collectively termed Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder (CNDD), highlighting the necessity of this pathway during embryogenesis. Previous work in mice shows that NAD deficiency perturbs embryonic development specifically when organs are forming. While the pathway is predominantly active in the liver postnatally, the site of activity prior to and during organogenesis is unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we used a mouse model of human CNDD and assessed pathway functionality in embryonic livers and extraembryonic tissues via gene expression, enzyme activity and metabolic analyses. We found that the extra-embryonic visceral yolk sac endoderm exclusively synthesises NAD <italic>de novo</italic> during early organogenesis before the embryonic liver takes over this function. Under CNDD-inducing conditions, visceral yolk sacs had reduced NAD levels and altered NAD-related metabolic profiles, affecting embryo metabolism. Expression of requisite pathway genes is conserved in the equivalent yolk sac cell type in humans.</p>
<p>Our findings show that visceral yolk sac-mediated NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis activity is essential for mouse embryogenesis and its perturbation causes CNDD. As mouse and human yolk sacs are functionally homologous, our data improve the understanding of human congenital malformation causation.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>1) We have included data showing that whole embryos at E11.5 and embryos with their livers removed at E14.5 have negligible HAAO enzyme activity. The observed lack of HAAO activity in the embryo at E11.5 is consistent with the absence of a functional embryonic liver at that stage. Thus, it confirms that the embryo is dependent of extraembryonic tissues (the yolk sac) for NAD de novo synthesis prior to E12.5. The additional datasets are included in Supplementary Table S1 and as a new Supplementary Figure 2. The Results section has been updated to refer to these datasets. We added an author (Alena Sipka) who has provided these datasets.
2) We now provide more information about the malformation types observed in E18.5 embryos in the Results and in Table S4.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Congenital malformations with substantial medical consequences are a major health burden because of their severity and high prevalence, occurring in approximately 3% of live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moorthie et al., 2018</xref>). Causes of congenital malformation are complex and diverse and can involve genetic as well as environmental factors, complicating the identification of aetiologies. Consequently, the underlying causes of malformation are still unknown in the majority of cases.</p>
<p>Disruption of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway, by which L-tryptophan is converted to NAD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), causes congenital malformations of varying types and severity. It affects organs and structures such as heart, kidney, vertebrae and others, and is termed Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder (CNDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dunwoodie et al., 2023</xref>). NAD, referring to its oxidised and reduced form (NAD+ and NADH), is both a critical redox cofactor present in all living cells and an essential co-enzyme involved in a diverse range of cellular functions. Besides NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis from L-tryptophan, mammals also generate NAD from vitamin B3, a collective term for the vitamers nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and nicotinamide riboside (NR), via the Preiss-Handler and NAD Salvage Pathways (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

    <p>(A) Schematic overview of the NAD synthesis pathways. The NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway (blue box) converts the essential amino acid L-tryptophan to NAD and is predominantly performed by the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The Preiss-Handler Pathway (purple box) converts nicotinic acid to NAD in the kidney. The Salvage Pathway (orange box), performed in all cells, salvages the product of NAD consuming enzymes, nicotinamide (NAM), back to NAD. When NAD levels are in excess, NAM is converted to 1-methylnicotinamide (1MNA), N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY) and excreted. Enzymes are in red, metabolites in black.

When maternal vitamin B3 provision was restricted during pregnancy, it induced CNDD-like defects specifically in homozygous-null mouse embryos, and these embryos had no malformations when the mother was provided sufficient dietary vitamin B3 to bypass their genetic block, as here NAD is synthesised via the Preiss-Handler Pathway or NAD Salvage Pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, embryos of wild-type mothers given diets low in L-tryptophan and depleted in vitamin B3 exhibit NAD deficiency and CNDD-like malformations, with phenotypic severity exacerbated by gene-environment interactions via <italic>Haao</italic> or <italic>Nadsyn1</italic> heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Szot et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>These CNDD mouse models suggest that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is active in the conceptus and is required for normal organ development unless sufficient vitamin B3 is supplied by the mother. In adult mice, NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis occurs in the liver and to a very minor extent in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). But mouse embryos are susceptible to CNDD between embryonic day (E) 7.5 and E12.5, before the embryo has developed a functional liver. Therefore, NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is likely active in another tissue during this time window of susceptibility.</p>
<p>The major components of the mammalian conceptus are the embryo itself and two extraembryonic organs, the chorioallantoic placenta and the visceral yolk sac (hereon yolk sac). Perturbation of either extraembryonic organ function can induce malformations in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brent &amp; Fawcett, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brent et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, to determine where NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis activity occurs in the conceptus, we assessed pathway function in these extraembryonic tissues during the CNDD-susceptible organogenesis stages, and in the embryonic liver once formed. We quantified expression of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway genes, HAAO enzyme activity, and metabolites formed during the synthesis and consumption of NAD. We identified yolk sac endoderm cells as the site of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis during organogenesis in mice. A comparison of mouse and human single-cell RNA datasets indicates that these findings in mouse are relevant to humans.</p>

<title>NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis in the embryonic liver is active after organogenesis in mice</title>
<p>NAD is synthesised <italic>de novo</italic> from L-tryptophan, predominantly in the liver. In addition, all cells salvage NAD from NAM in the circulation, with circulatory NAM levels dependent on NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). We have shown in mice that the conceptus is able to synthesise NAD <italic>de novo</italic> prior to E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>); however, it is unclear if or when the embryonic liver is capable of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. In mice, liver primordial cells are present around E9.5 to E10.5, hepatocytes are present from E11.5, and enzymes of the pathway are detected from E13.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Notenboom et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yang et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine when NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway activity commences in hepatocytes during embryogenesis, we re-analysed published murine single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data for the hepatic lineage (liver primordium, liver bud, and hepatocytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mu et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>Tdo2</italic> and <italic>Ido2</italic>, encoding tryptophan-catabolising enzymes, were negligibly expressed at all stages. Expression of subsequent pathway genes <italic>Afmid</italic>, <italic>Kmo</italic>, <italic>Haao</italic>, <italic>Qprt</italic> and <italic>Nadsyn1</italic>, required for NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis from kynurenine (also referred to as the kynurenine pathway), progressively increased during embryogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>), though the time of onset and proportion of cells varied between genes. Nonetheless, all were expressed by E14.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). HAAO enzyme assays were performed on <italic>Haao<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic>and <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryonic livers, isolated from mothers provided a diet rich in L-tryptophan and vitamin B3 (Breeder diet, see Methods). The livers showed limited HAAO activity at E12.5 and a gradually increase at subsequent developmental stages. Furthermore, HAAO activity correlated with the number of functional <italic>Haao</italic> alleles and was significantly different between genotypes at all stages assessed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>). Whole E11.5 embryos as well as E14.5 embryos with their livers removed had negligible HAAO enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>), confirming that no other embryonic tissue apart from the liver is capable of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis.</p>
<p>To validate that the pathway is functional at E14.5 in the liver, we quantified NAD+ and 11 NAD-related metabolites in <italic>Haao<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> liver samples using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatographyâ tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cuny et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>). Differential accumulation of metabolites upstream and downstream of the <italic>Haao</italic> genetic block is a defining characteristic of enzyme loss-of-function in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Szot et al., 2024</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> E14.5 livers had significantly elevated levels of the upstream metabolite 3HAA (18-fold) relative to <italic>Haao<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, whereas the downstream metabolites QA and NAMN were undetectable and significantly decreased (4-fold), respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>,). NAD+ levels were also significantly affected by the loss of functional <italic>Haao</italic> alleles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>), with the lowest concentration measured in <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryonic livers. By contrast, levels of the NAD Salvage Pathway metabolite NAM were 2-fold higher in <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, compared to <italic>Haao<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> livers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>) and levels of the waste products N<sup>1</sup>-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N<sup>1</sup>-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (4PY) were similar between <italic>Haao</italic> genotypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>).This suggests that NAD Salvage Pathway activity compensated for the loss of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis activity in <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos.</p>
<p>Together, these data confirm that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway gene expression occurs in the developing liver from E12.5 onwards and the pathway is functional by E14.5, which is in line with expression of genes encoding other metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mu et al., 2020</xref>). However, as CNDD malformations occur in <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryos when NAD is deficient between E7.5 and E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>), NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis must occur elsewhere in the earlier-stage conceptus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis occurs during early organogenesis in the mouse yolk sac but not the placenta</title>
<p>In mammals, two likely candidate sites for extrahepatic NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis are the chorioallantoic placenta and the yolk sac. First, we re-analysed published mouse E9.5-14.5 placenta scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Marsh &amp; Blelloch, 2020</xref>) and found that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway gene expression was scattered between the maternal decidual stroma <italic>(Tdo2, Ido1, Ido2)</italic> or various immune cell populations <italic>(Afmid, Kmo, Kynu, Haao, Qprt, Nadsyn1)</italic> but not in the conceptus-derived trophoblasts that constitute the bulk of placental tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3</xref>). Additionally, we showed that HAAO enzyme activity was absent in the mouse placenta between E11.5 and E17.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>). Combined, these data indicate that the murine placenta does not conduct NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis.</p>
<p>Next, we quantified HAAO enzyme activity in the yolk sac between E11.5 and E17.5.

<p>These data, combined with the presence of HAAO activity and expression of all requisite pathway genes, confirmed that the yolk sac performs NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis from at least E10.5 onwards and therefore is the site of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway activity in the conceptus during organogenesis prior to the formation of a functional liver.</p>

<p>Having confirmed that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is performed in the yolk sac during early organogenesis, we next sought to understand how its activity is perturbed under conditions that cause CNDD. The data outlined above was generated using a diet rich in vitamin B3 which allows pregnant mice with a genetic block in the NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway to generate NAD via the Preiss-Handler and NAD Salvage Pathway and provide sufficient NAD precursors to their embryos for normal development. Due to higher metabolic rate and food intake per body weight in mice compared to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bachmanov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Holliday et al., 1967</xref>), to induce CNDD in mice, pregnant females need to be given L-tryptophan and/or vitamin B3 restricted diets, thereby limiting their ability to provide NAD precursors to the embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Szot et al., 2024</xref>). Given that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is established in the yolk sac by E10.5, we placed <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mothers on a NAD precursor-restricted diet specifically between E7.5 and E10.5. During this time window, L-tryptophan and vitamin B3 were removed from the chow and 1000 mg/L L-tryptophan and 3.5 mg/L nicotinic acid were supplemented in the drinking water (hereon referred to as NW3.5) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

<p>Embryos from mothers on the NW3.5 diet were assessed for the presence of congenital anomalies at E18.5. <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos were significantly smaller than their <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> littermates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, 86.7% of <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos were malformed, with 83.3% (25/30) of them presenting with multiple defects (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls4">Table S4</xref>). We identified malformations in organs and tissues previously associated with CNDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). Kidney defects (in 83.3% of <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos) included hypoplasia or agenesis, as well a cyst observed in one kidney. In addition, shortened tails (73.3%), various structural heart defects (27.7%), digit and limb anomalies (40%), and vertebrae and rib defects (63.3%) including rib underdevelopment, sternum defects, vertebral fusions, butterfly vertebrae, and hemivertebrae were found (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls4">Table S4</xref>). By contrast, the ability to perform NAD de <italic>novo</italic> synthesis prevented NAD deficiency in <italic>Haao</italic><sup>+/-</sup> littermate embryos; the only defect was a solitary case of heart ventricular septum defect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls4">Table S4</xref>).</p>
<p>These observations align with previous CNDD studies utilising <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mothers on a vitamin B3-restricted diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, they show that restricting dietary precursor supply for three days only, between E7.5 and E10.5, is sufficient to cause CNDD malformation.

<title>The yolk sac has reduced NAD availability under conditions that induce congenital malformations</title>
<p>Having established the importance of E10.5 as a key stage of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis, we next characterised how maternal dietary NAD precursor-restriction between E7.5 and E10.5 affected levels of NAD and related metabolites in the yolk sac at E10.5.

Therefore, yolk sac samples from the maternal NW15 dietary condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) were collected as appropriate controls for comparison to NW3.5 samples.</p>
<p>Due to their small size, 2-3 yolk sacs were pooled per sample for NAD metabolite quantification by UHPLC-MS/MS. The diet itself had profound effects on the yolk sac metabolites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls5">Table S5</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls6">6</xref>). Although L-tryptophan concentration in the drinking water was equivalent in both diets, its levels were lower in NW3.5 yolk sacs than NW15 (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>-<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">6</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The abundance of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis pathway metabolites both upstream (3HAA) and downstream (QA, NAMN, NAAD) of the <italic>Haao</italic> genetic block was significantly altered in <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> yolk sacs, respectively, relative to their NW15 counterparts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-E</xref>,<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>-<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).

<title>The NAD metabolome of the yolk sac and embryo correlate during early organogenesis</title>
<p>The yolk sac has a nutritional role in mammals as it uptakes and processes maternally derived macro-and micronutrients and transfers these to the embryo via their interconnected and expanding vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ornoy &amp; Miller, 2023</xref>).

Therefore, we explored the effects of impaired NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of the yolk sac on NAD metabolite levels of the embryo.</p>
<p>We analysed the embryos that corresponded to the metabolically analysed yolk sacs above. Whilst we had to pool 2-3 yolk sacs at E10.5 for analysis, embryos were sufficiently large to be analysed individually with the embryo corresponding to one of the pooled yolk sacs. Contrary to observations at E18.5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), <italic>Haao</italic> genotype had no effect on embryo weight within the same dietary condition, but embryos were significantly smaller on NW3.5 than NW15 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>).Consistent with the yolk sac samples, the diet had a marked effect on embryonic NAD status, with NAD+ and the waste metabolites 2PY and 4PY significantly reduced in NW3.5 embryos relative to the same <italic>Haao</italic> genotype on the NW15 diet (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>,<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">G</xref>,<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">H</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls5">Table S5</xref>).

Neither the placenta nor the embryonic liver synthesise NAD <italic>de novo</italic> at E10.5, suggesting that these metabolites either originate from the yolk sac, which is consistent with the connection of vitelline and embryonic vasculature, or that another embryonic cell type is synthesising NAD <italic>de novo</italic> at E10.5.</p>
<p>To test the latter option, we examined pathway gene expression in the embryo at E10.5 using the âmouse organogenesis cell atlasâ (MOCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). Except for some limited <italic>Afmid</italic> and <italic>Kynu</italic> expression predominantly in immune cell populations, the requisite genes were not expressed, including in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4</xref>). Therefore, intermediary metabolites were seemingly exchanged between the yolk sac and the embryo. To explore this, we calculated the Pearson correlation for all measured NAD-related metabolites between corresponding yolk sacs and embryos. Protein-normalised concentrations of those metabolites differentially abundant by <italic>Haao</italic> genotype (3HAA, NAMN, QA and NAAD) were significantly positively correlated between the embryo and yolk sac (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I-J</xref>). Overall, this suggests extensive metabolite exchange between conceptus tissues occurred.</p>
<p>Levels of NAD Salvage Pathway metabolites NAD+, NAM and NMN were also significantly positively correlated both within and between the yolk sac and embryo tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I,K</xref>). NAM is the main NAD precursor exported into circulation after NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis for use in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Given the limited availability of other usable alternative NAD precursors in mouse circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cuny et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), NAD levels of <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic>conceptuses likely depend on maternal plasma NAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cuny et al., 2023</xref>). Though their overall concentration markedly differed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls5">Table S5</xref>-<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">6</xref>), embryo and yolk sac NAM correlated strongly, irrespective of <italic>Haao</italic> genotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls5">Table S5</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>).

Given the lack of <italic>Tdo2</italic> and <italic>Ido2</italic> expression across all timepoints assessed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B,C</xref>), it appears the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine is either occurring in the yolk sac vascular smooth muscle, or in the placenta which is well known to perform this function in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Spinelli et al., 2018</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Broekhuizen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sedlmayr et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis pathway gene expression dynamics in humans parallel those in mice</title>
<p>Despite the structural differences between the mouse yolk sac and its human equivalent, the definitive secondary yolk sac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ross &amp; Boroviak, 2020</xref>), there is increasing evidence that many metabolic pathways are conserved in the endodermal cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cindrova-Davies et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Goh et al., 2023</xref>). Despite very different timescales of embryogenesis between the two species, the human yolk sac is present throughout organogenesis, the period when embryos are most susceptible to malformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alwan &amp; Chambers, 2015</xref>), after which it degenerates and is lost (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is among the conserved metabolic pathways between the two species. We examined expression of the pathway requisite genes by re-analysing bulk and scRNA-seq for the human yolk sac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cindrova-Davies et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Goh et al., 2023</xref>) and hepatocyte lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wesley et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>All NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway genes were expressed within at least one human yolk sac bulk RNA-seq sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cindrova-Davies et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), but there were significant differences in transcript levels between them. High <italic>TDO2</italic> expressing yolk sacs concurrently expressed <italic>NMNAT1</italic>, and to a lesser extent <italic>NADSYN1</italic> (3/9), but showed limited expression of the other requisite genes. Conversely, low <italic>TDO2</italic> expression yolk sacs more robustly expressed <italic>AFMID</italic>, <italic>KMO</italic>, <italic>KYNU</italic>, <italic>HAAO</italic>, <italic>QPRT</italic>, and <italic>NADSYN1</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>Re-analysis of published human scRNA-seq yolk sac data generated across organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Goh et al., 2023</xref>) showed that unlike in mice, requisite genes were expressed in multiple populations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). <italic>KMO</italic> expression was limited in the endoderm, with more robust expression observed in monocytes. Similarly, <italic>NADSYN1</italic> transcripts were more abundant in various immune cell populations. Yet, expression of <italic>TDO2</italic>, <italic>AFMID</italic>, <italic>KYNU</italic>, <italic>HAAO</italic> and <italic>QPRT</italic> was highest in the endodermal population (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). As in mice, the proportion of endoderm cells and overall expression of <italic>AFMID</italic>, <italic>KYNU</italic>, <italic>HAAO</italic> and <italic>QPRT</italic> declined during organogenesis, with expression highest at Carnegie Stage (CS) 11 (4 post-conceptional weeks (PCW)) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). <italic>TDO2</italic> expression, not observed in the mouse yolk sac endoderm, increased as organogenesis progressed.</p>
<p>By contrast, in the hepatocyte lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wesley et al., 2022</xref>), every NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis pathway gene was expressed by 5 PCW (hepatoblast (HB) stages 1 and 2) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>) and remained constant throughout foetal hepatocyte stages (FH) 1 (7-11 PCW) and 2 (12-17 PCW). Indeed, expression during embryonic stages was higher than in adult hepatocytes.</p>
<p>Therefore, requisite NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis gene expression dynamics in humans largely recapitulate findings in mice with the pathway primarily active in the yolk sac endodermal cells during early organogenesis. As expression declines in this population, it increases in the hepatocyte lineage. The only major difference between the species is whether NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway activity in the embryonic liver is established during or after organogenesis, respectively.</p>

<p>NAD deficiency during human and mouse development causes CNDD characterised by multiple congenital malformations and foetal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cuny et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dunwoodie et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mark &amp; Dunwoodie, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Szot et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Szot et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Szot et al., 2021</xref>). Human CNDD cases are characterised by biallelic pathogenic variants in either <italic>KYNU, HAAO</italic> or <italic>NADSYN1</italic>, all genes of the NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway. Mouse models of CNDD demonstrate that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis occurs in the conceptus and that this activity is required for normal embryonic development unless the mother provides sufficient vitamin B3 which bypasses NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). Here we report that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis occurs at two sites in the conceptus; first in the transient extra-embryonic yolk sac during organogenesis, and later in the embryonic liver once formed. It is noteworthy that the placenta lacks this activity. We present evidence in human gene expression data that the NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway also occurs initially in the secondary yolk sac and later in the embryonic liver. Until now, the site of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis in the mammalian conceptus was unknown. The necessity of this metabolic activity in the yolk sac highlights the importance of this transient tissue in mammalian embryogenesis.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>The murine yolk sac is capable of synthesising NAD de novo</title>
<p>The yolk sac has various important functions during embryogenesis, including the uptake and processing of macro-and micronutrients before and after the formation of a functional chorioallanotic placenta. It also facilitates the transport of maternal lipids, cholesterol and other metabolites to the embryo until the embryonic liver can take over this function, and it is involved in haematopoiesis and gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cindrova-Davies et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the yolk sac metabolises teratogenic substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Terlouw &amp; Bechter, 1992</xref>). Disruption of yolk sac function causes embryonic malformation phenotypes that overlap with CNDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brent &amp; Fawcett, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brent et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ornoy &amp; Miller, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>), underscoring the yolk sacâs crucial role for normal embryo development.</p>
<p>Our finding of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis activity as another metabolic process of the yolk sac is notable because it represents a multi-step pathway involving several sequential enzyme-catalysed processes. Our RNA-seq data analysis confirms that all requisite genes required for NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis from kynurenine are expressed in mouse yolk sac endoderm cells. <italic>Tdo2</italic>, required for the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine, is expressed in the adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells. Our HAAO enzymatic assays and metabolic analyses confirm the pathway is indeed functional. Therefore, this is the first demonstration of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis occurring in a tissue outside of the liver and kidney.</p>

<title>NAD deficiency in early organogenesis is sufficient to cause CNDD</title>
<p>We developed a refined CNDD model by which we modulated the maternal dietary NAD precursor supply during a 3-day window between E7.5 to E10.5 to be either low (NW3.5) or sufficient (NW15). Combined with maternal <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic>and paternal <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> genotype, the NW3.5 diet reproducibly generated <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos with malformations and unaffected <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> littermates. The <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos exhibited a spectrum of CNDD defects but no cleft palate seen in our previous study with a precursor restriction for five days between E7.5 and E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). The absence of palate defects is possibly because our current 3-day dietary precursor-restriction is too short to perturb the later occurring developmental processes of palate formation. This observation supports our hypothesis that the timing of NAD deficiency during organogenesis determines which organs/tissues are affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cuny et al., 2023</xref>), but more research is needed to fully characterise the onset and duration of embryonic NAD deficiency in dietary NAD precursor restriction mouse models.</p>
<p>Furthermore, diminished NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis in the yolk sac is responsible for the defects caused by our 3-day precursor restriction, because the embryonic liver has not yet formed. These data indicate that the timing of NAD deficiency determines whether tissues known to be susceptible to CNDD are affected or not, explaining why phenotypes are highly variable within the CNDD spectrum. But it is currently unknown whether a common underlying molecular mechanism exists that unifies these tissues with respect to their disrupted development in CNDD and whether organs/tissues that are seemingly unaffected by NAD deficiency are resistant to this mechanism. Further research into the molecular and cellular effects of altered NAD availability during organogenesis is required to better understand CNDD causation.</p>

<title>Maternal vitamin B3 early in pregnancy can overcome a genetic disruption of yolk sac NAD de novo synthesis</title>
<p>The most abundant NAD precursors in circulation are L-tryptophan, L-kynurenine, and NAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Flux experiments in mice confirmed that the liver converts L-tryptophan into NAM and excretes it into circulation to maintain NAD levels using the NAD Salvage Pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The CNDD models employed here use <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mothers, who along with their <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos, cannot use the L-tryptophan provided. These <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mothers and embryos are instead dependent on the vitamin B3 provided in the diet to synthesise NAD. The amount provided in the NW15 diet is sufficient to maintain conceptal NAD levels and normal embryonic development. By contrast, on the more vitamin B3 restricted NW3.5 diet, the ability to perform NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis using the L-tryptophan is ultimately what distinguishes the unaffected <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> embryos from their affected <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> littermates.</p>
<p>Indeed, <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> yolk sacs had lowered NAD levels under both diets, but the lowest NAD levels were found in NW3.5 <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> yolk sacs with the combination of genetic block of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis and dietary NAD precursor restriction. Similarly, embryonic NAD levels significantly declined under genetic block (<italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, NW15) or vitamin B3 restriction (<italic>Haao</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, NW3.5) alone relative to <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic>on the NW15 diet but these were still sufficient to maintain normal development. By contrast, those embryos that would go on to develop defects, <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic>embryos on NW3.5, had the lowest NAD levels at E10.5, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). This underscores that NAD deficiency in the embryo is linked to the inability of the yolk sac to perform NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis from maternally provided precursors.</p>
<p>Though unaffected by the <italic>Haao</italic> genetic block, the Preiss-Handler Pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) does not appear to play a role in yolk sac NAD synthesis given that the relevant metabolites NAMN and NAAD were undetectable or negligible in <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> yolk sacs regardless of diet. This leaves the NAD Salvage Pathway, and its circulatory precursor NAM, as the main source of NAD in <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> yolk sacs, as well as their corresponding embryos, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cuny et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Szot et al., 2024</xref>). Indeed, NAM levels were lower in <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> yolk sacs compared to <italic>Haao</italic><sup>+/-</sup> under the equivalent diet, and yolk sac NAM levels strongly correlated with embryonic NAM in corresponding embryos irrespective of condition. Though not significantly different, the increase in NAM levels in both <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tissues on the NW15 diet over the NW3.5 diet, and the corresponding significant increase in NAD levels themselves, likely originates from the additional provision of NAM from the mother under this diet. Correspondingly, levels of excretion products 2PY and 4PY, which are generated from NAM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) when its levels are in excess, were significantly lowered and close to zero in E10.5 <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos on NW3.5 relative to NW15 embryos, indicating a low to insufficient NAD status.</p>
<p>Besides the direct effect of embryonic NAD deficiency as the cause of CNDD, it is possible that the low NAD levels observed in the yolk sac under NW3.5 diet also interfere with other crucial yolk sac functions that are linked to NAD, such as ATP-dependent active transport of essential nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cindrova-Davies et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dutta &amp; Sinha, 2017</xref>) or NADP-dependent enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Di Pietro et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>), thereby further impacting normal embryonic development. Likely, it is a combination of both. Determining the specific mechanisms of CNDD causation requires further studies.</p>
<p>Together, our NAD metabolome findings confirm that if vitamin B3 supply is limited, yolk sac NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis becomes essential for maintaining NAD and normal embryo development. Further work with more refined analytical approaches, such as molecular flux analysis, could determine to which extent specific metabolites are exchanged between maternal circulation, the yolk sac, and the embryo.</p>

<title>Yolk sac functions, very likely including NAD de novo synthesis, are conserved in human</title>
<p>Human embryogenesis requires a transient primary (day 7 to day 12) and secondary yolk sac (day 13 to day 49), while the mouse has a single yolk sac (E7.5 to birth). While human yolk sac anatomy and the timing of its presence differs to mouse, many functions are conserved between the species. These functions include serum protein synthesis, micro- and macronutrient transportation, and certain metabolic pathways, and it is also the site of primary haematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cindrova-Davies et al., 2017</xref>). Using published datasets, we showed that the human yolk sac expresses all genes required for NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis during comparable embryonic stages as seen in the mouse. Therefore, it is plausible that yolk sac NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis activity in early pregnancy is of similar importance to maintain NAD status and allow normal embryonic development in humans.</p>
<p>Recent studies have established a link between human yolk sac disruption and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Specifically, a disruption of yolk sac size and shape in the first trimester was a predictor of foetal anomalies and pregnancy loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Detti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Marin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Suguna &amp; Sukanya, 2019</xref>). Maternal diabetes during pregnancy is also a known risk factor for congenital anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gabbay-Benziv et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies suggest that maternal diabetes not only affects the embryo but also the yolk sac due to hyperglycaemia, impairing nutrient transportation that drives embryopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Reece et al., 1994</xref>). Furthermore, diabetes has been implicated in perturbations of the NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allegri et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Oxenkrug, 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that disruption of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis, either maternally or in the yolk sac itself, may contribute to the formation of congenital malformations under diabetic conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is possible that the yolk sac NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis capability is also conserved in non-mammalian vertebrates. At least one step of the pathway, catalysed by AFMID (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), was found to be active in chicken egg yolk sac membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Seifert, 2017</xref>). Inhibition of this enzyme in the yolk sac resulted in lowered embryo NAD levels and some evidence of disrupted embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seifert &amp; Casida, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Seifert &amp; Casida, 1979</xref>). Whether the entire NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway is active in the avian yolk sac, or whether downstream enzymatic synthesis steps are performed elsewhere, is unclear and requires further research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3e">
<title>Outlook</title>
<p>We have shown in mice that NAD deficiency due to an impaired NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway can be prevented by supplementing pregnant mice with the NAD precursor vitamin B3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Szot et al., 2024</xref>). NAD deficiency between E7.5 and 10.5 recapitulates the majority of CNDD malformations, and under more severe conditions from E0.5 to 3.5 all embryos die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). These mouse stages span approximately days 1 to 17 of human development (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Therefore, in women at risk of becoming NAD deficient, it would be necessary to enter pregnancy with sufficient NAD by taking vitamin B3 prior to pregnancy. Further research on the molecular intricacies of CNDD causation, the timing, and the tissues and cells involved will aid understanding of the causes of birth defects and miscarriages more generally.</p>
<p>Here, we highlight the importance of the yolk sac in embryogenesis. Given the link between yolk sac changes and miscarriage are established, other environmental and/or genetic factors may perturb yolk sac function and drive congenital malformation and embryo loss. Whilst CNDD should be preventable through supplementation, other causes may not be and instead require other approaches. Further research is required to better understand the mechanisms of CNDD causation and of other causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes involving the yolk sac.</p>

<p>Mice were maintained on Breeder diet (Rat and Mouse Premium Breeder Diet, Gordons Specialty Feeds, Bargo, Australia) containing 90 mg/kg niacin and 3.7 g/kg L-tryptophan. Mice were set up for timed matings and pregnancy was confirmed by the presence of a vaginal copulation plug in the morning (defined as timepoint E0.5). Pregnant females were culled between E10.5 and E18.5 by cervical dislocation and embryos dissected. From each embryo, the following tissues were collected: whole visceral yolk sac, placenta (whole placenta at E10.5-11.5, Â½ placenta at E12.5-13.5, Â¼ placenta at E14.5-18.5), and whole embryonic liver. All embryonic tissues were weighed prior to being snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were genotyped for the <italic>Haao</italic> loss-of-functional allele as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>For experiments requiring limitation of the maternal dietary vitamin B3 supply during critical organogenesis stages, pregnant females were maintained on Breeder diet until E7.5.

<p>E18.5 embryos were phenotyped as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>) except for the identification of heart defects, for which micro-CT was used. Briefly, hearts were dissected from fixed (4% paraformaldehyde with 1% glutaraldehyde) E18.5 embryos and stained in 0.7% phosphotungstic acid + 30% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for a minimum of 7 days or until stained completely. Stained hearts were scanned using a Skyscan 1272 scanner (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, USA) at a resolution of 1092Ã1632 with a voltage of 80 kV and a 125 ÂµA current. The filter was set to Al 1 mm with a pixel size of 4.95 Âµm. Projection images were recorded with 2300 ms exposure time per projection with a rotation step of 0.4Â° between projections. The hearts were scanned at a total of 360Â° rotation. Acquired projections were reconstructed using Nrecon software (Bruker) with smoothing set to 3, ring artefact reduction to 19, and beam hardening to 10%. Reconstructed volumes were exported in .TIFF format and visually inspected for structural heart defects.</p>

<p>For the re-analysis of single cell datasets, single cell count matrixes were downloaded and assembled into Seurat objects using the Seurat R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Butler et al., 2018</xref>). Cells were filtered for percent of mitochondrial content, and clustering included detection of top variable genes, scaling, dimensionality reduction with PCA and construction of nearest neighbour graphs. Cell cluster identification was established from markers described in linked manuscript (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls8">Table S8</xref>). For the gastrulation atlas â single cell count objects were downloaded from the Bioconductor âMouseGastrulationDataâ resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Griffiths &amp; Lun, 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>One-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance of tissue sample gene expression levels at different developmental stages, of HAAO activity in tissues of different <italic>Haao</italic> genotypes, and of metabolite concentrations under different <italic>Haao</italic> genotypes and maternal diets. Significance of metabolite level differences was additionally analysed by one-way ANOVA with Tukeyâs multiple comparisons test. Studentâs t-test was used to determine statistical difference of <italic>Haao</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryo weights with the NW3.5 diet. Values are displayed as mean Â± standard deviation. All statistical analyses were performed with Prism (version 10; GraphPad Software). Metaboanalyst 5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pang et al., 2022</xref>) was used to generate PCA plots and heatmaps of the NAD metabolome data. Custom R scripts were used to generate heatmaps of gene expression data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigated the mechanism underlying Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder (CNDD) using a mouse model with loss of function of the HAAO enzyme which mediates a key step in the NAD de novo synthesis pathway. This study builds on the observation that the kynurenine pathway is required in the conceptus, as HAAO null embryos are sensitive to maternal deficiency of NAD precursors (vitamin B3) and tryptophan, and narrows the window of sensitivity to a 3 day period.</p>
<p>An important finding is that de novo NAD synthesis occurs in an extra-embryonic tissue, the visceral yolk sac, before the liver develops in the embryo. It is suggested that lack of this yolk sac activity leads to impaired NAD supply in the embryo leading to structural abnormalities found later in development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Previous studies show a requirement for HAOO activity for normal development of the embryos develop abnormalities under conditions of maternal vitamin B3 deficiency, indicating a requirement for NAD synthesis in the conceptus. Analysis of scRNA-seq datasets combined with metabolite analysis of yolk sac tissue shows that the NAD synthesis pathway is expressed and functional in the yolk sac from E10.5 onwards (prior to liver development).</p>
<p>HAOO enzyme assay enabled quantification of enzyme activity in relevant tissues including liver (from E12.5), embryo, placenta and yolk sac (from E11.5).</p>
<p>
Comprehensive metabolite analysis of the NAD synthesis pathway supports the predicted effects of HAOO knockout and provides analysis of yolk sac, placenta and embryo at a series of stages.</p>
<p>The dietary study (with lower vitamin B3 in maternal diet from E7.5-10.5) is an incremental addition to previous studies which imposed similar restrictions from E7.5-12.5. Nevertheless, this emphasises the importance of the synthesis pathway on the conceptus at stages before liver activity is prominent.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The current dietary study narrows the period when deficiency can cause malformations (analysed at E18.5), and altered metabolite profiles (eg, increased 3HAA, lower NAD) are detected in yolk sac and embryo at E10.5.</p>
<p>More importantly, there is still a question of whether in addition to the yolks sac, there is HAAO activity within the embryo itself has been assayed as early as E11.5, with minimal activity prior to E12.5 (when it is assayed in liver). These findings support the hypothesis that within the conceptus (embryo, chorioallantoic placenta and visceral yok sac) the embryo is unlikely to be the site of NAD synthesis prior to liver development.</p>
<p>Evidence for lack of function of the NAD synthesis pathway in the embryos itself from kynurenine at E7.5-10.5 comes from reanalysis of scRNA-seq. This suggests low or absent expression of HAAO in the embryo prior to E10.5 (corresponding to the period when the authors have demonstrated that de novo NAD synthesis in the conceptus is needed). The caveat to this conclusion is that additional analysis of RNA and/or protein expression in the embryos at E7.5-10.5 has not been performed to validate the scRNA-seq data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Disruption of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) de novo Synthesis Pathway, by which L-tryptophan is converted to NAD results in multi-organ malformations which collectively has been termed Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder (CNDD).</p>
<p>While NAD de novo synthesis is primarily active in the liver postnatally, the site of activity prior to and during organogenesis is unknown. However, mouse embryos are susceptible to CNDD between E7.5-E12.5, before the embryo has developed a functional liver. Therefore, NAD de novo synthesis is likely active in another cell or tissue during this time window of susceptibility.</p>
<p>The body of work presented in this paper continues the corresponding author's labs investigation of the cause and effects of NAD Deficiency and the primary goal was to determine the cell or tissue responsible for NAD de novo synthesis during early embryogenesis.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that visceral yolk sac endoderm is the source of NAD de novo synthesis, which is essential for mouse embryonic development, and furthermore that the dynamics of NAD synthesis are conserved in human equivalent cells and tissues, the perturbation of which results in CNDD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the primary findings regarding the source of NAD synthesis, the temporal requirement and conservation between rodent and human species is quite novel and important for our understanding of NAD synthesis and function and role in CNDD.</p>
<p>The authors used UHPLC-MS/MS to quantify NAD+ and NAD-related metabolites and showed convincingly that the NAD salvage pathway can compensate for the loss of NAD synthesis in Haao-/- embryos, then determined that Haao activity was present in the yolk sac prior to hepatic development identifying this organ as the site of de novo NAD synthesis. Dietary modulation between E7.5-10.5 was sufficient to induce CNDD phenotypes, narrowing the window of susceptibility, and then re-analysis of RNA-seq datasets suggested the endoderm was the cell source of NAD synthesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Page 4 and Table S4. The descriptors for malformations of organs such as the kidney and vertebrae are quite vague and uninformative. More specific details are required to convey the type and range of anomalies observed as a consequence of NAD deficiency.</p>
<p>Can the authors define whether the role for the NAD pathway in a couple of tissue or organ systems is the same. By this I mean is the molecular or cellular effect of NAD deficiency the same in the vertebrae and organs such as the kidney. What unifies the effects on these specific tissues and organs and are all tissues and organs affected. If some are not, can the authors explain why they escape the need for the NAD pathway.</p>
<p>Page 5 and Figure 6C. The expectation and conclusion for whether specific genes are expressed in particular cell types in scRNA-seq datasets depends on number of cells sequenced, the technology (methodology) used, the depth of sequencing and also the resolution of the analysis. It is therefore essential to perform secondary validation of the analysis of scRNA-seq data. At a minimum, the authors should perform in situ hybridization or immunostaining for Tdo2, Afmid, Kmo, Kynu, Haao, Qprt and Nadsyn1 or some combination thereof at multiple time points during early mouse embryogenesis to truly understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of expression and NAD synthesis.</p>
<p>Absolute functional proof of the yolk sac endoderm as being essential and required for NAD synthesis in the context of CNDD might require conditional deletion of Haao in the yolk sac versus embryo using appropriate Cre driver lines or in the absence of a conditional allele, could be performed by tetraploid embryo-ES cell complementation approaches. But temporal dietary intervention can also approximate the same thing by perturbing NAD synthesis then the yolk sac is the primary source versus when the liver becomes the primary source in the embryo.</p>
<p>In further revisions, the authors have added data to Supp Table 4 and Supplemental Figures 1 and 2</p>
<p>Although the authors did not perform in situ hybridization for some of the genes requested to define the critical cell type of expression, available scRNA-sequencing suggests the yolk sac endoderm are the only likely source of NAD synthesis prior to its synthesis in the liver. Absolute functional proof of the yolk sac endoderm as being essential and required for NAD synthesis in the context of CNDD still requires validation but nonetheless it seems likely given the absence of a functional liver in embryos prior to E12.5. The authors provided some additional data pertaining to the type of kidney and vertebral anomalies observed which makes this data more complete.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>A number of modifications/additions have been made to the text which help to clarify the background and details of the study and I feel have improved the study.</p>
<p>NAD deficiency induced using the dietary/Haao null model showed a window of susceptibility at E7.5-10.5. Further, HAAO enymze activity data has been added at E11.5 and the minimal HAAO activity in the embryo act E11.5 supports the hypothesis that the NAD synthesis pathway from kynurenine is not functional until the liver starts to develop.</p>
<p>The caveat to this is that absence of expression/activity in embryonic cells at E7.5-10/5 relies on previous scRNA-seq data. Both reviewers commented that analysis of RNA and/or protein expression at these stages (E7.5-10.5) would be necessary to rule this out, and would strongly support the conclusions regarding the necessity for yolk sac activity.</p>
<p>There are a number of antibodies for HAAO, KNYU etc so it is surprising if none of these are specific for the mouse proteins, while an alternative approach in situ hydridisation would also be possible.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have tested 2 anti-HAAO antibodies, 2 anti-KYNU antibodies and 1 anti-QPRT antibody on adult liver and various embryonic tissues.</p>
<p>Given that all tested antibodies only detected a specific band in tissues with very high expression and abundant target protein levels (adult liver), they were determined to be unsuitable to conclusively prove that these proteins of the NAD _de novo_synthesis pathway are absent in embryos prior to the development of a functional liver. They were also unsuitable for IHC experiments to determine which cell types (if any) have these proteins.</p>

<p>The current dietary study narrows the period when deficiency can cause malformations (analysed at E18.5), and altered metabolite profiles (eg, increased 3HAA, lower NAD) are detected in the yolk sac and embryo at E10.5. However, without analysis of embryos at later stages in this experiment it is not known how long is needed for NAD synthesis to be recovered - and therefore until when the period of exposure to insufficient NAD lasts. This information would inform the understanding of the developmental origin of the observed defects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our previous published work (Cuny et al 2023 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.049647">https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.049647</ext-link>) indicates that the timing of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis pathway precursor availability and consequently the timing of NAD deficiency during organogenesis drives which organs are affected in their development. Furthermore, experimental data of another project (manuscript submitted) shows that mouse embryos (from mothers on an NAD precursor restricted diet that induces CNDD) were NAD deficient at E9.5 and E11.5, but embryo NAD levels were fully recovered at E14.5 when compared to same-stage embryos from mothers on precursor-sufficient diet. This was observed irrespective of the embryosâ <italic>Haao</italic> genotype. In the current study, NAD precursor provision was only restricted until E10.5. Thus, we expect that our embryos phenotyped at E18.5 had recovered their NAD levels back to normal by E14.5 at the latest.  More research, beyond the scope of the current manuscript, is required to spatio-temporally link embryonic NAD deficiency to the occurrence of specific defect types and elucidate the mechanistic origin of the defects. To acknowledge this, we updated the respective Discussion paragraph on page 7 and added the following statement: âThis observation supports our hypothesis that the timing of NAD deficiency during organogenesis determines which organs/tissues are affected (Cuny et al., 2023), but more research is needed to fully characterise the onset and duration of embryonic NAD deficiency in dietary NAD precursor restriction mouse models.â</p>

<p>More importantly, there is still a question of whether in addition to the yolk sac, there is HAAO activity within the embryo itself prior to E12.5 (when it has first been assayed in the liver - Figure 1C). The prediction is that within the conceptus (embryo, chorioallantoic placenta, and visceral yok sac) the embryo is unlikely to be the site of NAD synthesis prior to liver development. Reanalysis of scRNA-seq (Fig 1B) shows expression of all the enzymes of the kynurenine pathway from E9.5 onwards. However, the expression of another available dataset at E10.5 (Fig S3) suggested that expression is 'negligible'. While the expression in Figure 1B, Figure S1 is weak this creates a lack of clarity about the possible expression of HAAO in the hepatocyte lineage, or especially elsewhere in the embryo prior to E10.5 (corresponding to the period when the authors have demonstrated that de novo NAD synthesis in the conceptus is needed). Given these questions, a direct analysis of RNA and/or protein expression in the embryos at E7.5-10.5 would be helpful.</p>

<p>We now have included additional data showing that whole embryos at E11.5 and embryos with their livers removed at E14.5 have negligible HAAO enzyme activity. The observed lack of HAAO activity in the embryo at E11.5 is consistent with the absence of a functional embryonic liver at that stage. Thus, it confirms that the embryo is dependent of extraembryonic tissues (the yolk sac) for NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis prior to E12.5. The additional datasets are now included in Supplementary Table S1 and as Supplementary Figure 2. The Results section on page 2 has been updated to refer to these datasets.</p>

<p>Can the authors define whether the role of the NAD pathway in a couple of tissue or organ systems is the same? By this I mean is the molecular or cellular effect of NAD deficiency is the same in the vertebrae and organs such as the kidney.

<p>This is a good comment, highlighting that further research, beyond the scope of this manuscript, is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of CNDD causation. We have expanded the Discussion paragraph âNAD deficiency in early organogenesis is sufficient to cause CNDDâ to indicate that while the timing of NAD deficiency during embryogenesis explains variability in phenotypes among the CNDD spectrum, it is unknown why other organs/tissues are seemingly not affected by NAD deficiency.</p>
<p>To answer the reviewerâs questions and elucidate the underlying cellular and molecular processes in individual organs affected by NAD deficiency, a multiomic approach is required. This is because NAD is involved in hundreds of molecular and cellular processes affecting gene expression, protein levels, metabolism, etc. For details of NAD functions that have relevance to embryogenesis, the reviewer may refer to our recent review article (Dunwoodie et al 2023 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2023.0349">https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2023.0349</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Page 5 and Figure 6C. The expectation and conclusion for whether specific genes are expressed in particular cell types in scRNA-seq datasets depend on the number of cells sequenced, the technology (methodology) used, the depth of sequencing, and also the resolution of the analysis. It is therefore essential to perform secondary validation of the analysis of scRNA-seq data. At a minimum, the authors should perform in situ hybridization or immunostaining for Tdo2, Afmid, Kmo, Kynu, Haao, Qprt, and Nadsyn1 or some combination thereof at multiple time points during early mouse embryogenesis to truly understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of expression and NAD synthesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have tested antibodies against HAAO, KYNU, and QPRT in adult mouse liver samples (the main site of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis) but these produced non-specific bands in western blotting experiments. Therefore, immunostaining studies on embryonic tissues were not feasible.</p>
<p>However, we agree that histological methods such as <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation would provide secondary validation of the exact cell types that express these genes. To acknowledge this, we have updated a sentence on page 5 referring to the data shown in Figure 6C as follows: âWhile histological methods such as <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation would be required to confirm the exact cell types expressing these genes, the available expression data indicates that the genes encoding those enzymes required to convert L-kynurenine to NAD (kynurenine pathway) are exclusively expressed in the yolk sac endoderm lineage from the onset of organogenesis (E8.0-8.5).â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Absolute functional proof of the yolk sac endoderm as being essential and required for NAD synthesis in the context of CNDD might require conditional deletion of Haao in the yolk sac versus embryo using appropriate Cre driver lines or in the absence of a conditional allele, could be performed by tetraploid embryo-ES cell complementation approaches. But temporal dietary intervention can also approximate the same thing by perturbing NAD synthesis Shen the yolk sac is the primary source versus when the liver becomes the primary source in the embryo.</p>

<p>Reviewer 1 has made a similar comment about confirming that indeed NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis activity is limited to extraembryonic tissues (=yolk sacs) and absent in the embryo prior to development of an embryonic liver. We now have included additional data showing that whole embryos at E11.5 and embryos with their livers removed at E14.5 have negligible HAAO enzyme activity. The observed lack of HAAO activity in the embryo at E11.5 is consistent with the absence of a functional embryonic liver at that stage. We think this provides enough proof that the embryo is dependent of extraembryonic tissues (the yolk sac) for NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis prior to E12.5. The additional datasets are now included in Supplementary Table S1 and as Supplementary Figure 2. The Results section on page 2 has been updated to refer to these data.</p>

<p>(1) Introduction (page 1) introduces mouse models with defects in the kynurenine pathway &quot;confirming that NAD de novo synthesis is required during embryogenesis ...&quot;. This requirement is revealed by the imposition of maternal dietary deficiency and more detail (or a more clear link to the following sentences) here would help the reader who is not familiar with the previous papers using the HAAO mice and dietary modulation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated this paragraph in the Introduction to better indicate that the requirement of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis for embryogenesis was confirmed in mouse models by modulating the maternal dietary NAD precursor provision during pregnancy.</p>

<p>(2) Discussion - throughout the introduction and results the authors refer to the NAD de novo synthesis pathway, with the study focussing on the effects of HAAO loss of function. Data implies that the kynurenine pathway is active in the yolk sac but whether de novo synthesis from L-tryptophan occurs has not been addressed. The first sub-heading of the discussion could be more accurate referring to the kynurenine pathway, or synthesis from kynurenine.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that our manuscript needed to make better distinction between NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis starting from kynurenine and starting from tryptophan. We removed âfrom Ltryptophanâ from the sub-heading in the Discussion and clarified in this paragraph which genes are required to convert tryptophan to kynurenine and which genes to convert kynurenine to NAD. We also updated two Results paragraphs (page 2, 2nd paragraph; page 5, 5th paragraph) to improve clarity.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that our statement in the Discussion âthis is the first demonstration of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis occurring in a tissue outside of the liver and kidney.â is valid because vascular smooth muscle cells express <italic>Tdo2</italic> and in combination with the other requisite genes expressed in endoderm cells, the yolk sac has the capability to synthesise NAD <italic>de novo</italic> from L-tryptophan.</p>

<p>(3) Outlook - While this section is designed to be looking ahead to the potential implications of the work, the last section on gene therapy of the yolk sac seems far removed from the paper content and highly speculative. I feel this could detract from the main points of the study and could be removed.</p>

<p>We have updated the Outlook paragraph and shortened the final part to âFurther research is required to better understand the mechanisms of CNDD causation and of other causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes involving the yolk sac.â</p>
