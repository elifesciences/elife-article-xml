<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ciliated protists (ciliates) are a large and diverse group of microbial eukaryotes that are important to a wide range of biological studies and applications. Relative to most other eukaryotes, the nuclear genomes of many ciliates possess three interesting features. First, ciliates often have two types of nuclei. Their diploid micronucleus (MIC) carries the cell germline, the genetic material of which is inherited via sexual reproduction and meiosis. The polyploid macronucleus (MAC) or vegetative nucleus provides nuclear RNA for vegetative growth. MAC is generated from the MIC by massive amplification, editing and rearrangement of the genome (see reviews in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)). Second, ciliate meiosis is remarkable relative to that of other studied sexual eukaryotes. A hallmark of meiosis is programmed initiation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by Spo11, a meiosis-specific topoisomerase VII subunit A endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Meiotic DSBs are then repaired in a homology-dependent manner via searching, pairing (or synapsis) and exchange of homologous parental chromosomes, leading to the formation of interhomolog crossovers (COs). Ultimately, the resulting recombinant chromosomes equally segregate into haploid gametes. To facilitate pairing and recombination between homologous chromosomes, telomeres attach to the nuclear envelope (NE) at the beginning of meiosis and then cluster to one side of the NE to form a transient structure called the “bouquet”. In many sexual eukaryotes, homology pairing usually culminates in the synaptonemal complex (SC), a zipper-like proteinaceous structure that appears to regulate CO formation. The SC behaves like a liquid crystal, tightly connecting paired homologous chromosomes from telomere to telomere and also incorporating lateral component loops in interstitial chromosome segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Most studied ciliates lack SC or only have degenerate SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, the most intensively studied ciliate, meiotic MICs undergo extreme elongation (by ∼50-fold) and form proteinaceous condensates called “crescents”. Within these elongated crescents, telomeres and centromeres of all meiotic chromosomes are rearranged at opposing ends in a stretched bouquet-like manner. Meiotic pairing and recombination take place within the crescents (see review in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)). It has been reported that ATR1 (<underline>A</underline>taxia <underline>T</underline>elangiectasia <underline>M</underline>utated 1), an evolutionarily conserved DNA damage senor protein kinase, senses Spo11-induced DSBs and triggers the elongation of MICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Meiosis-specific CYC2 and CYC17 cyclins, as well as cyclin-dependent kinase CDK3, are required to initiate meiosis and for crescent assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). CYC2/CDK2 promotes bouquet formation in MIC via controlling microtubule-directed elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) and also controls gene expression of proteins involved in DSB formation (SPO11), DNA repair (COM1, EXO1, DMC1), and CO formation (HOP2, MND1, MSH4, MSH5, ZPH3, BIM1, and BIM2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The DPL2/E2fl1 complex, a meiosis-specific transcription factor, promotes transcriptional induction of DNA repair proteins and chromosome-associated structural proteins, including MRE11, COM1, EXO1, RAD50, RAD51, SMC1, SMC2, SMC3, SMC4, REC8, ESP1, and CNA1, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying crescent assembly and disassembly remain poorly understood. Third, many ciliates reassign their standard stop codons into amino acids (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For example, several ciliates possess two noncanonical nuclear genetic codes (UAA<sup>Q</sup> and UAG<sup>Q</sup>), in which the UAA and UAG stop codons have been reassigned to glutamine (Q) so that UGA is the sole functional stop codon in many ciliates, including <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic>, <italic>Paramecium bursaria</italic>, <italic>Oxytricha trifallax, Stylonychia lemnae</italic>, <italic>Pseudocohnilembus persalinus</italic>, <italic>Aristerostoma</italic> sp<italic>., Favella ehrenbergii, Pseudokeronopsis</italic> spp., <italic>Strombidium inclinatum,</italic> and <italic>Uronema</italic> spp. Both the UAA and UAG stop codons are reassigned to tyrosine (Y) in <italic>Favella ehrenbergii</italic>, whereas the UGA stop codon is translated to tryptophan (W) or cysteine (C) in <italic>Blepharisma japonicum</italic> and <italic>Euplotes focardii,</italic> respectively. In contrast, <italic>Stentor coeruleus, Climacostomum virens, Litonotus pictus</italic> and <italic>Protocruzia adherens</italic> utilize the universal set of genetic codons. Notably, <italic>Condylostoma magnum</italic> and <italic>Parduzcia</italic> sp. have no dedicated genetic codes. Their UAA, UAG and UGA codons can be stop codons or translated to Q, C and W, respectively. Translation termination at the mRNA 3′ end occurs in a context-dependent manner to distinguish stop from sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Although it has been reported previously that Q is used more frequently in <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> and <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> than in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), many important questions regarding stop codon reassignment in ciliates remain unresolved. For instance, fundamentally, it is unclear if Q, Y, W and C are used more frequently in other ciliates in which stop codons are reassigned. Moreover, whether there are common or specific structural motif(s) in proteins arising from stop codon reassignment is not clear. Furthermore, what are the structural and functional impacts of such genome-wide alterations? Since high-quality transcriptomic and gene annotation data are now available for many ciliate and non-ciliate eukaryotes and genetic codons have also been properly defined for a wide variety of them (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we were confident we could provide important insights into these interesting topics.</p>
<p>In this report, first we present an unexpected result that the Q-rich motifs of several <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> proteins possess autonomous protein expression-enhancing (PEE) activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), including four serine(S)/threonine(T)-Q cluster domains (SCDs) and three prion-forming domains (PFDs) with polyglutamine (polyQ) or polyglutamine/asparagine (polyQ/N) tracts. Notably, all seven of these Q- or Q/N-rich motifs display high Q, S, T, and/or N contents. A common feature of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) is high content of Q, N, S, T, proline (P), glycine (G) and charged amino acids. Rather than adopting stable secondary and/or tertiary structures, IDRs are structurally flexible polypeptides in their native states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Next, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses on all proteins having Q-rich motifs (i.e., SCDs, polyQ and polyQ/N), as well as those with the homorepeat (polyX) motifs of other amino acid residues, in 20 non-ciliate and 17 ciliate species. Our results support that Q-rich motifs are not only massively expanded in the 10 ciliate species we examined with reassigned TAA<sup>Q</sup> and TAG<sup>Q</sup> codons, but they also prevail in proteins involved in several species-specific or even phylum-specific biological processes.</p>

<p>Rad51-NTD is a SCD because it has three SQ motifs (S<sup>2</sup>Q, S<sup>12</sup>Q and S<sup>30</sup>Q) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). The S/T-Q motifs, comprising S or T followed by Q, are the target sites of DNA damage senor protein kinases, i.e., ATM, ATR (<underline>AT</underline>M and <underline>R</underline>AD3-related) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Mec1 (<underline>M</underline>itotic <underline>E</underline>ntry <underline>C</underline>heckpoint 1) and Tel1 (<underline>TEL</underline>omere maintenance 1) are the budding yeast homologs of mammalian ATR and ATM, respectively. Budding yeast lacks a DNA-PK homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). We showed that the three SQ motifs of Rad51-NTD are phosphorylated by Mec1 and Tel1 during vegetative growth and meiosis. Mec1/Tel1-dependent NTD phosphorylation antagonizes Rad51 degradation via the proteasomal pathway, increasing the half-life of Rad51 from ∼30 min to ≥180 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). This outcome is consistent with the notion that Mec1 exhibits an essential function in regulating protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>A unifying definition of an SCD is possession of three or more S/T-Q sites within a stretch of ≤50 or ≤100 amino acids in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). One of the best-understood mechanisms of SCD phosphorylation involves their association with binding partners hosting a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. For example, Mec1 and Tel1 phosphorylate the SCD1 of Rad53 (residues 1-29) and the SCD of Hop1 (residues 258-324), respectively, specifically recruiting and activating their downstream DNA damage checkpoint kinases Dun1 and Mek1 during vegetative growth and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Sml1, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, is involved in regulating Rad53 and the production of deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) during DNA replication and the DNA damage response (DDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). The Sml1 protein in the SK1 strain harbors three S/T-Q motifs (S<sup>4</sup>Q, S<sup>14</sup>Q and T<sup>47</sup>Q), whereas that in the S288c strain only has one SQ motif (S<sup>4</sup>Q, C<sup>14</sup>Q and T<sup>47</sup>M). Here, we further show that yeast Rad53-SCD1, Hop1-SCD, Sml1-NTD<sup>1–</sup> <sup>50</sup> (residues 1–50) and Sml1-NTD<sup>1–27</sup> (residues 1–27) also exhibit PEE activities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>The Q-rich motifs of three yeast prion-causing proteins also exhibit PEE activities</title>
<p>Since Sml1-NTD<sup>1–27</sup> in the SK1 strain only harbors two S/T-Q motifs (S<sup>4</sup>Q and S<sup>14</sup>Q), the number of S/T-Q motifs alone could not account for PEE activity. Notably, Rad51-NTD, Rad53-SCD1, Hop1-SCD, Sml1-NTD<sup>1-27</sup> and Sml1-NTD<sup>1-50</sup> all represent Q- or Q/N-rich motifs. Rad51-NTD contains 9 serines (S), 2 threonines (T), 9 glutamines (Q) and 4 asparagines (N). Rad53-SCD1 has 2S, 4T, 7Q and 1N. Hop1-SCD has 6S, 6T, 8Q and 9N. Sml1-NTD<sup>1–27</sup> and Sml1-NTD<sup>1–50</sup> in SK1 possess 3S and 5S, 2T and 3T, 6Q and 7Q, as well as 2N and 3N, respectively.</p>

PolyQ and polyQ/N tracts are the most common homorepeats acting as structurally flexible motifs for protein aggregation or protein–protein interactions in many eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). PolyN is not as structurally flexible as polyQ due to a stronger propensity for β-turn formation in polyN than in polyQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). In so-called polyQ-associated diseases, long Q-, Q/N- or even N-rich motifs result in an excess of interactions, resulting in malfunctional or pathogenic protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Many prion-causing proteins contain Q/N-rich prion forming domains (PFDs). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the best-characterized prion-causing proteins are Sup35 (or translation terminator eRF35), New1 ([<italic>NU+</italic>] prion formation protein 1), Ure2 (uridosuccinate transport 2), Rnq1 (rich in N and Q 1) and Swi1 (switching deficient 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). We found that the Q/N-rich NTDs of Sup35, Ure2 and New1 also display PEE activities, i.e., the prion nucleation domain (PND; residues 1-39) of Sup35, the Ure2 prion domain (UPD) (residues 1-91) and the New1 prion domain (NPD; residue 1-146) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Sup35-PND containing 3S, 12Q, 18N and an S<sup>17</sup>Q motif exerts critical functions in promoting [<italic>PSI+</italic>] prion nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). The UPD of the Ure2 nitrogen catabolite repression transcriptional regulator is the basis of the prion [<italic>URE3<sup>+</sup></italic>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). The UPD is critical for Ure2’s function <italic>in vivo</italic> because its removal in the corresponding Ure2-ΔUPD mutants elicits reduced protein stability and steady-state protein levels (but not transcript levels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Ure2-UPD contains 10S, 5T, 10Q and 33N, adopting a completely disordered structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). New1 is a non-essential ATP-binding cassette type F protein that fine-tunes the efficiency of translation termination or ribosome recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). The NPD of New1 supports [<italic>NU<sup>+</sup></italic>] and is susceptible to [<italic>PSI+</italic>] prion induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). New1-NPD contains 19S, 8T, 14Q, 28N and an S<sup>145</sup>Q motif. Here, we applied the LacZ-NVH fusion protein approach to show that N-terminal fusion of Sup35-PND, Ure2-UPD or New1-NPD to LacZ-NVH all increased steady-state protein levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and β-galactosidase activities <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>The PEE function is not affected by the quaternary structures of target proteins</title>
<p>We found that N-terminal fusion of Rad53-SCD1 to four different NVH-tagged target proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) or Rad51-ΔN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) all resulted in higher protein production <italic>in vivo</italic>. LacZ is a tetrameric protein, glutathione S-transferase (GST) is dimeric, and non-dimerizing GST (GSTnd) and GFP are monomeric proteins. As reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), removal of the NTD from Rad51 reduced by ∼97% the protein levels of corresponding Rad51-ΔN proteins relative to wild type (WT) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), leading to lower resistance to the DNA damage agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, the autonomous PEE function of Rad51-NTD could be fully rescued in Rad51-ΔN by N-terminal fusion of Rad53-SCD1, Rad53-SCD1-5STA (all five S/T-Q motifs changed to AQs) or Sup35-PND, respectively. Compared to wild-type yeast cells, the three corresponding yeast mutants (<italic>rad51-SCD1-rad51-</italic>Δ<italic>N</italic>, <italic>rad51-SCD1-5STA-rad51-</italic>Δ<italic>N</italic> and <italic>sup35-PND-rad51-</italic>Δ<italic>N</italic>) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) not only produced similar steady-state levels of Rad51- ΔN fusion proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), but they also exhibited high MMS resistance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). During homology directed repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), Rad51 polymerizes into helical filaments on DSB-associated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and then promotes homologous search and strand exchange of the ssDNA-protein filament with a second double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). We inferred that the catalytic activity of Rad51- ΔN in HDRR is likely similar to that of wild-type Rad51 because the weak MMS-resistant phenotype of <italic>rad51</italic>-Δ<italic>N</italic> is mainly due to very low steady-state levels of Rad51-ΔN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Accordingly, we concluded that the quaternary structures of the target proteins (i.e., GFP, GSTnd, GST, LacZ and Rad51-ΔN) are irrelevant to the autonomous PEE activity.</p>

<title>The protein quality control system moderately regulates autonomous PEE activities</title>
<p>The protein quality control system is a mechanism by which cells monitor proteins to ensure that they are appropriately folded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). In the current study, we compared the protein steady-state levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and β-galactosidase activities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>) of Rad51-NTD-LacZ-NVH and LacZ-NVH in WT, <italic>hsp104</italic>Δ, <italic>new1</italic>Δ, <italic>doa1</italic>Δ, <italic>doa4</italic>Δ, <italic>san1</italic>Δ and <italic>oaz1</italic>Δ yeast cell lines. The protein products encoded by each of the six genes deleted from the latter mutant lines are all functionally relevant to protein homeostasis or prion propagation. Hsp104 is a heat-shock protein with disaggregase activities that disrupts protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). New1 is a translation factor that fine-tunes ribosome recycling and the efficiency of translation termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Doa1 (also called Ufd3) is an ubiquitin- and Cdc48-binding protein with a role in ubiquitin homeostasis and/or protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). The <italic>doa1</italic>Δ mutant exhibits diminished formation of [<italic>PSI+</italic>] prion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Doa4 is a deubiquitinating enzyme required for recycling ubiquitin from proteasome-bound ubiquitinated intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). The <italic>doa4</italic>Δ mutant exhibits increased sensitivity to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). San1 is an ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets highly aggregation-prone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Oaz1 (<underline>o</underline>rnithine decarboxylase <underline>a</underline>nti<underline>z</underline>yme) stimulates ubiquitin-independent degradation of Spe1 ornithine decarboxylase by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). We found that the β-galactosidase activities of Rad51-NTD-LacZ-NVH in WT and all six of the gene-knockout strains we examined were 10-29-fold higher than those of LacZ-NVH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Intriguingly, the β-galactosidase activities of LacZ-NVH in the six gene-knockout mutants are all lower (30-70%) than those in WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the β-galactosidase activities of Rad51-NTD-LacZ-NVH in WT are either slightly higher or lower than those in the six null mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). These results indicate that addition of Rad51-NTD to LacZ-NVH can abrogate the protein homeostasis defects caused by loss of each of these six genes. For example, Rad51-NTD might compensate for the ribosome assembly and translation defects in <italic>new1</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), as well as the cycloheximide-hypersensitive phenotype displayed by <italic>doa4</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Accordingly, the β-galactosidase activities of Rad51-NTD-LacZ-NVH in the <italic>new1</italic>Δ and <italic>doa4</italic>Δ lines are higher than those in the WT, respectively. In contrast, the β-galactosidase activities of LacZ-NVH in the <italic>new1</italic>Δ and <italic>doa4</italic>Δ lines are lower, respectively, than those of WT. Finally, although the <italic>doa1</italic>Δ mutant is defective in [<italic>PSI+</italic>] prion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), the steady-state levels of Rad51-NTD-LacZ-NVH in the <italic>doa1</italic>Δ line are also slightly higher than those in WT.</p>

<title>The relationship between PEE function, amino acid contents and structural flexibility</title>
<p>Using three Q-rich motifs (i.e., Rad51-NTD, Rad53-SCD1 and Sup35-NPD) as examples, we observed a very strong positive relationship between STQ and STQN amino acid percentages and β-galactosidase activities (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). These results are consistent with the notion that, due to high STQ or STQN content, SCDs or Q-rich motifs are intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in their native states, rather than adopting stable secondary and/or tertiary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). A common feature of IDRs is their high content of S, T, Q, N, proline (P), glycine (G) and charged amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>

<p>It is important to note that the threshold of STQ or STQN content varies in the three cases presented herein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, the percentage of STQ or STQN residues is not likely the only factor contributing to protein expression levels. Since G, P and glutamate (E) are enriched by &gt;10% in Rad51-NTD, Rad53-SCD1 and Sup35-NPD, these three amino acids may also contribute to the PEE activities and structural flexibility of these three Q-rich motifs.</p>
<p>Functionally, IDRs are key components of subcellular machineries and signaling pathways because they have the potential to associate with many partners due to their ability to adopt multiple metastable conformations. Many IDRs are regulated by alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, and some are involved in the formation of various membraneless organelles or proteinaceous condensates via intracellular liquid-liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). Since IDRs can endow proteins with structural and functional plasticity, we hypothesized that Q-rich motifs (e.g., SCD, polyQ and polyQ/N) represent useful toolkits for creating new diversity during protein evolution.</p>

<p>It was reported previously that SCDs are overrepresented in the yeast and human proteomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>), and that polyX prevalence differs among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>).

Among the 6050 proteins in the most recently modified <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> reference proteome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000002311">https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000002311</ext-link>), we identified 1016 SCD-hosting proteins (Dataset DS4), including all 436 SCD-harboring proteins previously revealed by ScanProsite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). ScanProsite is a publicly available database of protein families, domains and motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>).</p>
<p>The percentages of polyQ proteins in the near-complete proteomes of the 21 non-ciliate species and 6 ciliates range from 0.6% (<italic>S. coeruleus</italic>), 2.1% (<italic>P. falciparum</italic>), 4.1% (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), 6.5% (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>), 21.8% (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>), 24.5% (<italic>D. discoideum</italic>) to a maximum of 47.2% in <italic>Pseudocohnilembus persalinus</italic>. Those of polyQ/N proteins range from 9.5% in <italic>T. camphoratus</italic>, 11.9% in <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, 28.2% in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, 62.5% in <italic>D discoideum</italic>, 63.7% in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, to a maximum of 79.4% in <italic>P. persalinus</italic>.

<p>Notably, average usage of a given amino acid (X) is not always positively correlated with the percentages of polyX proteins in different species. For instance, proteome-wide Q usages are 2.8% in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, 3.7% in <italic>S. coeruleus</italic>, 5.4% in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and 10.9% in <italic>P. persalinus.</italic> The proteome-wide usage of F in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (4.4%) is not significantly different from that of other species, ranging from 2.0% in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> to 5.2% in <italic>T. thermophila</italic>. Average usages of P (7.7%), A (17.1%) and G (11.5%) in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, as well as the average usages of N (14.4%) and Y (5.7%) in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, are higher than those in 6 ciliate and the 20 other non-ciliate species, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> and Dataset DS1). These results indicate that distinct evolutionary strategies have evolved to enable specific polyX motifs to accumulate in different species.</p>
<p>Next, we performed comparative GO enrichment analyses using information on the functions of genes provided by GO knowledgebase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneontology.org">http://geneontology.org</ext-link>). Our results provide two intriguing insights into evolutionary biology. First, SCDs (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and polyQ/N motifs (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) exist in many proteins involved in various evolutionarily conserved processes (Dataset DS4-DS29). It was reported previously that many SCD proteins in yeast and human are neither targets of ATR or ATM nor are related to pathways of functions relevant to the DDR or DNA replication, including telophase, cytokinesis, protein transport, endocytosis and cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Second, SCDs (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) and polyQ/N motifs (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) are overrepresented in the specialized biological processes of different species. Of particular note is an overrepresentation of conserved SCD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>) and polyQ/N proteins (this study) in pathways related to vertebrate neural development and neurodegeneration. For instance, human CTTNBP2 (1663 amino acid residues) is a neuron-specific F-actin associated SCD-protein that is involved in the formation and maintenance of dendritic spines and it is associated with autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). Human CTTNBP2 possesses ten S/T-Q motifs (T<sup>466</sup>Q, T<sup>493</sup>Q, S<sup>1580</sup>Q, S<sup>553</sup>Q, S<sup>634</sup>Q, S<sup>994</sup>Q, S<sup>1392</sup>Q, S<sup>1580</sup>Q, T<sup>1621</sup>Q and S<sup>1624</sup>Q). Mouse CTTNBP2 has 630 amino acid residues, four S/T-Q motifs (S<sup>419</sup>Q, T<sup>463</sup>Q, S<sup>550</sup>Q, S<sup>624</sup>Q), and it shares high amino acid identity to the N-terminus (1-640 amino acid residues) of human CTTNBP2. Using IUPred2A (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://iupred2a.elte.hu/plot_new">https://iupred2a.elte.hu/plot_new</ext-link>), a web-server for identifying disordered protein regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>), we found that both human CTTNBP2 (220-1633 residues) and mouse CTTNBP2 (220-630 residues) are Q/N-rich IDRs with high percentages of S, T, Q, N, G, P, R and K. We reported recently that mouse CTTNBP2 forms self-assembled condensates through its C-terminal IDR and it facilitates co-condensation of an abundant excitatory postsynaptic scaffold protein SHANK3 at dendritic spines in a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>). Our results also reveal that SCDs, as well as polyQ, polyQ/N, polyS and polyP tracts, are overrepresented in the nervous system of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Tables 5</xref> and <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The numbers (and percentages) of SCD-, polyQ-, polyQ/N-, polyS- and polyP-containing proteins, respectively, in different nerve-related biological processes are: regulation of axonogenesis [101 (87%), 93 (80%), 98 (84%), 103 (89%) and 100 (86%)], neuron development [97 (80%), 99 (82%), 102 (84%), 103 (85%) and 88 (73%)], axon guidance [199 (53%), 209 (56%), 278 (74%), 280 (75%), and 186 (50%)], mushroom body development [140 (66%), 142 (67%), 167 (79%), 161 (76%) and 109 (51%)], dendritic morphogenesis [96 (53%), 95 (52%), 132 (73%), 131 (72%) and 61 (34%)], and peripheral nervous system development [94 (73%), 100 (78%), 111 (86%), 106 (82%) and 90 (70%)] (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> and Dataset DS22).</p>

<p>We also found SCDs, polyQ/N tracts and a few other structurally flexible polyX tracts that are overrepresented in specialized biological processes of various species. First, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, 92 proteins are involved in RNA-mediated transposition (GO ID: 32197), among which 82 and 88 are SCD and polyQ/N proteins, respectively (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> and Dataset DS4). The 82 SCD (also polyQ/N) proteins are all structural components of the virus-like particles (VLPs), which form the shell that encapsulates the Ty1 (Transposon-yeast 1) and Ty2 retrotransposon dimeric RNA genomes. These capsid proteins also possess nucleocapsid-like chaperone activity, promoting primer tRNA(i)-Met annealing to the multipartite primer-binding site, dimerization of Ty RNA, and initiation of reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>). Another example is the developmental and sexual cycles of <italic>D discoideum</italic>, which are induced by starvation and/or other stimuli. During the developmental cycle, these amoebae secrete small molecules (e.g., cyclic adenosine monophosphate or cAMP) to induce intercellular communication (chemotaxis), ultimately resulting in aggregation of hundreds to hundreds of thousands of amoebae into multicellular fruiting bodies (sorocarps). These sorocaps consist of ∼80% asexual spores and ∼20% dead stalk cells. During the sexual cycle, two amoebae of complementary mating types fuse to form a zygote. The zygote and the surrounding amoebae form a thick multilayered structure called the macrocyst, representing the site of meiosis and interhomolog DNA recombination, enabling the generation of hundreds of recombinant haploid amoebae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>). We found that SCDs (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) and polyQ/N tracts (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) are overrepresented in many proteins involved in a diversity of biological processes during the <italic>D. discoideum</italic> development and sexual cycles, including chemotaxis to cAMP, amoebae aggregation, sorocarp morphogenesis, sorocarp development, and sexual reproduction (Dataset DS14). A third example is the human malaria-causing parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Infection in humans begins upon being bitten by an infected female <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito. After entering the human bloodstream, sporozoites from the mosquito’s salivary gland quickly invade hepatocytes and undergo asexual multiplication, leading to tens of thousands of merozoites bursting from the liver cells. These merozoites then invade red blood cells (erythrocytes) and undergo an additional round of multiplication. The mature merozoites can change the surface properties of infected red blood cells, causing them to stick to blood vessels (a process called cytoadherence), resulting in obstructed microcirculation and multiple organ dysfunction. The success of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in establishing persistent infections is mainly attributable to immune evasion through antigenic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>). Our GO enrichment results reveal that SCDs, as well as polyQ/N, polyN, polyS, polyT, polyD, polyG and polyK tracts, are overrepresented in many of these specialized infection processes, including antigen variation, modulation of host erythrocyte aggregation, cytoadherence to the microvasculature, and cell-cell adhesion (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> and Dataset DS15). For example, the numbers of proteins involved in antigen variation are 38 (SCDs), 82 (polyQ/N), 37 (polyN), 51 (polyS), 49 (polyT), 42 (polP), 69 (polyG), 40 (polyD), 68 (polyE) and 144 (polyK), respectively. These examples are consistent with the notion that S, T, Q, N, P, G and charged amino acids are used more frequently in IDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>

<title>Massive expansion of Q-rich motifs in ciliates having two reassigned stop codons (UAA<sup>Q</sup> and UAG<sup>Q</sup>)</title>
<p>The most striking finding in our study is that, due to their usage of the two noncanonical codons (UAA<sup>Q</sup> and UAG<sup>Q</sup>), Q (but not S, T or N) is used more frequently in five free-moving unicellular ciliates (<italic>T. thermophila</italic>, <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic>, <italic>O. trifallax</italic>, <italic>S. lemnae</italic> and <italic>P. persalinus</italic>) than in the sessile ciliate <italic>S. coeruleus</italic> or in any of the 21 non-ciliate species we examined herein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref> and Dataset DS1). We refer hereafter to these five free-moving unicellular ciliates as ‘group I’ ciliates. The proteome-wide Q and N contents, as well as the percentages of SCD, polyQ, polyQ/N and polyN proteins, respectively, in the different ciliates are: <italic>T. thermophila</italic> (9.6%, 9.2%, 50.8%, 33.0%, 72.6%, 25.2%), <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic> (9.1%, 6.9%, 41.1%, 27.1%, 62.9% and 8.7%), <italic>O. trifallax</italic> (9.0%, 7.9%, 58.0%, 36.7%, 72.3%, 22.0%), <italic>S. lemnae</italic> (8.4%, 7.5%, 49.2%, 28,1%, 65.3%, 17.4%), <italic>P. persalinus</italic> (10.9%, 9.8%, 47.7%, 47.2%, 79.5%, 36.3%), and <italic>S. coeruleus</italic> (3.7%, 6.3%, 13.9%, 0.6%, 18.7% and 3.7%] (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, Dataset DS2 and DS3).</p>
<p>Our GO enrichment results also reveal that the percentages of SCD, polyQ and polyQ/N (but not polyN) proteins in many biological processes of the five group I ciliates are significantly higher than those in <italic>S. coeruleus</italic>. For example, the numbers (and percentages) of SCD, polyQ, polyQ/N and polyN proteins involved, respectively, in DNA repair (GO ID: 06281) are: <italic>T. thermophila</italic> [28 (61%), 18 (39%), 38 (83%) and 13 (28%)] (DS16); <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic> [27 (44%), 21 (34%), 49 (79%) and 3 (5%)] (DS17); <italic>O. trifallax</italic> [50 (61%), 35 (43%), 62 (76%) and 22 (27%)] (DS18); <italic>S. lemnae</italic> [32 (53%), 21 (35%), 44 (73%) and 19 (17%)] (DS19); <italic>P. persalinus</italic> [19 (53%), 19 (53%), 31 (86%) and 10 (28%)] (DS20); and <italic>S. coeruleus</italic> [7 (17%), 1 (2%), 10 (24%) and 2 (5%)] (DS22). The respective numbers (and percentages) of SCD, polyQ, polyQ/N and polyN proteins involved in microtubule-based movement (GO ID: 07018) are: <italic>T. thermophila</italic> [93 (85%), 69 (63%), 107 (97%) and 63 (57%)] (DS16); <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic> [155 (69%), 109 (48%), 195 (86%) and 47 (21%)] (DS17); <italic>O. trifallax</italic> [99 (78%), 85 (66%), 121 (95%) and 47 (37%)] (DS18); <italic>S. lemnae</italic> [84 (80%), 66 (63%), 100 (95%) and 50 (48%)] (DS19); <italic>P. persalinus</italic> [65 (72%), 63 (70%), 85 (94%) and 41 (46%)] (DS20); and <italic>S. coeruleus</italic> [78 (34%), 5 (2%), 84 (37%) and 13 (6%)] (DS21).</p>
<p>Compared to 20 non-ciliate species, all five group I ciliates and the sessile <italic>S. coeruleus</italic> possess proteins involved in peptidyl-glutamic acid modification (GO ID:18200), with respective numbers (and percentages) of SCD, polyQ, polyQ/N and polyN proteins being: <italic>T. thermophila</italic> [38 (78%), 31 (63%), 47 (96%) and 23(47%)] (Dataset DS16); <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic> [42 (60%), 23 (33%), 58 (83%) and 5 (7%)] (Dataset DS17); <italic>O. trifallax</italic> [81 (91%), 63 (71%), 84 (94%) and 50 (56%)] (Dataset DS18); <italic>S. lemnae</italic> [63 (86%), 54 (74%), 68 (93%) and 34 (47%)] (Dataset DS19); <italic>P. persalinus</italic> [38 (58%), 37 (57%), 55 (85%) and 28 (43%)] (Dataset DS20); and <italic>S. coeruleus</italic> [30 (23%), 0 (0%), 50 (38%) and 23 (17%)] (Dataset DS21).

</table-wrap>
<p>In <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, there are 124 annotated proteins involved in various events during meiosis, including meiosis initiation and regulation, homologous pairing, formation of DNA DSBs, formation of CO and chiasma (a structure that forms between a pair of homologous chromosomes by CO recombination and physically links the homologous chromosomes during meiosis), as well as meiotic nuclear divisions (DS31) (see review in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)). Among the 124 <italic>T. thermophila</italic> meiotic proteins, we identified 85 SCD proteins, 54 polyQ proteins, 106 polyQ/N proteins, 32 polyN proteins, 32 polyS proteins and 48 polyK proteins, respectively. Notably, there are 48 and 59 meiotic proteins that contain ≥4 SCDs and/or ≥4 polyQ/N tracts, respectively. For instance, DPL2, CYC2, CYC17 and ATR1 each contains 15, 6, 8 and 5 SCDs, 2, 0, 1 and 2 polyQ tracts, as well as 11, 4, 4 and 5 polyQ/N tracts, respectively. Pars11, a chromatin-associated protein required for inducing and limiting Spo11-induced DSBs, has 14 SCDs, 2 polyQ tracts and 6 polyQ/N tracts. Spo11-induced DSBs promote ATR1-dependent Pars11 phosphorylation and its removal from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Many <italic>T. thermophila</italic> meiotic DSB repair proteins also harbor several SCDs, polyQ tracts and/or polyQ/N tracts, including MSH4, MSH5, SGS1, FANCM, REC8, and ZPH3, among others. Several <italic>T. thermophila</italic> proteins involved in editing and rearrangement of the MIC genome also harbor multiple Q-rich motifs. PDD1 (programmed DNA degradation 1), a conjugation-specific HP1-like protein, has 13 SCDs, 3 polyQ tracts and 6 polyQ/N tracts. Mutations in the chromodomain or the chromoshadow domain of PDD1 were found previously to elicit PDD1 mislocalization, prevented histone H3 dimethylation on K9, abolished removal of internal eliminated sequences (IES), and/or resulted in the production of inviable progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>). DCL1 (Dicer-like 1) has 5 SCDs, 1 polyQ tract and 8 polyQ/N tracts. DCL1 is required for processing the MIC transcripts to siRNA-like scan (scn) RNAs, as well as for methylation of histone H3 at Lys 9. This latter modification occurs specifically on sequences (IESs) to be eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>). GIW1 (gentlemen-in-waiting 1) physically directs a mature Argonaute-siRNA complex to the MIC nucleus, thus promoting programmed IES elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). GIW1 has 9 SCDs and 2 polyQ/N tracts (Dataset DS31). Using IUPred2A (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://iupred2a.elte.hu/plot_new">https://iupred2a.elte.hu/plot_new</ext-link>), we found that the Q-rich motifs in all these meiotic proteins are intrinsically disordered. Accordingly, it is of interest to speculate that, like the C-terminal IDR of mammalian CTTNBP2, the Q-rich motifs in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> meiotic proteins might form tunable proteinaceous condensates to regulate assembly and disassembly of the “crescents” in ciliate MICs.</p>
<p>Finally, we performed comparative GO analyses for the SCD and polyX proteins encoded by the transcriptomes of 11 different ciliate species. These transcripts were originally generated as part of the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>), which were then reassembled and reannotated by Brown and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>). All transcripts are publicly available at Zendo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zenodo.org/record/1212585#.Y79zoi2l3PA">https://zenodo.org/record/1212585#.Y79zoi2l3PA</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>). We applied TransDecoder (Find Coding Regions Within Transcripts; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/wiki">https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/wiki</ext-link>) to identify candidate coding regions within the transcript sequences. Five of those eleven ciliates have reassigned UAA<sup>Q</sup> and UAG<sup>Q</sup> codons (hereafter termed “group II ciliates”), i.e., <italic>Aristerostoma</italic> spp<italic>., Favella ehrenbergii, Pseudokeronopsis</italic> spp., <italic>Strombidium inclinatum,</italic> and <italic>Uronema</italic> spp.. Like sessile <italic>S. coeruleus,</italic> group III ciliates (<italic>Climacostomum virens</italic>, <italic>Litonotus pictus</italic> and <italic>Protocruzia adherens</italic>) possess the standard genetic codes. Group IV ciliates encompass <italic>Favella ehrenbergii</italic>, <italic>Blepharisma japonicum</italic> and <italic>Euplotes focardii</italic>, each of which utilizes the reassigned codons UAA<sup>Y</sup>, UAG<sup>Y</sup>, UGA<sup>W</sup> and UGA<sup>C</sup>, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The proteins encoded by these MMESTP transcripts are unlikely to represent the entire protein complement of all 11 ciliate species because 1) many MMETSP transcripts are not intact (i.e., broken mRNAs) and thus encode incomplete protein sequences, and 2) except for <italic>C. virens</italic> (94.7%), the BUSCO protein scores of these MMESTP transcripts only range from 52.6% to 89.9% (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Nevertheless, our results indicate that Q is used more frequently in group I and group II ciliates than in group III and group IV ciliates or in a further 20 non-ciliate species (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and DS1). Accordingly, proportions of SCD, polyQ and polyQ/N proteins in all group I and group II ciliates are higher than they are in the three group III ciliates (except <italic>L. pictus</italic>) and the three group IV ciliates, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Since N is used more frequently in <italic>L. pictus</italic> than in group II ciliates, as well as in the other group III and group IV ciliates, it has higher percentages of polyN and polyQ/N proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>-<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> and Dataset DS1).</p>
<p>Our data also indicates that Y, W or C are not used more frequently in the three group IV ciliates than in the other 14 ciliate or 20 non-ciliate species (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and Dataset DS1). Reassignments of stop codons to Y, W or C also do not result in higher percentages of polyY, polyW or polyC proteins in the three group IV ciliates, respectively (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We present two unexpected results in this report. First, the Q-rich motifs of several yeast proteins (Rad51-NTD, Rad53-SCD1, Hop1-SCD, Sml1-NTD, Sup35-PND, Ure2-UPD and New1-NPD) all exhibit autonomous PEE activities. These structurally flexible Q-rich motifs have useful potential for applications in both basic research (e.g., synthetic biology) and biotechnology. It is of interest to investigate further how these Q-rich motifs exert this PEE function in yeast and whether Q-rich motifs in other eukaryotes also possess similar PEE activities. Second, reassignment of stop codons to Q in the group I and group II ciliates significantly increase proteome-wide Q usage, leading to massive expansion of structurally flexible or even intrinsically disordered Q-rich motifs. In contrast, reassignments of stop codons to Y, W or C do not result in higher usages of these three amino acid residues nor higher percentages of W-, Y- or C-rich proteins in the three group IV ciliates, respectively. These results are consistent with the notion that, unlike for Q, the Y, W and C residues are not common in IDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to their structural flexibility, Q-rich motifs can endow proteins with structural and functional plasticity. Based on our findings from this study, we suggest that Q-rich motifs are useful toolkits for generating novel diversity during protein evolution, including by enabling greater protein expression, protein-protein interactions, posttranslational modifications, increased solubility, and tunable stability, among other important traits. This speculation may explain three intriguing phenomena. First, due to higher Q usage, many proteins involved in evolutionarily conserved biological processes in group I and group II ciliates display more diverse amino acid sequences than the respective proteins in other ciliate or non-ciliate species. Accordingly, it is sometimes difficult to identify authentic protein homologs among different ciliates, particularly for group I and group II ciliates. We highlight the example of the 58 proteins involved in xylan catabolysis in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> (Dataset DS16). Second, our GO enrichment results reveal that Q-rich motifs or a few other structurally flexible polyX tracts prevail in proteins involved in specialized biological processes, including <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RNA-mediated transposition, <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentous growth, ciliate peptidyl-glutamic acid modification, <italic>T. thermophila</italic> meiosis and xylan catabolism, <italic>D. discoideum</italic> sorocarp (fruiting body) development and sexual reproduction, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood cell infection and antigen variation, and development of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> nervous system. In theory, structurally flexible Q-rich motifs might form various membraneless organelles or proteinaceous condensates via intracellular liquid-liquid phase separation in tunable manners, including protein posttranslational modification, protein-protein interaction, protein-ligand binding, <italic>et al</italic>., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). A typical example is that the C-termini of mouse CTTNBP2 facilitates co-condensation of CTTNBP2 with SHANK3 at the postsynaptic density in a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>). Third, the Borg genomes of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea are huge, linear extrachromosomal elements. A striking feature of Borgs is pervasive tandem direct repeat (TR) regions. While we were preparing this manuscript, it was reported that TRs in ORFs are under very strong selective pressure, leading to perfect amino acid TRs (aaTRs) that are commonly IDRs. aaTRs particularly often contain disorder-promoting amino acids, including Q, N, P, T, E, K, V, D and S, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>). Accordingly, distinct evolutionary strategies have evolved in different species to evolve protein regions that are structurally flexible or even intrinsically disordered. Further investigations are needed to determine if liquid-liquid phase separation prevails in ciliates with reassigned TAA<sup>Q</sup> and TAG<sup>Q</sup> codons and/or in the specialized biological processes in various species we have described herein.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>One of the most interesting questions in genome diversity is why many ciliates reassign their nuclear stop codons into amino acids, e.g., glutamine (Q), tyrosine (Y), tryptophan (W) or cysteine (C). However, the impacts of such genome-wide alternations are not well understood. We show that glutamine (Q) is used more frequently in all 10 ciliate species possessing reassigned TAA<sup>Q</sup> and TAG<sup>Q</sup> codons than in other ciliates and non-ciliate species. The consequence of this preponderance of Q is massive expansion of proteins harboring three structurally flexible or even intrinsically disordered Q-rich motifs. Since Q-rich motifs can endow proteins with structural and functional plasticity, we also show that Q-rich motifs prevail in proteins involved in several species-specific or even phylum-specific biological processes. Our results indicate that Q-rich motifs are useful toolkits for evolutionary novelty.</p>

<p>All plasmids, yeast strains and PCR primers used in this study are listed in the <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>-<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, respectively. Guinea pig antisera against Rad51, and rabbit antisera against phosphorylated Rad51-S<sup>12</sup>Q, phosphorylated Rad51-S<sup>30</sup>Q, and phosphorylated Hop1-T<sup>318</sup>Q were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). The mouse anti-V5 antibody was purchased from BioRad (CA, USA). The rabbit anti-Hsp104 antiserum was kindly provided by Chung Wang (Academia Sinica, Taiwan). Rabbit antisera against phosphorylated Sup35-S<sup>17</sup>Q were raised using the synthetic phosphopeptide N<sup>12</sup>YQQYS<sup>(P)</sup>QNGNQQQGNNR<sup>28</sup> as an antigen, where S<sup>(P)</sup> is phosphorylated serine. Phosphopeptide synthesis and animal immunization were conducted by LTK BioLaboratories, Taiwan. Western blotting analyses were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Quantitative β-galactosidase activity assays were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>). The ASFinder-SCD and ASFinder-polyX software are publicly available at Github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tfwangasimb/AS-SCD-finder">https://github.com/tfwangasimb/AS-SCD-finder</ext-link>). The sources of proteome and transcript datasets are described in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The proteome-wide amino acid contents, the numbers of protein with different types of Q-rich motifs and polyN, as well as the SCD and polyX proteins in all 37 different eukaryotes are listed in Datasets DS1-DS3, respectively. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were performed using publicly available data in the GO Resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneontology.org">http://geneontology.org</ext-link>). The GO identities (ID) of different biological processes and the names of all SCD and polyX proteins in the 24 near-completed eukaryotic proteomes are listed in Dataset DS4-DS29, respectively.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
This work contains 3 sections. The first section describes how protein domains with SQ motifs can increase the abundance of a lacZ reporter in yeast. The authors call this phenomenon autonomous protein expression-enhancing activity, and this finding is well supported. The authors show evidence that this increase in protein abundance and enzymatic activity is not due to changes in plasmid copy number or mRNA abundance, and that this phenomenon is not affected by mutants in translational quality control. It was not completely clear whether the increased protein abundance is due to increased translation or to increased protein stability.</p>
<p>In section 2, the authors performed mutagenesis of three N-terminal domains to study how protein sequence changes protein stability and enzymatic activity of the fusions. These data are very interesting, but this section needs more interpretation. It is not clear if the effect is due to the number of S/T/Q/N amino acids or due to the number of phosphorylation sites.</p>
<p>In section 3, the authors undertake an extensive computational analysis of amino acid runs in 27 species. Many aspects of this section are fascinating to an expert reader. They identify regions with poly-X tracks. These data were not normalized correctly: I think that a null expectation for how often poly-X track occur should be built for each species based on the underlying prevalence of amino acids in that species. As a result, I believe that the claim is not well supported by the data.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
This work is about an interesting topic and contains stimulating bioinformatics analysis. The first two sections, where the authors investigate how S/T/Q/N abundance modulates protein expression level, is well supported by the data. The bioinformatics analysis of Q abundance in ciliate proteomes is fascinating. There are some ciliates that have repurposed stop codons to code for Q. The authors find that in these proteomes, Q-runs are greatly expanded. They offer interesting speculations on how this expansion might impact protein function.</p>
<p>Weakness</p>
<p>
At this time, the manuscript is disorganized and difficult to read. An expert in the field, who will not be distracted by the disorganization, will find some very interesting results included. In particular, the order of the introduction does not match the rest of the paper.</p>
<p>In the first and second sections, where the authors investigate how S/T/Q/N abundance modulates protein expression levels, it is unclear if the effect is due to the number of phosphorylation sites or the number of S/T/Q/N residues. The authors also do not discuss if the N-end rule for protein stability applies to the lacZ reporter or the fusion proteins.</p>
<p>The most interesting part of the paper is an exploration of S/T/Q/N-rich regions and other repetitive AA runs in 27 proteomes, particularly ciliates. However, this analysis is missing a critical control that makes it nearly impossible to evaluate the importance of the findings. The authors find the abundance of different amino acid runs in various proteomes. They also report the background abundance of each amino acid. They do not use this background abundance to normalize the runs of amino acids to create a null expectation from each proteome. For example, it has been clear for some time (Ruff, 2017; Ruff et al., 2016) that Drosophila contains a very high background of Q's in the proteome and it is necessary to control for this background abundance when finding runs of Q's. The authors could easily address this problem with the data and analysis they have already collected. However, at this time, without this normalization, I am hesitant to trust the lists of proteins with long runs of amino acid and the ensuing GO enrichment analysis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This study seeks to understand the connection between protein sequence and function in disordered regions enriched in polar amino acids (specifically Q, N, S and T). While the authors suggest that specific motifs facilitate protein-enhancing activities, their findings are correlative, and the evidence is incomplete. Similarly, the authors propose that the re-assignment of stop codons to glutamine-encoding codons underlies the greater user of glutamine in a subset of ciliates, but again, the conclusions here are, at best, correlative. The authors perform extensive bioinformatic analysis, with detailed (albeit somewhat ad hoc) discussion on a number of proteins. Overall, the results presented here are interesting, but are unable to exclude competing hypotheses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Following up on previous work, the authors wish to uncover a mechanism associated with poly-Q and SCD motifs explaining proposed protein expression-enhancing activities. They note that these motifs often occur IDRs and hypothesize that structural plasticity could be capitalized upon as a mechanism of diversification in evolution. To investigate this further, they employ bioinformatics to investigate the sequence features of proteomes of 27 eukaryotes. They deepen their sequence space exploration uncovering sub-phylum-specific features associated with species in which a stop-codon substitution has occurred. The authors propose this stop-codon substitution underlies an expansion of ploy-Q repeats and increased glutamine distribution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The preprint provides extensive, detailed, and entirely unnecessary background information throughout, hampering reading and making it difficult to understand the ideas being proposed.</p>
<p>
The introduction provides a large amount of detailed background that appears entirely irrelevant for the paper. Many places detailed discussions on specific proteins that are likely of interest to the authors occur, yet without context, this does not enhance the paper for the reader.</p>
<p>The paper uses many unnecessary, new, or redefined acronyms which makes reading difficult. As examples: (1) Prion forming domains (PFDs). Do the authors mean prion-like domains (PLDs), an established term with an empirical definition from the PLAAC algorithm? If yes, they should say this. If not, they must define what a prion-forming domain is formally. (2) SCD is already an acronym in the IDP field (meaning sequence charge decoration) - the authors should avoid this as their chosen acronym for Serine(S) / threonine (T)-glutamine (Q) cluster domains. Moreover, do we really need another acronym here (we do not). (3) Protein expression-enhancing (PEE) - just say expression-enhancing, there is no need for an acronym here.</p>
<p>The results suggest autonomous protein expression-enhancing activities of regions of multiple proteins containing Q-rich and SCD motifs. Their definition of expression-enhancing activities is vague and the evidence they provide to support the claim is weak. While their previous work may support their claim with more evidence, it should be explained in more detail. The assay they choose is a fusion reporter measuring beta-galactosidase activity and tracking expression levels. Given the presented data they have shown that they can drive the expression of their reporters and that beta gal remains active, in addition to the increase in expression of fusion reporter during the stress response. They have not detailed what their control and mock treatment is, which makes complete understanding of their experimental approach difficult. Furthermore, their nuclear localization signal on the tag could be influencing the degradation kinetics or sequestering the reporter, leading to its accumulation and the appearance of enhanced expression. Their evidence refuting ubiquitin-mediated degradation does not have a convincing control.</p>
<p>Based on the experimental results, the authors then go on to perform bioinformatic analysis of SCD proteins and polyX proteins. Unfortunately, there is no clear hypothesis for what is being tested; there is a vague sense of investigating polyX/SCD regions, but I did not find the connection between the first and section compelling (especially given polar-rich regions have been shown to engage in many different functions). As such, this bioinformatic analysis largely presents as many lists of percentages without any meaningful interpretation. The bioinformatics analysis lacks any kind of rigorous statistical tests, making it difficult to evaluate the conclusions drawn.</p>
<p>The methods section is severely lacking. Specifically, many of the methods require the reader to read many other papers. While referencing prior work is of course, important, the authors should ensure the methods in this paper provide the details needed to allow a reader to evaluate the work being presented. As it stands, this is not the case.</p>
<p>Overall, my major concern with this work is that the authors make two central claims in this paper (as per the Discussion).</p>
<p>The authors claim that Q-rich motifs enhance protein expression. The implication here is that Q-rich motif IDRs are special, but this is not tested. As such, they cannot exclude the competing hypothesis (&quot;N-terminal disordered regions enhance expression&quot;). The authors also do not explore the possibility that this effect is in part/entirely driven by mRNA-level effects (see Verma Na Comms 2019). As such, while these observations are interesting, they feel preliminary and, in my opinion, cannot be used to draw hard conclusions on how N-terminal IDR sequence features influence protein expression. This does not mean the authors are necessarily wrong, but from the data presented here, I do not believe strong conclusions can be drawn.</p>
<p>That re-assignment of stop codons to Q increases proteome-wide Q usage. I was unable to understand what result led the authors to this conclusion. My reading of the results is that a subset of ciliates has re-assigned UAA and UAG from the stop codon to Q. Those ciliates have more polyQ-containing proteins. However, they also have more polyN-containing proteins and proteins enriched in S/T-Q clusters. Surely if this were a stop-codon-dependent effect, we'd ONLY see an enhancement in Q-richness, not a corresponding enhancement in all polar-rich IDR frequencies? It seems the better working hypothesis is that free-floating climate proteomes are enriched in polar amino acids compared to sessile ciliates. Regardless, the absence of any kind of statistical analysis makes it hard to draw strong conclusions here.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This study presents potentially valuable results on glutamine-rich motifs in relation to protein expression and alternative genetic codes. The author's interpretation of the results is so far only supported by incomplete evidence, due to a lack of acknowledgment of alternative explanations, missing controls and statistical analysis and writing unclear to non experts in the field. These shortcomings could be at least partially overcome by additional experiments, thorough rewriting, or both.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank both the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor for handling this manuscript and will submit our revised manuscript after the reviewed preprint is published by eLife.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>This work contains 3 sections. The first section describes how protein domains with SQ motifs can increase the abundance of a lacZ reporter in yeast. The authors call this phenomenon autonomous protein expression-enhancing activity, and this finding is well supported. The authors show evidence that this increase in protein abundance and enzymatic activity is not due to changes in plasmid copy number or mRNA abundance, and that this phenomenon is not affected by mutants in translational quality control. It was not completely clear whether the increased protein abundance is due to increased translation or to increased protein stability.</p>
<p>In section 2, the authors performed mutagenesis of three N-terminal domains to study how protein sequence changes protein stability and enzymatic activity of the fusions. These data are very interesting, but this section needs more interpretation. It is not clear if the effect is due to the number of S/T/Q/N amino acids or due to the number of phosphorylation sites.</p>
<p>In section 3, the authors undertake an extensive computational analysis of amino acid runs in 27 species. Many aspects of this section are fascinating to an expert reader. They identify regions with poly-X tracks. These data were not normalized correctly: I think that a null expectation for how often poly-X track occur should be built for each species based on the underlying prevalence of amino acids in that species. As a result, I believe that the claim is not well supported by the data.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>This work is about an interesting topic and contains stimulating bioinformatics analysis. The first two sections, where the authors investigate how S/T/Q/N abundance modulates protein expression level, is well supported by the data. The bioinformatics analysis of Q abundance in ciliate proteomes is fascinating. There are some ciliates that have repurposed stop codons to code for Q. The authors find that in these proteomes, Q-runs are greatly expanded. They offer interesting speculations on how this expansion might impact protein function.</p>
<p>Weakness</p>
<p>At this time, the manuscript is disorganized and difficult to read. An expert in the field, who will not be distracted by the disorganization, will find some very interesting results included. In particular, the order of the introduction does not match the rest of the paper.</p>
<p>In the first and second sections, where the authors investigate how S/T/Q/N abundance modulates protein expression levels, it is unclear if the effect is due to the number of phosphorylation sites or the number of S/T/Q/N residues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are three reasons why the number of phosphorylation sites in the Q-rich motifs is not relevant to their autonomous protein expression-enhancing (PEE) activities:</p>
<p>First, we have reported previously that phosphorylation-defective Rad51-NTD (Rad51-3SA) and wild-type Rad51-NTD exhibit similar autonomous PEE activity. Mec1/Tel1-dependent phosphorylation of Rad51-NTD antagonizes the proteasomal degradation pathway, increasing the half-life of Rad51 from ∼30 min to ≥180 min (Ref 27; Woo, T. T. et al. 2020).</p>

<p>Second, in our preprint manuscript, we have also shown that phosphorylation-defective Rad53-SCD1 (Rad51-SCD1-5STA) also exhibits autonomous PEE activity similar to that of wild-type Rad53-SCD (Figure 2D, Figure 4A and Figure 4C).</p>
<p>Third, as revealed by the results of our preprint manuscript (Figure 4), it is the percentages, and not the numbers, of S/T/Q/N residues that are correlated with the PEE activities of Q-rich motifs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors also do not discuss if the N-end rule for protein stability applies to the lacZ reporter or the fusion proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The autonomous PEE function of S/T/Q-rich NTDs is unlikely to be relevant to the N-end rule. The N-end rule links the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residues. In S. cerevisiae, the N-end rule operates as part of the ubiquitin system and comprises two pathways. First, the Arg/N-end rule pathway, involving a single N-terminal amidohydrolase Nta1, mediates deamidation of N-terminal asparagine (N) and glutamine (Q) into aspartate (D) and glutamate (E), which in turn are arginylated by a single Ate1 R-transferase, generating the Arg/N degron. N-terminal R and other primary degrons are recognized by a single N-recognin Ubr1 in concert with ubiquitin-conjugating Ubc2/Rad6. Ubr1 can also recognize several other N-terminal residues, including lysine (K), histidine (H), phenylalanine (F), tryptophan (W), leucine (L) and isoleucine (I) (Bachmair, A. et al. 1986; Tasaki, T. et al. 2012; Varshavshy, A. et al. 2019). Second, the Ac/N-end rule pathway targets proteins containing N-terminally acetylated (Ac) residues. Prior to acetylation, the first amino acid methionine (M) is catalytically removed by Met-aminopeptides, unless a residue at position 2 is non-permissive (too large) for MetAPs. If a retained N-terminal M or otherwise a valine (V), cysteine (C), alanine (A), serine (S) or threonine (T) residue is followed by residues that allow N-terminal acetylation, the proteins containing these AcN degrons are targeted for ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation by the Doa10 E3 ligase (Hwang, C. S., 2019).</p>

<p>The PEE activities of these S/T/Q-rich domains are unlikely to arise from counteracting the N-end rule for two reasons. First, the first two amino acid residues of Rad51-NTD, Hop1-SCD, Rad53-SCD1, Sup35-PND, Rad51-ΔN, and LacZ-NVH are MS, ME, ME, MS, ME, and MI, respectively, where M is methionine, S is serine, E is glutamic acid and I is isoleucine. Second, Sml1-NTD behaves similarly to these N-terminal fusion tags, despite its methionine and glutamine (MQ) amino acid signature at the N-terminus.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The most interesting part of the paper is an exploration of S/T/Q/N-rich regions and other repetitive AA runs in 27 proteomes, particularly ciliates. However, this analysis is missing a critical control that makes it nearly impossible to evaluate the importance of the findings. The authors find the abundance of different amino acid runs in various proteomes. They also report the background abundance of each amino acid. They do not use this background abundance to normalize the runs of amino acids to create a null expectation from each proteome. For example, it has been clear for some time (Ruff, 2017; Ruff et al., 2016) that Drosophila contains a very high background of Q's in the proteome and it is necessary to control for this background abundance when finding runs of Q's.</p>

<p>We thank Reviewer #1 for this helpful suggestion and now address this issue by means of a different approach described below.</p>
<p>Based on a previous study (43; Palo Mier et al. 2020), we applied seven different thresholds to seek both short and long, as well as pure and impure, polyX strings in 20 different representative near-complete proteomes, including 4X (4/4), 5X (4/5-5/5), 6X (4/6-6/6), 7X (4/7-7/7), 8-10X (≥50%X), 11-10X (≥50%X) and ≥21X (≥50%X).</p>
<p>To normalize the runs of amino acids and create a null expectation from each proteome, we determined the ratios of the overall number of X residues for each of the seven polyX motifs relative to those in the entire proteome of each species, respectively. The results of four different polyX motifs are shown below, i.e., polyQ (Author response image 1), polyN (Author response image 2), polyS (Author response image 3) and polyT (Author response image 4).</p>

<p>The results summarized in these four new figures support that polyX prevalence differs among species and that the overall X contents of polyX motifs often but not always correlate with the X usage frequency in entire proteomes (43; Palo Mier et al. 2020).</p>
<p>Most importantly, our results reveal that, compared to Stentor coeruleus or several non-ciliate eukaryotic organisms (e.g., Plasmodium falciparum, Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens), the five ciliates with reassigned TAAQ and TAGQ codons not only have higher Q usage frequencies, but also more polyQ motifs in their proteomes (Figure 1). In contrast, polyQ motifs prevail in Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Dictyostelium discoideum, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti, though the Q usage frequencies in their entire proteomes are not significantly higher than those of other eukaryotes (Figure 1). Due to their higher N usage frequencies, Dictyostelium discoideum, Plasmodium falciparum and Pseudocohnilembus persalinus have more polyN motifs than the other 23 eukaryotes we examined here (Figure 2). Generally speaking, all 26 eukaryotes we assessed have similar S usage frequencies and percentages of S contents in polyS motifs (Figure 3). Among these 26 eukaryotes, Dictyostelium discoideum possesses many more polyT motifs, though its T usage frequency is similar to that of the other 25 eukaryotes (Figure 4).</p>
<p>In conclusion, these new normalized results confirm that the reassignment of stop codons to Q indeed results in both higher Q usage frequencies and more polyQ motifs in ciliates.</p>

<p>The N-terminal domain (1-123 amino acids) of S. cerevisiae Sup35 was already referred to as a “prion forming domain (PFD)” in 2006 (Tuite, M. F. 2006). Since then, PFD has also been employed as an acronym in other yeast prion papers (Cox, B.S. et al. 2007; Toombs, T. et al. 2011).</p>

<p>(3) Protein expression-enhancing (PEE) - just say expression-enhancing, there is no need for an acronym here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. Since we have shown that addition of Q-rich motifs to LacZ affects protein expression rather than transcription, we think it is better to use the “PEE” acronym.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The results suggest autonomous protein expression-enhancing activities of regions of multiple proteins containing Q-rich and SCD motifs. Their definition of expression-enhancing activities is vague and the evidence they provide to support the claim is weak. While their previous work may support their claim with more evidence, it should be explained in more detail. The assay they choose is a fusion reporter measuring beta-galactosidase activity and tracking expression levels. Given the presented data they have shown that they can drive the expression of their reporters and that beta gal remains active, in addition to the increase in expression of fusion reporter during the stress response. They have not detailed what their control and mock treatment is, which makes complete understanding of their experimental approach difficult. Furthermore, their nuclear localization signal on the tag could be influencing the degradation kinetics or sequestering the reporter, leading to its accumulation and the appearance of enhanced expression. Their evidence refuting ubiquitin-mediated degradation does not have a convincing control.</p>
<p>Based on the experimental results, the authors then go on to perform bioinformatic analysis of SCD proteins and polyX proteins. Unfortunately, there is no clear hypothesis for what is being tested; there is a vague sense of investigating polyX/SCD regions, but I did not find the connection between the first and section compelling (especially given polar-rich regions have been shown to engage in many different functions). As such, this bioinformatic analysis largely presents as many lists of percentages without any meaningful interpretation. The bioinformatics analysis lacks any kind of rigorous statistical tests, making it difficult to evaluate the conclusions drawn. The methods section is severely lacking. Specifically, many of the methods require the reader to read many other papers. While referencing prior work is of course, important, the authors should ensure the methods in this paper provide the details needed to allow a reader to evaluate the work being presented. As it stands, this is not the case.</p>

<p>Thank you. As described in detail below, we have now performed rigorous statistical testing using the GofuncR package.</p>

<p>Overall, my major concern with this work is that the authors make two central claims in this paper (as per the Discussion). The authors claim that Q-rich motifs enhance protein expression. The implication here is that Q-rich motif IDRs are special, but this is not tested. As such, they cannot exclude the competing hypothesis (&quot;N-terminal disordered regions enhance expression&quot;).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In fact, “N-terminal disordered regions enhance expression” exactly summarizes our hypothesis.</p>
<p>On pages 12-13 and Figure 4 of our preprint manuscript, we explained our hypothesis in the paragraph entitled “The relationship between PEE function, amino acid contents, and structural flexibility”.</p>

<p>The authors also do not explore the possibility that this effect is in part/entirely driven by mRNA-level effects (see Verma Na Comms 2019).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As pointed out by the first reviewer, we show evidence that the increase in protein abundance and enzymatic activity is not due to changes in plasmid copy number or mRNA abundance (Figure 2), and that this phenomenon is not affected by translational quality control mutants (Figure 3).</p>

<p>As such, while these observations are interesting, they feel preliminary and, in my opinion, cannot be used to draw hard conclusions on how N-terminal IDR sequence features influence protein expression. This does not mean the authors are necessarily wrong, but from the data presented here, I do not believe strong conclusions can be drawn. That re-assignment of stop codons to Q increases proteome-wide Q usage. I was unable to understand what result led the authors to this conclusion.</p>
<p>My reading of the results is that a subset of ciliates has re-assigned UAA and UAG from the stop codon to Q. Those ciliates have more polyQ-containing proteins. However, they also have more polyN-containing proteins and proteins enriched in S/T-Q clusters. Surely if this were a stop-codon-dependent effect, we'd ONLY see an enhancement in Q-richness, not a corresponding enhancement in all polar-rich IDR frequencies? It seems the better working hypothesis is that free-floating climate proteomes are enriched in polar amino acids compared to sessile ciliates.</p>

<p>Thank you.  These comments are not supported by the results in Figure 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Regardless, the absence of any kind of statistical analysis makes it hard to draw strong conclusions here.</p>

<p>We apologize for not explaining more clearly the results of Tables 5-7 in our preprint manuscript.</p>
<p>To address the concerns about our GO enrichment analysis by both reviewers, we have now performed rigorous statistical testing for SCD and polyQ protein overrepresentation using the GOfuncR package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GOfuncR.html">https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GOfuncR.html</ext-link>). GOfuncR is an R package program that conducts standard candidate vs. background enrichment analysis by means of the hypergeometric test. We then adjusted the raw p-values according to the Family-wise error rate (FWER). The same method had been applied to GO enrichment analysis of human genomes (Huttenhower, C., et al. 2009).</p>

<p>The results presented in Author response image 5 and Author response image 6 support our hypothesis that Q-rich motifs prevail in proteins involved in specialized biological processes, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA-mediated transposition, Candida albicans filamentous growth, peptidyl-glutamic acid modification in ciliates with reassigned stop codons (TAAQ and TAGQ), Tetrahymena thermophila xylan catabolism, Dictyostelium discoideum sexual reproduction, Plasmodium falciparum infection, as well as the nervous systems of Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens (74). In contrast, peptidyl-glutamic acid modification and microtubule-based movement are not overrepresented with Q-rich proteins in Stentor coeruleus, a ciliate with standard stop codons.</p>
